Rinse your pieces of silver with warm water.,
Mix warm water with a mild detergent.,
Scrub your silver in a straight, back and forth motion.,
Rinse each piece of silver with warm water.,
Dry the finished pieces with a soft, cotton cloth.",How to Clean Sterling Silver1," While rinsing your silver, use your hands to feel and remove dirt and debris. Rinsing your pieces of silver will remove any debris that may scratch it during the cleaning process. Place the pieces on a soft, cotton dish towel., Use a mild phosphate-free and ammonia-free dishwashing detergent like Dawn Dishwashing Liquid (make sure it is citrus-free as well). Mix 1/4 tablespoon (3.7 ml) of soap with 1 cup (8.12 oz) of water. Mix until well-combined., Scrubbing in a back and forth motion will help you maintain a uniform appearance. Avoid scrubbing in a circular motion. Use a cellulose sponge or a cotton ball/pad dipped in the soapy water to scrub your silver.If your silver contains small crevices, use a toothbrush or a Q-tip to clean these.
You can purchase a cellulose sponge from your local hardware store.

, Do not use hot or cold water. Then dry the piece immediately after rinsing it to avoid water stains on your silver., Alternatively, you can use a Selvyt cloth to dry your pieces of silver. Then use a microfiber cloth to polish the finished piece.When handling and cleaning your pieces of silver, you may use nitrile gloves (not latex) to prevent fingerprinting and smudging.This cleaning method works best for pieces of jewelry that contain pearls and opaque or clear gemstones.

Hand wash the silver.,
Plug your sink.,
Cover the bottom of your sink with aluminum foil.,
Place your silver on the aluminum.,
Boil water.,
Add baking soda to the boiling water.,
Dump the water into the sink.,
Watch the chemical reaction.,
Allow the water to cool.,
Inspect the silver.,

Repeat the process.,
Rinse the silver.,
Dry the silver.,
Discard the foil.",How to Clean Silver with Baking Soda," Before trying to clean your silver with baking soda, make sure that you do a light cleaning of your silver to remove any residual food or other debris. This way, you’ll make sure that your silver is cleaned as best as possible.









Use a non-abrasive mild soap. Make sure the soap is safe to use on silver.
Wipe down the silver with a microfiber rag or a soft dish cloth.
Do not put your silver in the dishwasher.
Avoid using steel wool or anything else abrasive. Silver scratches easily.;
, Before you start, you need to clean and then plug your sink or basin. This is important, as you don’t want any dirt, debris, or contaminants dirtying your silver and undermining the process of cleaning.









Use a light detergent, or even baking soda, to scrub down your sink.
Place the drain cover securely on the drain so no water can drain out.

, The foil should cover large parts of the bottom of the sink or basin. The more surface and contact area the aluminum foil has, the better. Try to keep the shiny side up and don't feel compelled to make sure the foil is completely flat.









When placing your aluminum foil, make sure to use a generous amount.
Feel free to reuse old foil.
The foil does not need to cover the entire bottom., When placing your silver, make sure that each piece makes physical contact with a piece of aluminum.









Place your silver in the basin gently.
Avoid overloading the basin. You want to make sure each piece of silver is cleaned. If you need to take some out, feel free to do so., Boil enough water to fill your basin. This is important, as you’ll have to have enough water to completely cover any silver that you’re trying to clean.









For a small basin or sink, you may need between 4 and 8 cups (.95 and 1.9 liters).
Prepare more boiling water than you think you’ll need. This way, you’ll have it ready and available if you need more., After you’ve boiled your water, you’ll need to pour baking soda into it. This is important, as the baking soda is critical to the chemical reaction that will clean your silver.









Use a quarter cup of baking soda for every 4 cups of water (.95 liters)., Once you’ve created your mixture of baking soda and hot water, dump it into the sink. Make sure to do it slowly as to not splash any hot water onto yourself or the surrounding area.









Pour a little bit at a time.
Stop pouring when the last piece of silver is completely submerged., After you’ve poured the water and baking soda in, you’ll notice a foaming effect in the sink. The foaming effect may start slowly and begin to accelerate. It should continue for up to several minutes.









You should notice yellow flakes sticking to the aluminum foil. This is aluminum sulfide.
It may take up to several minutes to clean lightly tarnished objects., After you’ve observed the chemical reaction, you should allow the water to sit and cool for a few minutes. This is important, as you may burn yourself if you try to remove the silver when the water is still too hot.


Wait until the water is no longer steaming.
Consider using tongs to remove and inspect the silver after the chemical process has completed.
If you’re worried the water is still too hot, use a thermometer to test the temperature., Take a good look at the silver and verify that the cleaning process has worked. Make sure to examine the top, bottom, and sides of the items you've cleaned. This way, you'll be able to see if they're as clean as you want them to be.









Tarnish marks should be removed or lightened substantially.
The silver should be extremely shiny.

, There are several ingredients you can add to your hot water to enhance its cleaning properties. If your first attempt to clean with baking soda and hot water did not work, you may benefit from adding salt and/or white vinegar to the mixture.


Add a quarter cup (.06 liters) of salt for every four cups (.95 liter) of water -- the amount of salt and baking soda should be equal.
If you choose to add vinegar, use a half cup (.12 liters) of white vinegar for every cup of water., While lightly tarnished silver may take several minutes to clean, silver that is heavily tarnished can take much longer. Thus, you may need to repeat the process several times to clean your silver. To repeat:









Drain the sink or basin.
Rinse the silver.
Remove the aluminum foil and add new foil.
Lay the silver back into the basin.
Dump more boiling water and baking soda., After the silver is clean, drain the basin and rinse it with cool water. Make sure to rinse thoroughly so you remove baking soda, salt, and vinegar residue.









You may need to drain the basin and rinse a couple times to completely remove all residue., Once it is rinsed, take each piece of silver and carefully dry it with a clean, soft, cloth. After hand drying each piece, lay them on another soft cloth so they can fully dry.









You may want to consider using a microfiber cloth to reduce scratching., After drying your silver, you need to throw away the aluminum foil. This is important, as the foil will now be stained and cannot be used to clean silver in the future.









You’ll notice that the foil will be heavily tarnished. This is the result of the chemical reaction that helped transfer sulfide from the silver to the aluminum."

Wipe out the pan with a paper towel.,
Rinse the pan with warm water.,
Scrub the pan with a non-abrasive brush or sponge.,
Dry the pan completely.",How to Clean Seasoned Cast Iron1," Go over the surface of the pan lightly to remove as much grease and loose debris as you can. The slick surface of seasoned cast iron should release most messes without leaving behind a sticky residue.Be sure to wait for the pan to cool down before attempting to clean it.
Giving your cookware a preliminary wipedown will help work some of the leftover food grease into the pores in the iron, improving its level of seasoning.;
, Hold the pan under the faucet, letting the water run over the entire cooking surface. Rub stuck-on messes with the corner of a sponge or the pads of your fingers to help loosen them.Unless your cookware is plagued by troublesome residue, you can usually just stop here. Unlike most types of cookware, it’s beneficial for cast iron to retain a thin coating of oil.Simmering an inch of water in the pan will help soften messes that running water alone won’t clear away. Try not to let your cookware soak for more than a few minutes at a time., An ordinary kitchen sponge or nylon dish brush will work fine, as neither of these tools is abrasive enough to leave scratches on cast iron. Even so, try not to scrub the pan any more forcefully than needed to remove remaining food particles and residue.For added cleaning power, squeeze a small amount of mild liquid dish soap to the water in the pan. Just don’t overdo it—detergents that are formulate to cut tough grease may strip the pan of some of its seasoning., Once the pan is clean, pat both sides dry with a clean towel. You can also set the pan on the cooktop over a low heat until all moisture has evaporated.Water and cast iron don’t mix. If not dried quickly and entirely, excessive moisture can cause your cookware to rust, reducing its nonstick capabilities.Never air dry your cast iron cookware. The combination of water and oxygen will cause it to deteriorate much faster.

Make a baking soda paste.,
Rub the paste onto your pieces of silver.,
Clean small crevices with a toothbrush.,
Rinse the silver with warm water.",How to Clean Sterling Silver2," Mix ¼ tablespoon (3.7 ml) of baking soda with one or two drops of water to form a paste. Make sure the paste is not too watery, as this will decrease the paste’s cleaning power.The paste should be relatively dry, but not powdery. Look for a toothpaste-like consistency.

, Use a clean, cotton cloth to rub a pea-sized amount of paste onto your pieces of silver. Rub the silver in a straight back and forth motion until you see the shine return.As you clean your silver, it is normal for the baking soda paste to turn grey.

, Do this by diluting your paste with a couple more drops of water. Then dip your toothbrush into the diluted paste and scrub the smaller crevices.Alternatively, you can use a Q-tip to clean small crevices if you do not have a spare toothbrush.

, Do this once all the tarnish is removed. Dry the silver with a soft, cotton cloth like a dishtowel or with a Selvyt cloth. Finish by polishing the item with a microfiber cloth."

Bring 1 cup (8.12 oz) of water to a boil.,
Add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of salt and 1 tablespoon of baking soda to the dish.,
Pour in the boiling water.,
Use the salad tongs to take the pieces of silver out of the bowl.,
Polish your pieces of silver with a microfiber cloth.",How to Clean Sterling Silver3," While the water is coming to a boil, line a glass or ceramic baking dish with aluminum foil. Make sure the shiny side of the aluminum foil is facing up., Then slowly add ½ cup (4.06 oz) of white vinegar. You want to add the vinegar slowly because it will cause the baking soda to fizz. Once all the vinegar is in, mix the ingredients together until well-combined.Make sure the salt is completely dissolved. If not, the granules may scratch your silver.

, Then carefully place each piece of silver into the baking dish. Make sure they are lying flat and are not overlapping. Let the silver sit in the baking dish for 5 to 10 minutes. Use salad tongs to rotate and flip the pieces of silver to make sure each side is exposed to the aluminum foil., Place each piece on a clean cloth to cool. Then rinse each piece one by one with warm water. Use a soft, cotton cloth to dry the pieces of silver.Make sure to thoroughly dry pieces of silver that contain small crevices and etchings.

, Do not polish your silver with other types of fabric since these may scratch your silver. Remember that you can use nitrile gloves to avoid smudging while drying and polishing your pieces of silver.

Pour some coarse-grained salt into the pan.,
Scrub the pan with a stiff-bristled brush or sponge.,
Rinse out the pan.,
Wipe the pan dry.",How to Clean Seasoned Cast Iron2," When you’re left with a lot of gunk and grime after cooking, you may need to turn to a solution that works a little better than plain water. Shake in just enough salt to cover the bottom of the pan. Drizzle a few ounces of water onto the salt and stir the two ingredients together until they form a thick paste.Use a more substantial type of salt, such as kosher salt, sea salt or coarse-ground rock salt.The rough edges of the salt grains make it an effective (but not too abrasive) astringent agent for scouring cast iron without fear of damaging it.

, Go over the cast iron lightly using a gentle circular motion. Concentrate on the spots where residue is the heaviest. The salt paste should make it possible for you to lift away messes without a lot of effort.Be careful not to scour your cookware too hard. Always use the least amount of force necessary.
If you’re still having trouble after using salt, heat the pan on the cooktop to burn away the last few bits of solid food. They can then be wiped away easily with a paper towel.

, Flush with warm water to get rid of the last traces of salt. As you rinse, sweep the bottom of the pan lightly with your sponge. There should be no salt or food residue visible on the surface when you’re done.Don’t forget to check for salt on the underside of the pan and inside the grooves of the handle.
Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Salt can also be hard on iron surfaces.

, Shake off the excess moisture, then towel dry your cookware from top to bottom or heat it briefly on the stove. Afterwards, you’ll need to reseason the cast iron to keep its nonstick finish properly conditioned.Make sure there’s no water left on the pan before you put it away.

Reseason your cookware after every use.,
Cook with the pan regularly.,
Avoid tools and cleaning methods that can damage your cookware.,
Store cast iron in a cool, dry place.",How to Clean Seasoned Cast Iron3," Heat the pan to around 350 and pour in about a tablespoon of conventional cooking oil. Swirl the oil around in the bottom of the pan, then turn of the cooktop and allow it to cool. Once it’s safe to handle, use a thick wad of folded paper towels to spread the oil over the cooking surface.Conventional oils like vegetable oil, canola oil and shortening are all effective for seasoning.You can also spray the pan with liberally with a special seasoning spray. These will usually be available through the company you purchased your cookware from.

, Break out your cast iron skillet anytime you need to do some frying, searing or sautéing. The more you use your cookware, the more fats and oils it will absorb. That way, you’ll be keeping it in top shape as you cook.Greasy offerings like fried chicken, bacon and steak that would make a mess of other types of cookware are just what cast iron needs to retain its nonstick finish over time.If it’s been a long time since you last used a piece of cookware, it can be a good idea to season it before adding ingredients to it that might stick.

, Though cast iron is prized for its durability, it can be worn down with the wrong kind of treatment. Opt for synthetic sponges and brushes over harsh scrubbers like steel wool, and avoid astringent cleaning powders and high-powered dish soaps. And, of course, make sure to dry the pan thoroughly by hand each and every time you clean it.Don’t be afraid to use metal utensils with your cast iron cookware. It won’t be enough to scratch the metal’s resilient surface., Humidity and other factors can take a toll after awhile, so it’s important to keep cast iron protected and out of the way. The inside of a pantry or cabinet is a good place to house your cookware when it’s not in use. Wherever you decide to keep your cast iron, it should be far enough away from direct exposure to moisture to reduce the risk of rusting and warping.Some people also prefer to hang their pots and pans so that they’re close at hand and add charm to the look of the kitchen.If you’re forced to stack your cookware together to economize space, stick a layer of folded paper towels between each to act as a buffer."

Wash away dirt and grease.,
Start with the areas most corroded by rust.,
Scrub the rust with a coarse sandpaper or steel wool.,
Remove the remaining rust and unevenness with fine-grit sandpaper.,
Rinse and dry your tools.",How to Clean Rusty Tools1," Mix grease-cutting dish detergent into warm water until you get suds. Place the tools into the soapy water. While the tools are submerged, scrub them using a sponge or rag until the oil and dirt are gone, then remove the tools from the water.The soap and water should mix more easily if you pour the detergent into the bowl before adding the water.
Dry the items well enough for you to grip them while you sand the rust.;
, Look for the thick patches of rust and start there. While you’ll clean away all of the rust, the process is easier if you work from thick rust to surface rust.


For example, you’ll want to scrub off the flakes of rust before you attack the inset rust., Choose a coarse grit to begin scrubbing as it will make it easier for you to scrape off the rust. If the sandpaper gets dull, switch to a new sheet.

, Work over your piece with the fine-grit sandpaper to remove any fine speckles of rust and restore the shine to the metal. The softer quality of the paper should prevent damaging the metal of the tool.


If your tool still has rust, then you may need to try a chemical remover., Once all of the rust has been sanded away, rinse your tools under clean running water to remove any debris. Dry them using a clean cloth or rag, making sure that no wetness remains.


If you do not get your tools completely dry, more rust can develop.

Make sure your quarter is not valued by collectors.,
Wash your hands with soap and warm water.,
Soak the quarter in very hot water.,
Soak the quarter in a plastic container filled with warm, soapy water.,
Rinse the coin with warm running water.,
Rinse the quarter with distilled water.,
Dry the quarter.",How to Clean Quarters1," This is especially important if you plan on selling or trading your quarter later. Many collectors find tarnish desirable.Cleaning collectible quarters can decrease their value greatly.Because of this, it is best to leave old, valuable quarters alone.


Some collector's quarters can be worth up to $400, if not more.;
, to remove any grit and oils from your fingers. Prepare your working area by laying down several layers of thick towels flat across the surface. This will provide a soft landing place for any quarters that you might drop, as well as an area for them to dry on.

, Fill a plastic container with very hot water and dip the water inside. Do not use metal, glass, or china because their hard finishes will scratch your quarters. Metal containers may also react with the surface of the quarter.


You can also hold the quarter under running hot water, but make sure that you have the drain covered. Hold the quarter by the edges, between your thumb and forefinger.
If you are soaking more than one quarter at a time, make sure that there is enough space between each one. If they are all touching, they are more likely to get scratched or dinged.
Check the dates of the quarters to avoid soaking two different kinds of metals together. Quarters minted in 1964 and earlier were made mostly from silver. Quarters minted in 1965 and after were made from copper and nickel.

, Fill a plastic container with 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 2 cups (475 milliliters) of warm water. Stir just enough to mix the two together but not so much that you get suds.Place the quarter into the water, and leave it there for several hours. The soap will help loosen any dirt.


If you are soaking more than one quarter at a time, make sure that there is enough space between them.

, Hold the quarter by the edges, between your thumb and forefinger. Make sure that the drain is covered, in case you drop the quarter. If the dirt is stubborn, you can very gently rub it off using your fingertip or a soft bristled toothbrush (such as a baby toothbrush). Work in an outward direction, from the center of the coin to its edges, until the dirt is gone.


If the dirt is very gritty, do not rub it off. The tiny particles may scratch the surface of the quarter. Instead, consider soaking the quarter in the soapy water for longer. You can also move the quarter around under the running water to dislodge the grit.

, Fill a plastic container with distilled water. Dip the quarter into the water, swish it around, and lift it out. Running tap water is great at dislodging dirt, but it often contains minerals that may cause water spots. Distilled water is pure, and does not container these minerals.

, Gently pat the quarter dry with a clean, soft, dry cloth. Be very careful not to rub the coin.Try to use a lint-free cloth, such as microfiber. You can also dry the quarter by wrapping some tissue around it, then placing it between the pages of a book. Close the book, open it, then take the quarter out."

Clean your knife with water.,
Soak your blade in white vinegar.,
Apply some salt or baking soda and lemon juice.,
Use baking soda.,
Stab the rusty knife into a potato.,
Mix white vinegar and dishwashing soap.",How to Clean Rust from a Pocketknife1," Before you remove rust, make sure that the knife is free of dirt and oils. You can just hold your knife under some warm running water to clean it. Work slowly and be patient – if you rush the job, or scrub too vigorously, you risk damaging your knife.Use regular water to clean away any dirt or stains.
Be sure to wipe away all traces of fingerprints, as the natural salts present in human skin can cause a blade to rust.
Avoid getting water into the gaps between the handle and blade, where it may create new rust spots that are difficult to reach.
Thoroughly dry your knife with a soft, clean rag after you finish cleaning it.;
, White vinegar contains acetic acid, which will often dissolve rust. Dampen a rag with white vinegar and apply it directly to the rust spots, or soak the blade in a shallow bowl of white vinegar for tougher stains.Once the rust has dissolved, rinse the blade thoroughly with water to remove the vinegar. Then, dry off the knife with a clean, dry cloth.

, Lemon juice can dissolve rust stains on metal surfaces, but it may work even better when you use it with some salt or baking soda. Try using a mixture of lemon juice and salt or baking soda to remove rust stains from your knife blade.Sprinkle baking soda or salt onto the rust spots, then wipe the blade with a clean rag soaked in lemon juice.
Rinse away the lemon juice with warm water after a minute or two and then dry it with a clean cloth.
Be careful not to leave lemon juice on your blade for more than a few minutes, because it can damage the metal.

, Baking soda can remove rust stains, although you may need to repeat the process several times. Baking soda is used in cooking and for many house cleaning chores – you may already have some in your kitchen.Make a thick paste by mixing baking soda with water. Put about a quarter (1/4) cup of baking soda in a glass bowl, and add a small amount of water to create a paste. Continue to add water in small increments, until you have a paste that is thick enough to stick to the surface of the blade.
Apply the paste to the blade, and allow it to soak for two to three hours.
Scrub the paste off of the blade with a wire brush or fine steel wool to remove the rust spots.
Rinse away the rest of the paste by holding the knife under running water.
Then, dry the knife thoroughly with a clean cloth.

, A raw potato may remove rust stains from metal surfaces. Potatoes contain oxalic acid, which can dissolve rust.Stick the rusted blade directly into a potato and leave it there for a few hours. Then, remove the knife from the potato, rinse away the potato juices, and dry the knife with a clean cloth.
Throw away the potato after you are finished with it. It might have small pieces of rust stuck in it, so it is not suitable for eating.

, Dishwashing soap mixed with vinegar can also remove rust stains from a knife. Get some regular dish soap and mix it with white cooking vinegar, or clear cleaning-grade vinegar.Mix one part dish soap with one part vinegar, and apply it to the blade with a soft rag. Then, rinse away the solution and dry off the knife.
For stubborn rust stains, soak the blade in the vinegar dish soap solution for an hour. Then, remove the blade and rinse off the vinegar dish soap solution under running water. Dry off the blade with a clean, dry towel.

Wash all of the tools or parts to be treated for rust in a mixture of grease-cutting dish detergent and warm water to remove the oils and dirt., You can use a plastic container, pot, or tub, as long as it’s large enough to submerge the tools. Choose a container that you can set aside for one to three days., White vinegar is acidic, so it will cut through the rust, making it easier to remove. While the amount of white vinegar will vary depending on how many tools you are cleaning and how big they are, track how much you add to the container so that you can properly measure your salt., You should add roughly ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of salt for each quart (1 liter) of vinegar. The salt will increase the acidity of the vinegar so that the solution dissolves the rust quicker. Spread the salt evenly over the vinegar soak., The vinegar and salt need time to break down the rust so that it can be scrubbed from the tools. The longer you allow your tools to remain in the vinegar, the easier it will be to remove the rust.Place the container in a secure location so that children and animals won’t get into it. For example, you could lock it in your garage or shed.

, After you remove the tools from the vinegar solution, vigorously rub your tools to buff away the rust. Continue to scrub the tools until they are completely free of rust.


If the rust is thick, use a metal bristle brush., Pour out the vinegar solution and wash out the tub. Fill the tub with enough clean water to match the amount of vinegar solution that you’d used., The baking soda will neutralize the acid from the vinegar so that it doesn’t remain on your tools. Use about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of baking soda for each quart (1 liter) of water. Mix the baking soda into the water to create a solution., Make sure that your tools are submerged in the baking soda solution. Allow the tools to soak for ten minutes before removing them. Dry them well with a clean towel., Use 0000 steel wool to buff the tools and remove any remaining spots. Your tools should be free of rust., Apply denatured alcohol to a clean cloth and rub it onto the tools. The alcohol will help you make sure that no water remains on your tools. Water could cause more rust.Polish the tool with camellia oil to prevent more rust."

Use Vaseline or petroleum jelly to remove dirt from quarters.,
Soak dirty quarters in a solution made from vinegar and salt.,
Know what to avoid.",How to Clean Quarters2," You can use pure acetone or nail polish remover. For light residue, soak a cotton ball with acetone, and wipe the surface of the quarter until the stickiness is gone. For more stubborn residue, pour some acetone into a glass cup and leave the quarter in there for up to 24 hours. Remove the quarter, then dry it off with a tissue.Acetone works on tape residue as well as gunked up ink, tar, and glue.
You must use a glass container. Do not use metal or plastic. Metal which can react with the quarter and ruin it. Plastic can be corroded or melted by the acetone.

, If you are collecting quarters that you plan on having as part of a set, such as the State quarters, consider lightening them with ammonia. This was, they will all match. To do this, soak a cotton ball with some ammonia, and wipe the surface of each quarter.


This works only on quarters that are mostly clean. If your quarter is very dirty, consider cleaning it with some soap and water.Ammonia can also remove green tarnish.
Get plain ammonia from the grocery story. Avoid using ammonia-based household cleaning products. They tend to be too harsh for quarters.

, Pour some baking soda into the palm of your hand. Dip the quarter you want to clean in water, then place it into the baking soda. Roll it around and flip it over. Use your fingers to rub the baking soda across the surface of the quarter. Rinse the baking soda off with distilled water. Repeat this step, if necessary.Baking soda is effective, but it is also very harsh. It can create tiny scratches that collectors and dealers will notice upon inspection. Do not use this on valuable, collectible quarters.

, Place the quarter you want to clean into a small plastic bowl. Fill the bowl with enough lemon juice to cover the quarter. Wait a few minutes, then check on the quarter. If the quarter is clean, rinse it off with distilled water. If the quarter is still dirty, let it soak for a few more minutes. Once you have the quarter rinsed off, pat it dry with a tissue., Place the quarter you want to clean in a small plastic bowl. Fill the bowl with just enough olive oil to cover it. Olive oil is very gentle, but it takes a long time for it to work. Check on the quarter after several hours. If you want, you can gently rub the surface with your fingers to dislodge any surface dirt. Rinse the quarter off with dish soap and warm water, then give it a final rinse with distilled water. Pat it dry with a tissue., Place the quarters you want to clean into a small plastic bowl. Fill the bowl with just enough rubbing alcohol to cover the quarters. Wait a few hours, then check on the quarters. If they are still dirty, let them soak for a few more hours. If they are clean, take them out of the rubbing alcohol bath and pat them dry with a tissue., Dip a Q-tip into some Vaseline. Apply the Vaseline to the face of the quarter, then wipe it off with a clean Q-tip. Keep doing this until the quarter is clean, then repeat for the other side. Once the quarter is clean, wipe it off with lint-free fabric, such as microfiber., Fill a small, glass bowl with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of white vinegar and 2 tablespoons of salt. Stir the solution to mix, then add the quarters. Leave the quarters there for several hours to overnight. When they are clean, take them out and rinse them off using distilled water. Gently pat them dry with a tissue., There are some cleaning agents that should be avoided, mostly because they can permanently mar the surface of the quarter. Listed below are several cleaning agents that you should avoid when cleaning quarters, and why:


Chlorine, bleach, porcelain cleaners, and other cleaning acids can corrode and darken the surface.Do not use silver dip or silver polish.They tend to be too abrasive and can scratch up the coin's surface.This is especially important for quarters minted in 1964 and earlier. These are made from almost pure silver.

Oil the blade to remove light rust stains.,
Use a non-toxic rust remover.,
Try CLR for extra stubborn rust stains.",How to Clean Rust from a Pocketknife3," Apply a light oil that will not stain or dry the metal components. You can use commercial products such as WD-40, 3-In-One, Clean Streak, and Metal Brite.Use a clean rag to apply a thin layer of oil directly to the blade. Use as little oil as possible because a thick layer of oil may attract dust and debris.
Leave the knife open and allow the oil to soak into the blade for two to three days. This should loosen up the rust spots and make them easier to remove.
After two to three days, use the tip of a sharp knife to carefully scrape off the rust spots. You can also use a piece of steel wool.If you work slowly and carefully, you can remove the rust while leaving much of the original finish of the blade intact.

, You can purchase non-toxic rust removal products in hardware and auto parts stores, such as Evapo-Rust. These products are gentler than some of the other acid-based chemical solvents that you can use to remove rust.To use a product like Evapo-Rust, pour some of the product into a bucket and then immerse the knife blade in the solution.
Leave the knife to soak in the solution for 30 minutes or overnight if it is really rusty.
Rinse off the excess product and dry the knife with a clean, dry cloth.

, CLR is a commercial cleaner that removes calcium, lime, and rust from any metal surface. It is often used on old plumbing and appliances, but it can also be used to remove rust from a knife blade.Dip the blade of your knife directly into a solution of half CLR and half warm water. Avoid getting CLR on the knife handle, if it is made of anything other than metal (e.g. plastic, bone, wood, stone).
Rinse the blade right away with cold water. Do not soak the blade in CLR for any longer than two minutes, as this may damage the metal.
If stains persist, use CLR at full strength (not diluted with water), and rinse right away with cold water.
CLR is a caustic substance. Clean your knife in a well-ventilated area, and use gloves when handling CLR.
Do not mix CLR with other household cleaners, as this may cause a dangerous reaction.
Do not use CLR on galvanized metal, as it may cause spotting on the zinc coating of the blade.

This method is suitable for light rust stains, especially those on kitchen knives. Use caution when cleaning knives to prevent accidental cuts., Rinse the rusted metal with water and shake it dry over your sink or outside. Sprinkle baking soda onto areas with rust. The soda will stick to the still damp metal. Leave the soda for about an hour, then scour rust away with steel wool, a scouring pad, or a metal bristle brush. Rinse the item with water and dry it with a towel.


This technique is most useful for light rust, rust rings, rusty baking pans, and other kinds of thin metal that have developed rust.
While scrubbing, use firm, steady pressure. It may take some time before the rust comes free. If rust remains after rinsing, repeat this process until the rust is completely removed., Fill a bucket with enough vinegar to completely submerge the rusty metal. Remove loose flakes of rust by brushing afflicted areas with a wire bristle brush or steel wool. Soak the item in vinegar overnight, then rinse the item in water and dry it with a towel.


Larger rusty items may not fit in a bucket. In these situations, saturate rags in white vinegar and wrap these around rusty areas. Leave the rags on overnight, then brush, rinse, and dry the item as per usual.
This rust removal technique works well for severe rust, especially on steel tools. Vinegar will not harm the surface or integrity of steel.
The longer you leave items in vinegar, the more effective it will be. Soak heavily rusted items for longer periods of time. Repeat this process as necessary to remove stubborn rust., Follow the directions on the citric acid to mix it with hot water to form a cleaning solution. Immerse your rusted steel item in the solution for 8 to 10 hours or overnight. Avoid soaking items for more than 24 hours. After soaking, use a stiff or wire bristle brush to remove any leftover flakes. Rinse the item in water and dry it with a towel.


Citric acid can be purchased at most grocery and health stores. You can usually find it in the canning section. In some cases, citric acid may go by the name “sour salt.”
Most citric acid products are prepared by adding 2 or 3 tbsp (30 to 44 ml) of acid to a moderate amount of hot water in a bucket.
Citric acid will remove paint from items. It is safe for use on steel, and works well for removing heavy rust."

Doing so can also make the silver oxidize more quickly., The detergent and heat of your dishwasher can cause oxidation and corrosion in your silver. Silver should be cleaned with cool water and a mild soap. Use a soft cotton cloth to wipe dirty silver clean when necessary., Opposite of what you might expect, using your silver and cleaning it thoroughly by hand after every use can defend against oxidation. Even using your silver once a week could keep it looking oxidation free for longer."

Scrape the vomit off the bed.,
Remove the sheets and wash thoroughly.,
Soak up the remaining liquid from the mattress.,
Apply baking soda to the affected area.,
Allow the baking soda to sit overnight.,
Vacuum up the baking soda residue.,
Mix equal parts water and white vinegar.,
Spray the mixture on the stain and blot the area well.,
Repeat the process until the stain is gone.,
Let the mattress dry overnight.,
Apply rubbing alcohol to kill any germs.,
Allow the mattress to dry again.",How to Clean Vomit from a Mattress," The first step is cleaning the mattress is removing the vomit from the surface of the bed. Use a paper plate to scrape any solids off the bed, and place it in a plastic bag to discard in the trash.Before cleaning up the vomit, it’s a good idea to put on rubber gloves. That will protect you from any germs.
You can also use a dustpan to scrape the vomit from your bed and dump it in the toilet to dispose of it. Hose the dustpan down outside to clean it.;
, If the bedding is still on your bed, remove them before moving on to cleaning the mattress. Strip the sheets, comforter, mattress pad, and any other items from the bed, and wash them in the washing machine.Wash the bedding on the highest temperature setting that is available on the washer. That will help kill any lingering germs.

, Once you’ve removed the sheets from the bed, use a dry cloth to soak up any liquid from the vomit that may have reached the mattress. Avoid rubbing the stained area, though. Instead, blot it to help remove the liquid without spreading it around.It’s a good idea to use an old rag to blot the mattress because you may want to throw it out when you’re done.

, After you’ve blotted away any remaining liquid from the mattress, sprinkle some baking soda over the area. The baking soda will help absorb any remaining liquid and remove the lingering odor.If you don’t have baking soda at home, you can substitute cornstarch. However, cornstarch doesn’t have the deodorizing properties that baking soda does.

, Once you’ve spread the baking soda on the stained section of the mattress, it needs time to absorb any leftover liquid and odor. Let the baking soda sit on the mattress for 8 hours to overnight, or until the baking soda is completely dry.If you or someone else needs to sleep on the bed, you can lay a clean towel over the baking soda on the mattress so you can place sheets over it.

, When the baking soda has sat on the mattress overnight, use a vacuum cleaner to remove the residue. Be sure to empty the vacuum and wash the canister or change the bag afterward so bacteria doesn’t grow inside the machine.Using the vacuum's hose attachment is the best bet to ensure that you remove all of the baking soda residue.
If you don’t have a vacuum cleaner, you can sweep the baking soda residue into a garbage can or bag.

, If there are still stains on the mattress from the vomit, you may need a targeted cleaner. Combine 1 cup (237 ml) warm water and 1 cup (237 ml) of white vinegar in a spray bottle and shake well to mix thoroughly.For extra cleaning power, you can also mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of liquid dish soap. Just make sure it’s not a moisturizing formula., After you’ve prepared the vinegar mixture, apply it to the stains on the mattress. Don’t oversaturate the mattress; spray the stained area until it is just damp. Next, blot the mattress with a clean towel to lift the stain.Choose a towel that is extremely absorbent for blotting the mattress.

, Depending on the stain, one application of the vinegar solution may not be enough to remove the stain. Apply it to the mattress and blot it as many times as necessary to completely remove the vomit stains.Make sure to have plenty of clean towels on hand for the blotting. You don’t want to blot the mattress over and over with the same towel because you can wind up spreading the stain.

, After you’ve removed the stain from the mattress, it’s important to let it dry. Give the mattress at least 6 to 8 hours to dry. You can help the drying process by turning on an overhead fan, aiming a freestanding fan at the mattress, or opening a window near the bed., Even after you clean the mattress, there can still be germs left behind after someone vomits. When the mattress is dry, spray the affected area lightly with rubbing alcohol to kill any lingering germs.Instead of rubbing alcohol, you can dab some unscented hand sanitizer on the mattress to kill the germs.

, After you’ve applied the rubbing alcohol, allow the mattress to dry completely. It should take about 6 hours, but it’s a good idea to let it air dry overnight to be certain it’s dry.Be sure to keep children and pets away from the mattress until the alcohol is dry.

Try a hydrogen peroxide cleaner for blood.,
Use soap on beverage stains.,
Stomp on the mattress to absorb liquid.,
Place it in the sun.,
Use a dehumidifier or fan.,
Deodorize and dry with baking soda.",How to Clean a Wet Mattress," Whether the liquid is urine, vomit, a drink, or some other kind of liquid, the first thing to do when you get liquid on your bed is strip it down completely. Take the sheets off, and if you have one, the mattress protector. Throw those in the wash., After you've cleared the area, you want to get as much of the stain out of the mattress as you can. Use a towel or rag to blot at the stain, letting it absorb the moisture. Switch rags or ring them out as needed., Another option is spraying on a light mist of cleaner, such as white vinegar mixed with water and tea tree oil, and then spreading towels over the top. On top of that layer, apply a layer of newspaper. Finally, add something heavy, such as books, to help weight the whole thing down. Leave it overnight to absorb what it can., Enzymatic cleaners are the spray cleaners made to clean up pet messes, but they work just as well on human messes. Spray the cleaner on, and let it sit for about five to ten minutes. Blot up the cleaner at the end.Other options for urine include laundry stain removers and a home mix of two parts vinegar to one part water with a capful or two of tea tree oil in it.
You can also use one part vinegar, two parts water, and a few drops of laundry detergent.These cleaners will also likely work on vomit and other bodily fluids.

, If you get blood on the mattress, a cleaner with hydrogen peroxide will likely work best. Mix together 1/4 cup (59 milliliters) of hydrogen peroxide, 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of salt. It should form a thick paste that you can spread on the stain to let dry. Once it's dry, scrape it up to see if the stain is gone. If not, reapply a new batch of the mixture.You can also try straight hydrogen peroxide (3%). Spritz it on, and then dab at the stain. Let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. , If you spill a beverage such as soda, beer, or wine, using a bit of soap may do the trick. Dampen a sponge, then apply a little bit of dishwashing detergent or even hand soap. Dab at it with the sponge. You can even scrub a little to help remove the stain., Take the mattress outside. To ensure you've gotten as much moisture out as you can, lay a towel out on the wet area. Jump up and down or stomp a bit on the wet part, which will help release more of the moisture. Keep going until it's not leaving moisture on the towel., To make sure the mattress is thoroughly dry, the sun can do wonders. Take the mattress outside to a sunny area, and use a chair on each corner to keep it off the ground and promote air flow. Let it sit in the sun to dry out., Place the mattress with a chair under each corner so you have air flow underneath, and then use a dehumidifier or fan in the same room. If you're using a dehumidifier, it can help to close the door.A space heater can also help.You can also just prop the mattress up against the wall with the appliance nearby.

, When the mattress is mostly dry, you can sprinkle a little baking soda on top to help absorb any moisture left. This step will also help deodorize the mattress. Use a vacuum to remove the baking soda after letting it sit for about 15 minutes."

, This includes pillows, mattress protector, and miscellaneous items. The mattress will now be given a chance to breathe.


If it's that once-a-year spring clean of your bedroom, consider getting a helper or two to carry the mattress outdoors for some sunshine. Lay down a large tarpaulin or groundsheet beforehand, and lay the mattress on it, in full sun.

, If the bed has a headboard, wipe it down with a damp cleaning cloth, then dust it. Polish if appropriate.

, Since this is right next to the bed, it can be cleaned now too. Remove all items that have accumulated on the table and place back where they belong. Wipe the remaining items with a damp cleaning cloth, then wipe the surface of the table. Leave to dry, placing the items back when the surface has dried.

, First, remove any clothing that has been stuffed in there or isn't properly put away. This will make it easier to see what is in there.

, If mildew is growing, treat it with an appropriate cleaning solution. These are available commercially or you can make your own, such as using vinegar or clove oil.

, Depending on what the floor surface is, clean it in the appropriate manner. Remove all shoes, shoe boxes, and other items from the area first.

, Decide whether anything needs washing and put it in a washing pile. Other clothes can be folded neatly or hung up as appropriate and put back. This is a good time to make decisions about donating items that aren't getting used anymore.


Start a washing clothing pile in one corner of the bedroom for retrieval later.

, As with the clothes, use this opportunity to discard or donate anything no longer needed.


Clothes can be added to the washing clothing pile or immediately placed back where they belong in the wardrobe.
Books, magazines and newspapers should be returned to shelving or the recycling/donation box.
Gadgets, toys, electronic equipment, etc. should be returned to where they belong.
Other people's items should be returned to them.

Wash the inside of the windows if needed.

, Use a damp cloth to wipe over all remaining undusted surfaces in the bedroom, including shelves and knick-knacks on the shelves. You can also use a duster for books on shelves, for shelf items and hard-to-reach areas of the room.


Microfiber cleaning cloths and dusters are recommended, as they attract rather than disperse the dust.

, Depending on the floor surface, now is the time to clean it.


Take rugs outside and beat them to remove dust. Vacuum them on return indoors.
If there are stains on the carpet, treat these appropriately to remove or lessen them.
Polish the floor if it's wooden.

, If there is a desk in your room, remove all items from it. Choose what is to go back on the desk and put away everything else. Wipe the desk down and dust any objects from the desk. Return the items to the desktop when dry.

If you don’t have a hamper, you can use a trash bag to transport your clothes.

, This will help you focus on the next task of getting rid of junk.


Gathering everything in one spot will give you a clear idea of how much you have and allow you to start getting rid of things you don’t need.

, Make a pile for trash, donating, and stuff that you use or that you want to keep, etc. It’s a good idea to get three bins or bags to sort your items.


Throw all your trash in one bag. You may have to throw things away that aren’t needed but can’t be donated either. Be honest with yourself and think about the last time you used something. If it’s been longer than six months, you don’t need it.
Throw all your charity items in another bag. Make sure whatever you donate is in good condition.

, Aim to only need one bin, tote, or container to keep everything that you want but don’t need out. This will help you stay organized.


Put everything you want to keep (toys, stuffed animals, etc.) in a storage bin and put it in your basement, under your bed, or in a closet.

, Now it’s time to clean your cleared off surfaces. Dust first and wipe off every surface, then sweep, vacuum, and mop.


Dusting with a dust rag or dust wipes will pick up most of the dust from your surfaces but also cause some to flutter down to the floor. Don’t forget your ceiling fan and lamps.

What's so messy about it? Look for the big things first. Realizing what makes your room messy in the first place is a very good start because it helps to cleaning it right. Now you got the main things out, you are ready to start cleaning.;
, You're probably left with a lot of clothing, toys, etc. You didn't really do much but clear out the hardest parts. Take your dirty clothing off the floor and put them in a container, or, if you have one, a laundry basket. Take your clean clothing and pile them up somewhere else. Also, don't just leave your dirty clothes in the hamper, make sure they actually get washed! If you have any empty clothes hangers laying around, put them into your closet.

, If you are still young, and reading this guide and have toys, then take your toys and think. Do you want them anymore? Are they in good enough shape to donate? Put your toys into 3 piles: Toys to keep in your room, toys to throw out, and toys to donate. Now keep your piles out of your room and away for now. Again, we will go back to that later.

, A common thing in messy rooms are dirty dishes. You probably have glasses laying around with a little sour milk still on the bottom, and plates with sauce all over them. Go to the ""Tips"" Section if you have ants, roaches, or any insect in your room. Anyway, take your dishes down and wash them or put them in the dishwasher. Make sure you do it well, and remember to put them back in the cabinet for the next family member or guest to use. Take a sponge and wipe away any glass marks (from not using a coaster) or spills from food and drink. Good! You got the grossest part of cleaning your room done. Now down to the next step.

, If you never do crafts, skip this step. Crafty stuff includes paper, stationery (pens, pencils, scissors, rulers), and things you'd use for creative hobbies. If you're a really crafty person, buy some drawers specifically for craft materials.

, Make sure you get rid of any ""Dog-ears"" (folds in the corners of the page) and put them in a bookcase or shelf. If you don't have one, put them to the side for later (where you put your toys and clothing).


If you want your room to look really tidy, then rearrange your books from smallest to largest, alphabetically, etc.

Consolidate wires.,
Dust, sweep, vacuum, and mop your surfaces and floor.,
Bring the items you want to keep back into your room.",How to Clean and Organize Your Room2," Getting rid of items you don’t need is essential to cleaning and organizing a living space. Grab three containers, or just create three piles: keep, donate, toss.


The living room is a communal space that tends to attract of a lot of junk from other rooms. Whether it’s plates from the kitchen or pillows from the bedroom.
Go through your living room and first take everything out of the room that doesn’t belong. Place those things in the correct room.
Place everything else into your three sections. Look at everything you have. Maybe you can donate or sell all of those DVDs that you never watch. Perhaps you realize that you haven’t used that lamp in the corner and don’t need it.
Don’t remove your items just yet, first you need to clear off all surfaces.

, Take everything off of all your surfaces. This means everything from the coasters to bigger items that you can easily move.


Having clean, clutter-free surfaces will make getting the proper cleaning done much easier and will help you organize.
Place each item that you remove from any surface, like your table and stands, into one of your three piles.
When deciding which pile to place an item in, think about the last time you used an item, and its purpose. Try to only keep frequently used and useful items.
You don’t have to get rid of something like a blanket or decoration piece. But take note of how many of one thing you have. You may want to store some of your blankets and pillows in a closet to keep your space clean.

, Adding some furniture that doubles as storage can greatly improve your living area. Is your coffee table scuffed from people putting feet on it? Do you have too many toys, blankets, pillows, and other items lying around everywhere? These are questions to consider when cleaning and organizing. You can get ottomans that serve as storage bins to tuck away those toys and blankets. These ottomans can also serve as a better footrest than your coffee table.
You can also purchase a cube organizer console to place along a wall that serves as cubby spaces for toys, blankets, and other objects.
If you’re feeling adventurous you can even install a wall mounted floating shelf near the top of your wall toward the ceiling. Place objects like extra blankets, books, or movies that you want but don’t use often. This keeps things out of the way but easy to access.

, With everything out in the open, it’s now time to clear out what you don’t use or need. Place these items in a trash bag to send off to the garbage or for donation.


The living room tends to be an area where a lot of old electronics end up. Notice what you use for entertainment. Do you have a bunch of DVDs or VHS tapes, players, or old stereo equipment you don't use? If you do, these are only collecting dust, it’s time to get rid of them.
If you have certain things you want to keep, like DVDs, that mounted shelf could be a great place for these items.
Remove everything that's not furniture from the room. Take your piles into another room for now so you can clean. And so you can see how nice your room looks without the clutter.

, Wires are another area that causes dust build up and can make a room look disorganized.


Go through all of your cords and wires and first make sure everything is connected and serves a purpose. Remove any that aren’t connected to anything.
If you don’t know what a stray wire or cord goes to, and don’t want to throw it away, wrap it up nicely and wrap a rubber a band around it. Then place it in a ziplock bag with others.
Group as many wires as you can together. Wires and cords that connect your TV, stereo, video games, etc, can usually be grouped together. Then grab a zip tie and tie the cords together. This makes your area look more organized and helps you hide the cords.

, Now it’s time to clean your cleared off surfaces and the floor. Dust first and wipe off every surface, then sweep, vacuum, and mop.


Dusting with a dust rag or dust wipes will pick up most of the dust from your surfaces but also cause some to flutter down to the floor. Don’t forget your ceiling fan and lamps. Also, make sure to dust behind your TV and consoles, and your Wi-Fi routers.
Sweep next to remove any fallen dust and get any dirt off the floor. Make sure to get every corner and under all your furniture, especially your couch and consoles.
Once you’ve swept away the cobwebs, vacuum to pick up anything else, and then mop the area to really clean it.

, Place all the items you wish to keep back into your living space.


Group similar items together and in areas where you are likely to use that item. Store your extra items like your blankets or pillows together but out of sight, either in a bin or a closet if you have one nearby.
If you have a floating couch, one that isn’t on a wall, you can add a storage council behind it to store your extra items as well.

Free up counter space.,
Purge unneeded items from your kitchen.,
Group like objects together.,
Clean out the pantry and fridge.,
Dust, sweep, vacuum, and mop, the rest of the kitchen.,
Perform a daily clean to keep your kitchen as clean as possible.",How to Clean and Organize Your Room3," Cluttered counter space is a major contributor to a messy and unorganized kitchen. Store everything that normally goes in a cupboard or the pantry back to its rightful place. Consider adding backsplash storage above your countertops. Instead of storing your coffee, sugar, cooking oils and whatever else on the counter, you can install rods or rails to hang baskets or caddies from. This not only adds a nice organized look but makes cleaning regularly much simpler. You can also add a floating shelf to store spices and such, keeping your counter space free.
Store appliances you don't use every day in a cupboard. If you don’t toast bread every day, you can store your toaster to free up counter space.
Clear as you cook. Keeping a clean kitchen is easiest when you don’t let a mess build up. When cooking, make sure to clean and clear your ingredients, pots, pans, and utensils when you’re done with these items.
Put your spices and ingredients back where these items belong when you finish. If you use a bowl to mix something, clean it or throw it in the dishwasher as soon as you can.
Do your dishes right after your meal. Whatever you didn’t get to before you finished cooking should be taken care of right after your meal. It will take you less time and keep you more organized than if you wait until there’s a huge pile of dishes.

, Go through your cabinets and drawers and throw out anything you don’t use.


If you have six spatulas and you only ever use three, get rid of the other three.
Reach to the back of your cupboards and find the coffee mugs you haven’t used and toss those as well. The more mugs, cups, and utensils you have, the easier it is to let dishes pile up.
Go through your Tupperware and any older appliances. Check to make sure that every component is there. If something is missing a piece or part, get rid of it. Throw out grimy Tupperware and appliances you never use.
Clean out any miscellaneous items you have like ketchup packets, powders, and plastic silverware.

, Similar items should go near each other for the best organization.


Mugs and glasses should be near each other. Plates and bowls together. And Silverware near cooking utensils.
Store items close to where you use these items. It’s a good idea to keep your plates and glasses close to your sink and dishwasher area. Doing this helps you to stay on top of cleaning.
Store your lids for your Tupperware in one large container and stack your Tupperware bowls inside one another next to it.

, Go through your fridge and pantry and take everything out. Throw away any food that is stale or gone bad.


Before you put anything back in, give both areas a good wipe down with disinfectant and water. You want to clean off any stains and bacteria.
Store like food items together strategically. In your pantry, put all the cereals together. Put the snacks in another area. See if you can have a healthy area and a snack area. Or, separate items by meal. Put your breakfast stuff at the top, lunch in the middle, and dinner at the bottom.
In your fridge, put your milk and other perishable liquids in the actual fridge, not the door. The opening of the door can cause liquids to splash around, sometimes leaking out. And the warm air can get to your items easier. Store food of like colors together. And keep your meats on the bottom shelf. Meats will sometimes leak juices. Place meat on the bottom so nothing leaks on anything else.

, Now it’s time to clean your cleared off surfaces, stovetop, and the floor. Dust first and wipe off every surface, then sweep, vacuum, and mop.


Dusting with a dust rag or dust wipes will pick up most of the dust from your surfaces but also cause some to flutter down to the floor. Don’t forget the tops of your cabinets.
Sweep next to remove any fallen dust and get the dirt off the floor. Make sure to get every corner and under all your appliances like your fridge, dishwasher, and oven.
Once you’ve swept away the cobwebs, vacuum to pick up anything else, and then mop the area to really clean it. You should also wipe down your sink and cabinets.

, Your kitchen gets a lot of traffic. Spending five minutes each day will keep it clean and organized.


Wipe down the stove top after you cook on it to keep grime from building up.
Don’t go to bed with any dishes in the sink.
Check your expiration dates every day. Before turning in for the night, do a once over in your fridge to make sure you don’t have any spoiled food. This keeps your fridge uncluttered and clean.

Make sure you can use soap and water.,
Opt for a gentle cleaning rag or sponge.,
Remove dirt and debris.,
Wipe down your counter.,
Use a toothbrush to get into hard to reach areas.",How to Clean Countertops1," Most countertops can be cleaned with warm water and soap. Make sure your countertop is made of the right material, however. The following countertops can be cleaned with mild dish soap and water:Granite
Laminate
Corian
Concrete
Marble;
, After making sure dish soap and water are appropriate for your counter type, select your cleaning pad. To minimize damage such as scratches, opt for a gentle rag or sponge. Opt for a non-abrasive rag or sponge. Do not use things like scrub pads, as these can scratch a countertop., If there are crumbs scattered on your countertop, remove them with a paper towel before cleaning your countertop with soap and water. Wipe them off the counter and into your hand or a piece of paper towel. Discard the crumbs in the garbage.

, Mix a small amount of liquid dish soap with warm water. Douse your sponge or rag in the soap. Wring it out slightly and gently wipe down the countertop to leave it looking clean and shiny.

, If there are hard to reach areas, such as edges or areas between the sink and counter, target these with a soft-bristle toothbrush. Scrub the soap and water mixture in here to clean dirt, debris, and other buildup from cracks and crevices in your kitchen.Make sure the toothbrush is soft-bristled. This will prevent the counter from becoming scratched.

Use glass cleaner or ammonia occasionally on quartz.,
Opt for multi-purpose cleaner with tile.,
Apply mineral oil to soapstone on occasion.",How to Clean Countertops2," Quartz is typically cleaned with slightly harsher cleaners. Glass cleaner or ammonia should be used periodically to restore shine or to clean a very dirty countertop. For daily cleaners, opt for dish soap and water applied with a microfiber cloth.Avoid using ammonia if you clean other parts of your kitchen with vinegar. This can cause an adverse chemical reaction.

, Tile should be cleaned with multi-purpose cleaners. These leave behind less residue, and residue found in the cracks of tiles can potentially cause harm. As tiles can stain easily, test your cleaner in an inconspicuous spot before applying it to your full counter to make sure there's no adverse reaction. After making sure the cleaner is safe for your tile, you can spritz it on and wipe down the counter with a paper towel or soft rag., Soapstone counters can benefit from an occasional cleaning with mineral oil. As soapstone starts to lose its shine, wipe it down with mineral oil. For regular cleaning, however, use dish soap and water."

Comply with local laws.,
Exercise proper safety precautions.,
Isolate the area in which you’ll be cleaning asbestos.,
Consider hiring an asbestos professional.",How to Clean Asbestos1," Different nations have different laws governing how and if you can clean asbestos. For instance, the United States allows individuals to clean asbestos-contaminated materials from the interior but not the exterior of their homes. When cleaning asbestos from public places or other buildings, you might need to be a certified asbestos professional. Check with your local or national environmental department before undertaking an asbestos-cleaning project.You can find these laws by contacting your local environmental department or agency.;
, When cleaning asbestos, a single disposable paper dust mask is not enough. Instead, use a full or half face-piece, negative pressure, air-purifying respirator with replaceable high-efficiency filters. Alternately, use a half or full facepiece powered air purifying respirator with replaceable high-efficiency filters.Additionally, wear disposable rubber gloves and a disposable coverall.
Cover your eyes with safety goggles.
Wear rubber boots.Do not handle asbestos-containing materials with your bare hands.

, Before cleaning asbestos, let others know you’ll be doing so. This will prevent them from coming into contact with asbestos. If you’re in a high-traffic area or a public space, ensure you block the area off using safety tape or by some other means (“Do not enter” signs, for instance) to prevent others from wandering into the area you’re cleaning.If you’re cleaning asbestos outside, let neighbors know what you’ll be doing. Advise them to close their doors and windows., If you are not an asbestos professional or if you do not feel confident enough to navigate the system of laws governing asbestos cleaning procedures in your jurisdiction, you might want to get a professional to clean asbestos for you. This ensure that you stay out of harm’s way, and that someone with experience will effectively clean asbestos for you.Before hiring an asbestos professional, contact the local agency that governs worker safety, your local environmental department or agency, and your local business bureau. Ask if the contractor has any safety violations or legal actions against them. If the individual or firm in question has any violations or pending legal actions against them, seek another contractor.
If you live in a location where asbestos contractors are required to obtain certification and training before cleaning asbestos, ask for proof of this training and certification before hiring them. If the contractor lacks proof of training and accreditation, seek another.

Wipe spills as soon as you notice them.,
Use baking soda or vinegar for limestone, slate, and soapstone.,
Target tile stains with a toothbrush.,
Check manufacturer's recommendations for silestone.",How to Clean Countertops3," In general, stain removers should not be used too often. Even mild stain removers can wear down a counter's surface. If you notice a spill, wipe it up with paper towel promptly. If there is any remaining mess, wipe the area down with water or a cleaner that works for your countertop. Avoid letting stains become set into the counter., A mixture of water and white vinegar can be spritzed on stains for limestone, slate, and soapstone. This should remove set in stains. You can also add enough water to baking soda to form a paste. Rub the paste into the stain until it lifts and then rinse the paste off with water., Bleach diluted with water can be worked into stains on a tile counter top using a toothbrush. Make sure to dilute the bleach to safe levels. The instructions on a container of bleach should tell you the ratios to use to dilute your bleach.If there is mildew in the cracks of tiles, however, opt for a mildew cleaner. You can buy this at most grocery or department stores.

, Silestone is particularly susceptible to damage. Store bought cleaners often wear down silestone, as will some cleaners made from household products. As specific types of silestone differ, check the manufacturer's label to see what is safe to use on your specific brand of silestone."
"
Use a wet cleaning method.,
Vacuum the asbestos.,
Steam clean affected carpets.",How to Clean Asbestos2," Wet cleaning asbestos involves mopping the floors and using damp rags to wipe down floors and other surfaces that have been contaminated with asbestos. When cleaning is complete, discard mop heads and rags used to clean asbestos along with the rest of your asbestos-contaminated materials.If working on roof, do not attempt to use wet cleaning methods if it creates a slipping hazard (for instance, if you’re cleaning asbestos from a roof that is angled steeply).

, Specialized devices known as HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) vacuums can substitute or accompany wet cleaning methods. HEPA vacuums work the same as regular vacuums. In other words, you can use the HEPA vacuum to clean asbestos by turning it on and running it across the surfaces affected by asbestos.Consult manufacturer directions before using the HEPA vacuum.
Take care when changing the filters and emptying HEPA vacuums. Doing so incorrectly could risk releasing asbestos materials. Before emptying the vacuum or changing the filter, move it to an isolated area and dress in the same protective gear you would when cleaning asbestos.

, If asbestos-contaminated material was released over a carpet, you might need to utilize a steam cleaner in conjunction with HEPA vacuums to take clean the asbestos. All steam cleaners are slightly different, but generally, they work the same way a vacuum does. In other words, plug the device in, then run it across the area of carpet you wish to clean.After you’re done steam cleaning, use the HEPA vacuum on the area you cleaned with the steam cleaner.

Place all asbestos-containing materials into waste disposal bags.,
Dispose of polyethylene sheeting.,
Wipe down all surfaces.,
Wipe down your equipment.,
Remove your protective gear.,
Locate an asbestos disposal facility.,
Drop your asbestos-contaminated materials off.",How to Clean Asbestos3," The bags should be double-wrapped (that is, place one sealed bag inside another before disposal). The bags should be approved for use with asbestos waste., Fold the polyethylene sheeting you used to protect the walls and floor. Once it’s folded up to a manageable size, roll it tightly. Fold again if necessary. Stuff the sheeting into a waste bag, seal it, then bag it again just as you did with the rest of the asbestos-containing debris., Using a damp cloth, wipe the floor, wall, counter, and other surfaces that may have come in contact with asbestos fibers. Do not use a vacuum or broom to clean asbestos. Doing so will only cause the fibers to scatter.If you’re cleaning asbestos from a roof, do not wipe down the surface of the roof if it creates a slipping hazard., Use a damp cloth to wipe down any tools you may have used to access or remove asbestos. Don’t re-use cleanup rags. When you use a rag to wipe something down, discard it., Take off your disposable gloves and coverall and put them in the bin with the asbestos you cleaned. Wash or wipe down any reusable gear like rubber boots and plastic protective eyewear. Leave your respirator on until everything is wiped down or enclosed appropriately in disposal bags., In most areas, you cannot just throw your asbestos-contaminated materials out in a rubbish skip or curbside bin. Instead, find an asbestos disposal facility nearby. To locate an asbestos disposal facility, contact your local environmental agency and ask for the location of such a facility.


Alternately, use the internet to search for one in your area. Just enter a word string like “asbestos disposal facility ” to identify locations you might be able to drop your asbestos-contaminated materials off., Once you’ve located a facility in your vicinity, contact them and find out when and how you can drop the materials off. Ask the facility personnel about their requirements when dropping off asbestos-contaminated materials.Some facilities have special labeling requirements for your bags.
You might also need to submit a form describing the nature and origins of the asbestos-contaminated material before the drop-off facility accepts it.
Transport the asbestos-contaminated material to the facility in a covered truck to prevent the accidental spillage of asbestos into the air.

Clean the litter box.",How to Use Vinegar for Household Cleaning," To make a versatile disinfectant with vinegar, simply mix equal parts white vinegar and water and store the mixture in a spray bottle. You can use this mixture to clean:Telephones, doorknobs, and other surfaces: spray on and wipe off
Mirrors and glass: spray on and wipe dry with a rubber squeegee blade
Freezer and refrigerator: soak a cloth with the solution and wipe the surface to clean and remove odors
Microwave: fill a small bowl with the solution and microwave on high for two minutes, then wipe down the inside of the microwave;
, This all-purpose cleaner recipe is more diluted than the disinfectant, but it’s still great for many cleaning jobs around the house. Just spray the cleaner on and wipe down things like counters, walls, toys, tables, blinds, and other surfaces. To make the cleaner, combine:3 cups (705 ml) of water
1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar
2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice
10 drops lemon essential oil

, A basic floor cleaner is more diluted than all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants. Make this cleaner as necessary when it’s time to clean the floors. This solution can also be used on counters, tiles, and for other minor cleaning needs around the house.


In a large bucket, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar and ½ gallon (1.9 L) of warm water.Soak a mop or sponge in the solution, wring out the excess, and wipe the floor.
Allow the floor to air dry.

, Mattresses are difficult to clean because they can’t go in the washing machine, can't be taken to the dry cleaner, and are too large and unwieldy to wash in the normal ways. But you can make an odor-killing disinfectant with vinegar:


In a spray bottle, combine 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar, ¼ cup (59 ml) of rubbing alcohol, and 10 drops of tea tree oil.Remove the sheets from the mattress and spray the solution over the entire mattress.
Let the mattress air dry throughout the day.

, Polishing tarnished metals with cleaner is a smelly job that requires care because commercial metal cleaners are strong chemical solutions. You can make your own polish for copper, pewter, and brass instead. To make and use this paste:Combine 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar, and enough flour to make a paste
Apply the paste to the tarnished metal with an old toothbrush or jewelry brush
Leave the paste on the metal for about 15 minutes
Rinse under warm water
Buff the metal with a dry microfiber cloth

, A vinegar-based stain remover can be used to remove stains and tough dirt from carpets, clothes, upholstery, drapes, and even dishware. Simply spray the cleaner on the affected surface, let it soak for two minutes, and then blot the area with a cloth.


To make a stain remover for fabrics, combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid laundry soap, and 1 cup (235 ml) of warm water in a spray bottle.To make a stain remover for hard surfaces, combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid dish soap, and 1 cup (235 ml) of warm water in a spray bottle.

, Vinegar and baking soda cleaning pastes are great for carpets, tough dirt, baked on grime, stovetop grease, getting crayon off walls, pet accidents, and other hard-to-clean messes. Just stir together 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vinegar and ¼ cup (55 g) of baking soda until they foam and become a paste.To use this cleaner, apply a small amount to the affected area. Rub in the paste with an old toothbrush or non-abrasive scrubber. Blot the area with a damp sponge to remove dirt and excess cleaner. For carpets, vacuum when dry.

, Showers, tubs, and sinks are prone to mineral deposits, mold, mildew, soap scum, and other household cleaning nightmares. But you can use these two simple ingredients, baking soda and vinegar, to keep these surfaces sparkling and clean. To do this:Saturate a cloth or sponge with pure vinegar
Sprinkle liberal amounts of baking soda on the sponge
Scrub showers, shower doors, bathroom and kitchen sinks, and tubs with the sponge
Re-soak the sponge and add more baking soda as necessary
Rinse with clean water

, Clogged and slow-running drains are never fun to deal with, and commercial drain cleaners are dangerous and corrosive. Instead, try baking soda and vinegar to unblock your drains next time you're facing a clog. All you have to do is:Fill the affected drain with 1 cup (220 g) of baking soda
Pour in 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar
Let the mixture bubble and foam for 30 minutes
Pour a kettleful of boiling water down the drain to flush it out

, The acid in vinegar makes it perfect for dissolving the mineral deposits and other clogs that can block up shower heads, coffee makers, and even filters. To use vinegar in this way:Showerheads: Fill a plastic bag with vinegar. Wrap the bag around the showerhead and use an elastic to hold it in place, so the showerhead is soaking in vinegar. Let it soak overnight. In the morning, remove the bag and rinse the showerhead with water.
Coffee maker: Fill the coffee maker’s water reservoir with vinegar and run the machine through a brew cycle. Dump out the vinegar. Run the machine again with just plain water to rinse it out.
Humidifier filters: Remove the filter from the humidifier. Fill a large shallow pan with vinegar and submerge the filter. Let the filter soak for one to two hours, or until the deposits and clogs dissolve or come loose.

, Sticker residue can seem nearly impossible to remove from certain surfaces, especially if the sticker was there for a long time. To remove a sticker with vinegar, peel off as much of the sticker as you can with your fingers. Then, apply vinegar to the area with a paint brush or sponge. Let the vinegar soak for 10 minutes, and then scrape the residue with a plastic scraper., You can increase the cleaning and washing power of your dishwasher and washing machine by adding vinegar to their regular cycles. Not only will you have cleaner dishes and clothes, but you'll also get the stain-removing and deodorizing benefits of vinegar.


For the dishwasher, add 2 cups (470 ml) of vinegar to the bottom of the dishwasher before starting the cycle.
For the washing machine, add 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar directly into the drum during the rinse cycle to help break down stains and soften clothes., Cutting boards can harbor bacteria and organisms that can make you and your family sick. To kill these and keep your cutting boards clean and disinfected, dampen a cloth with vinegar and wipe the cutting board after each use. Allow to air dry before using again., Mold and mildew can form easily in the bathroom and other areas that are often damp. To prevent mildew from growing on your shower, sink, and tub walls, wipe them down with a squeegee after each use and then spray the walls with plain vinegar.


To prevent mildew on the shower curtain, shake off excess water after a shower and then spray the curtain with vinegar., The toilet is another place in your house where dangerous bacteria can linger, so vinegar can come in handy here too. To clean and disinfect the toilet, pour 1 cup (235 ml) of straight vinegar into the toilet bowl and let it sit overnight. Scrub the bowl in the morning and flush to rinse it out.You can also spray straight vinegar on the toilet seat and around the outside of the bowl. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, and then wipe the surface with a damp cloth or rag.

, Litter boxes can stink and can harbor bacteria, so it’s important to keep them clean. Every time you change the litter, dump the old litter, rinse the pan, and fill the bottom with ½ inch (1.3 cm) of vinegar. Let the vinegar sit for about 15 minutes. Rinse out the pan with clean water.Let the litter pan air dry before filling it with fresh litter.

Brush your pets on a regular basis.,
Vacuum your rugs and carpets on a regular basis.,
Clean up after your pets as soon as possible.,
Purchase furniture that is tightly woven and/or has a smooth surface, like leather.,
Invest in a bed for your pets to give them a main location.",How to Clean a House with Pets," Veterinarians recommend brushing and grooming your pets regularly in order to reduce the amount of hair in the air and on the ground. Ideally, you'll want to brush your pets a few times a week. If the hair is on the brush, then it's not on the floor.


However, with every stroke, not all of the hair is guaranteed to end up on the brush. Some hair follicles will end up in the air or fall to the ground. Therefore, when brushing your pets, do it outside to minimize the impact it will have on the interior of your house.;
, No matter how many precautionary steps you take, pets will shed their hair and some of it will end up on your floor.


How often you vacuum will depend on the number of people and pets in your household. For every person and pet in the house, you should vacuum once a week. If it's just you and your pet, you should vacuum twice a week. If you have a 4 person family with 3 pets, you should vacuum every day.
You can minimize the number of locations that you have to vacuum by blocking pet access to certain rooms by closing doors or setting up pet barriers in doorways.
When cleaning hairs off of hardwood or tiled flooring, it may be more effective to use a broom or a dust-mop. In addition to being more effective, they have a lesser chance of causing damage to your floor than a vacuum.

, Never let a mess remain untouched, which will allow it to build up and become more difficult to clean up later. Furthermore, when you don't clean up a mess, your pets will interpret it as appropriate behavior and they will be encouraged to repeat.


When choosing a cleaner, avoid using industrial cleaners as they may be harmful to your pets. Choose a cleaner from a pet store, as cleaners offered in pet stores are often formulated to be safe for pets.
Never use ammonia-based cleaners when cleaning up after a pet. Ammonia has a scent that is similar to the scent of animal urine, which can send mixed signals to your pet and could potentially encourage them to make messes.

, Furniture of this sort will not only make it easier to clean pet hair, but will also mitigate damage against claws and scratching. With smooth surface furniture, you can simply squeegee the hair fibers right off.

, When a pet learns to enjoy their bed, the area around that bed becomes their space, and they are more likely to stay in that location. When properly trained, a pet will rest in their bed more often, which means less time spent on your furniture.

Purchase the right type of Deoxit for your application.,
Remove the case from your receiver or amplifier.,
Locate the potentiometers.,
Spray the Deoxit into the first pot.,
Rotate the knob attached to the pot repeatedly.,
Allow the Deoxit to dry.",How to Apply Deoxit," DeoxIT is manufactured in over a dozen varieties, so you should read carefully about the uses of each type before your purchase. For cleaning and lubricating potentiometers (""pots"") or contacts, the standard ""D5"" spray should be used. Other formulations are available for more specialized applications, though, such as cleaning gold or conductive plastics.;
, To access the pots, you will have to remove the case. This can usually be done by removing a few screws on the underside of the unit. Remove these screws carefully and set them aside. Slide the case away from the chassis of the receiver. To access the pots, you only need about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of room behind the faceplate.

, Just behind the knobs on the faceplate (the ones that control volume, tone, balance, et cetera) you will find the pots. The pots are small cylinders that are controlled through the knobs. Each pot should have a small rectangular hole that allows access to the internal components.

, Attach the long, straw-shaped nozzle to the can of Deoxit and place the tip of this nozzle into the hole in the pot. Spray a small amount of the cleaner into the hole and remove the nozzle.

, After spraying the cleaner into the first pot, turn the control back and forth repeatedly from its minimum position to its maximum position. This will spread the cleaner across the inside of the pot and help work loose any corrosion or dirt. Do this for about 2 minutes continuously. Repeat this process with each pot in sequence.

, After cleaning each pot, reattach the receiver's case. Allow the unit to sit for an hour so that the Deoxit dries sufficiently. Plug the unit in and test it. The knobs should now rotate smoothly and no distortion should be audible when rotating each control.

Use it in the bathroom beyond your mouth.,
Make an odor-eater in the kitchen.,
Turn it into a great laundry aid.,
Create an anti-fungus treatment.,
Use it as a low-cost skin treatment.",How to Use Mouthwash for Household Problems," With a white tissue dampened with a mint flavored mouthwash, you can remove smudges and dust from the screen of your monitor. As a screen cleaner, mouthwash is a bargain. Based on a price of just US$2 for 42 ounces - slightly less than 5 cents an ounce - it costs less than a penny to clean your computer screen. Just an important note - this trick works best on glass screens and is not recommended for computer monitors that use an LCD.;
, The plaque-busting ingredients in mouthwash effectively clean toilet bowls and kill bathroom germs. Pour two ounces of mouthwash into the toilet bowl and let the liquid sit for 30 minutes. Follow up with a quick swish with a toilet brush and then flush., Working with garlic and onions can leave your hands with a strong odor long after the food has been cooked. To zap the scent, soak a cotton ball with mouthwash and apply it to your hands. This tip works best when you let the mouthwash dry before rinsing. Likewise, mouthwash or just plain alcohol can also banish underarm odor during a midday emergency.

, A cup of alcohol-based mouthwash is great for killing germs in the laundry, especially if you're washing very soiled items. Add to the regular cycle.

, A mixture of mouthwash and water (25 percent mouthwash and 75 percent water) can be sprayed onto plant leaves suffering from mildew and fungus. Use once a week. Meanwhile, mild cases of athlete's foot and toe fungus can be treated with mouthwash. Soak a cotton ball with (sugar free) mouthwash and apply it to the foot several times a day. The athlete's foot may disappear in days, but toe fungus will need professional medical counsel.

, The alcohol and bacteria-fighting ingredients contained in most sugar-free mouthwashes are great for freshening up your skin, according to Reader's Digest. Mouthwash is great at removing grime and residue from the face. Rinse with cold water.

Vacuum the ceiling.,
Use a duster.,
Wipe dirty areas with a dry microfiber cloth.,
Create a cleaning mixture.,
Spray the ceiling.,
Use a paint roller to roll over your ceiling.,
Pat the ceiling dry.,
Use an eraser to remove pencil marks.,
Try baking soda to remove stains.,
Apply trisodium phosphate (TSP) to soot stains.",How to Clean Ceilings," Simply take the vacuum and gently run it along the surface of the ceiling. Depending on the type of vacuum you have, you may be able to vacuum a substantial amount of debris before doing anything else.


Use a bristle-brush attachment or another attachment intended for easily-scratched surfaces.
Extend the telescoping shaft of your vacuum, if you have one.
Pay special attention to corners, where crown molding meets the ceiling, and areas around air vents.;
, Take your duster and dust back-and-forth across the entire surface of the ceiling. Make sure to get as much dust and debris off the ceiling as you can.


You may need to clean or dust your duster if the ceiling is exceptionally dirty. It might help if you vacuum the duster a couple of times while cleaning the ceiling.
A microfiber attachment on your duster will pick up more dust and is less likely to scratch your ceiling., If certain parts of your ceiling are exceptionally dirty, you may need to use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe them. Take your cloth and gently pat or wipe the area.


Avoid applying too much pressure so as not to rub dirt or dust into the ceiling.
Get a new cloth once the one you are using is dirty.
If you can't reach the ceiling, use a chair, ladder, or take a broom and fix your microfiber cloth to the end of it., While a variety of cleaning solutions will help clean your ceiling, you should create a specific solution that won’t damage paint, tiles, trim, and other surfaces. To create a cleaning solution:


Mix 1 cup of warm water, 1 teaspoon of non-abrasive dish liquid (like Dawn), and 2 tablespoons of white vinegar.
Pour the mixture into a spray bottle.
Shake the spray bottle vigorously., Take the spray bottle and spritz down the ceiling. Make sure to get somewhat complete coverage as you’ll be able to notice splotch marks on your ceiling if you don’t.


Avoid soaking the surface of the ceiling. If the solution starts to drip down, you’ve probably sprayed too much., Find a large paint roller, dampen it with water, and roll allover your ceiling. Do so in a systematic way so that you get complete coverage of the ceiling.


If you have a textured ceiling, try a dabbing motion instead of a wiping motion.
Make sure you remove all the vinegar and detergent solution that you sprayed on the ceiling., After you’ve used a roller on the ceiling, take a clean cloth and gently pat the ceiling dry. The cloth will absorb any residual water and cleaning solution.


Make sure the ceiling is clean before you dry it. If it is not, you may spread dirt and further dirty the ceiling.
If you have trouble reaching the ceiling, get a long-handled painting roller or fix your roller to the shaft of a broom., If you have pencil marks or similar marks on your ceiling, you may be able to use an eraser to remove them. Simply take the eraser and gently rub it against the marks on your ceiling.


An eraser will work best on pencil marks and may even work on crayon or pen marks.
Use a large eraser so you can more easily remove large stains., As with stains elsewhere, baking soda is very helpful in removing stains from ceilings. Create a paste and spread it over stains on the ceiling.


Combine 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water and mix thoroughly.
Allow the paste to sit on the stain for a few minutes.
Wipe the paste in a circular motion., Purchase TSP at a home improvement store and mix some with a small amount of water. This should create a thick paste. Use a painting brush to apply the paste to the stained area.


Only use as much as you need to cover the stain.
Follow the manufacturer’s directions printed on the TSP container.
Use goggles or other safety equipment.

Clean the window.",How to Remove Paint from Windows1," You will need a bucket of hot water mixed with dish soap, a clean cloth or sponge, a new safety razor blade and some glass cleaner.






As an alternative to the razor blade, you could use a mini paint scraper (for small jobs), a professional grade window scraper (for bigger jobs) or even a little fine-grade steel wool (for drips and splatters).;
, Use the sponge to wet the window with warm soapy water. The soap lubricates the window, preventing the glass from getting scratched.






If you need to protect a freshly painted windowsill, lay down a plastic tarp before applying the water and soap.
Make sure to reapply the soapy water whenever the window starts to dry out.

, Hold the razor blade at a 45 degree angle from the window pane (so it is closer to flat than vertical) and position it at the edge of the paint.






Holding the blade at this angle will help to prevent it from scratching the glass or from breaking., Using slow, smooth motions, start scraping the paint from the window. If the paint is wet enough, it should come away in a single sheet, rather than patchy flakes. After each stroke, clean the paint off the razor blade before starting again.






Always scrape in one direction only, lifting the blade from the glass at the end of the stroke. Scraping the blade backwards and forwards across the glass is more likely to cause scratching.
Pay attention to the sound the blade makes as it moves across the glass. If it makes a coarse or gritty sound, the blade may be dull or broken. Switch to using a newer, sharper razor blade instead.
You should test the blade out on an inconspicuous area of the glass first, to make sure it is working properly., Once all of the paint has been scraped away, spritz the window with some glass cleaner and use a clean, dry cloth to buff the windows clean.


Inspect the windows for any remaining paint. If you see any, repeat the process.

Start with some “elbow grease.” Before getting into expensive or potentially toxic cleaning products, try using these scrubbing techniques first.,
Use baking soda.,
Brush on some toothpaste.,
Use commercial paste cleaners.",How to Remove Hard Water Stains From Glass1,"


Use “magic” and “eraser” cleaning pads or other non-scratching scrubbing sponges to safely scrub your glass surfaces.Try to remove as much as you can by scrubbing with one of these moistened sponges.
Never use hard-bristled brushes or abrasive cleaning tools when cleaning glass to avoid scratching or etching the glass surface.
Scrubbing works best on smaller hard water deposits, newer stains, and those that are not firmly set in.;
, If you’re dealing with older stains or large areas of heavy hard water build-up, you will need more than just elbow grease. Baking soda is a very effective non-liquid home remedy that’s all-natural and probably already in your pantry. Baking soda is a base (alkaline), so it can be used to chemically counteract the effects of hard water mineral deposits.
Because it is a natural, biodegradable product, baking soda is considered to be a safe, environmentally-friendly alternative to harsh chemical cleaners.There are two schools of thought for using baking soda to clean: one camp claims that you can mix baking soda with vinegar to make an effective paste,while others claim that you should not use vinegar (an acid) and baking soda (a base) at the same time because they will cancel out each others' pH benefits.As a compromise, try applying some white vinegar to the stain first, waiting 30 minutes, and then applying baking soda before scrubbing and thoroughly rinsing away the stain.

, Many home cleaners use toothpaste as an alternative to baking soda.Apply some regular toothpaste to a moist towel and rub it over the stain using circular motions.
Wait a few minutes, and then rinse off the paste with equal parts water and vinegar to remove all residue.

, There are several commercial cleaning products for hard water stains that come in a paste formula.


The main benefit of using a paste over liquid cleaner is that the paste will not leave its own liquid streaks or water marks.
A downside to using paste products, though, is that they can leave behind a foggy haze if not buffed off of the glass. Be sure to follow all the label instructions to avoid this side effect.

Remove small paint splatters with chemical solvents.",How to Remove Paint from Windows2," If you are just trying to remove small drips or splatters of paint, a chemical solvent will work nicely. You will also need to use a chemical solvent if you are trying to remove paint from textured glass.


Rubbing alcohol works well for acrylic paint, while acetone-based solvents (such as nail polish remover) work for enamel paint. You can also use specialized paint strippers or thinners, which are available at most hardware stores.
Simply dip a clean cloth into the solution and use it to gently rub off the paint."

Get help from your hardware store.",How to Remove Hard Water Stains From Glass2," Combine salt and water and use the mixture to remove the mineral buildup. The salt acts as a scouring powder and can cut through the stain. Apply the mixture to the area and use a clean cloth to rub the stain in a circular motion. Rinse the glass thoroughly when finished to remove all salt water residue., Vinegar is an acid, which helps to loosen mineral deposits, and white vinegar is clear/colorless enough to not cause any staining. It’s also a natural liquid cleaner that isn’t toxic and won't potentially burn your eyes or lungs like other chemical cleaners.


Mix some lemon juice into the vinegar to increase the effectiveness and add a fresh lemon scent. Lemon juice (another an acid) has the same effect on minerals as vinegar.Put your vinegar and lemon juice in a spray bottle and slightly warm them in the microwave, for 20-40 seconds depending on your microwave. Warmed cleaner can be more effective at lifting stains than cold or room temperature cleaner. Just be sure to remove the spray bottle top so that it doesn’t explode in the microwave.Spray the vinegar solution on the glass and let it stand for about 2-3 minutes before wiping it clean with a dry, lint-free cloth or a paper towel.
To remove hard water stains from drinking glasses and other small glass items, fill a basin with a 50/50 solution of vinegar and water, and allow the items to soak in the solution for several hours before rinsing thoroughly.

, A rinsing agent, such as Jet-Dry, will help remove hard water stains from your dishes. Fill up the designated area in your dishwasher with the rinsing agent, add your usual dishwashing detergent, and run the dishwasher for clear and clean glasses., You can try super-charging your regular all-purpose window/glass cleaner with some ammonia in order to cut through hard water stains., If the above home remedies haven’t solved your stains, it’s time to bring out the big guns and go for specialized cleaning products with strong chemical and acid agents.


These types of commercial products are made for household use and are sold by several different companies under different names.
For the most part, they will contain an acid, such as sulfamic acid, as the active descaling ingredient.
Wear long sleeves, rubber gloves, and eye protection when working with acidic cleaners, and follow package directions carefully.These cleaners are safe to use on hard surfaces such as tile and glass, but should not be used on natural marble, stone, terrazzo, aluminum, or colored grout. They might stain these porous non-glass surfaces., If these commercial products still don’t give you the desired results, you can get even tougher products from your local hardware store. Be careful though, and be sure to follow all of the manufacturer’s instructions since these will be very powerful products."

You can try to remove the minerals in the water by attaching a filter to your water system.Water softeners can also be added to counteract hard water.

, Hard water should be removed regularly in order to prevent it from drying into stains.


Dry your shower doors after each use with a lint-free towel or with a squeegee to remove all water residue or streaks.Clean your glass every week or so to stay ahead of build-up.
Act quickly: the longer a stain sits, the harder it will be to remove, and it can even become permanently etched into the glass surface., You can also prevent hard water stains by sealing or protecting your glass surfaces.


For glass tables, be sure to use coasters under drinking glasses. They’ll intercept any drips and spills and keep them from leaving ring stains on the table.For shower doors, consider applying a wax-based protective coat once or twice a year.

In terms of cleaning solution, your best bets are water and dish soap, water and vinegar, or a professional window cleaner of your choice. The tools and equipment you'll need include:


Vinegar or a mineral deposit cleaner for stubborn stains
Scraper or razor for stickers, tape, paint, and sap
Vacuum
Sponge or lint-free cloth
Sharp rubber squeegee for drying
A few clean, lint-free rags or cloths
Large bucket;
, To clean a window so it has no streaks, it’s important to start by removing everything from the surface of the glass, including built-up dirt, bird droppings, stickers, tape, paint, sap, and other stubborn marks.


Stubborn stains and grime can be removed with white vinegar or a mineral deposit cleaner. Either spray the stains with vinegar and let it sit for five minutes before wiping, or clean the area with a sponge that’s wet with the mineral cleaner.
To remove tape, paint, and sticky messes, wet the area and use a scraper to remove the tape. Hold the scraper at a 45-degree angle to the glass, and press gently as you move forward underneath the tape., When you're cleaning your windows, your sponge can pick up dust and dirt from around the window and create streaks. To prevent this, you should vacuum or clean the sills, sashes, and frames before washing.


For inside windows, use a small brush attachment and vacuum all around the windows.
For outside windows, use either a vacuum with a long hose attachment, a portable vacuum, or a pressure washer., Outdoor windows are frequently bombarded with dust, dirt, and debris from the outside world. The best way to prevent that dirt from leaving streaks on your clean windows is by removing as much of it as possible before you start cleaning.Use a hose outfitted with a spray nozzle and spray all the outdoor windows to remove dirt, grime, and other buildup.

, You can use any cleaning solution you prefer, even for streak-free windows. The technique and tools you use are more important than the cleaner when you want your windows spotless and perfect. Use a clean bucket and mix together your desired window-cleaning solution, which could be:Equal parts white vinegar and water
1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid dishwashing liquid per gallon (3.8 L) of water
Professional window cleaning solution

, Dip your sponge or lint-free cloth into the bucket to saturate it with cleaning solution. Remove the sponge and squeeze it gently so it’s not dripping wet. Wipe the entire window pane with the sponge, applying gentle pressure to lay on an even coat of cleaner.


You can use any motion you like to clean the windows, such as circles, an up and down motion, or a back and forth zig zag.
Clean every inch of glass to ensure that no dirt or grime is left behind.Clean and fully dry one window at a time before moving on to the next.

, Once the window is coated with cleaning solution, use the rubber squeegee to wipe the water away. Start at the top of the window, working in horizontal swipes from one side of the window to the other. When you finish each stroke, wipe the squeegee dry with a lint-free cloth.Overlap each stroke by about an inch (2.5 cm), and work your way down toward the bottom of the window until the entire surface is dry.
When you're wiping the window, make sure the squeegee stays in contact with the glass during each swipe.
It’s important to use a new squeegee with a sharp blade because removing all the water from the window is one of the keys to a streak-free clean., After you’ve cleaned and dried each window, use a dry cloth or towel to dry excess water that’s dripped or accumulated around the edges of the window, on the sill, or on the floor.Drying excess water won’t help with streaks, but it will prevent mold and water damage around your windows.

, A dry squeegee is another key to streak-free windows. If the squeegee is wet, it will leave water marks on the windows, and these will leave streaks when the water dries.


Wipe down your squeegee with a dry cloth between each stroke as you dry each window, and in between every window that you dry.

, When your water becomes so dirty that it’s no longer clean and clear, dump the water and replace it with fresh cleaning solution if you still have more windows to clean.Dirty water will leave dirt and dust deposits on the glass, and this will create streaks.

, When you're drying a window in horizontal swipes, it’s important that the squeegee blade stays in contact with the glass the entire time. If the blade comes off, it will leave water behind, and this will create streaks when the water dries.To make sure the blade keeps contact with the glass, apply gentle pressure to the squeegee as you swipe from one side of the window to the other.

, Avoid using any type of water that still has minerals and other elements in it, because these can leave streaks and marks on otherwise clean windows.When non-distilled water evaporates from the windows, it can leave behind traces of these elements and minerals that will stay on the glass and leave visible marks.

, Any cleaning solution that’s allowed to dry on the window before it’s properly wiped off will leave cleaning residue or water marks on the windows.


Do not interrupt your window cleaning when you're in the middle of cleaning or squeegeeing a window.
Once you start cleaning a window, work as quickly as possible to ensure the cleaner doesn’t have time to dry on the glass., When you use an absorbent cloth to rub a window dry, you just move dirt and moisture around on the glass rather than cleaning or drying it properly.


Glass isn't actually as smooth as it looks, and is actually pitted. So when you use a cloth to dry windows, you leave different quantities of moisture and cleaner on different parts of the glass, and this leads to streaks.Squeegees are the best way to dry windows for a streak-free clean because they don’t absorb moisture from one spot and deposit it elsewhere.

, Many people swear by newspaper for cleaning and drying windows, but this method is problematic, and is likely to leave streaks for two reasons:First, the newspaper moves dirt, moisture, and cleaning solution around just like an absorbent cloth would.
Second, the ink from the newspaper is liable to run and leave dark streaks all over the glass.

, Spray bottles deposit an inconsistent amount of cleaning solution on the windows, and there's no guarantee that you'll actually clean every inch of the glass. Glass that’s cleaned unevenly is likely to streak.


It’s much better to apply cleaning solution with a sponge or cloth that’s soaked in your cleaner, because this way you can apply an even layer of cleaner to the entire surface., One of the main causes of streaks on a window is the cleaning product itself. This happens when the cleaning product has time to dry on the window, which occurs if you don’t wipe it off quickly enough after cleaning.


On sunny days, your cleaning product will dry much faster, giving you less time to wipe it off, and increasing the chances that there will be streaks.
To prevent this, wait for a cloudy day to clean your windows., Wind is another factor that can dry your cleaning solution prematurely, and this will also lead to streaks on your window. Wait for a day that’s calm and with as little wind as possible.


Not only will the wind dry your cleaning product quickly, but it could also blow dirt and debris onto your freshly cleaned windows.

, Rain doesn’t just contain water, and is also full of minerals, pollutants, dirt, and other contaminants that could leave residues and streaks on your freshly cleaned windows. To avoid this, leave your window cleaning for a dry day.

, Windows should ideally be cleaned twice a year, but some seasons are better than others for this. Winter is really the only season when you should avoid window cleaning, simply because freezing temperatures, warm water, and wet windows can lead to cracked glass.


Fall is one of the best times to clean windows, but you may have to hold out for a dry and calm day.Late spring and early summer are also ideal for window cleaning, but you'll have to wait for a day that’s not too sunny or rainy.

Deciding where to install the rods is the first step to getting a great window dressing.You can install the rods on the wooden frame of the window using brackets.
You can install the rods underneath the wooden frame of the window by using tension rods pressed between the sides of the window frame.
You can also install the rods above the window by using brackets attached to the wall. You can make the rods extend a bit wider than the window to create the illusion of a bigger window.;
, To get curtains to look great on a bay window, it’s important to get an accurate measuring of the windows. Use a tape measure to find the length and width of the windows. Start by measuring the width of the window to know how long the rods should be. Then measure the length of the window to determine the minimum length for the curtains. Write down the measurements on paper so can easily access them when you need them.Where you plan to install the rods determines how you measure the width of the windows. If you’re planning on installing the rods on the window frame, measure the width of the top frame of the window. If you’re planning on installing tension rods underneath the top frame, measure the width from the inside of one side’s frame to the inside of the other side’s frame. If you plan to install the rods on the wall above the window, measure the width from where you want one bracket to be to where you’ll want the other. Try to have the rod extend the same amount outside each side of the window if you choose to install brackets on the wall.
Make sure the tape measure runs straight across when you take measurements to ensure you get the most accurate measurement.

, Curtain rods come in many different colors, sizes, and styles. Your window will have a different look depending on the type of rod you decide to install. Think about what look you are going for when you consider choosing the curtain rods.You can pick a rod similar in color to your walls or window frame to create a smooth, blended look.
Choosing a dark colored rod when you have a light colored window frame or walls will give you a bold contrast for an upscale look.
Thick rods can give a playful look, but for a more traditional feel choose a thinner rod around 1 inch in diameter. Rods thinner than 1 inch can sometimes look rather cheap and take away from the nice effect of a dressed window.

, Mount the rods above the window frame using a drill and screwdriver. A laser level helps ensure you are mounting the rod straight.Mark the location where you want to hang your mounting brackets with a pencil.
Drill a hole in the drywall where the brackets will be mounted.
Insert a plastic wall anchor into the hole. Use an anchor that is rated for at least 25 lbs.
Screw the mounting brackets into the wall anchor.
Hang the rod on the mounting brackets.

, Shades can add a look of elegance to a window and are also useful to block out the sun and summer heat. Consider what type of look you want in your window when choosing blinds or shades.


Plastic blinds can be an economical and practical choice.
Wooden plantation shutters give a look of elegance.
Bamboo or cloth blinds can provide a rustic look.

, Choose a color that matches or compliments the color scheme on the walls of the room. The window should be an accent point but you don’t want it to clash with the other colors in the room.

, Many blinds can become easily tangled or damaged with heavy use. If you plan to open your blinds daily and will be adjusting the light in your window using the blinds, make sure you pick blinds that are easy to open and maintain., Blinds and window shades come with mounting hardware when they are purchased. Most blinds are mounted inside the window frame. Use a screwdriver, drill, or hammer to mount the blinds according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Many fabric types can be used to create curtains. Consider how heavy the fabric is to allow it drape properly when hanging from a window.


Hold up a sample of fabric at least 2 yards long.
Crimp the fabric like an accordion and observe how it flows to the floor.
Heavy fabrics may fall flat while lighter fabrics can become overly flared when crimped.
Linen, silk, and, velvet are commonly used for curtains and produce a nice drape when hung.

, A piece of felt can be inserted between the inner and outer layer of the curtain fabric as a bump to provide body and fullness. A lining will also help your curtains maintain the temperature of your home.Have a piece of felt sewn between the front and back of the curtain to create a three layer curtain.
Lining will help prolong the life of your curtains and make them appear fuller.

, Curtains can be solid colors or decorative prints. Let your curtains provide an accent to your room to make the window dressing pop.Be aware that sunlight make make the colors of your curtains fade over time.
Neutral colors can blend with the decor of any room.
Avoid busy prints or your window may look overly gaudy.
Colors complimentary to your wall colors work well. Bring a sample of the wall paint color when choosing fabric colors for your curtains.

, Measure the height of your windows. Decide if you want the curtains to stop just below the window frame or extend to the floor. Curtains can be either length depending on the desired look for the window.Try hanging a sheet and folding it different lengths to test whether you want window or floor length curtains.
Make sure to buy extra length of fabric to account for seams and hems.

, Slide the curtains over the rods to hang them in front of the window. Add one curtain to either side of the hanging rod.


Bunch the curtains along the rod to give them a fuller look.
Tie a ribbon around the middle of the curtains to drape them partially open.

You may wish to remove your contacts before getting started (or wear safety glasses), because all the steel dust may irritate or injure your eyes.
You may wish to wear rubber gloves to protect your hands when using the steel wool. If not, be sure to wash your hands often as the grime will transfer to your hands and cause unsightly fingerprints on your clean windows.;
, You want to begin with a clear, empty window. Don’t worry too much about getting off the adhesive residue from the stickers., This will knock the dust loose from the screen. You may want to position a fan so that it blows out of the window, otherwise the breeze from outside may blow all that dust and pollen back into your home., Do this systematically: start with the outside of the top pane, then the inside of the top pane, then the outside of the bottom pane, and so on. Continue until the entire window is clean. Steel wool removes the grime without scratching the glass. It will take a bit of elbow grease to remove the grime, particularly on the outside of the window.Have plenty of steel wool on hand, and take new pieces often. The steel wool tends to fall apart after a while, creating more dust while cleaning less effectively.

, The steel wool will flake and cause a lot of dust. Keep a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush-head handy and vacuum each section, including the windowsills, right after you finish., You will need white vinegar, water, an empty spray bottle, and newspaper. It’s also a good idea to ventilate the area so the smell of vinegar does not become overwhelming.


Distilled water works best, as it contains the lowest amounts of contaminants and minerals.While steel wool removes dirt and grime from your windows, the vinegar removes grease and oils. Using both will leave you with sparkling, streak-free windows.

, Fill a spray bottle with this solution. Make sure the solution is mixed thoroughly.If you don’t like the smell of vinegar, you could add a few drops of essential oil to your solution to mask the smell.
If you don’t have vinegar on hand, you can use lemon juice in its place. Don’t dilute it, just use straight lemon juice in place of the vinegar and follow the same steps., Evenly coat the window, but don’t use too much. You don’t want a dripping, sloppy mess.

, Do this systematically: start at the top left corner and work your way to the right, then move down and work from the left to right again.Newspaper cleans glass better than paper towels, which leave streaky marks.
You may want to wear gloves, as the newsprint could stain your hands.

, If you missed any areas, scrub them with a bit of the damp newspaper. Don’t spray the solution directly onto the window, as you would likely have to clean the entire window again.

, This will help you catch any bits of dust or dirt left behind, and ensure your entire window area is clean. Enjoy your sparkling, streak-free windows!

If the magnet doesn’t react, your item is likely copper. Plated copper generally needs to be treated more gently than pure copper., Lacquer is frequently applied to copper to prevent tarnish. However, this can crack and cause copper to tarnish unevenly. Use a cloth to dab a little white vinegar and baking soda on an out-of-sight place on the metal. Metal that brightens is lacquer-free., Mineral deposits and debris are likely contributing to the tarnished appearance of your copper. Soak copper items in warm water with a small amount of gentle dish soap for about 10 minutes.

Large items can be boiled in this fashion in sections. It may be easiest to use a lacquer remover or acetone to remove lacquer from large items.
Copper will be quite hot after being boiled in baking soda. Use a pair of tongs, ladle, or spoon to remove copper from the water. Place it on a wooden cutting board or towel until cool., Combine a half cup (118 ml) white vinegar and 1 tbsp (15 ml) of salt in a mixing bowl. Mix together these ingredients with a spoon and add flour to it until all ingredients are evenly distributed and a thick paste is formed., Use a plastic spatula or a similar tool to apply the paste to the tarnished copper. Completely cover all tarnished areas with the paste. Allow the paste to remain on the copper for 10 minutes for light oxidation.


Heavier oxidation may require the paste to be left on for up to an hour. Use your best judgement., Use brisk motions when polishing. Detailed parts of the copper may not be accessible with a cloth. In these cases, use a cotton swab or a soft bristle brush., Rinse all surfaces of the copper under clean water. Dry the cleaned copper completely.Any water remaining on the surface of your copper will likely leave behind water marks. When dry, buff the copper with a clean, dry microfiber cloth.If, after removing the paste, oxidation remains, clean the copper in this fashion once again.

, Dampen a microfiber cloth with the olive oil. Apply the oil to the surface of your copper in a thin layer. The oil will form a protective barrier from the air, preventing oxidation., Fill a small container with 2 parts lemon juice and 1 part salt. Stir this mixture lightly with a spoon until the salt dissolves. Dip a rag into this mixture and apply it to the oxidized copper. This technique is especially useful for improving the shine of the copper.


If the lemon juice and salt mixture doesn't seem to work, substitute white vinegar in place of lemon juice and apply the solution in the same fashion described., Keep in mind that lacquer may crack over time and lead to uneven oxidation or tarnishing in your copper. Suitable copper lacquers can be purchased at your local hardware store. Some lacquers may only be intended for certain surfaces. Apply copper lacquers according to their directions for the best results.


Only apply lacquer to copper that’s been well cleaned and polished. Once the lacquer is applied, any remaining oxidation or dirtiness will be preserved under the lacquer.
Many copper lacquers have spray applicators. Spray an even layer of lacquer onto all copper surfaces. Be careful when drying lacquer; paper or fuzz may stick to the lacquer."

Clean and polish the remaining wheels in this fashion.",How to Clean Oxidized Aluminum Wheels," Chalk the wheels of your car with a piece of wood to ensure it does not roll while you’re cleaning. Park out of the sun to prevent cleaners from drying too fast, which can decrease their deoxidizing power and cause spotting., If you are unsure whether your aluminum wheels are coated or uncoated, apply a small amount of polish to an out-of-sight spot on the wheel with a clean, microfiber cloth or a polishing pad. Oxidized aluminum will wipe off black. If there is no black residue, your wheels are likely coated.Coated wheels should be cleaned similarly to bare aluminum, but only with a clear coat cleaner, like Griot’s Garage Wheel Cleaner or Pinnacle Clear Coat Safe Wheel Cleaner., Clean and polish wheels one at a time. Remove as much buildup, dirt, and brake dust as you can from your tires with a powerful stream of water. Rinse all parts of the wheel and the wheel well thoroughly.


Only clean oxidation from your wheels before washing your car. It’s likely that while cleaning your wheels dirtiness will spread to your car.
Dirt and brake dust have a tendency to build up around or between spokes, brake calipers, and even behind the wheel. Rinse these areas carefully.
A Fireman’s Nozzle can improve the stream of normal hoses, though power washers will be most effective at rinsing wheels., Acidic cleaners may cause spots to form on aluminum wheels. Spray the wheel you have just rinsed with aluminum cleaner. Be sure to cover all areas of the wheel with cleaner thoroughly.


Many kinds of aluminum cleaner and polish are skin and eye irritants. Wear rubber gloves and protective eyewear while cleaning and polishing.Two common, non-acidic aluminum wheel cleaners include SONAX Wheel Cleaner Full Effect and Detailer’s Pro Series Wheel Cleaner.
Certain cleaners may require a special procedure to be effective. Always follow the label directions on the cleaner for best results., Only use a soft bristle brush on your wheels, no matter how dirty they are. Use the brush to work the soap on the wheel into a lather. After cleaning the front, clean the inner parts of the wheel by reaching through the spokes.Stiff bristle brushes can create scratches or clouding in the surface of your wheels. These marks may be difficult to polish away.
The contours and inner parts of lug nuts collect corrosive brake dust. Use a small, soft bristle, detailing brush or lug nut brush to clean around the nuts and inside their holes.
Keep the wheel wet while brushing it. The presence of water will help prevent scratches. Additionally, cleaner that dries on the wheel will likely result in a spotted finish., The area of the frame surrounding the tire is the wheel or fender well. Re-wet this area if necessary. Apply all-purpose car exterior cleaner to a stiff bristle brush. Firmly scrub out the wheel well completely.


Because the buildup on wheel wells is usually stubborn, this part of the car is designed to be sturdy and resilient. Scrub the wheel well vigorously.
Keep your brushes separate. Do not use your stiff well brush on your wheels, nor should you use your soft wheel brush on the wells.
Keep the wheel wet while brushing it. The presence of water will help prevent scratches and a spotted finish., Use your hose or power washer to completely clean soap from all areas of the wheel. Start with the wheel well, as this area will likely splash grime on your wheel while rinsing. Pay close attention to spokes and lug nuts. Flush soap from lug nut holes., Allowing your wheels to air dry will likely result in spots. To protect the finish of your wheels, only use a soft microfiber cloth. Keep wheel-drying cloths separate from others to prevent corrosive brake dust from harming more delicate parts of your car.


After you’ve finished cleaning all your car wheels, wash your wheel drying cloths separately from other laundry or car cleaning items., No matter how many times you scrub your wheel with cleaner, embedded particles will likely remain. Use cleaning clay after you’ve cleaned the wheel but before it has been polished or waxed. Though brands may vary, generally, to apply the clay:


Spray your wheel with a clay lubricant. This may have come with your clay, or it may need to be bought separately.
Shape about a quarter of the clay into a patty with your fingers. With moderate-light pressure, rub the clay over the wheel’s surfaces. Take care to apply the clay to difficult to reach places and black spots.
Fold the clay as it becomes dirty so that you continue to remove embedded particles with clean parts of the clay.
Use clay lubricant and a clean, soft microfiber cloth to wipe away clay when the entire wheel has been cleaned., Coated aluminum wheels should not have much (or any) oxidation or pitting. Only use a clear coat safe polish, like Meguiars Ultimate Polish, on clean, dry, clear coated aluminum.Always follow the directions on the polish, but generally, to polish coated wheels:


Apply the polish one wheel at a time with a microfiber cloth.
Buff the wheel with a ball shaped power polisher polishing pad or a clean, soft microfiber cloth.
When the polish dries or is mostly gone, use a fresh, soft microfiber cloth to wipe the wheel., When your wheels are heavily oxidized, you’ll need to use an aluminum polish pre-cleaner. Spray on the cleaner and allow it to sit for about 10 minutes. Brush oxidized areas where necessary. Rinse and dry the wheel well before moving on.

, Wet the metal of the wheel with water. With your coarsest (lowest grit rating) sandpaper, buff the wheel. Rinse the wheel regularly and keep it wet throughout this process. As pitting diminishes, switch to a finer grit (higher rating) paper. When the pitting is all but gone, finish with your finest grit paper.


Depending on the amount of pitting or oxidation on your rims, you may need to replace your sandpaper several times while sanding. Severe pitting may require coarser sandpaper, like one that is 320-grit.
A power polisher will buff wheels more efficiently and quickly. If you have a power polisher, save yourself time and effort by skipping this step and administering wheel polish instead., Use an applicator, a soft, clean microfiber cloth, or a power polisher wool polishing pad to apply the polish to the wheel. Apply enough polisher for the entire wheel, or the amount directed in the instructions., Activate the polisher on a slow setting and spread the polish across the wheel’s surface. After the polish is well spread, little by little increase the polisher’s speed until it reaches 3000 RPM.


While polishing, keep the pad moving across the wheel. When the polish begins to dry or disappear, wipe the wheel surface with a clean microfiber towel.
This process can also be done by hand. Buff polish onto wheels with a polishing pad. Polishing by hand may require considerable time and effort.
Some polishes may have multiple stages, like those that have a general polish and a finishing polish. Apply secondary agents in the same fashion as normal polish, but use a clean pad., At this stage, your wheel should be looking like new. If, however, you aren’t yet happy with the condition of your wheel, repeat the polishing process. After each time polishing, wipe the wheel with a clean, soft microfiber cloth.For multi-stage polishes that use a fine or finishing polish, only re-polish the wheel with the finishing polish.
If you plan on re-polishing, be sure to use new pads and cloths. Dirty or gritty polish can retransfer to your wheel or cause scratches., Now that your wheel is cleaned and polished, repeat this process on your remaining wheels. To prevent further oxidation, apply a wheel wax to the wheel according to its label directions.


Wheel wax can be bought at most auto and hardware stores, as well in the automotive section of many general retailers. An application of wax will prevent dirt and break dust from building up."

Rinse the aluminum surface.,
Wash thoroughly with soap and water.,
Deep clean the aluminum.",How to Clean Oxidized Aluminum1," Begin the process of cleaning oxidized aluminum by rinsing the aluminum to remove surface dust or debris. If you are cleaning an aluminum pot or pan, rinse the pan under a strong jet of water. If you are cleaning aluminum wheels or house siding, use a damp cloth to wipe the aluminum or a hose to it with water., If your aluminum looks clean after rinsing with water, move onto cleaning the aluminum with natural cleaners. If it is still looking dirty or there is debris caked up over the oxidation, wash the aluminum surface with hot water, soap, and a soft bristled brush or scratchy pad., To remove stubborn dirt or food buildup on your aluminum, use hot water and a flat edge to scrape buildup off of the surface. If you are cleaning an aluminum pot, place a few inches of water in the bottom, put the pot on the stove, and bring it to a boil for about five minutes. Then take the pot off the stove, wait for the water to cool slightly and use a flat-edge spatula to scrape off the buildup with the water still inside.If you are washing aluminum wheels or siding, soak a cloth in hot water and hold it against the buildup to loosen it, then use a flat spatula to scrape it off.

Use vinegar.,
Use lemon juice.,
Clean with cream of tartar.,
Cook something acidic.",How to Clean Oxidized Aluminum2," If you are cleaning an aluminum pot, fill the pot with water, then add 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) for every quart of water. Bring the water and vinegar to a boil and let the boil roll for 15 minutes, then pour out the liquid. You may have to do this process a few times to eliminate all oxidation.If you are cleaning a small aluminum object, bring water and vinegar to a boil inside a pot, then take the pot off the heat and drop the aluminum object inside. Let it soak for 15 minutes, then take it out and rinse it off.
If you are cleaning a large aluminum surface, soak a cloth in vinegar, then wipe it across the oxidation. Scrub with a soft bristled brush, then wipe away the vinegar and lifted oxidation with a damp cloth.
Don’t use abrasive materials like steel wool or sandpaper to scrub the surface of the aluminum. While this can scrape away oxidation, it also will scratch the surface of the aluminum and make oxidation harder to remove in the future.

, Do the same cleaning process as you did with vinegar, this time with lemon juice. If you are cleaning a small surface, you can also simply rub sliced lemon over the oxidized surface and wipe away. Dip the lemon slice in some salt to add abrasiveness if you are talking a particularly tough patch of oxidation.You can find small containers of lemon juice at most grocery stores, which is an easier alternative than individually juicing lemons.

, Use the same methods as you used with lemon and vinegar, this time using cream of tartar to clean off the oxidation. If you are cleaning a large area of oxidation, wet a cloth, apply a small amount of cream of tartar to it and rub the cloth over the surface. Then rub the cream of tartar away with a soft bristled brush., If you are cleaning out an aluminum pot of oxidation, you can simply cook something acidic in it such as tomato, sliced apple, sliced lemon or rhubarb. Place the pot on the stove, add one of these acidic foods and enough water to cover the oxidized areas. Bring the pot to a boil, then take it off the heat and pour everything out.Since the oxidation will come off of the pot, you should not eat the foods you are cooking.

Apply aluminum cleaners.,
Use a metal polishing paste.,
Apply wax after cleaning.",How to Clean Oxidized Aluminum3," There are many cleaners on the market specifically formulated to clean aluminum. After removing as much oxidation as you can by using the methods above, put on gloves and apply the commercial aluminum cleaner according to its packaging.Only use commercial cleaners that are aluminum specific. Many commercial cleaners that contain ammonia, trisodium phosphate and other chemicals that can be harmful to aluminum.

, Aside from making surface shiny, polishing pastes can also clean the surface of aluminum and take off oxidation. Purchase a metal polishing paste that can safely be used on aluminum and refer to its package to apply it to the oxidized area., Depending on what kind of aluminum object or surface you are cleaning, you may want to coat it with automotive wax after cleaning to help prevent oxidation in the future. Use wax on surfaces like car or bicycle wheels, house siding, or outdoor furniture, but don’t use it on aluminum pots or kitchenware."

Leave your old coins as they are.,
Have a coin expert inspect your old coins.,
Clean only worthless or filthy coins.",How to Clean Old Coins1," Although it may seem counterintuitive, the best course of action when dealing with dirty coins is simply to leave them as they are. If a coin is in good condition, with only a small amount of smudging or tarnish on the face or back, it will be worth more to a collector in this condition than if you clean it.Nearly all types of cleaning will substantially decrease the monetary value of your coins, especially if the face or back is damaged in the process.;
, If you’re not an expert yourself, but are wondering if your old coins may be worth any money, take them to an expert before cleaning. The expert will be able to advise you as to whether or not you should undertake cleaning the coins. If the coins are unique or valuable, the expert will likely advise you not to clean them.A numismatist—an expert on money and coins—will also be able to advise you as to the worth of your collection. The more valuable a coin is, the less reason you have to clean it.

, If you have coins that have little value and you are not planning to collect or sell to a collector, you may wish to clean these for purely aesthetic reasons. It’s also up to you whether or not to clean extremely dirty coins. If a coin is so blackened or tarnished that its face is all but invisible, you may decide to accept the risk and clean it.If you’re in doubt as to whether a coin has any value, should be cleaned, or is worth keeping in a coin collection, always take the coin to an expert before you try to clean it. It would be a shame to find out that you’ve cut the value of a rare coin in half by cleaning it.

"

Never clean coins with abrasives or acids.,
Clean old coins with water.,
Clean old coins in a weak soap solution.",How to Clean Old Coins2," Although abrasive products are often advertised on TV or in stores as effective for cleaning coins, this is not the case. Acidic cleaners remove some of the material of the coin’s surface during the process of cleaning it. Although this will make the coin look cleaner and improve its shine, the coin will be damaged and its value diminished.Similarly, you should never scrub or scrape coins in order to remove tarnish or blackness. Products like steel wool or wire brushes will irreversibly damage your coins and remove their value.

, To clean your coins without risking damage to the surface and a reduction of value, you should use only water. Grasp a coin by the edges, and hold it under a gentle stream of lukewarm distilled water. Flip the coin over so that the reverse side is also wet. Then, gently pat the coin dry with a soft cotton towel. This will remove some superficial dirt without scratching the coin.If you live in a city, the tap water will be treated with chlorine. This chemical will discolor the face of your coin. To avoid this, either purchase distilled water from your supermarket, or clean coins under water from a purifier.

, If the distilled water was too weak to effectively clean the surface of a dirty or encrusted coin, the only other non-damaging option is to use a weak soap solution. Pour a small amount of a weak liquid soap into a large bowl, and then fill the bowl with tepid distilled water. Grasp your coin by the edges, and swirl it around in the soap solution. Then rinse the coin under distilled water and pat dry with a clean cloth.Do not use dish detergent to clean your coins; it’s too powerful and abrasive. Instead, use a weak, gentle soap, such as hand soap.

Scrub old pennies with ketchup.,
Clean old silver coins with baking soda.,
Clean old coins with vinegar.",How to Clean Old Coins3," To clean a copper penny, squeeze out a small amount of tomato ketchup onto the face and back of the coin. While you’re grasping the coin firmly by its edges, use a clean toothbrush to lightly scrub the flat surfaces of the coin.The salt and vinegar in the ketchup will remove tarnish from the penny. Then rinse the coin clean under distilled water and pat dry with a clean cloth.This practice works best on pennies produced before 1982. Pre-1982 pennies were made using real copper, whereas post-1982 pennies contain zinc, which will not be cleaned with ketchup.
Be aware that ketchup is mildly acidic, and so may end up reducing the penny’s value.

, Begin by running the coin under distilled water. Then, hold the coin firmly by its edges. Using your fingers or a clean toothbrush, apply a small amount of baking soda to the face and back of your coin and lightly rub. The baking soda will remove black and tarnish from the surfaces of the coin.Rinse the coin under distilled water again, and pat dry with a clean cloth.


This process will be most effective on older silver coins. It may be less effective on newer coins that contain less—or no—actual silver.

, White vinegar is a common cleaning agent which many people use to clean metals, including jewelry. To clean an old coin with vinegar, pour a cup of vinegar into a glass or bowl, and then gently set the coin at the bottom. Let the coin soak for a few minutes. Then grasp the coin by its edges, pull it out of the vinegar, and rinse it clean with distilled water.If the coin is still tarnished or dirty, try brushing it gently with a soft toothbrush. Be careful not to scratch the surface of the coin, however.
If the coin does not look cleaner after a few minutes, place it back in the vinegar for a few hours. Very dirty old coins can even be left soaking in vinegar overnight."

Simply mix a squirt of liquid dish detergent with some water until you have a bubbly cleaner. The soapy water won’t harm stainless steel surfaces or appliances.Commercial products such as Barkeeper’s Friend, Cerama Bryte, Sprayaway, and Weiman are also non-abrasive cleaners that work well on stainless steel.;
, Pick up the soapy water using the cloth. A sponge can be used instead as long as it isn’t an abrasive scrubber. Any abrasive scrubber can end up scratching the steel.

, Look closely at the stainless steel. You’ll notice that its particles form lines going in a certain direction. For example, your steel object will have lines going up and down or left and right. Move the cloth along those lines.When using soft cloths and soapy water, you aren’t likely to scratch the surface if you make a mistake, but it’s a good idea to always try to clean stainless steel along the grain.

, After soaping up the stainless steel, place the same cloth you used under the faucet. Run warm water over it to clear off the soap., Take the rinsed cloth and wipe it over the surface of the stainless steel to remove the soap. Remember to wipe along the grain.

, A nylon brush for dish cleaning is soft enough to avoid scratching the steel. Dip it into the soapy water.


If you are worried about the brush scratching the steel, you can try to apply the cleaner using a soft cloth, sponge, or non-scratch scouring pad such as a Scotch-Brite., Again, remember to take a close look at the surface of your stainless steel. If you can see the grain forming lines, scrub along those lines. This keeps the brush from scratching the steel., Place the appliance under warm running water if possible or use a soft cloth. The scrub brush will dislodge the grease, and the water will rinse away the grease and soap. Use the cloth to wipe along the grain and remove the soap., Use a clean, soft cloth and move it along the grain. Make sure you remove all the moisture so that the stainless steel doesn’t get a water stain.

Afterward, remove it from the heat and use a wooden spatula to pull up the food, which should have been loosened up. Repeat this until the pot is clean.Refrain from using steel wool or Brillo Pads to pick up caked on food, because they can scratch up the pot and make it harder to clean in the future.

, To remove oxidation, mix water and either vinegar or lemon juice in a pot. Turn on the heat and allow the mixture to cook for fifteen minutes after it hits a hard boil. Throw small aluminum cookware in the pot so that they can be treated as well. Repeat as necessary.


The mixture should be about two tablespoons of water or vinegar for every quart of water., Run warm water over the cookware to carefully remove any residue of the lemon juice or vinegar. Then wipe it down with a rag to dry it off."

Clean the surface with a soft bristle brush.,
Wipe it down with dishwashing detergent and a sponge.,
Scrub with a lemon.,
Use aluminum etching cleaner for hard to remove oxidation.,
Rinse the aluminum off with a clean sponge.",How to Clean Corroded Aluminum2," Clean off dirt with a soft bristle brush. Try to remove all dust and large particles with the brush., Apply water and dishwashing detergent to a sponge. Use moderate pressure when wiping down the surface. Sometimes, this will be sufficient to remove oxidation., If detergent did not remove the oxidation, try a lemon. Cut the lemon in half and place salt on the inside. Then rub the surface down with the inside of the lemon, so that the salt and acid of the lemon can remove aluminum oxide. Rub gently because the salt is abrasive.Alternatively, you can apply lemon juice and salt to a rag and use the rag to gently rub the aluminum.

, For hard to remove oxidation, apply aluminum etching cleaner to stainless steel wool, grade 0000 to 000. Put on gloves and rub problem spots with the cleaner. Rub as gently as possible to remove corrosion., Do not allow detergent, lemon, or other cleaners to dry on the surface. Use another wet sponge, without detergent, to wipe it down, removing the soap."

Watch for cracks in the paint.,
Remove paint chips.,
Use general purpose adhesive remover to de-wax the surface.,
Apply an epoxy paint.,
Apply sealant around hardware.",How to Clean Corroded Aluminum3," Paint prevents the formation of aluminum oxide, which can be unattractive, but prevents poultice corrosion. When the paint begins to crack on aluminum surfaces often exposed to water, poultice corrosion forms, eating away at the aluminum.Poultice corrosion will appear as either a white powder or a white goo.

, Where the paint has begun to crack, scrape off paint from that area. You can use a putty knife to get under the paint and lift it up.For larger areas, use 220-grit sandpaper to sand off the paint. Create a gradual transition along the edges between the painted area and the bare metal.

, Apply the adhesive remover to a rag. Use the rag to wipe down the area where you have scraped off the paint., Find an epoxy paint that closely matches the paint on the surrounding area. Use a brush to apply a couple of coats of paint, so that there is a thick layer. There is no need to apply primer to a small spot before painting it., Movable hardware like fasteners and spreaders often rip up surrounding paint when they move. Thus, new paint jobs around the area usually won’t last long. Instead, apply a low-adhesion polyurethane or polysulfide sealant around the hardware base. Seal up the entire circumference of the hardware base, so that no paint can seep down to the aluminium."

Use dish soap to clean delicate jewelry.,
Create the cleaning agent.,
Soak and wash the gold.,
Rinse the gold under warm tap water.",How to Clean Gold1," This method is the gentlest way to clean gold. If the gold is a very soft 18- or 24-karat gold, it may be scratched by other methods. However, the cleaning agents in the dish soap may loosen gemstones, diamonds, and other set stones.If you think a stone may be coming loose on your jewelry, take it to a jeweler to be reset. Otherwise it may fall out and get lost.;
, Pour about a tablespoon of dish soap into a dry glass bowl. Adding the soap before the water will help the dish soap mix in evenly. Next, fill the bowl with water. The water should be hot, but not so hot that you can’t touch it.


If you’re cleaning gold jewelry set with pearls, add a few drops of baby oil to the cleaning mixture. This will help protect the pearls from damage., Let the gold soak in the soapy water for about fifteen minutes before scrubbing it to loosen oils and grime. If you’re cleaning jewelry with pearls, stones, or settings, skip the soaking and immediately start cleaning the jewelry. Clean the gold by scrubbing it with a clean, soft bristled toothbrush. Take care not to scratch the surface.If you don’t want to use a toothbrush, you can also use an eyebrow brush or a brush made specifically for cleaning jewelry.
Use a new toothbrush when cleaning jewelry. Old toothbrushes may have toothpaste residue that will scratch the gold.

, Rinse the gold over a strainer or glass bowl to prevent it from washing down the drain. Alternatively, plug your sink to while rinsing to avoid losing jewelry. Rinse the jewelry thoroughly to remove all the detergent. Dried detergent residue can leave an unattractive film on gold.

Clean your sink with a copper cleaner every four to six weeks.,
Apply a copper protectant or wax to keep your copper shiny.,
Use a sink grid or mat when washing dishes.",How to Clean Copper Sinks2," If your copper sink is polished or finished and you want to maintain its shine, you should use a copper cleaner at least every six weeks.Apply the cleaner to a cloth, wipe all surfaces, then rinse and dry the sink. Check your copper cleaner’s instructions for more specific information about how to use it.


Copper is a living surface that develops a patina over time, but a copper cleaner can help slow the development of patina and preserve a polished look.Don’t use a copper cleaner on a vintage sink or if you want your sink to develop a patina., Using a copper protectant or wax after cleaning and drying your sink will also help preserve its bright, polished look. Depending on your product’s application method, spray it onto the sink or apply it with a cloth. Then use a microfiber towel to buff all of the sink’s surfaces.Apply a copper wax or protectant every six weeks or whenever water no longer beads on its surface.
Aside from products specially labelled for copper, you can also buff your sink with carnauba wax to preserve its brilliance., If your copper sink is hammered or has a patina, there’s no need to worry about dings or dents from washing dishes, pots, and pans. However, to preserve a polished sink’s shine, you’ll want to avoid direct contact between your sink and dishware. Place a sink grid or mat down when you wash dishware, and dry wares in a countertop drying rack."

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers.,
Avoid letting acidic foods or toothpaste sit in a copper sink.,
Avoid leaving pots and pans in your sink for too long.,
Dry your sink after each use to prevent hard water deposits.",How to Clean Copper Sinks3," The most important aspect of copper sink care is to steer clear of harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners or scrubbers. Don’t use bleach, lime or rust removers, or ammonia-based cleaners in or around your sink. Stay away from abrasive powdered cleaners like Comet.Never use scouring pads, steel wool, or any other hard scrubbing pad.

, Acidic foods and liquids are harmful to all copper surfaces. Don’t let things like tomato sauce or lemon juice sit in your sink, and keep the water running when dealing with any acidic items.Toothpaste can also discolor copper, so rinse away toothpaste residue after brushing if your bathroom sink is copper., Putting cookware away as soon as possible will keep any copper sink in the best condition, whether vintage or polished. Dirty pots and pans might contain acidic ingredients that can discolor both patina and polish.Pots and pans left to dry in the sink can shift positions and potentially leave a dent in a shiny copper surface.

, If you have hard water, it’s especially important to dry your sink every time you use it. Mineral deposits can be unsightly on both polished copper and surfaces with a patina.The most accurate ways to Determine if You Have Hard Water are to ask your water company or to use a home test kit. You can purchase a kit online or at a store that sells pools, or you can contact a water softener company and ask if they offer free tests.

Wipe down your galvanized steel with a damp rag.,
Scrub your steel with a brush and a detergent solution.,
Use a car wash or truck wash to clean your steel.,
Spray your steel with a low-pressure washer for larger areas.",How to Clean Galvanized Steel1," An initial cleaning with a rag dipped in fresh water will remove any dirt or streaks on your galvanized steel. Regular maintenance will reduce the amount of dirt and chemical buildup that forms on your steel over time and will make cleaning easier in the future.;
, Use a tablespoon (14.79 milliliters) of laundry detergent and mix it into a bucket of water. Make sure to do a thorough scrubbing over the surface of your steel and pay particular attention to problem areas where dirt or mud has built up. Use a nylon or plastic brush because other brushes can interact with the steel and alter its color.


Do not use harsh cleaners. A cleaner with a pH of more than 12 to 13 can begin to dissolve the zinc in your galvanized steel.Washing steel in this way may make areas that you clean look uneven compared to the areas that you don't.
Abrasive overwashing of your galvanized steel will reduce the steel's lifecycle and wear out the zinc coating. Scrub your galvanized steel sparingly.

, Truck and car washes are made to reduce the potential for corrosion, and will typically also be well-suited to clean your galvanized steel.Remember to rinse your steel thoroughly with cold water after using the cleaner.


Make sure to read the back of the car wash for directions and warnings.
You can pick up car wash at an automotive store, department store, or online.
Most contemporary cars use galvanized steel to prevent rusting., If you have a large area of galvanized steel to clean, like a roof or the siding on a building, using a pressure washer will save you time and effort. This is also a way to quickly rinse off any chemicals or cleaners you may have used to clean your steel.


Make sure that your pressure washer is lower than 1450 psi, or it may remove the coating on your steel."

Use this method to clean hardy 14-karat jewelry or gold coins.,
Create your cleaning mixture.,
Rub the paste on your gold.,
Rinse the gold.",How to Clean Gold2," This technique is not as gentle as using soap and water. However, the cleaning agents in the baking soda and the acid from the vinegar will quickly clear any grime from metal.


Avoid using this technique on jewelry with stones, pearls, or settings. The vinegar and baking soda may loosen the settings and damage the jewelry.

, Mix ¼ cup baking soda with 2 tablespoons of warm water in a glass bowl. Stir the mixture together to make a thick paste.If the mixture is too runny, sprinkle in some baking soda. If it’s too thick, add a few more drops of water.

, Use a sponge, soft cloth, or soft toothbrush to transfer the baking soda paste to the gold. Gently rub the mixture into the surface of the gold, taking care to reach all the nooks and crannies. However, be careful not to scratch the gold with the toothbrush.

, First, rinse the gold with vinegar. Any kind of white cooking vinegar will work. If you work over a sink, rinse the gold in a sieve or plug the sink to avoid losing the gold down the drain. Next, thoroughly rinse the gold with warm tap water to wash away the vinegar.


If you’re cleaning gold with gemstones, pearls, or settings, skip the vinegar and rinse the baking soda off with warm water."

Try using ammonia to clean large, grimy pieces of gold.,
Mix your cleaning solution.,
Soak the gold in the ammonia solution.,
Rinse the gold with warm water.",How to Clean Gold3," Ammonia is a very powerful cleaner and can remove the most stubborn greasy gunk from gold. This technique will also clean diamonds that are set into the gold.However, use this method sparingly. Ammonia can discolor and corrode metal over time.


Ammonia can damage almost all gemstones, pearls, and stones. Diamonds are the exception.

, Add six parts water and one part ammonia to a glass bowl or cup.For example, if you use six tablespoons of water, add one tablespoon of ammonia. Use enough liquid that the gold will be completely submerged in the bowl or cup.

, Let the gold soak for up to 60 seconds. If you let it soak too long, the ammonia may damage or discolor gold.If you see any hardened debris, gently wipe the gold with a soft cloth after removing it from the ammonia.


Handle the freshly cleaned gold with care to avoid scratching it.

, Use a sieve when rinsing the gold or plug up your sink. Otherwise, you may lose your gold down the drain. Make sure to thoroughly rinse away the ammonia. Any ammonia left on the surface of the metal will continue to corrode the metal.

Dry the clean gold.,
Inspect jewelry for loose gemstones.,
Clean any gemstones or pearls.",How to Clean Gold4," Let the gold air dry overnight in a secure spot.Alternatively, buff the clean gold dry for immediate use. Use a soft, dry polishing cloth, a fresh microfiber towel, or a scrap piece of cotton fabric. The softer the fabric, the less likely it is that the gold will be scratched.


If you let the gold air dry, store it in a spot that doesn’t see a lot of activity. Otherwise, the gold may be knocked off its perch and lost.
Buff air-dried gold with a soft towel to make it shine.

, Once the jewelry is clean and dry, carefully inspect any gemstones or settings. To do so, gently wiggle the stone with your finger. If anything has come loose, immediately take it to a jeweler for repair. Otherwise, the stone may fall out and get lost.


Place the jewelry in a plastic sealable bag while traveling to the jeweler. If the stone falls out, it will stay in the bag.

, Clean a pearl by buffing the surface with a soft cloth dotted with olive oil.Avoid using detergents on pearls as this can cause discoloration. Similarly, clean gemstones with a wet cotton cloth and buff them with a soft, dry cloth until they shine.


If your gemstones are especially dirty, see a professional jeweler. They may have to sand the gemstone to clean it properly.

Mix one part ammonia to ten parts fresh water in a bucket.,
Dip a durable nylon brush into the solution and wipe down your steel.,
Request the use of chemical passivating treatments.,
Rinse your steel with water and allow it to dry thoroughly.,
Avoid storing your steel in damp or poorly ventilated areas.",How to Clean Galvanized Steel2," You can purchase ammonia cleaning products at most major department stores. Mix the ammonia cleaner and the water into a bucket and use the solution to clean your galvanized steel.


Wear gloves or the ammonia can cause irritation and chemical burns on exposed skin.You can also use CLR, lime juice, Rust Dissolver, 10G or white vinegar as an alternative to ammonia to remove wet storage stains from your galvanized steel., Dip a nylon brush into the solution and scrub down your steel using a circular motion. Make sure to pay attention to problem areas.The white substance should start to come off as you clean.

, The steel manufacturer may be able to provide these treatments to you at a cost. Chemical passivating reduces the likelihood of wet storage spots or ""white rust"" from appearing on your steel. The process covers the steel with a thin layer of water-based chromate coating, which can further protect it from being affected by the environment.Spending the extra money passivating your steel may save you money in the long run because you won't have to pay for replacement steel., Use fresh water when rinsing your galvanized steel. Any chemicals that remain on its surface may corrode or destroy steel's coating over time.

, Improperly storing your steel can create wet storage stains on them.Instead of stacking your steel, make sure that you put it on an angle so it can properly drain if it gets wet. Accumulation of water over time can create zinc deposits that form on the top of your steel."

Scrape the initial paint off with a wooden or plastic scraper.,
Scrub new paint with a standard paint thinner.,
Wipe your steel with a non-alkaline stripper for hard paint.,
Rinse your paint remover thoroughly after washing.",How to Clean Galvanized Steel3," Do not use a metal scraping device to get paint off galvanized steel because it can easily scratch it and ruin its surface.Work your way around and remove the paint in large chunks, then concentrate on the smaller pieces next. Don't worry about getting it all, because you will be using a chemical process to eliminate the rest of the paint.


If the paint is fresh and wet, skip this step and go to step two in this method.
You can also use sandpaper or a wire brush to remove stuck on paint or rust from your galvanized steel. Be warned that this may cause discoloration, so if you need to maintain your steel aesthetically, these would not be good tools to use., If the paint is fresh, you can use a nylon brush and paint thinner to remove it from your galvanized steel.Add paint thinner to your galvanized metal with a rag and proceed to work it in with your nylon brush.

, Paint that has dried and has become hard is harder to remove. Luckily, many paints react poorly with the zinc found in galvanized steel and will peel and chip once dry, making it easier for you to clean.Apply your stripper with a rag and scrub it in with a nylon or plastic bristled brush.

, Any chemicals left over can change the hue of your steel in the future. Make sure to wash away any remaining residue by running your steel under fresh water.

Start with water.,
Use a non-abrasive sponge for light scrubbing.,
Try a vinegar solution for stubborn stains.",How to Clean Oil Rubbed Bronze Fixtures1," Wipe your oil rubbed bronze fixture with just water on a soft cloth. Often water is all that is needed to clean this type of finish.


Consider carefully before you use another cleaner besides water. Because of its changing color and quality, oil rubbed bronze needs as little cleaning as possible to maintain its shined finish and natural patina with age.
Try water first, and always test another cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area of your fixture.Dry the fixture immediately with a clean, dry cloth.;
, Dampen a soft sponge to remove hard water stains. Buff dry with a soft cloth.


Don’t use steel wool or very scratchy, abrasive sponges or cloths. Also avoid bleach-based or other harsh cleaners.
Observe your fixture after you have rubbed gently with a damp sponge and dried it. If spots reappear, repeat the process or consider a vinegar solution if the stains are very bad.

, Mix one part vinegar with one part water for use on more difficult marks on your bronze finish. Do this for any hard water deposits that just water won’t remove.Test the vinegar mixture on your fixture first by dipping a q-tip into it and applying it to the metal to determine what effect it will have before you use it on the entire surface.
Gently rub the vinegar mixture onto your fixture with a soft cloth, or soak a paper towel in the mixture and leave it on the fixture for about 15 minutes."
"
Blot water away when you see it.,
Use a high quality wax.,
Wipe down with oil.",How to Clean Oil Rubbed Bronze Fixtures2," Prevent hard water stains from forming by blotting your fixture dry whenever you see drops of water. Allowing water to evaporate on the surface is what leaves mineral deposits behind.Use just a dry cloth or towel to absorb any moisture, without rubbing or buffing.
Do this daily for faucets and other fixtures that are very frequently exposed to water.

, Apply a very thin layer of wax intended for metals to your fixture. Do this to help maintain the shine and protect against water stains.


Look for a high quality wax like Renaissance Wax, or another brand trusted for use on antique furniture.
Apply the wax using a soft cloth, ensuring to the best of your ability that no excess builds up in cracks or other areas of the fixture, leaving a residue.
Do this maintenance rarely, only when it appears your finish is wearing unusually thin from damage or overly abrasive cleaning.

, Use a very small amount of vegetable oil on your fixture every so often. Don’t use so much that it leaves a residue that will come off on your hands.Note that the oils from human hands on frequently-touched areas will naturally add shine and create a lighter coloring on the bronze over time.Do this maintenance only when it appears your finish is losing shine, either from excessive wear or overly abrasive cleaning.

"
Sand down your fixture to repaint.,
Use a spray finish.,
Try an aging solution.",How to Clean Oil Rubbed Bronze Fixtures3," Sand down the finish on your fixture if it has become severely damaged and you decide to repaint it. Starting with sanding will create an even surface, but isn’t always necessary depending on the fixture and damage.


Think carefully before you remove the existing oil rubbed finish on a fixture, as it is has been carefully treated and aged over time, which you cannot easily replicate with simple spray paint or aging materials.
Use a high-grit automotive sandpaper or steel wool to sand down the metal without unevenly scratching it., Try a spray paint that mimics an oil rubbed bronze finish. Use this method for a quick update to a fixture.Apply a thin coat of spray primer to your fixture after sanding and before painting. You may find that your oil rubbed bronze spray paint has primer already included, in which case you may skip this step.
Spray several thin coats of your spray paint on rather than one thicker coat to help it bind and cure better to the metal.
Remember to spray screws and any other related hardware with the same paint finish. You can insert a spare key into a doorknob you’re painting so that the paint doesn’t clog up the keyhole., Use an aging solution on brass to help achieve the same cured look created by oil rubbed bronze. Do this only for very damaged oil rubbed bronze fixtures.


First remove existing lacquer using a lacquer thinner and fine-grade steel wool.
Use an aging solution intended for bronze and brass. Don rubber gloves and safety glasses, as the chemical nature of these solutions can be damaging or harmful.
Soak your fixture in the solution as instructed by the specific product, then rinse in cool water to halt the chemical reaction. You can rub some mineral or vegetable oil on after drying to add shine."

Don’t get your watch wet.,
Don your watch after applying cosmetics.,
Add a coating to your watch.,
Clean with a damp cotton ball.",How to Clean Gold Plated Watches1," The best way to keep your gold-plated watch both attractive and functional is by protecting it from moisture. Gold is inert and won’t react with water, but the base metal beneath the plating might. Furthermore, watch movements are complex, and water can damage their delicate workings. This means that you should avoid wearing your watch while doing these things:Showering or bathing.
Washing dishes.
Swimming.
Walking in the rain.
Exercising.
Gardening.;
, Lotion, makeup, and hairspray can all gunk up the band and movement of a gold-plated watch even more efficiently than water. To keep your watch safe and clean, wait to put it on until a couple of minutes after your grooming is finished. Avoid applying perfume on your wrists when you’re wearing a watch, as well., Some jewelry stores sell a clear coating that you can use to protect your skin from your jewelry (or vice-versa). It’s usually a thin, clear liquid that you can brush on like nail polish. Apply it to the side of your watch that faces your wrist, and it should shield the metal from sweat or water, and you from any adverse reactions to the base metal beneath the gold plating., After you wear your watch, give it a very gentle cleaning with a barely moistened cotton ball or soft cotton cloth (like a t-shirt). Wet the cotton and rub it carefully over the band. Afterward, buff it with another cotton ball or cloth. Doing this every time you wear the watch should let you reduce the frequency of deeper cleanings.Be very careful not to wet the inside of the watch, as this could badly damage or even destroy it.

Spot clean with toothpaste.,
Clean grooves with a cotton bud.,
Purchase a jewelry cleaner.,
Use ammonia for difficult cases.,
Dry and shine the watch.",How to Clean Gold Plated Watches2," If it’s gentle enough for your teeth, toothpaste is gentle enough for metal, too. Any toothpaste with a traditional opaque (non-gel) formulation will work for this trick. This is best if there are noticeable dirty patches or smears on the watch.Place a dab of toothpaste onto a cotton ball or cleaning cloth, or even directly onto the dirty areas of the watch. Carefully rub the toothpaste over the spots, gently but firmly cleaning them.
Start with the inside of the wristband. Then move to the outside of the band and finally, being especially careful not to reach the fragile inside, the gold-plated area of the watch itself.
Finally, remove the toothpaste. Moisten a clean cloth or cotton ball and go over the watch, making sure to remove all the toothpaste. Any toothpaste left on the watch can cause corrosion, so make sure the watch is completely rinsed clean.

, Watches contain many small parts and, consequently, crannies that are tricky to clean. Make use of a cotton bud (or Q-tip) for these. The tip will reach inside grooves or other places that are hard to reach with a cloth or cotton ball.For this tactic, you can use just water, or toothpaste and then water.
The bud may start to turn gray. This is the dirt and grime coming off the watch, and means you're cleaning effectively.

, If you’re struggling to use toothpaste, it might be time to level up to an official jewelry cleaner. A good jeweler or watch store can recommend a safe and potent one available in your area. Choose a cleaner marked as safe for gold plate, and use it according to the package directions. These directions are pretty similar to the toothpaste method, usually—buff in, then remove with something soft., If your watch’s band is very dirty all over and you’re in a pinch, you can soak it in an ammonia solution. Mix one part ammonia to six parts water, and place only the band of the watch in it for no more than sixty seconds. After a minute, remove the watch, and immediately dry it off., Using a soft, fine cloth intended for jewelry, rub over the watch, paying special attention to spots where the gold is dull. After you’ve dried it once, you can rub another clean cloth over it to lend it a radiant shine. Now put your beautiful watch on, and wear it with pride!"

Hold the coin under warm water.,
Place the coins in a solution of dish soap and water.,
Brush the coins with a soft-bristled toothbrush or a paper towel.,
Dry off the coins with a towel.",How to Clean Coins1," Doing this will allow your faucet to remove initial dirt buildup. The faucet should be enough water pressure to get the job done, so avoid any add-on to increase the pressure, like a jet. You only need to hold the coin under the faucet for one or two minutes. Once you are done place them aside on a paper towel or rag.


All coins can be cleaned with water. However, copper coins react to more things than nickel or silver, and will therefore usually exhibit more environmental damage. This makes them harder to clean with just water.Make sure to plug the drain before cleaning coins in your sink to avoid a coin from slipping out of your hands and into the drain.
Handle each coin separately so the faucet can hit each coin directly.;
, Create a solution in a small bowl mixing water from your faucet and dish soap and dip each coin in the bath individually. Put the coin between your index finger and your thumb and softly rub dirt from the face of the coin. You should see the dirt begin to come off.


If you have a particularly dirty coin, you can allow it to soak in the solution.
A non-abrasive liquid solvent like distilled water and a weak soap will have enough cleaning power to clean your coins, and does not contain acids that can corrode them.

, Brush your coins while they are still in your soap and water solution. Keep brushing until the face of the coin turns shiny again. Rinse the coin often to avoid any visible scratches left over from loosened dirt. Doing this to valuable or antique coins can cause tiny scratches that reduce the value of the coin.When you are done scrubbing, make sure you do a final rinse of the coin.
Make sure to not rub the coin too hard. Concentrate on a small area and brush lightly.

, Dry off each coin with a towel and store them in a dry place. Make sure that each coin is free of moisture before you put them away to avoid eroding the coin over time. Your coins should now be shiny and have a good lustre.


Using a cotton free cloth won’t leave a residue.
Patting the coins will allow you to avoid creating micro-scratches with the material you are wiping it with.

Create a coin bath made of isopropyl alcohol and salt.,
Rinse the coins over your sink with distilled water.,
Dab the coins with a cloth and allow them to air dry.,
Store your coins in acid-free plastic folders at room temperature.",How to Clean Coins2," These chemicals are abrasive and acidic and will clean your coin of any built up dirt. To make your coin bath combine a cup of over-the-counter isopropyl alcohol and two tablespoons of table salt in a bowl. Mix the solution and place your coins in it. Let your coins soak for anywhere from two hours to a week, depending on how dirty your coins are.


Isopropyl alcohol is a universal solvent and will dissolve things that regular water cannot, like non-polar compounds.Isopropyl alcohol has a strong scent and is flammable. Make sure to open a window when you are soaking your coins.

, Tap water has chemicals like chlorine that will erode your coins over time. Rinsing them will distilled water after washing them will ensure that any leftover chemicals will be rinsed off.Distilled water is water that has had all contaminants filtered out.
You can buy distilled water at a supermarket.

, Turn them over and repeat the process. Avoid stacking your coins right after they are dry to ensure there's no remaining moisture. Allowing moisture on the coin can damage it over time.


Extreme temperatures can affect the patina of your coin. Avoid putting heated air on them while they dry.
If there is any cotton or dust left over from patting your coins, blow on the coin to remove it, not canned air.

, Common storage materials like paper, cardboard, and some plastics can damage a coin over time. Avoid any coin holders that contain polyvinyl chloride, or PVC as it contains chemicals that can hurt your coins.Coins can be damaged by extreme heat or cold, so it’s good to keep them in a room temperature area with low humidity.Don’t store your coins in a place where they can fall over, like a high, unsturdy shelf.
If you want to put your coins on display, use a two pocket container made of Mylar, a polyester made specifically to store coins.

Go to a professional.,
Apply a thin layer of Vaseline with a cotton swab.,
Put coins in an acetone bath for 5 seconds.,
Store your collectable coins in 2x2 hard plastic holders.",How to Clean Coins3," You should always consult with a professional coin grading service before you clean your collectable coins. Cleaning collectable coins can significantly reduce their value, and in fact, sometimes coin “toning” or the discoloration and patina caused by exposure to air can actually add to the coin’s overall value.For that reason, you shouldn’t be cleaning valuable or antique coins.


When you are handling antique coins, always hold them on the edge and not on the coin's face. Oils and fingerprints can hurt a coin's value.
There is standardised grading for coins, so even the smallest scratch from wiping one off can significantly reduce its value.

, Use a dedicated lint-free cloth and lightly dab the coin until the Vaseline is removed. This is a way to pick up any unwanted dirt or dust, without damaging the value of the coin. When doing this, be careful, and use a magnifying glass.


You can use a q-tip or a very soft non-synthetic brush to apply the Vaseline.
Do not put too much Vaseline on the coin. The trick is to put on the thinnest layer possible.

, Leaving any acetone on your coins can add a brownish haze to them and reduce their cost significantly.It's imperative that you immediately rinse your coins with distilled water and get all of the acetone off the coin before allowing it to air dry. Do not wipe or rub your antique coins. Because acetone is a solvent and not an acid, it will not affect the value of your coins unless they are exposed to it for a prolonged period.


Acetone is flammable. Wear powder-free gloves if you decide to use this chemical.
If you are using a jar of distilled water, line the bottom with a napkin so that your coins don't get scratched by hitting against the inside of the jar.
Use 100% acetone. Other products that contain acetone will also contain other chemicals that can destroy the value of your coin.

, You may store your 2x2 plastic holders in a binder to display all of your coins. Hard plastic is better because it is more sturdy and will prevent your coin from being damaged. The most important thing is that the containers are air-tight and that the coins will not be exposed to the environment around it.


Make sure that you remove any plastic that contains PVC plastic. Buy coin flips that use Mylar flips because PVC can damage the coins over time.
Keep your antique coins away from staples or other metal.
Do not use paper. It contains sulphur and can turn your coins black."

This will help break up the stain and make it easier to rinse off later., Dip a sponge in cool water, and blot the stains that you’ve spot cleaned. Using a sponge should help soak up the broken-down stains as well as the cleaner that you used. You might need to blot each stain a few times to ensure you get everything up., Once you’ve rinsed the stains on a memory foam pad by blotting, use a clean towel to blot those areas dry.

Fill a bowl with water.,
Scrub the rust with foil.,
Use a foil wad to work on pitted areas.,
Rinse and dry the area.,
Buff the chrome with a cloth.,
Apply a layer of baby oil.,
Rub the area with a cloth.",How to Clean Chrome and Remove Rust Without Expensive Cleaners," Clean the chrome first to remove dirt, marks, and grime, and to help expose any rust that may have formed. Fill a bucket with lukewarm water. Add five to 10 drops of liquid dish soap. Swish your hand in the water to work up some suds.To wash submersible items like small parts, pots, or pans, use your kitchen sink rather than a bucket.;
, Dip a sponge or microfiber cloth into the soapy water. Wring out some of the excess water so it doesn’t drip everywhere. Scrub the chrome with the soapy water, making sure you cover every inch of the metal. Dip the sponge back into the soapy water regularly to clean it off and make sure it stays saturated with the cleaning solution.To access hard-to-reach nooks and crannies, use a soft-bristled toothbrush dipped in the soapy water.
For the best results, clean the chrome weekly, or as soon as it starts to look dull.

, When the chrome has been cleaned to your satisfaction, dump your cleaning water. Rinse the bucket, and fill it with plain water. Rinse your sponge thoroughly under running water. Wring out some of the excess water, and go over the chrome again with the wet sponge to remove leftover cleaning solution.


For items that you're cleaning in the kitchen sink, simply rinse them under running water to remove excess cleaning solution.
For outdoor items like car and bike parts, rinse them with a garden hose.

, Sometimes you'll encounter stains or marks that didn’t come off with soap and water, and you can tackle these with a mildly acidic vinegar solution. In your bucket or sink, mix equal parts vinegar and water. Soak your sponge, wring it out, and go over the tough spots with the vinegar and water solution.When you're satisfied with the cleanliness of the chrome, rinse it again with plain water.

, With a clean microfiber cloth, towel dry the chrome. Chrome tends to show water spots, so you shouldn’t let it air dry.As you dry the chrome, check it for rust.


If you find any rust, you'll have to address it with a rust-cleaning method.

, Tear off a 3-inch (7.6 cm) strip of aluminum foil from the roll. Cut the strip into three equal pieces. Each one will be about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) in length. You will rub the chrome with the aluminum foil to remove rust.


Aluminum foil is ideal for cleaning chrome, because it’s a softer metal and won’t scratch the chrome.
Steel wool is not recommended for chrome, because it requires more effort, and can leave the chrome looking dull., Grab a small bowl from the kitchen and fill it with plain water. The water will act as a lubricant between the chrome and the aluminum foil, but it’s actually the chemical reaction between the two metals that removes the rust.It’s not necessary to use cola or vinegar as the lubricant to clean chrome.

, Dunk a piece of aluminum foil into the bowl of water to get it wet. Lightly rub the wet foil against the rusted chrome surface. You don’t need to press hard or use a lot of elbow grease, because only minor friction is needed to produce the aluminum oxide that will dissolve the rust.


As you rub, the rust will disappear and the surface of the chrome will become shiny and smooth.If you're working with a large area, switch to a new piece of foil after every 10 inches (25 cm) of area you cover.

, Chrome is susceptible to pitting, especially in areas where there has been rust. You can remove rust and smooth these areas with an aluminum foil wad. Tear off another 3-inch (7.6-cm) strip of foil. Crumple it into a loose ball. Wet the ball and gently rub any pitted areas with the foil.


As you rub the area with the foil, the edges on the foil ball will help to smooth out the pits in the surface of the metal, and remove rust in the process., Once all the rust has been removed, use a sponge or hose to rinse away any brown paste that’s formed when you scrubbed the rust. When all the paste and excess rust has been washed away, dry the area with a clean microfiber cloth.


Don’t let chrome air dry, as it’s likely to form water spots., Use a clean and dry microfiber cloth to rub the entire surface of the chrome. Apply gentle pressure and rub the metal in a circular motion. This will help to remove any leftover water, dirt, and rust, and help to buff the metal to a shine.You can also use an electric hand polisher with a clean and dry buffing pad to buff the chrome.

, Baby oil, which is actually mineral oil, makes a great polish for woods and metals. Not only will it smooth out the surface of the metal, but it will also help bring it to a beautiful shine. Squirt a few drops of baby oil over the surface of the chrome, spreading it out so there's a drop every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm).


You can also use car wax, Turtle Wax, or carnauba wax to polish and protect chrome., Use a clean and dry microfiber cloth to rub the baby oil into the surface of the chrome. Use a circular motion, and apply gentle pressure as you work. Once you’ve gone over the entire area, repeat with a clean cloth to remove any excess oil from the surface.As you rub the oil and polish the metal, the chrome will come to a bright, shiny, mirror finish.

, You may ask a friend to help you hold the measuring tape if it does not lock into place.

, You will be able to use these measurements to see what type of bed you have in the next step. Alternatively, you can measure a space in your house to see what size bed will fit comfortably in the room.

, Pull the tape out until it reaches the right edge of the bed. Write down this width measurement.

, Extend the tape till you get to the middle bottom of the bed. Write down this length measurement.

, Most twin beds are 39 inches (99 cm) wide, while a “narrow” twin is 36 inches (91 cm) wide. Standard length will be 75 inches (191 cm) long.


In the UK, a single bed is 36 inches (91 cm) wide.
An extra-long twin, like the beds in most dorm rooms, is 80 inches (203 cm) long. Look for sheet sets that say “x-long twin.”
This bed size is used for most standard bunk beds.

, It should also be 75 inches (191 cm) long. In England and occasionally in the US, this is referred to as a “double” bed.


While a twin bed fits one person, a full bed is best for one large person or two small children or adults.

, The length should be 80 inches (203 cm). If the length is 84 inches (213 cm), it is a California queen sized bed.


There is no equivalent to a queen sized bed in the UK. The next largest size is a king.
Another type of queen, called the “super,” or “expanded” queen is 66 inches (168 cm) wide and 80 inches (203 cm) long. The expanded is also thicker than the super or the standard queen.
Queen sized beds and larger are designed with enough room for two adults.

, If it is 76 inches (193 cm) wide and 80 inches (203 cm) long, it is a standard king. A UK king sized bed is much smaller at 60 inches (152 cm) wide and 78 inches (198 cm) long.

, A California king is 72 inches (183 cm) wide by 84 inches (213cm) long and a Grand king is 80 inches (203 cm) wide and 98 inches (249 cm) long. A super king bed in the UK is 72 inches (183 cm) wide and 78 inches (198 cm) long."

Reward yourself!",How to Clean Your Room," Before you start, put on an album or playlist that you love and that gets you pumped. Music with a faster beat will help ramp you up for your cleaning project. Stay away from more mellow, relaxing music and rap or modern rap. Choose music that motivates you rather than music that makes you tired or sad. Alternatively, you could listen to the radio.;
, Just be careful not to decide on something that may distract you from your cleaning! You can also make your room cold because when you're cold you have to start moving to create body heat so making your room cold will make you move around. Keep yourself away from blankets; they'll slow you down and impede your goal of successfully cleaning your room.


Listening to natural sounds such as waterfalls, campfires, oceans, rain, and wind can act as background noise that helps you focus on the task at hand.
Try not to waste too much time changing to different music or going from album to album. Setting your iPod to shuffle will help you get the job done faster.

, Open all of your curtains or blinds to let a lot of natural light in. Consider opening the windows to give yourself some fresh air. Letting lots of light into your room will keep your spirits up and give you energy.


If you're cleaning at night, turn on all of the lights. Turning on the lights will keep you from getting drowsy during your cleaning process.

, Though this step is optional, it's still a good idea! Checking them off as you go will give you an extra burst of motivation. You can also set specific time limits for each item. That way, cleaning your room will take less time.

, Taking a break to eat, drink, and kick up your heels is often a good idea. However, don’t let yourself become too distracted during your break! Plan out a chosen amount of time that you will take a break for. It is best to take a break after you have completed an entire task rather than in the middle of it. One example could be that you plan to take a break after you have cleaned out under your bed and before you start organizing the smaller things in your room.


Don't take a break if the time of your break comes around and you feel as though you're on a roll. Use that feeling of being on a roll to get even more done!

, Decide what you are going to do after you are done cleaning. Maybe you will go hang out with your friend, watch a movie with your family, or eat a big bowl of ice cream. Having a reward to motivate you will get you through the cleaning process quicker! However, you shouldn't make your reward so tempting that you speed through cleaning without doing a very thorough job.

, If you're having trouble motivating yourself to clean your room, make the process interesting by playing a game. See how many things you can put away during ten minutes. Try to beat your ""high score"". Give yourself a piece of candy or five minutes of break time as a reward. For some ideas, check out the list of games at the end of this article.


There are other options besides creating a game for yourself. If you like to act and can't seem to get motivated to clean your room, try making up a scene where your character is cleaning. You'll be surprised how fast you'll start focusing on your scene while still cleaning!

, You'll need to store extra things you don't need. Just don't throw those things out unless they're broken. You can donate them to Goodwill or a different charity organization instead.

, Making your bed will give you the sensational feeling of having accomplished something already. It will also give you a flat surface to fold clothes and take breaks on. Think of your bed as your island of clean in your ocean of mess. Move all the stuff that was on your bed into a pile in one section of your room. Strip your bed bare and flip your mattress over. Flipping over your mattress will increase its lifespan. It will also make you feel great when you sleep on the side that hasn't been used very much. Make your bed again with fresh sheets and blankets.


Take the extra time to really make your bed. Make sure the bottom of your sheet is tucked under your mattress. Make the blankets straight. Fluff the pillows. Throw your dirty sheets into your hamper or washing machine.

, Put everything that's on the floor away first. That way, you'll be able to get around your room without tripping over. The objects you put away don't have to be neat--simply put them where they belong. Start with the bigger things, like books and pillows, then move onto smaller things, like pencils and other stationary.


Remove the largest items first when attacking the pile. Just a few of them and you will see a big improvement. Continue with the next largest items until you are left with the little stuff like change and pencils.
Do not let yourself become distracted by items you are putting away. You might find a photo album you haven’t looked at in a long time, but don’t look at it while you’re cleaning. If you really, really want to look at it, make it a part of the reward you will give yourself after you have finished cleaning.

, Put things you use often where it is easy to get to them and things that you don't use often in more hard-to-reach spots. You're more likely to put things away when you're done if it's nearby and easy to get to. Also, don't create too many piles of things because later it will be tiring to try and look through everything to find stuff.

, Fold clean clothes and place them in your dresser or hang them up. Fold your clothes neatly and try not to wrinkle them.


Place a laundry bin just outside your room. Placing it in the hallway is best. Place any dirty clothes you find into the laundry bin. Don’t take your dirty laundry to the washer machine until you have finished cleaning your room (you never know where you might find another dirty sock that needs washing.)

, If there is sticky liquid in a cup or bowl, take it down immediately to avoid the risk of it spilling in the hallway.


If you find anything else that goes in another room, put in a separate box and take it away after you are done cleaning your room.

, Pull everything out from under your bed. You may be surprised to find just how much junk has accumulated there, much of which is probably stuff you thought you'd lost or may have forgotten about.


Separate it into piles: trash, stuff to giveaway to charities, things to sell to second hand stores, stuff to give to your siblings (if you have any) or friends, stuff that belongs elsewhere, and stuff that stays in your room. It's probably easier to make 2 piles first (what to keep and what to get rid of), and then sort the 'stuff to get rid of' pile into subcategories. Also, sort the trash pile into things you can recycle and things you can't. Also look under the rest of your furniture like your desk, dresser, end tables, nightstands or bookshelves.

, If you have any giant piles, sort them into subcategories (clothes, shoes, books etc) before you begin to put them away.


First, the trash. Put the items that can't be recycled in the bin, then the items that can into the recycling bin.
Now, sort the 'belongs elsewhere' pile. If the items belong somewhere in the same house, take them to their places one by one. If they belong in a different house, put them somewhere that you'll remember.
Next, the 'give to siblings / friends' pile. Immediately take the siblings items to them (if you live with them, if not, put them with the 'friends' pile). Put the 'friends' pile in another place you'll remember.
Gather all the stuff you want to give to charity and the stuff to sell in two separate bags.

, Start simply by separating different categories of things (clothes, shoes, books, etc.) and putting them in their place. Again, don’t organize those specific things yet or you'll lose momentum. For example, put all the books where they're supposed to be, like on your bookshelf, but don't get caught up in organizing the bookshelf just yet. Continue putting everything away — stuffed animals, photographs, purses, shoes, and so on — until your pile is gone.


Little tasks like this give you a sense of accomplishment. While it may be frustrating not to organize every single thing at first, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks will give you more motivation to finish the entire job.
If you find something that doesn't belong anywhere, consider giving it away, or make a place for it. A less cluttered room always feels really nice. If you need to continue using the object, ask your parents if they have room to store it elsewhere.

, Clean your closet by taking everything out of it and adding them to the piles you have already made for the things you found under your bed. Throw or give away items that you don’t need anymore. Once you have cleaned out your closet and decided what you are keeping, match all of your shoes and place them back in your closet, hang your clothes, and organize the stuff on the shelves in your closet (if you have shelves.)


If you find clothes that you have forgotten about, try them on. If they don’t fit, or you don’t like them anymore, put them in the ‘giveaway’ pile to make more room for clothes you do like.
Consider purchasing a shoe rack if you feel like you don’t have enough space for your shoes.

, Folding is the key. Folded clothes will open up more space in each drawer and will allow your drawers to close more easily. Organize your dresser so that each drawer contains a specific type of clothing laundry pile.


Again, try on any clothes you forgot about or think might not fit anymore. If you don’t like them, or they don’t fit, give them away or try to sell them at a second hand store.
The top drawers could contain underwear and socks, the next drawers could contain shirts, and the bottom drawers could contain pants and skirts.
Organize your dresser in a way that makes sense to you. If you are used to reaching in the bottom drawer to grab a pair of underwear, put all of your underwear in the drawer.

, Once you have your stuff separated into piles, you can start attacking each pile. Stick to attacking one pile at a time; you'll feel more satisfaction once you sort all your clothes, for example, and be motivated to continue cleaning.


Throw away the trash first. Get a large trash bag and place all of the trash you have collected into it. Don’t take it out until you are done cleaning your whole room, as it is very likely you will find more trash to throw away before you are done with the cleaning process.
Deal with the giveaways. Put everything you want to give away/give to your siblings in a bin and leave it right outside your room. You can keep adding to the bin as you clean, so don't get rid of everything just yet. However, it is helpful to minimize the mess in your room by moving everything outside. If you have clothes or things you would like to give to a specific person, consider placing a sticky note on the item to remind you who you want to give the item to.
Put away the things that you want to stay in your room. Fold any more clothes, put books on the bookshelf, toys in a toy bin, etc.

, Even those on the floor should look organized. Stack them by height, biggest on the bottom shortest on the top. Organize your bookshelf if you have one.


Make sure you make all your shelves look presentable. If you just chuck things on your shelf or desk, it will not look very tidy.
You can label each shelf and/or alphabetize your books. The organization system you use doesn't matter, as long as it looks tidy.

, Consider buying a desk organizer at your local office supply store. These desk organizers will help keep your pencils from running into your glue, which in turn will be kept separate from your scissors and markers.


Organize each drawer of your desk. Sort through any papers you may have in there and decide what you want to keep, and what you would like to recycle. Purchase some folders and organize your papers into the proper folder (you can even label your folders with things like ‘School Work’, ‘Drawings’, etc.)
If you don’t have folders, try stapling or paper-clipping paper together to keep them from getting lost. You can also rubber band small objects together.
If you don’t want to get a desk organizer, consider putting all of your pens, pencils, etc. into a plastic bag so that they don’t roll all over your desk drawers.

, Look around your room and see if there are any spots remaining that look messy. Now is the time to untangle your jewelry, put pairs of shoes together neatly, re-arrange your picture frames, and so on. Focus on the finishing touches.


This is also a good time to think of possible upgrades your room needs. Do you need a shoe rack to hang in your closet or on the back of your door? Do you need a jewelry case for all your necklaces? Do you need extra shelf- or closet-space for your clothes? Make a list of things you think would improve your room and set it aside or post it on your bulletin board (if you have one) so that you can purchase those things at a later date (or later in the day.)

, Use a duster to wisp away all of the dust on the surfaces of your desk, dresser, bookshelf, and any other surfaces you may have in your room. Dust before you vacuum or sweep because often dust will become displaced and then settle back on your floor. Make sure that your windows are open while you do this, especially if you are allergic to dust.


If you don’t have a duster, you can use wipes to wipe up all of the dust. Disinfectant wipes work well as they both wipe away dust and kill any bacteria that may have grown on your room’s surfaces. You can also use a damp cloth to wipe away dust.
Make sure to dust objects on your desk, dresser, etc. Things like picture frames, travel souvenirs, and trophies, will look much more interesting if they are not covered in a layer of dust.

, Make sure to clean out the vacuum bag if it's close to being full. Go over the dirtiest parts of your room more than once with the vacuum. If you want, sprinkle some carpet deodorizer on the carpet before vacuuming to give your room a pleasant scent.


If you don’t have a carpet, sweep the floor. You could even go so far as to mop your floor after sweeping or use a Swiffer cleaner.

, Use Windex or another cleaning solution and a microfiber cloth if you have one so that smudge marks don't get left on the windows. Cleaning your windows will give your room a glowing look.

, Shine your door handles by wiping them with cleaning solution. If you have a ceiling fan, wipe the blades down with a wet cloth. You could even go so far as to clean the moulding with wipes (if you have moulding.)


Make sure to dust away any cobwebs that may have formed on your ceiling.

, Pick up any bits of trash that may have accumulated. Empty the trash. If you have any trash that has accumulated, get rid of it. Spray some air freshener or place some bags of dried lavender in your room.


Take your boxes of giveaways somewhere where you won't forget to give them away.
Take any dishes or items that go in other rooms to their respective places.

, Do something you enjoy and/or relax in your clean room! Go out to the movies, eat some candy, play with your dog--whatever you like to do, go and do it knowing that your room is sparkling clean.


Make sure that the next time you get something out, you put it away. Try to make your bed every day. These are cleanly habits that will prevent you from having to clean your room as often.

Measure out a cup or two of Coke.,
Pour the Coke into the bowl.,
Let the Coke sit.,
Flush.,
Repeat as needed.,
Use lots of scrubbing.,
Use heat.,
Use Coke along with other household cleaners.,
Know when Coke isn't the best choice.",How to Clean a Toilet With Coke," Open a bottle or can of Coke. You won't need much to clean your toilet — a standard-sized soda can contains 12 fluid ounces (1.5 cups), which should be plenty. If you have a bigger container of Coke, measure about this much and pour it into a glass.


Coke works as a cleaner because of the gentle carbonic and phosphoric acid it contains. These chemicals come from the carbonation, not from the flavorings in the soda, so Diet Coke works just as well as regular Coke. This also means that club soda and many other carbonated beverages can be substituted for Coke (though these are rarely as cheap)., Pour the Coke around the rim of the bowl. Let it flow over the stains below. Be sure to give all the stains a good even coating of Coke — it will appear to wash into the bottom of the bowl, but a thin coat will remain on the stain.


For stains high in the bowl that are hard to reach, try soaking an old rag in Coke and applying it by hand. You can also use a spray bottle filled with Coke if you prefer not to get your hands dirty.

, Patience is key. The longer you let the Coke sit, the more of a chance you give the acids in the Coke to break down the stains. Try to let the Coke sit for at least an hour without disturbing it.


For extra cleaning power, pour the Coke in before you go to bed and let it sit in the toilet overnight.

, While you let the Coke sit, the acids will slowly loosen the built-up stains in the bowl. Now, flush the toilet once. The loosened stains should be (at least partially) rinsed away with the toilet water.

, At this point, you can see how well the Coke was able to remove the stains. While Coke usually works well for the sorts of rings and built-up mineral stains that are common problems in toilets, it may not completely eliminate every stain. If desired, simply re-apply a second layer of Coke and repeat the process.


If your stains just won't seem to go away with a second application of Coke, check out the section below, which has suggestions for especially hard-to-remove toilet stains.

, A good old-fashioned toilet brush is your best bet if simple flushing won't remove your stains. The mechanical action of a brush (or a similar item, like an abrasive pad) will further loosen built-up stains and help remove them from the walls of the bowl after you've treated them with Coke. Be sure to wash your hands after scrubbing and wear gloves if germs make you squeamish.


For best results, scrub before and after using the Coke. In other words:
Open the bowl and scrub the stains with the brush.
Apply the Coke.
Let the Coke sit.
Scrub once again with the brush and flush to rinse the stains away.;
, In general, chemical reactions happen much more quickly at high temperatures. The acid reactions that allow Coke to remove stains from toilet bowls are no exception. For difficult stains, try heating up your Coke in the microwave before you apply it to the bowl. It doesn't need to be boiling, but for best results it should be hot to the touch, so use caution when handling the hot Coke.


Never microwave soda (or any liquid) in a sealed container or a container made of metal. This can lead to dangerous explosions of hot liquid. Instead, pour the soda into a microwave-safe glass (like one made of glass or ceramic), then microwave it.
Heating Coke will make it fizz slightly more than normal, so you may want to wear gloves to avoid getting splashed with tiny drops of soda., While Coke can remove many stains, it's not always the absolute best cleaning agent for the job. For very difficult stains, you may want to try pairing it with other cleaning solutions. Here are some other cleaning methods you can try with items around the house:


Try mixing 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/4 cup baking soda (or 2 teaspoons borax) into 1/2 gallon (2 liters) jug of water. Apply the mixture to the toilet bowl, scrubbing and waiting an hour before flushing. Follow with Coke treatment as needed.
For mold, try mixing one part hydrogen peroxide with two parts water in a spray bottle. Spray it onto the moldy surface, let sit at least one hour, and scrub until the mold dissolves. Use Coke to remove any residual stains or scaling around the moldy spot.
Try mixing two parts borax with one part lemon juice and one part Coke for another versatile cleaning agent. Apply the mix to the toilet bowl, let it rest an hour, then scrub off the stains.

, Coke is suitable for most of the mineral deposits and rings that commonly occur in toilets. However, it won't always work for rarer stains, so other solutions are sometimes necessary. See below:


Coke isn't great for removing oil, fat, or grease-based stains. For these, you're better off using dish soap, detergent, or a stronger acid like vinegar.Coke isn't great at killing germs. In fact, the sugary residue left behind by regular Coke can actually feed certain types of bacteria. Stick to soap, a commercial cleaning solution, or an alcohol-based sanitizer to kill microorganisms.
Coke won't remove stains caused by inks, dyes, or pigments. Rubbing alcohol and other chemical solvents are often the best choice here."

You can also use a small bucket or plastic bin.

, The acids in the vinegar will help dissolve the white mineral deposits on the showerhead.

, The more soiled the showerhead is, the longer you will have to leave it in the vinegar.


If you are in a hurry, and if the showerhead is made from metal, you can place the pot on the stove and simmer the vinegar for 15 minutes.
If the showerhead is made from brass, or has a gold or nickel finish, take it out after 30 minutes.You can always give it another vinegar bath once you have rinsed it off.

, You should see the mineral deposits flaking off.

, Focus on the base where the holes are; this is where the most mineral buildup will be. Gently scrub the brush over any residue and rinse with cool water. Keep doing this until all of the residue is gone.

Clean the windows.,
Wipe the windows dry.,
Wipe up the excess water.",How to Clean Windows," Outside windows are especially prone to stubborn stains because they are exposed to hard water runoff, minerals, bird droppings, and elements that can cake on dirt and grime. There are a few methods you can try to remove marks on inside or outside windows:


Use a mineral deposit removing cleaner, such as CLR. Dampen a sponge with cleaner and rub at the stains on the windows. Rinse the area with water and proceed with regular cleaning.Spray the affected area with pure vinegar and let it sit for at least five minutes. Use a sponge or cloth to rub the stain, and proceed with regular cleaning.Make a paste with water and a cleaner that contains oxalic acid, such as Zud or Bar Keepers Friend.Apply the paste to the affected area with a clean cloth and give it a good rub. Rinse away the paste and clean normally.
You may be able to get off crusty or gritty stains by gently using a razor to scrape them off.;
, Whether you have children who love to decorate with stickers or applied decals to your windows to prevent birds from flying into them, removing sticky substances from windows can be difficult. However, all you really need is a spray bottle filled with water and a plastic scraper with a good edge.


Spray the stickers with water and let it sit for a couple minutes.
Hold the scraper against the window at a 45-degree angle and apply gentle pressure. Start below the stickers and scrape upwards to get underneath the stickers. Use a towel to wipe away the water., For inside and outside windows, clean the screens every time you clean the windows, which should be twice a year. Remove the screens and vacuum them to remove dust and dirt.


Use a hose or a spray bottle filled with water to lightly spray the screen both before and after you wipe it down.
With a clean cloth or sponge, wipe them down with warm water mixed with a splash of vinegar or dish soap. Allow the screens to air dry fully before replacing them., Outside windows are exposed to all manner of grease, dirt, pollutants, and other materials. For really dirty windows, start the cleaning process by using a garden hose to rinse away the top layer of grime from the windows and panes.








If you don’t have a hose, use a lint-free cloth and water to wipe away some of the dirt. You can also use a pressure washer as long as it is on a low setting.

, Make sure you get all the windows, frames, and corners. This will prevent you from just spreading dirt around when you are cleaning.Before you start cleaning inside windows, lay a large towel down in front of the window to catch spills.

, There are a few things you will need to perform a basic cleaning job on your windows, including a:


Sponge or brush (or a squeegee)
Rubber squeegee for drying
Absorbent microfiber or lint-free cloth
Clean cloth or rag
Bucket filled with cleaning solution
Large towel to protect inside floors

, There are a few different cleaners you can try for your windows, but most experts recommend a basic water and dish soap mixture. Using a spray bottle and paper towel or newspaper will just move dirt and cleaning solution around, leaving windows streaky and murky.To make your window cleaner, you can mix:


Two gallons (7.6 liters) of water with one teaspoon (6 ml) of dishwashing liquid. Equal parts water and white vinegar.¼ cup (60 ml) each of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol and vinegar, plus 1 tablespoon (15 g) cornstarch (to prevent streaks),and 2 cups (480 ml) water., You can use a sponge for windows that have multiple small panes, and a squeegee for larger picture windows. Dip your sponge into the bucket of cleaner. Wring out the excess water and wipe down the entire window, being sure to get into all the corners.








To clean high outside windows without a ladder, attach a squeegee or brush to an extension pole or broom handle.You can also use a special window cleaner that will spray up to the second floor from the ground.
Once you clean a window, make sure you dry it before moving on to the next. If the squeegee squeaks a lot when you are washing or drying the windows, add a little more soap to the water.

, For small-paned windows, use the rubber blade on the squeegee to wipe away the water vertically, working from top to bottom. For a picture window, use horizontal strokes. Start at the top and work down the window. Overlap each stroke by a couple inches (a few centimeters), and wipe the blade dry with a lint-free cloth between each stroke.








Make sure the rubber blade is always in contact with the window.
One of the easiest ways to get streak-free windows is to buy a good quality squeegee, and to make sure the rubber blade on it is sharp.Make sure you also have a streak-free window cleaning solution. Replace the rubber blade when it gets dull, because it will stop sealing properly and start leaving streaks.

, Anywhere that water spilled, dripped, or ran down the window, wipe the area dry with an absorbent, lint-free cloth. This will prevent streaks on the window.


To prevent damage to the frame, use a separate cloth or rag to dry water from the window sill.

Once you find a good area to work in, it's time to take the screens there and get ready to clean them.You'll want to make sure you've got plenty of room to work in.
The area you choose should allow you to spray and drain water easily.
You can try laying down a tarp to protect the screen from sharp sticks or stones.

, A good screen cleaning will require you to have a bucket of household ammonia and water ready. Cleaning the screen with this mixture will allow you to break up and remove dirt, dust or any other substance that has come in contact with the screen. Mixing up some ammonia and water will be the last thing you need to do before you start washing the window screen.Mix one part ammonia with three parts water.
If you don't have ammonia handy, you can also use warm water mixed with mild soap.
Make sure you wear rubber gloves when mixing or cleaning with this mixture.
Once you've mixed the ammonia and water together, stir the mixture to evenly distribute both parts.
You could also use mild dish detergent if you don't have ammonia handy.

, To begin cleaning the window screen, you'll want to rinse the screen by spraying it with a garden hose. Spraying the screen will remove most of the surface dirt and dust. Make sure you spray the entire screen before scrubbing it down with the cleaning solution.Start at the top of the screen and work your way down, covering the entire screen with water.
Set your hose to the most gentle setting it has to avoid damaging the screen.
Flip the screen over to make sure you've sprayed both sides.

, After the screen has been rinsed, you can start washing it with the cleaning solution. You'll want to use a soft bristle brush to gently scrub the screen with the cleaning solution, allowing you to break up and remove any troublesome areas of grime or dirt. Scrub the entire screen to make sure you've removed as much dirt as possible.Try to use small, circular scrubbing motions.
Scrub the screen gently. Being too forceful can tear the screen.
Rinse the brush off while you are a cleaning to avoid reapplying dirt to the screen.
Wash both sides of the window screen.

, Scrubbing the screen with a brush and cleaning solution will have broken most of the dirt loose. You can remove leftover dirt and grime by wiping the screen down with a sponge. The sponge will help soak up most of the dirt and excess cleaning solution, leaving the window screen clean and grime free.


Don't forget to wipe down the screen's frame.
Now is a good time to check for any areas that you may have missed.
Wipe down both sides of the screen.

, If you are confident that the screen is as clean as it can be, you can apply the final rinse. Use the hose once more to gently spray the remaining cleaning solution or dirt off of the screen. Make sure you've totally rinsed the screen off before letting it dry and reinstalling it.Do not use a high pressure or high power setting on the hose.
Make sure you have sprayed the entire screen down.
It can be a good idea to rinse the screen on both sides.

, If you are happy with the way the screen looks, you'll want to give it plenty of time to fully dry before installing it again. Try using some of these tips to help you dry the window screens quickly and completely:Wipe the screens down with a dry cloth or towel.
Try gently shaking the screen off to remove some of the extra water.
Lean the screen up against a wall to allow the water to a way to run off.
Try leaving the screen somewhere in direct sunlight to help speed up the drying process.

, Once the screen is dry and you're happy with the way it looks, it's time to put it back in the window frame. Replacing the screen can be done by reversing the steps you took to remove it. Make sure the screen is securely in place to complete your window screen cleaning project., To help your screens continue looking great, you'll want to keep dust and dirt from building up. Giving your window screens a light dusting once a week can cut down on the amount of heavy cleaning you'll need to do. Use these basic steps to keep up with your weekly screen dusting schedule:Grab a vacuum cleaner and a dusting brush attachment.
Use the vacuum cleaner to gently suck up any dirt on the screen.
If you are able to do so, vacuum both sides of the screen.
It's best to work top to bottom when cleaning the screen.

, You won't always need to remove the entire screen from the window to clean it. If you notice a specific spot or area that is dirty, you can mix up some soap and water to clean your screen. Keep some of these tips in mind to spot clean the screen while it's still in the window:Mix some mild soap and warm water in a bucket.
Dip a small sponge into the bucket.
Use the sponge to gently wash the stained area.
If you have to scrub the area, do so gently. Using too much force can easily tear the screen.
Finish by drying the screen with a towel.

, The more often you clean your window screens, the less often you'll need to remove them and do a full cleaning. Try to include window screens in your usual house cleaning routine to help keep them looking like new."

Give your tracks a quick wipe down when cleaning that particular room.",How to Clean Window Tracks," If you haven’t cleaned your window tracks in a while you may need a variety of supplies to get your window tracks back to that new and clean look. You’ll need:


A good vacuum with a hose attachment. A brush head can also help you break up caked on dirt.
A thin cleaning brush or an old toothbrush. You can also purchase special window track cleaning brushes. These brushes are designed with a special brush head that’s made to get all those hard to reach corners in the window track.
A clean bucket of warm or hot water. Add a few drops of dish soap or Dawn Soap until you see foamy bubbles.
One towel to dip into your water and one dry towel to wipe up any leftover moisture.
You may also want to grab baking soda and vinegar to help you break down any tough dirt or mold. You’ll need q-tips as well to loosen the dirt.;
, Take your vacuum cleaner with the attachment hose and suck out all the loose debris in the window track. Your vacuum will suck up any loose dirt as well as dead insects, dust, cobwebs, etc.
Once you have vacuumed up as much debris as you can, use your brush attachment if you have one. Scrub the tracks with your brush to help you break up more debris.

, Loosen up the muck with vinegar and baking soda. Target the corners first and then work your way into the center. You may also want to remove your screen for separate cleaning.
Pour a small amount of baking soda on your tracks. You only need a couple of tablespoons. Then pour a small amount of vinegar into the tracks.
Again, you don’t need a lot. Just enough vinegar so that it causes the baking soda to fizzle. The baking soda and vinegar will help to break up any tougher grime that your vacuum didn’t get.

, Once you’ve let the vinegar and baking soda soak in and work for a few minutes, go over the grime with your q-tips. A rule of thumb is to wait until the baking soda stops fizzling.

Clean by making small circles with your q-tips. Start at the corners and sweep all the muck toward the center. The q-tips should get most of the muck off the tracks.
Lay down some paper towels and press to soak up any leftover vinegar and grime.

, On some windows, you may be able to remove all the dirt and grime with vinegar and baking soda. But if your windows still need some work, it’s time to wash and wipe the tracks down.

Dish soap like Dawn works very well. Otherwise, you can use a natural, organic cleaning product. Natural cleaners like vinegar and lemon are options that will clean your tracks. You can also use Castille soap for an organic approach. , Use the brush to scrub the inside of the window tracks to loosen any leftover and stubborn dirt & debris.


You can use any type of brush from a special window track bush to a toothbrush to a toilet scrubber.
Pay special attention to the corners to ensure all dirt is properly loosened by the soapy brush. , Make sure you squeeze all the excess water out so that it doesn’t pool in your tracks.


Your towel should be damp enough to wipe away and absorb any leftover dirt.

, By now you’ll have efficiently cleaned your window tracks and there shouldn’t be much grime or dirt left.

Make sure to wipe down the main part of the track and the corners. Pay attention to each little crevice and groove.
It’s also a good idea to wipe down the vertical tracks if you haven’t already. Additionally, wipe any parts of the actual window that you can reach, especially the frame which touches the tracks.

, Wipe away any water drips or wet spots leftover in the window track.


After you’ve got your tracks looking pristine and to your liking, take your dry rag and give the tracks a good wipe. The dry rag will remove any moisture and prevent drip or streak marks.
You may also want to leave your windows open to let the areas air dry.

, To make cleaning your tracks quick and easy, do it a few times a year.

The more frequently you clean your windows and window tracks, the less work you’ll have to do each time you clean.
You don’t always have to go through all the steps to get the tracks nice and clean.
You may find that applying vinegar and baking soda is enough to get your tracks clean, or that a quick wipe down with soapy water gets all the grime off.

, Don’t ignore your vertical tracks. These areas are prime for grime and dirt buildup.

Use your brush and q-tips to get into the harder to reach places.
The dirt and grime that gets into your vertical tracks often falls down and creates more buildup on your bottom tracks.

, You may not always need to use a brush or q-tips. But when trying to clean out every part of the track, a brush or q-tip will be able to really get in and scrub the areas effectively.

You can also use an old toothbrush to reach smaller areas and still get an effective scrubbing.

, If you do a deep clean a couple times a year, you can still maintain cleaner tracks by wiping the tracks down whenever you clean that room.

You won’t always need to use soap and water or brushes if you clean frequently. Use some disinfectant wipes or paper towels and cleaning spray. Quickly clean the tracks to prevent excess buildup of grime or dirt, especially in the corners.

Blow away dust or debris.,
Make a mild cleaning solution.,
Use a non-abrasive cleaning cloth.,
Gently clean the surface of acrylic windows.,
Dry windows.,
Remove fingerprints with isopropyl alcohol.,
Get rid of tough stains with kerosene.,
Polish away small scratches and abrasions.,
Sand away deeper scratches.,
Avoid ammonia-based cleaners.,
Treat windows with an anti-static product.,
Don't use paper towels, scrub pads, or other abrasive cleaning tools.",How to Clean Acrylic Windows," To remove dust or debris from acrylic windows, use a blow dryer on the coolest setting. Hold the blow dryer 3-4 inches away from the window and cover the surface evenly, going from side to side. Be sure not to heat the plexiglass as doing so might damage.Use an extension cord to ensure that you are able to use the blow dryer evenly in front of your windows.;
, To clean acrylic glass, use a mild, non-abrasive solution of dish washing liquid and warm water. For a ratio that will leave plexiglass streak-free, add 3 drops of dish washing liquid to a gallon of water (approximately 3.8 L). The solution can be made in a bucket to use for cleaning right away, or poured into spray bottles for easy cleaning down the line., To clean acrylic windows, use a microfiber cloth or another soft, lint-free, non-abrasive cloth. Either wet the cloth directly in the mild detergent solution, or moisten it completely before using it with the cleaning spray.Always use a new, clean cloth to wash acrylic windows as any build up, debris, or dirt residue remaining from other cleaning jobs can causes scratches to acrylic very easily., When cleaning acrylic windows, apply minimal pressure while you clean. Gently dab the surface with the cleaning cloth to avoid scratches. Since dirt does not cling to acrylic, this gentle cleaning should be enough to remove residue or dust from your windows., After cleaning, gently blot windows dry with a clean cloth or chamois. This will prevent water spots from forming. Avoid using the cloth to wipe down the surface of acrylic windows, as this motion might cause scratches., Dampen a soft cloth with isopropyl alcohol and gently run it over the part of your acrylic window where fingerprints appear. Once the fingerprints are gone, quickly rinse the alcohol off of your window with a clean, wet cloth. Do not use isopropyl alcohol as a regular cleaning agent for windows, as it can cause a number of tiny cracks on the acrylic's surface over time., To remove difficult stains like oil, tar, or grease from acrylic windows, purchase kerosene at your local hardware store. Dampen a soft cloth with kerosene and apply to the stains, passing the cloth over the surface as lightly as possible to avoid scratches. Rinse the area thoroughly with a clean, wet cloth to remove all traces of the solvent.Be sure to use kerosene in an open, well-ventilated area.

, To remove small scratches from the surface of your plexiglass windows, use floor wax, car wax, or car polish. Using a soft, clean cloth apply one thin, even layer of the wax or polish to your acrylic windows. Buff gently with another clean, damp cloth.For stubborn scratches, use an abrasive polish approved for acrylic surfaces.

, If scratches are too deep to remove with regular buffing, sand the area with fine sand paper (e.g. 600 grit sandpaper, available at hardware stores). Coarser sandpaper will leave scratches. Use small, circular strokes to sand the scratched area, gradually widening your scope and you go., When cleaning acrylic windows, avoid ammonia-based cleaners that you would use on glass windows (e.g. Windex). The chemicals in such cleaners can damage acrylic windows, leaving them looking cloudy and dull. Avoid using any commercial window cleaning sprays unless they are non-abrasive and specifically recommended for acrylic., To reduce the static buildup that can cause dust and other debris to stick to acrylic windows, purchase an anti-static cleaning spray (e.g. Novus Plastic Clean and Shine). Apply the spray to a soft cloth and gently dab it onto the window surface. Buff the window gently with another clean cloth., When cleaning acrylic windows, use only soft cloths to avoid damage to the surface. Even paper towels can leave scratches on plexiglass. Prolonged use abrasive cleaning items can ruin acrylic windows entirely, making them cloudy and unusable."

Rub the glue with rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover.,
Use white vinegar to remove residue left by masking tape.,
Use commercial degreasing agents.,
Use WD40 or paint thinner.,
Use lighter fluid.,
Heat the glass with a hair-dryer or heat gun.",How to Clean Glue from Windows1," Pour a cap's worth of rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover onto a paper towel. Rub in a circular motion to soften glue or paint. You don't need much – remember that a small, concentrated dose of solvent will be much more effective than splashing the window at large.Go over the spot with a regular glass-and-window-cleaning spray. Rub the spray into the surface with a fresh rag. This will help you lift leftover smudges – and it will help cover up the smell of the alcohol or nail polish remover.;
, This method works well for window glass on which the tape has been left for too long or has dried out quickly in the hot sun. Wipe the residue a couple of times with a soft cloth that is damp with vinegar. Let the adhesive sit for a minute, then rub off the residue with a fresh piece of your already-dampened cloth. Keep rubbing and applying more vinegar until you have removed all of the dried-on adhesive. Dry and polish with a clean cloth.

, Head to your local auto store – there are plenty of products that can give you a leg up when tackling stubborn adhesives. Look for brands like Fast Orange, Goof-Off, and Goo Gone. These products are designed for cleaning motor oil and grease from hands, but they work just as well for sticker, tape, and glue residue because they contain powerful degreasing agents.


In the case of citrus cleaners like Fast Orange, the degreasing agent is usually d-Limonene. Others rely on heptanes, a powerful solvent. For the sake of safety, make sure to use both types of products in small doses, in a well-ventilated area.

, Spray either product directly onto the glue and scrub the surface with a clean rag., Squirt the fluid onto a rag or paper towel, and be careful not to spill. Scrub the glue spot with the damp towel until you remove all of the glue.


Alternately, soak the glue in lighter fluid to loosen the adhesive. Squirt or dab the lighter fluid directly onto the glue patch, in a concentrated area. Let it set for a minute, then wipe it off with a clean, damp towel.
Incidentally, this method will also remove crayon streaks from a wall. Some light stains may remain, but lighter fluid will remove the bulk of the wax. Once you remove the stains, you can touch-up the paint.

, Run a hair dryer on high over the glue-patch for at least a minute to loosen its bond with the window. You can also use a heat gun to soften up the glue. Set the dial on the gun to a low heat setting and apply heat to the glued area in a circular motion.Once you've weakened the adhesive and the glue feels warm to the touch, you can scrub with a solvent or carefully chip away with a scraping tool, such as a razor blade."
"
Consider the type of glue.,
Act quickly.,
Wipe wet glue with a damp washcloth before it sets.,
Use any solvent that you would use to clean up dried glue.,
Soften the glue with a hot sponge.,
Pour boiling water on the glue.,
Try freezing wet glue with an ice cube.",How to Clean Glue from Windows2," Your reaction to wet glue depends on the type of glue that's begun to cling to your window. Certain types of glue will peel (mostly) cleanly from glass once they dry; others require scrubbing with hot water and solvents; and still others may never come clean without serious, glass-damaging effort. Check which type of glue was used:


Hot glue should be peel-able when dry. Let it set, then remove it cleanly.
Elmer's liquid glue should also peel free when dry.
Elmer's stick glue might come off with hot water, but it is more resistant than some other types.
Tacky glue is usually peel-able when dry, but you can also try scrubbing it with hot water to head off the problem before it sets.
Superglue is not going to come off without serious chipping. There's a good chance that you will scratch your window if you try to remove this super-adhesive substance.

, Glue can be much more difficult to remove once it sets. If you act while the glue is still wet and sticky, you may be able to remove the majority of the goop before it hardens onto your window.

, Hot water and a washcloth should do the trick if the glue has not dried yet. You can also use a paper towel, an old shirt, or the rough side of a sponge. Scrub the window for a couple of minutes until you remove all of the glue. When the surface is clean, dry it thoroughly with a rag. Inspect the glass, and repeat the process if the spot is still sticky.


Be aware that wet glue may stick to the washcloth, which may be difficult to remove. Use something old that you're willing to ruin.
Scrubbing wet glue may simply spread the adhesive around, further obscuring the surface. If water and washcloth alone do not suffice, try using a heavier solvent.

, Rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover, WD-40, industrial degreasers, vinegar, and lighter fluid should all help you lift still-goopy glue from a window surface. As with dried glue, rub the spot with a rag or paper towel soaked in your solvent of choice until the area is completely free of adhesive.

, First, soak a sponge in boiling water for a few minutes. Ring out the sponge, then press it onto the glue. Leave the hot sponge to soak for a few minutes. By the time you lift it, most of the glue should be gone. Rinse any glue from the sponge, then wipe the remaining goop from the glass until the surface is completely clean.

, Pour a consistent stream of boiling water directly onto the glue patch for several seconds. This should loosen the adhesive enough that you can scrape it away. Try scraping directly after you heat the glue, while the bonds are still loosened., Hold an ice cube against the glue patch for a few minutes to freeze the adhesive. Once the gunk is frozen, scrape it off with a butter knife or the edge of a credit card.

"
"
Scrape the glue away once you have soaked or scrubbed it with a solvent.,
Chip stubborn adhesives away from the glass with a scraping tool.,
Use steel wool.,
Wipe the scraped area clean with a dry, clean towel.",How to Clean Glue from Windows3," The solvent will weaken the glue's grip on the window, and the scraping tool will give you the edge and leverage that you need to chip the adhesive away from the glass. Use a metal scraper, preferably something sharp and sturdy. Do not use a thin or fragile blade – you'll need to apply a lot of force to remove the glue, and a sharp blade will be dangerous if it breaks., Use the sort of scraper that you'd use to remove auto decals; alternately, use a new razor blade, a retractable utility knife, or a flat-head screwdriver.Angle the blade about 30 degrees from the surface of the glass. Carefully and methodically scrape the residue from the glass surface. Push with a smooth motion,a nd remember: scrape, don't slice, otherwise you might ruin the glass.The scraping method is not only useful for glue. It's also great for removing stubborn, caked-on paint.

, If the problem is particularly resistant, try rubbing the window with a piece of steel wool. Soak the steel wool in water and a few drops of dish soap. Be very careful not to scrub too hard – if you apply too much pressure with the steel wool, you might permanently scratch up your window.

, Finish by wiping the area with a fresh towel, or with a clean portion of your alcohol- or vinegar-dampened paper towel. If there are paint flecks stuck to your window, you can skip the solvent and just wipe the window with the clean towel.

Douse the frames in water.,
Remove grease spots with a commercial cleaner.,
Make a paste with baking soda and lemon juice.,
Apply your paste.,
Rinse the frames.",How to Clean Aluminum Window Frames1," If you have a hose, use this to get the aluminum frames wet. This will help remove a small layer of dirt and grime and make your cleaner more effective. If you do not have a hose, get the frames wet using a bucket of water., Buy a solvent-based cleaner online or at a local hardware store. Make sure the cleaner is safe to use on aluminum. Obvious grease spots and stains should be treated with a commercial cleaner.Refer to the instructions manual for precise instructions. Most cleaners should sit on the stain for a set amount of time before being wiped off.
Look the safety instructions on your cleaner as well. Gloves or goggles may be advised.

, Lemon juice and baking soda can clean a lot of dirt and grime off of aluminum and leave it looking shiny. After applying a commercial cleaner to the stains, give the whole frame a scrub with a paste made of a half cup lemon juice and a quarter cup lemon juice., Rub the paste using a sponge or rag. The paste should remain on the window frame until it dries. The precise time this will take depends on the current climate in your area.Make sure you apply the paste to the entire window frame. Do not neglect cracks or crevices in the window.
If you need a smaller tool, such as a scrub brush, to get into certain places, use that to apply the cleaner.

, Use a damp sponge to remove the paste after it dries. Use water to rinse off the paint and any remaining traces of your commercial cleaner. Make sure to keep rinsing until the water runs clean. Any lingering residue could damage your windows."
"
Wipe down the frames with a damp cloth.,
Use the same cleaners you used outdoors.,
Apply your cleaner with a scouring pad.,
Rinse and dry the frames.",How to Clean Aluminum Window Frames2," Get your window frames wet before you being cleaning. This will loosen dirt and dust, making the cleaning process go smoother. Wet a sponge and run it along the full frame, making sure to get into cracks and crevices as well.If certain areas are hard to reach using a sponge, opt for a smaller tool like a scrub brush.

, If cleaners were safe for your outdoor frames, they will be safe for your indoor frames. Use a solvent-based cleaner as well as a paste made from a half cup lemon juice and a quarter cup baking soda.However, make sure commercial cleaners are safe to use inside before applying them to your window frames.

, A scouring pad helps dislodge dirt and debris. When applying your cleaners, do so using a scouring pad. This helps dislodge unwanted debris from your window frames, such as stuck on messes from the kitchen. If you don't have scouring pads, they can be purchased at most department stores.Apply the solvent-based cleaner first, targeting obvious stains. Allow the cleaner to sit on as long as the package recommends before cleaning it off.
Apply your lemon juice and baking soda paste second. Let the paste dry before rinsing your frames.

, Rinse your frames off using a damp sponge. After rinsing them, rub off the remaining water using a dry cloth. Indoor frames will not dry as fast on their own and need to be dried after the cleaning process."
"
Use steel wool and paint thinner for tough stains.,
Polish your frames when you're done.,
Test your product on a small part of the window frame first.",How to Clean Aluminum Window Frames3," IF you encounter difficult stains that do not come off with a commercial cleaner, paint thinner applied with steel wool can help. Make sure to follow package directions, especially any safety instructions, before applying paint thinner. Then, work the paint thinner into the frames using a steel wool sponge until the stains come off.Be gentle when using steel wool to avoid scratching the frames.

, After cleaning your frames, they may look a little dull. Apply water using fine steel wool, buffing the surface of the frames until they shine.Outdoor frames may become dull due to a process called anodizing. This looks similar to rust and cannot be polished off. Aluminum frames that appear rusty should be treated by a professional cleaner.

, Never apply any product, even household products, to the full window frame without testing them first. Before applying a product to your window frame, apply it to a small portion of the frame that's mostly out of sight. Make sure the cleaner does not cause a negative reaction, such as discoloration, before applying it to the rest of the window frames."

Boil the cast aluminum item in a solution of cream of tartar and water.,
Scrub the item with a soft toothbrush or a non-abrasive pad.,
Use a mixture of lemon juice and water.",How to Clean Cast Aluminum1," One of the most effective ways to clean a cast aluminum item is to boil it in a solution of three tablespoons of cream of tartar and four cups of water. You can submerge the item in a pot of this solution. If you want to clean the inside of a pan, boil the solution inside the pan.


Boil the solution on medium high heat for 15 minutes. Then, remove the solution and let the item cool.
You can follow up by scrubbing the item, if necessary. Scrubbing any residue will be much easier thanks to the acidity in the cream of tartar. The cream of tartar can also help to remove any dark or blackened spots on the pan.;
, If there is a lot of residue on a cast aluminum pan or piece of furniture, you can use a toothbrush with soft bristles or a soft, non-abrasive pad to gently scrub the item. You should scrub in gentle, circular motions and be careful not to scrub too hard or with too much pressure as you do not want to scratch or damage the surface of the item.Soaking a pan or small furniture items in cream of tartar and water before scrubbing them can make it easier to remove any residue.
You can try to scrub cast aluminum furniture with a soft toothbrush or a fine scrub pad without soaking it first. One option is to run the garden hose over the furniture to give it a good clean and then scrub it with a fine pad or a toothbrush.Avoid using any metal utensils or steel wool on cast aluminum items. These harsh scrubbing tools can damage the finish., The acidity in the lemon juice can help to loosen up any residue on a pan or furniture. However, be careful not to use too much lemon juice in the soaking solution as too much acidity can damage the cast aluminum surface. Dilute the lemon juice with water using one part lemon juice to four parts water.You can also try another natural acidic product like apple cider vinegar, but make sure you dilute the vinegar with water before soaking the cast aluminum in it or before applying it as a scrub to the furniture.

Fill a squirt bottle with half water and half vinegar.,
Spray the vinegar solution on the glass.,
Saturate a towel with the vinegar solution.,
Scrub the glass lightly with the towel.,
Allow the vinegar solution to sit.,
Remove the vinegar solution with a dry towel or squeegee.",How to Clean Hard Water Spots Off Windows1," The best vinegar to use is plain white distilled vinegar, which is inexpensive and effective.A higher concentration of vinegar may be even more effective, so adjust the vinegar to water ratio based on the severity of the water spots.;
, Spray the solution on the glass, being sure to fully saturate any stubborn water spots or areas of concentrated buildup. Allow the vinegar to soak, and reapply a couple of times for particularly dirty areas.








, Soak a rough towel in vinegar and water, and spread it over the sprayed area of glass. You can allow the towel to sit over the area so that the vinegar can soak in thoroughly.







, Use your rough, soaked towel to scrub the glass. You should not have to scrub hard. The bumps on the towel should act as an abrasive to help remove the spots and allow the vinegar to penetrate the mineral build-up.








, The worse the stains are, the longer the vinegar will need to do its work. Let the vinegar soak in, and reapply if it seems to be drying out.







, You may want to spray the area once more with your vinegar solution or plain water, then towel off with a clean, dry towel (or paper towel) or use a squeegee to remove the water. Be sure you do not allow the vinegar solution or water to dry on the surface of the glass, as this will continue to leave more spots.

Soak the item in dissolver spray and water.,
Run the item through a self cleaning oven.,
Clean the item with a mild detergent and water.",How to Clean Cast Aluminum2," If you are looking to try a professional product on the cast aluminum, you can try a dissolver spray. Dissolver sprays can be found in the cleaning aisle of most hardware stores.Apply the dissolver spray on the item and let it sit for 30 minutes. It should help to loosen any residue or crud on the item. You can then use a non-abrasive pad or a soft-bristled brush on the item.

, If you have access to a self-cleaning oven, you can place the item in the oven and let it run through a shortened cycle for an hour. The high temperatures in the oven can help to reduce any organic residue to a powder that can then be rinsed off once the item is out of the oven.With this option, it is important that you remove any non-aluminum parts on the item as they can be damaged in the oven. Remove any steel or wood parts, such as handles and screws. If you cannot remove any non-aluminum parts on the item without damaging it, this option may not be a good one.

, Dilute in the mild detergent in water so it is not too harsh on the cast aluminum item. You can dip a soft-bristled toothbrush in the solution or a non-abrasive pad and use it to scrub off any residue or dirt on the item."

Wash cast aluminum furniture before storing it for the winter.,
Clean a cast aluminum pan right after it has been used.,
Fix any warped areas on the aluminum with a hammer and a piece of wood.",How to Clean Cast Aluminum3," You should get into the habit of cleaning your cast aluminum furniture before you store it away as this will help to maintain the finish on the furniture. This will also prevent the build up of corrosive pollutants on the surface of the furniture during the winter months.You may also want to cover the furniture with covers made of breathable material to protect the furniture when it is not in use or stored away.

, To preserve the finish of your cast aluminum pan, you should try to wash it as soon as it has been used. Avoid letting the pan sit out with residue and dirt on it for a long period of time. If you do not have time to clean it right away, you can soak it in a natural solution of cream of tartar and water so it will be easy to remove any residue from the pan later., One possible issue with aluminum is that it can warp due to improper heating or cooling. This can lead to dents, warps, and deformities on the cast aluminum. However, it is possible to fix any warps with a hammer and a piece of wood.If your cast aluminum pot has a warped bottom, for example, you can place the pot upside down on a towel that is laid out on a flat, sturdy surface. Place a wood block or scrap piece of wood over the middle of the warp, such as a 2x4"" or a 1x4"" block. A soft wood like pine works best, as it will not further warp the aluminum.
Make small measured taps over the wood block with the hammer, working slowly and carefully to flatten out the warp. Avoid making any sharp, hard blows on the wood as this can lead to further warping of the aluminum.

Use lemon juice instead of vinegar.,
Try lemon or orange essential oil.,
Apply white toothpaste to the area.,
Make a paste of baking soda and vinegar.",How to Clean Hard Water Spots Off Windows2," Lemon juice has the same acidic properties as vinegar, and can be equally as effective.Fresh lemon usually works better than bottled lemon juice.









Try rolling the lemon on a hard surface with some pressure before cutting it open. This will make the lemon easier to juice.
Squeeze the juice out of a lemon and place in a spray bottle with water or use a towel to apply the lemon juice to the glass.
Alternatively, you can use the lemon itself on the surface of the glass. Just cut the lemon in half and rub the open area on the glass with a fair amount of pressure.
Allow the lemon to soak in, then remove from the glass using water or a traditional glass cleaner.

, Essential oils are becoming increasingly popular due to their rumored health and cleaning benefits. Citrus-based essential oils such as lemon and orange may remove hard water deposits. This has an added benefit as well: the oil tends to serve as a water repellant and may prevent future spot buildups.









Place several drops of the oil in water, and use a sponge or a towel to apply the solution to the glass.
Allow to soak, then scrub lightly with the towel or sponge.
Remove from the glass using water or a traditional glass cleaner.

, As strange as this may sound, toothpaste is made to remove build-up, so it works fairly well on hard water spots.








Water down the toothpaste with some water so that it spreads more easily and so that you can use less toothpaste.
Apply the paste to the glass and allow to sit.
Scrub lightly with a brush, a towel, or a sponge.
Wash the paste away from the glass with water.
Clean the glass with water or a traditional glass cleaner, but be sure to dry it thoroughly so that the water spots do not re-form.

, The paste will bubble when you combine the two. You can wait for the bubbling to subside or you can apply the still-bubbling paste directly onto the glass. Do not combine vinegar and baking soda in a closed container, as the resulting gas expansion may cause the lid to forcibly fly off.









Apply the paste to the glass and allow to sit.Scrub lightly with a brush, a towel, or a sponge.

Find a powdered abrasive cleaner.,
Wet the surface of the glass.,
Apply the powdered cleaner to the glass.,
Use some “elbow grease.” The major benefit of the abrasive cleaners is the micro-scrubbing action provided by the granules of the cleaner.In order for these granules to work, you will need to apply some vigorous scrubbing.,
Rinse the product away with water.,
Dry the glass.,
Use an abrasive scrubber.",How to Clean Hard Water Spots Off Windows3," Some abrasive cleaners are Comet, Barkeeper’s friend, or simple baking soda.These are all powdered cleaners that can be sprinkled on a surface area.








, It is easiest to wet the glass first, then apply the powder to it. This way, the powder will stick to the surface of the glass. The water and the abrasive will work together to make a sort of cleaning paste.








, Many purpose-made powder cleaners have multiple holes in the top that facilitate sprinkling. If yours doesn’t, or if you’re using baking soda, you could try putting the powder in a small sifter and sprinkling it on the surface with that.








, Think of it as a double benefit: cleaning and a workout at one time!








, While some cleaning products can be left on the glass, an abrasive cleaner is likely to leave a residue since it isn’t designed specifically as a glass cleaner. Thoroughly rinsing the cleaner away with water, then cleaning the glass with a traditional glass cleaner is the best way to ensure that the abrasive cleaner does not leave any residue.








, After you rinse away the cleaner and clean the glass with water or glass cleaner, be sure that you dry the surface thoroughly to prevent additional water spots.








, An alternate approach to using an abrasive cleaner is to use an abrasive scrubber. The scrubber essentially works like very fine sandpaper to remove stains and build-up from the glass. Some popular abrasive scrubbers are steel wool,rough green scrub sponges, and a product known as a magic eraser, which is a very fine sponge.

Find a product made to remove hard water stain buildup.,
Apply the product according to the directions on the packaging.,
Wear some protective gear if necessary.,
Clean the area with water or a vinegar solution.,
Store the products safely.",How to Clean Hard Water Spots Off Windows4," There are products that are specifically designed to remove hard-water spots from glass and other surfaces. You may want to try other household products first, as buying several different cleaning products for one cleaning problem can be costly.Here are a few specific products that may help with hard water spots:









CLR
Barkeeper’s Friend
Kaboom
Lime-away

, Most products require being sprayed on or applied using a sponge or towel. Most products will recommend that you allow them to sit and soak in to saturate the surface of the cleaning area.









Some products suggest wiping them on and off, but not scrubbing them because scrubbing can lead to unwanted splatter.It’s always best to test a small portion of the surface to be sure that a product will not damage it.
Be sure to take care to keep the product only on the glass you are cleaning: the cleaner may damage adjacent walls, window sills, tile, flooring, or car paint.

, Many cleaners are caustic and can be damaging to humans or animals. Be sure to wear gloves and protective eyewear such as goggles if necessary.









Wash your hands immediately after contacting any cleaner, and never put your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes immediately after contact with cleaners.
Many cleaners suggest using in a well-ventilated area to avoid any bodily harm due to fumes from the product.
Be sure to read warning labels on the product carefully.

, After using a cleaning product, you may want to clean the glass with a water or vinegar solution to remove any residue of the cleaner. Be sure to dry the glass thoroughly.








, Cleaning products should always be stored outside of the reach of children and pets, with the lid securely in place and any spilled cleaner wiped away from the outside of the bottle. On a high shelf behind a door with a childproof latch on it is ideal.

Treat water spots quickly.,
Remove any resting water.,
Keep your windows dry.,
Treat the glass with a water repellant.",How to Clean Hard Water Spots Off Windows5," If hard water spots are treated in the beginning of their formation, they will be less stubborn and easier to remove. Simply spraying spots with a vinegar solution once a week or so, as they begin to form, may be adequate.








, Prevention is the best way to deal with hard water spots. Not allowing water to rest on and evaporate from surfaces can be the key to preventing the spots from forming in the first place.








Wipe the wet glass down with a dry towel if you see water on it.
Use a squeegee to remove standing water from glass. This will keep your glass looking clean and clear., The easiest way to avoid water spots is to prevent your glass from getting wet to begin with. If you are dealing with water spots on car windows, try parking your car in a covered area, such as in your garage. Installing blinds or curtains may keep the water off of windows near kitchen or bathroom sinks.








, A product that repels water, such as an oil-based cleaner or a product such as rain-x, may help spots from forming on your glass.Do not use a product on car windows unless they are specifically made to treat car windows and will not interfere with visibility in wet or dry conditions.

Dry wipe with a microfiber cloth.,
Go over it with a dryer sheet.,
Apply cooking spray.,
Rinse with warm water.,
Use soap and water.,
Dry in small circles.",How to Clean Chrome Fixtures1," Your fixtures might have accumulated a good amount of dust over time. Dust on a regular basis and you can space out your deeper cleanings further apart. Get a microfiber cloth or duster and run it over the fixtures, applying a light amount of pressure as you go. Select a clean cloth for each new fixture.Try to avoid touching or wiping chrome fixtures with any abrasive cleaning pads, such as steel wool. This will only create scratches on the surface of the fixture.;
, Dryer sheets are soft and they also contain a mild cleaning solution. Get a few dryer sheets and run them over the surface of your fixture. Apply even pressure and gently scrub on any problem areas. Dryer sheets are especially good at removing set-in soap scum.If you are looking to save money, you can use either new or used dryer sheets, too. The used sheets still retain their cleaning ability after one cycle through the dryer.

, Get a cooking spray made from vegetable or olive oil. Holding the can close to the fixture, apply a light coating of spray over the entire thing. Make sure to get the back of the fixture as well. Let it soak for a few minutes. Wipe it down with a damp microfiber cloth. Repeat as necessary.Make sure to get all of the oil off of your fixture or you could end up with an oily sludge in some areas. Use a cotton swab to get in the cracks, if necessary.

, Get a microfiber cloth or sponge. Wet it down with warm water and wring it out until damp. Wipe this over the surface of your chrome fixture. Repeat as necessary. This can be especially helpful for fixtures that are not in regular contact with water, such as the top arms of showerheads. If the fixture regularly encounters water, it will be less effective., Place dish soap into a bucket and add water until you have a soapy mixture. Dip your cloth or sponge into the mixture and apply liberally to your fixtures. Keep dipping the sponge or rag to remove any accumulated dirt and to gather additional bubbles.You can also use a toothbrush with a bit of dish soap applied to the head to scrub difficult to reach areas or stubborn stains., If you leave moisture on the fixtures, you will likely create water spots or residue. To avoid this problem, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe over the surface of the fixtures. Continue until all moisture is gone. You can also keep rubbing in circles until the fixtures take on that trademark shiny appearance of chrome."

Fill a bucket with hot water.,
Add soap to your water.,
Rub the chrome with a non-abrasive sponge or cloth.Take a non-abrasive sponge or cloth and dunk it partway into the soapy water.,
Clean nooks with an old toothbrush.Certain pieces of chrome, like car tires, will have hard-to-reach areas that require a new approach.,
Dry the chrome once you're finished cleaning it.Leaving the chrome wet will result in unsightly water marks.,
Rub chrome using aluminum foil.Because aluminum is a softer metal than chrome, it can be used to polish your chrome.",How to Clean Chrome1," As with any type of cleaning, you'll have an easier time cleaning your chrome if the water is at least warm. Fill a bucket two-thirds of the way full with warm to hot water. If there's only a small bit of chrome that needs cleaning, you can do away with the bucket, and apply the water and soap directly to a towel.;
, Once you have a bucket of hot water, add soap to it until the surface is filled with bubbles. The type of soap you use for cleaning chrome depends on the application. Although any non-abrasive soap is fine to use with chrome, choose a soap that can be used with the surrounding area as well. For example, you should use a car-specific wash when cleaning your car's exterior.A simple household cleaner should be fine for use on chrome.


If in doubt, check the label of the cleaner you're going to use. It should have some indication for materials it can and can't be used on.

, Rub the chrome gently in a smooth, circular motion. Focus on cleaning a section of chrome before moving onward. In order to prevent marks or streaks, dry the area with a separate cloth when you're done with each area.


In case the water is hot to the touch, you should only put the end of your cloth in. When the water and soap run out, you can simply dip it in again.

, For the vast majority of them, applying your soapy water to an old toothbrush and scrubbing the nooks will get the dirt off.


Although the toothbrush can be old, make sure that the majority of the bristles are still intact. Scrubbing chrome with a worn-down toothbrush is inefficient and could risk scratching the chrome if you scrub hard enough.

, After you finish washing the chrome, dry it off with a clean hand towel. Dry it in soft, circular motions to prevent streaking.

, Many kitchens stock aluminum foil. Tearing off a strip and scrubbing it over the chrome once you've cleaned off the dirt is a great DIY method to bring the shine back.

Do a spot test.,
Remove any calcium build-up.,
Use fresh lemons.,
Make a baking soda paste.,
Use vinegar.,
Avoid abrasive cleaners.",How to Clean Chrome Fixtures2," If you are going to use more aggressive methods to clean your fixtures, then you will want to test your cleaning solution on a small, not noticeable spot. Place your solution on this spot with a cotton swab or cotton ball and then let it soak in for a few minutes. Wipe it off with a damp cloth and look to see if any discoloration has occurred.You can also read the care instructions that came with your fixtures. This will also tell you if using a particular type of cleaner or method will void your warranty. In addition, many fixture companies, such as Kohler, offer customer care numbers that you can call with any questions.If you notice any discoloration, keep applying water and drying until it disappears.

, It is possible that your fixture isn’t functioning as well due to calcium build-up at the nozzle. This is especially the case when dealing with shower and sink faucets. Before you perform a surface clean, get rid of this build-up by filling a plastic baggie with one part of water and one part of CLR cleaner. Attach the baggie to the faucet spout by using a rubber band. Let it sit for two hours and then remove and rinse off the excess.Some people like to use a Magic Eraser to remove the resulting grime from the spout, but a rag or paper towel works as well.

, Grab a lemon and slice it in half. Rub the inside of the lemon against your chrome fixture. The acid in the lemon should loosen any grime or dirt. When you are finished, rinse off any residue with warm water and dry the fixture with a microfiber cloth.This cleaning method can remove difficult spots, but it is also gentle so you can use it as often as necessary., If your fixture is covered in deep grime, you may need to apply a thicker and more powerful cleaner to break through it. Get a small bowl and mix together baking soda and water until you form a thick paste. Use a cloth to apply this paste all over the fixture. Rub it in and then rinse it off with water before drying., Get a bowl and add together one part warm water and one part vinegar. Dip a sponge into this solution and let it absorb until it gets damp. Then, wipe down the surface of your chrome fixtures. You can scrub with a bit more force on stubborn stained areas.Make sure to keep the vinegar-water mixture at a one-to-one ratio. Otherwise you risk diluting the vinegar to the point of losing its effectiveness.

, Make sure to avoid using any cleaning products with alcohol or ammonia on the ingredients list. These may eat through the finish of the crime and leave damage. Glass cleaners can also damage the outer chrome coating as well. When in doubt, carefully read the labels and any warnings on any commercial cleaners that you are considering using."

Clean them regularly.,
Spot treat as needed.,
Apply a polish.,
Use Rain-X.,
Rub it with wax paper.",How to Clean Chrome Fixtures3," Try to wipe down your fixtures on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Performing a gentle wipe down will keep the dust from accumulating and creating a layer of grime. You can also dry the fixtures if you see any water spots present after a shower or bath.

, If you see a spot developing on your fixture, dip a cotton ball in a one-to-one vinegar and water mixture. Place the ball on the surface of the chrome and hold for a few minutes. Remove it and rinse with water. Repeat as necessary to remove any stains., Go to your local hardware or auto store and purchase a polish made especially for chrome. Follow the directions on the package and apply the mixture to your chrome fixtures. Make sure that you rinse the solution off thoroughly. If done properly, this will keep your fixtures shining between cleanings., This is a cleaning product that works by creating a barrier that repels water. Spray Rain-X directly onto your chrome fixtures and wipe away any excess. You can also moisten a microfiber cloth with Rain-X and apply it that way. With either method you should get at least a few weeks of protection from water drop spotting., Get a sheet of wax paper, fold it to expose the waxy side, and gently scrub the chrome. It may feel weird to polish a fixture with paper, but this really works. The wax will get lightly applied to the surface of your fixture and it will enhance the shine and help it to repel dust and dirt."

Choose a cleaning solution.Because chrome is a relatively soft metal, appropriately lightweight cleaning solutions are the best choice for it.,
Use your lightest available cleaner first.If you have a variety of cleaners to choose from, pick the lightest solution first.,
Apply your cleaner to a towel.,
Rub the chrome gently in circles.Once the cleaner is on your towel, apply it to the chrome surface in a gentle smooth and circular motion.,
Rinse and dry the chrome once you're finished cleaning it.After using a cleaner, give the chrome a quick once-over with a towel damp with hot water to remove any cleaner.",How to Clean Chrome2," Most of the dirt pileup on chrome won't need more than soap and water to dispel. Here are some of the most common cleaning solutions used on chrome:


Baby oil.
Ethanol or rubbing oil.
Cola.
Lemon and baking soda.
You can also use a chrome-friendly cleaning spray. Commonplace household cleaners like Vim Bathroom cleaning spray are well-suited to cleaning chrome., Generally speaking, chrome does not require a lot to get the grime off. Due to chrome's fragility, you should only use heavier cleaning solutions if the lighter ones don't work to clean the surface.

, As you would with soap and water, dab the edge of your towel into the cleaning solution. If you're using a spray bottle, spray directly into the towel, and apply from there. This method will allow you the most control over how much cleaner is used.


Paper towels also work in lieu of a cloth hand towel, although you'll probably have to go through quite a few in order to clean any large chrome surface.

, In spite of the soap, some grime may take a bit of pressure to wipe away properly. You may exert some force without needing to worry about the chrome being damaged.

, Following that, take a fresh towel and dry the surface completely, working in a circular motion.


If you don't dry it, it may result in residual water marks in the chrome finish.

Apply polishing aluminum oxide.Polishing aluminum oxide will remove micrograins from the surface of the chrome, leaving it smooth and shiny.,
Rub off rust with steel wool.In the case of dilapidated chrome finishes, you may have a build-up of rust on part of the surface.,
Wax your chrome surface.Wax is a great choice if you want to polish a chrome surface.,
Dab, and dry with water for an extra finish.Quickly cleaning it with water is easy and effective when it comes to reinvigorating the look of a surface.",How to Clean Chrome3," Apply this polisher to a towel and scrub it in using a circular motion.

, A cleaner will not scrub this rust away. You'll need to use something mechanical like steel wool to try to fix this problem. Use steel wool to scrub as much of the rust away as you can. Although the chrome may never be perfect after rust sets in, you can drastically improve the look of it once the rust is removed.


Waxing and polishing the freshly de-rusted surface will help to further improve the chrome's appearance.

, Shake wax, and apply it to the chrome with a fresh cloth. Once it has been applied evenly to your chrome, take another cloth, and wipe it away.

, If your chrome lacks shine due to streaks, dirt, or fingerprints, taking a wet towel to it and drying it after should result in an immediate improvement.

Break up grime with a damp cloth and putty knife.,
Use a mild soap solution.",How to Clean Brushed Nickel1," Find a clean, soft, lint-free cloth. Terry cloth works well, but any soft cotton blend can prove equally useful. Remove dust, smudges, and grease. Use small, circular motions.If you’re cleaning a light shade, remove the shade before cleaning it.;
, Wet a cloth with warm water. Press the cloth onto the area with buildup. Use a putty knife to gently and carefully scrape the gunk only (not the nickel itself). Buff the area with a soft, dry cloth., Soak a soft, clean cloth in warm water with a squirt of detergent. Wipe your nickel item with the wet cloth. Rinse or sponge it clean with water. Dry it thoroughly.Dishwashing soap is effective because it cuts away grease while remaining fairly gentle.
The simpler the soap, the better. Scented soaps often contain additives that only create further streaking rather than removing it.

Start with water.,
Wipe in the direction of the grain.,
Avoid abrasiveness.,
Wait until the appliance is cool.",How to Clean Brushed Stainless Steel1," For basic spills, just plain water will do the trick. Use a soft rag, and apply warm water to the surface. You can use this method to wipe up spills, as well as small stains. Wipe with clear water once the stain is up., If you look closely at the surface of brushed stainless steel, you'll notice it has a grain. It's important to wipe with the grain, rather than against it. If you wipe against the grain, you can end up damaging the surface., Anything that's too abrasive can scratch the surface of brushed stainless steel. That includes abrasive sponges and steel wool, but it also includes very hard water or gritty (dirty) water., If you're cleaning an appliance like an oven or a toaster, it's a good idea to wait until it's cool before cleaning. Lightly touch the appliance. If it feels cool, it's fine to clean it."

Evaluate the brass.,
Add salt to one half of a cut lemon.,
Scrub the brass.,
Finish with a dry cloth.",How to Clean Brass Naturally1," You should first check to see if the item is brass or brass-plated. If it's brass-plated, you need to be even gentler with it, as you don't want to scrub away the plating. A magnet won't stick to pure brass, but it will stick to brass-plated items. Therefore, if the magnet doesn't stick, you have pure brass., Start with a whole lemon. Cut the lemon in half, width-wise, so you have a good-sized scrubber that will squeeze out lemon juice as you rub. Sprinkle salt on the cut side of one of the halves. You can use whatever salt you prefer., Take the salted lemon half, and scrub the brass. The salt will work as a light abrasive, and the lemon juice will help remove grime. Work it in over all the brass. If you have a big piece, you may need to move to the second lemon half, adding salt to it first., Use a soft cloth to remove all the salt and lemon juice. You may need to switch out cloths halfway through. You can also rinse it, if you prefer, but make sure you dry it very well afterwards."

Check to see if the brass is solid.,
Look for lacquer.,
Wipe the object gently with soap and water.",How to Clean Brass‐Plated Items1," You'll want to clean brass-plated and solid brass items differently, so it's important to check first. The easiest way to check is to try to stick a magnet to it. Magnets won't stick to solid brass, but they will stick to brass-plated steel and other metals.If the brass is solid, you can follow some of the same general steps. However, solid brass can take slightly harsher chemicals, such as a strong brass cleaner, rather than just a mild one.;
, Brass-plated objects often have a thin coating of lacquer to help protect the brass. If the brass-plated item is lacquer-coated, you should stick to soap and water when cleaning it. Anything else will remove the lacquer.Unlacquered  (not comparable) items will tarnish over time, while lacquered items won't. However, lacquered items may show tiny black spots, as the lacquer cracks.
You can also test an inconspicuous place with a bit of brass cleaner. If it leaves a black spot on your rag, that means it's not lacquered. If it doesn't, it's likely lacquered, and you shouldn't clean it with anything harsh., Using a soft rag, wipe the brass-plated item down gently with dishwashing soap and water. A microfiber cloth is ideal. You don't want to scrub too hard, as you can rub off the brass or lacquer."

Bring water and cleaning agent to a boil.,
Test the crud’s bond.,
Dislodge the crud.",How to Clean Burnt Copper1," Fill a pot or pan with water. Add a few squirts of mild dish detergent and/or a generous splash of vinegar. If you’re cleaning anything other than a copper pot or pan (or cleaning the outside of a smaller pot or pan), place the item in the water. Set the burner to medium heat and bring to a boil.For heavy build-up of crusted-on materials, substitute the dish soap and vinegar with a cup (221 g) or more of baking soda for a more abrasive cleaning agent.;
, Wait at least fifteen minutes once the water comes to a boil. Then remove the copper with tongs (or the item’s handle if it wasn’t submerged). Use any pointed tool (like a butter knife or screwdriver) to prod at the offending material. If it only seems marginally looser, put it back in the boiling water. Otherwise, set it on a heat-safe surface and wait for it to cool enough to handle safely., Once the crud gives way when you poke at it, switch to a brush, sponge, spatula, or similarly soft item to avoid scratching the copper. Use this to brush or scrape off the crud. For especially heavy build-up:Combine baking soda and just enough water to create a thick paste. Apply an even coat of this over the copper before you start brushing or scraping.
Repeat as needed, since heavy build-up may require a lot of elbow work, during which time the crud may dry and crust over again.

Turn the iron on.,
Pour salt on a paper towel.,
Run the iron over the salt.,
Use salt and aluminum foil.,
Try salt and newspaper.,
Wipe with ammonia after using salt.,
Wipe down the iron after each use.,
Empty the water reservoir every time.,
Store the iron properly.",How to Clean an Iron with Salt," Turn the iron on to the highest setting and let it heat up. It will probably take several minutes for the iron to reach its highest heat level. There should be a light indicator on the iron that lets you know when it has reached the desired temperature.Remember that the iron will be quite hot, so you should take care not to burn yourself or other objects around you – especially things that could melt, like plastic.;
, Take several paper towels and fold them together until you get a compact square about the size of a CD case. Pour a bit of the salt, probably about one tablespoon, onto the paper towel.








For this option, you’ll need salt with larger grains (like rock salt, sea salt, or kosher salt).
If the salted paper towel doesn’t work, you can try pouring a bit of salt on a small cotton towel and repeating the process.

, Once you’ve let the iron heat up, run the iron over the paper towel with the salt on it. Spend a minute or two ironing the salt, which should clean the bottom of the iron completely. The dirt typically sticks to the salt, leaving you with a clean and shiny iron.








If there are still some stains left, try reapplying the salt and running the iron again.

, For tougher stains, simply pour one tablespoon of rock salt on a piece of aluminum foil and iron over the salted foil on the highest setting. This can help get rid of stains, or loosen things that are stuck to the bottom of the iron.








This works especially well for getting melted plastic off of the hot surface of an iron.
You can also use sea salt or kosher salt.

, Pour some salt on a piece of newspaper and run the iron over the surface. Be sure to use salt with larger crystals – like rock salt or sea salt. Spend at least one minute ironing over the salt to make sure you really get at the stain well.








This is particularly helpful if you are trying to remove something waxy that is stuck to the bottom of your iron.

, For extra tough stains, try combining a bit of ammonia with the salting method. Once you have finished ironing a paper towel (or cotton towel or piece of aluminum foil, depending on how tough the stain is), take a clean rag and dampen it with a bit of ammonia. Wipe the hot plate of the iron with the ammonia rag.








Remember to turn the iron off for this step, otherwise you risk burning yourself.
Be sure to wipe off the bottom of the iron with a clean rag after putting the ammonia on it so that you don’t transfer the pungent ammonia smell to the next thing you iron.

, The best thing you can do to prevent your iron from needing to be seriously cleaned is to perform routine cleanings and wipe downs after each use. When you finish using the iron each time, let the iron cool down and then give it a quick wipe down using paper towels and regular household cleaning solution.









Make sure you wash off any remainder of the cleaning solution after you finish cleaning so that it doesn’t accidentally transfer onto the next thing that you iron.

, Once you finish using the iron, you should dump out any remaining water from the iron’s water reservoir. Don’t try to conserve water by keeping the old water inside the iron between uses.








Leaving water in the iron while you aren’t using it can cause the water to become stagnant and create buildups of mineral deposits that can be difficult to clean later.

, When you are finished using the iron, make sure you give it plenty of time to cool down before you put it away. Irons should be completely cool to the touch before being stored. Put the iron in a place where it won’t be in the way – like in a cupboard or a closet.Make sure you put a protective covering over the iron (like a plastic bag) to prevent dust from settling on the machine between uses. This will help keep your iron cleaner over time and help protect it from corrosion and humidity.

, Most dirt and grime should come off with a dust mop. However, if anything does not come off during your weekly mopping, use a damp rag or towel to gently rub down any set in dirt. As epoxy floors do not easily build up dirt, most grime can be wiped off with water alone. Detergent, cleaners, and soap are rarely necessary unless you're deep cleaning spills or stains., If there are any exposed saw cuts in your floor, such as around the walls of the garage, vacuum any loose dirt or debris out of the grooves. Once a month, use a vacuum cleaner to vacuum dust out of these grooves and cracks to keep them clean.While it's easiest to use a vacuum cleaner, you can sweep dust out of saw cuts using a broom if you don't have one.

, If you notice any spills, such as grease from cars, after cleaning, you can spot clean these. Usually, they can be quickly wiped up with a soft cloth. If there is a film leftover, spritz some windex on the spill and then wipe it up with a paper towel."

Fill the pan with warm water.,
Add several drops of dish detergent.,
Bring to a boil.,
Cool and scrub the pan.",How to Clean a Scorched Pan1," Take your dirty pan, and add enough water to cover all of the scorched areas. You should add a two to three inches of additional water to the pan because some of it will evaporate when you heat it.Make sure to dry off the bottom of the pan after you’re done filling it with water. You don’t want to put it on the stove if there are drops of water that may fall onto the burner.;
, Water alone isn’t enough to remove scorch stains from your pan, so you’ll need to add a cleansing agent to get rid of the burnt film. Squeeze three to four drops of your usual dish detergent into the water and swirl the mixture around to spread the soap throughout the water.For very stubborn scorch marks, you may want to use dishwashing detergent in place of liquid dish soap. You can use a single tablet, several drops of liquid, or 1 to 2 tablespoons of powdered dishwashing detergent.

, Once you’ve combined the detergent and water, place the pan on the stove. Turn the heat up to high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Allow the water and dish detergent to boil for approximately 10 to 15 minutes to help loosen all of the debris from the bottom of the pan.Be sure to boil the water and dish detergent mixture, not just simmer it. You’ll know that it’s boiling when you see large bubbles rising from the bottom of the pan and it’s giving off nearly constant steam.

, After you’ve boiled the contents of the pan for approximately 10 minutes, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool completely, which should take approximately 20 minutes. Discard the water and detergent mixture -- you’ll likely notice that the pan already looks a little cleaner. Next, scrub it with dish detergent and hot water to remove the burnt film and debris.You may need to use some type of scrubbing sponge or tool to remove all of the scorch marks. Steel wool pads are effective, but they often scratch the bottom of the pan, which may cause further damage. Sponges that are covered with plastic netting are an ideal alternative because they help scrub away scorch marks but won’t scratch your pan.

Determine if you have brass-plated metal.,
Determine if your brass-plated handle is lacquered.,
Use ammonia or mild soap on unlacquered brass-plated handles.,
Utilize soapy water to clean lacquered brass-plated handles.,
Use a commercial cleaning product for heavily tarnished brass plate.,
Be especially gentle with brass-plated handles.",How to Clean Brass Handles3," Brass handles come in two varieties: brass-plated metal and solid brass. Brass-plated metals are composed of zinc, cast iron, or steel with a coat of brass plate over them. To determine whether your handles are brass-plated or solid brass, hold a magnet near the handle. If the magnet sticks to the handle, it is brass-plated rather than solid brass., Lacquered and unlacquered brass-plated handles require different cleaning methods. To determine if your brass-plated handle is lacquered, conduct a visual inspection. Lacquered handles will have a thin, clear coat covering them. Unlacquered handles will not have this coat.Most brass-plated handles are lacquered.

, Dab a soft cloth with ammonia or a mixture of mild soap and water. Wipe the brass handles until they sparkle. Dry the handles with a dry cloth.Always wear gloves when handling ammonia. Do not let it contact your skin.

, If your brass-plated handles are lacquered, you must use only the most gentle cleaning agents and methods. Mix a few drops of liquid dish soap with water until it is sudsy. Dab a clean cloth in the water and wipe the handle with it.Rinse the handle with a damp cloth, then dry it with a dry cloth.
Using commercial cleaning products or ammonia on lacquered handles will cause the lacquer coating to deteriorate.

, There are many commercial cleaning products that can help you clean your brass handles. The specific directions for these products vary with manufacturer. Typically, however, you can simply spray the product on the brass handle and wipe it off with a clean cloth.Popular brass cleaning products include Simichrome, Wenol, and Flitz.
Before using any cleaning product, consult manufacturer directions.

, When cleaning solid brass, you can use a fine-grain steel wool to remove gunk and tarnish. Brass-plated handles, however, are much more sensitive. Use only the softest cloth available when cleaning them."

Wear plastic gloves.,
Think about taking your brass handles to a professional.,
Coat your brass handles with oil.",How to Clean Brass Handles4," When cleaning your brass-plated or solid brass handles, wear disposable plastic gloves. This will help you avoid smudging them. Touching your brass handles means leaving behind natural oils from your hands, which can hasten tarnishing., If you’re interested in getting the brass handles of an antique dresser or similar piece of furniture cleaned, you might want to turn the job over to a specialist. That way, your brass handles will be treated appropriately and the odds of a successful cleaning will increase., After cleaning your brass handles, you can protect them from future tarnishing by rubbing a thin layer of olive, lemon, linseed, or mineral oil over them. Just dab a clean cloth or paper towel in an oil of your choice, then rub it along the surface of the brass handles."

Use an over-the-counter cleaner.,
Immerse your Black Hills Gold in boiling water.,
Clean the piece with rubbing alcohol.",How to Clean Black Hills Gold2," This product may contain a brush that you can use to clean your jewelry. If not, you can use a clean cotton cloth or towel. Dip a corner of the cloth into the liquid jewelry cleaner, and then apply the damp cloth to your Black Hills Gold piece. If the jewelry has sticky or oily residue on it, you may need to dip a soft toothbrush into the jewelry cleaner, and gently brush to clean the surface of the jewelry.You should be able to find a suitable jewelry cleaner at any local grocery store or drug store. If you can’t find the product, you may need to check at a hobby store or a jewelry store, which will certainly have a cleaner solution for sale.

, If you’d rather not go to the trouble of scrubbing your jewelry with a toothbrush or cloth, you can simply immerse it in boiling water. Heat a saucepan full of water on your stove, and, once it’s boiling, gently immerse your jewelry into the water and let it boil for about 15 minutes.The boiling water will clean grease and oil from the jewelry.


When removing the jewelry, be careful not to burn your fingers. Either let the water cool before grabbing the jewelry, or use a spoon to fish out the jewelry.
Once the Black Hills Gold is cool enough to touch, use a clean, dry cloth to blot it clean.

, Rubbing alcohol is an effective substance to clean jewelry with, including Black Hills Gold. Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto a soft cotton cloth, and use this to wipe clean any spots of dirt or grease on your jewelry. As always, when cleaning any jewelry, be careful not to scratch or damage the gold.However, if your Black Hills Gold jewelry contains gemstones that are attached with glue, you should avoid cleaning it with alcohol. The alcohol will corrode the glue, and may result in the gemstones falling out.

Handle jewelry with inset gems gently.,
Avoid cleaning Black Hills Gold jewelry with ammonia.,
Consult a jeweler if you’re uncertain about cleaning Black Hills Gold.",How to Clean Black Hills Gold3," Although the Black Hills Gold itself is relatively durable and will benefit from being scrubbed with a toothbrush or being boiled, inset gem stones may fall out or be damaged by this rough treatment.Do not boil or apply alcohol to jewelry with inset stones, and avoid excessive use of a toothbrush over inset stones as well.


The types of inset stones that may be placed in an item of Black Hills Gold jewelry include opals, pearls, and other semiprecious and precious stones.

, Although an ammonia and water mixture is occasionally recommended as a viable solution to clean Black Hills Gold, be aware that the ammonia can potentially permanently damage or discolor your gold. Use the other cleaning methods mentioned before attempting to clean with ammonia.If you do choose to clean gold with ammonia, make a weak solution (about 1:6 of ammonia and water) and submerge your jewelry for less than a minute. Leaving the gold in the solution for longer will damage the surface.

, If your jewelry is especially old, valuable, or has an unusual feature (for example, the piece has a heavy tarnish), you should consult a jeweler before cleaning the jewelry. The jeweler will be able to give you professional cleaning advice, and may prevent you from irreversibly damaging your jewelry.To locate a jeweler in your area, you can searching online.

Use a skate bearing cleaning kit.,
Stack the bearings onto your cleaning kit.,
Fill the cleaning container with citrus cleaner, alcohol, or solvent cleaner.,
Shake and soak the bearings.,
Dry and lubricate your bearings.,
Reinstall your bearings and wheels.",How to Clean Ball Bearings2," The easiest way to clean skate ball bearings is to use a specially made kit, but you can also make your own kit at home. Grab a sports drink bottle and cut hole in the cap large enough for a bolt that’s a quarter inch (0.6 cm) wide and six inches (15 cm) long. Run a gasket down the bolt’s length until it’s flush with the head, insert the bolt through the cap, then secure it to the cap using a washer and a nut.You can cut a ballpoint pen casing into quarter inch (0.6 cm) wide cylinders to create spacers to place between the bearings.If you want to purchase a skate ball bearing cleaning kit, you can find one online or at a skate shop.

, If you’re using a store bought kit, place a bearing casing onto the base, snap a spacer over it, then repeat the sequence until you’ve stacked all of the casings. If you’re using a homemade cleaning kit, slide the bearing casings down the bolt’s length and place a ballpoint pen spacer between each casing.Stacking the bearing casings instead of free washing them in a container will help prevent casings from scratching each other. It’ll also help keep the balls from falling out of the casings., After stacking the casings, fill your kit container or bottle with a cleaner.You can use a citrus-based cleaner, 90% pure isopropyl alcohol, or a solvent cleaner, such as acetone.Each cleaner has pros and cons. A citrus cleaner is the safest choice, but might leave a residue on the casings. Isopropyl alcohol and acetone are stronger and won’t leave residue, but are skin irritants and emit hazardous fumes.
Be sure to wear gloves if you choose 90% pure isopropyl alcohol or a solvent cleaner.
Don’t use WD-40 or oil to clean ball bearings or bearing casings. These will just cause buildup without actually removing any debris.

, Insert the stacked bearings into the cleaner-filled container and secure the lid. Shake the container for a few seconds, then let it sit for five to ten minutes to cut through buildup. After letting it sit, give the container another shake., Remove the casings from the container and unstack them. Use compressed air to thoroughly dry them.Once they’re dry, apply a few drops of lubricant using a hypodermic needle or pin.


Use either a lubricant made for skate ball bearings, sewing machine lubricant, or lubricant made for electronic devices. These products typically come with a needle applicator., Once you’ve lubricated your ball bearings, you can reassemble your bearings and wheels. Snap the rubber or metal seals back onto the bearing casings. Use a skate tool to reinsert the bearing casings back into the wheels’ centers, then fasten the wheels back onto your skates or skateboard.You can use a skateboard axle to pop the bearing casing back into place, but you might risk damaging the casing. Using a skate tool is the preferred method."

Take the wheels off of the bike.,
Remove the axle endcaps and rear freehub body.,
Pry off the seal on the cartridge bearing.,
Degrease and wipe the cartridge bearing.,
Use a grease gun to repack the cartridge with grease.,
Replace the cartridge seal and reinstall the wheels.",How to Clean Ball Bearings3," Many bikes have a quick release lever that you simply pull and turn counterclockwise. In addition to the quick release lever, most mountain bikes also have an axle that you’ll slide out after unfastening the quick release. Some bikes have heavy nuts that secure the wheels in place, which you can remove using a wrench., Once you’ve taken the wheels off of the bicycle frame, you’ll need to expose the cartridge that holds the ball bearings. For the front wheel, just twist or pop off the axle endcaps at the hub, or center of the wheel.For the rear wheel, you’ll also need to pull out the freehub body as well. Simply pull it out of the center of the wheel., Use a utility knife to carefully pry off the cartridge seal. Take care not to warp or damage the seal or the cartridge races, which hold the ball bearings in place.Be sure to store the seals and the other parts you removed in a safe place to avoid losing them.

, Use a rag to wipe away as much debris as possible from the cartridge. Grab an aerosol degreaser with a small straw, spray into the cartridge, then wipe away the degreaser. Spray into the cartridge with WD-40 to eliminate any water residue, as the degreaser will contain some water, then wipe away excess WD-40., Liberally repack the cartridge bearing with bicycle grease. A grease gun, which you can find online or at a bike shop, is the best way to access the cartridge’s tight spaces. If you live in a wet area, pack more grease into the cartridge to protect the bearings.Once you’ve cleaned and repacked one wheel, repeat the process on the other.

, Snap the seals back over the cartridge bearings. Reinsert the rear freehub body and pop the endcaps onto the wheel hubs. Realign the wheels with the bicycle frame and fasten them by tightening the quick releases or nuts."
"
Use cone spanners to remove the hub cone and axle.,
Lift the ball bearings out each side of the hub.,
Degrease and wipe the balls and bearing seat.,
Pack grease into the bearing seat before reassembling the hub.,
Insert the ball bearings back into each seat and add more grease.,
Replace the cone, spacers, and lug nut.",How to Clean Ball Bearings4," You’ll need a pair of thin cone spanners to disassemble a cup-and-cone hub. Place one cone spanner around the cone itself and the other spanner around the lug nut. Twist the lug counterclockwise to remove it.For the rear wheel, you’ll have to remove the cassette in order to access the cup-and-cone. You’ll need a cassette removal tool, which you can find online or at a bike shop, to fit into the cassette and loosen the locking nut.  
Set the lug nuts and any washers or spacers aside in proper order to make reassembly easier.

, Once you’ve removed the cone, you can access the ball bearings, which sit on each side of the hub. Use a scalpel blade or narrow utility knife to carefully pull the balls out from the seat on each side.There are also magnet tools, which look like magnetic sticks, that make it much easier to pull out the ball bearings.If you use a blade, spray a little grease onto it so the balls will stick to it. That’ll make it easier to pull them out from their seat.
Keep the ball bearings separate so you know which side is which.

, Spray the ball bearings with an aerosol degreaser and wipe them down with a rag. Fit a small straw into the nozzle of the aerosol degreaser and spray inside the bearing seat. Wipe inside the seat by wrapping your finger in a rag.Wear gloves when using a degreaser.

, Use your grease gun to pack a thick layer of grease into the bearing seat. Any excess will simply work it’s way out, so pack liberally and don’t worry about adding too much.If necessary, use your finger to work grease all around the bearing seat.

, When replacing the ball bearings, it’s possible to miss the seat, causing the balls to drop through the hub and come out the other side. To prevent this, you can place the axle through the hub, but in the opposite way that it would normally fit. That way, the tip of the axle will prevent the ball bearings from falling through, making it easier to slide them into their seat.Pack even more grease into the bearing seat after you slide the ball bearings back into place.
Once you’ve inserted the bearings one one side of the hub, repeat the process on the other side., Slide the axle through the hub and place the cone over it. Replace any washers or spacers you removed. Twist the lug onto the threaded axle by hand, then tighten it until it’s snug with the cone spacers using the cone spanners.For the rear wheel, place the cassette back onto the hub and tighten its locking nut using the cassette tool.

Sweep the floor first.,
Give your floor a deep mopping regularly.,
Soak and scrub off tire marks.,
Remove rust with kitchen scrubbing pads.",How to Clean an Epoxy Garage Floor2," Before addressing any major spills and stains, sweep your floor first using a regular broom or dust mop. It's important to remove any loose dust or debris before getting your floor wet. Wetting a dirty floor can result in dirt and debris simply getting pushed around in the cleaner., Give your epoxy garage floor a deep cleaning every three to four months. Use a foam mop over a string mop and a commercial cleaner made for epoxy floors. Most cleaners should be diluted in water first. Check your cleaner's instructions for the precise ratios to use. Place your cleaner in spray bottles and spray in on the floor. Rub it in using your foam mop, specially targeting any areas with stuck on dirt and debris. When you're done, dip your mop in a bucket of warm water and use this to rinse cleaner residue off the floor.When done, it's safe to let your floor air dry. However, you can also wipe it dry with paper towels if you need it dry right away.
If you do not want to use a commercial cleaner, you can mix half a cup of ammonia with a gallon of hot water.

, Use a commercial cleaner or a concrete degreaser on tire marks. Soak the marks with the cleaner or degreaser and let it sit on for a few minutes. Then, scrub the marks off using a stiff bristled nylon brush.For stubborn marks, you may need to add a second layer of cleaner or degreaser and then scrub again. If you find you're scrubbing very hard without any progress, stop and add another layer of your degreaser or cleaner. Scrubbing too hard can hurt your floor's finish.

, Take a scrubbing pad meant to be used in a kitchen. Use this to lightly scrub away at rust stains until you remove them. Do not use detergent, especially kitchen cleaners, on garage epoxy floors. The scrubbing pad alone is all you need to remove rust."
"
Wipe up spills promptly.,
Avoid acidic or soap-based cleaners.,
Use mats near doors.",How to Clean an Epoxy Garage Floor3," Epoxy garage floors are resistant to spills. If spills are treated as they occur, they should not set in and require special cleaning. If you see anything spilled on the garage floor, like motor oil, promptly wipe it up with a rag or paper towel. This will allow you to use commercial cleaners on your floor less often., Cleaners with acidic ingredients, like citrus cleaners, and soaps can leave an epoxy floor slippery. They also tend to be more abrasive, causing your floor to wear down faster over time. It's best to stick to cleaners specifically made for epoxy floors when choosing cleaners., Keep mats near doors going in and out of your garage. This way, people can wipe off snow, dirt, and household debris before entering the garage. This will prevent dirt, grime, and dust from building up on your floor."

Fill the pan with water.,
Add vinegar to the water and bring to a boil.,
Remove the pan from the stove and add baking soda.,
Scrub the pan clean.",How to Clean a Scorched Pan2," To being the cleaning process, add enough water to your scorched pan to cover the bottom. The amount of water necessary depends on the size of your pan, but 1 cup is a good starting point. If all of the scorched marks aren’t covered, add water until they are., Once you have enough water in the pan, it’s time to mix in some vinegar. Pour 1 cup into the water, and gently swirl the pan’s contents to combine the water and vinegar. Place the pan on the stove, and turn the heat up to high to bring the mixture to a boil. Allow it to boil for approximately 10 minutes.The amount of vinegar that you add to the pan will depend on the amount of water that you used. Keep the ratio 1 part water to 1 part vinegar.

, When the vinegar and water mixture is finished boiling, remove it from the stove. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the pan. The baking soda will react with the vinegar, causing fizzing and bubbling that will help loosen the scorched film and debris.The pan will be hot when you add the baking soda, so be careful not to touch it and burn yourself.
Allow the baking soda and vinegar to fizz for as long as it takes for the pan to cool.
You can also use cream of tartar in place of baking soda to clean a scorched pan. However, you should mix 1 tablespoon of the cream of tartar with 1 cup of water and omit the vinegar before adding it in the pan.
While baking soda can work well on a stainless steel pan, you shouldn’t use it or any other alkaline-based cleaning product on anodized aluminum cookware.

, Once you’re sure that the pan is cool, discard the water, vinegar, and baking soda mixture, and clean the pan with hot, soapy water. Use a sponge with plastic netting or brush to scrub at the bottom of pan, and remove the scorched debris.While it may help to use a sponge with netting or a scrub brush while you’re washing the pan, the baking soda and boiling water should have sufficiently loosened the film and debris so it’s easy to remove.
If there are any stubborn scorch marks that won’t scrub free, mix some baking soda with a few drops of water to form a paste. Apply it to the problem spots and allow it to sit for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before cleaning the pan as usual.
For extremely stubborn cases, you may need to repeat the entire process one or more times.

Make sure your pan isn’t non-stick.,
Put on gloves and open a window.,
Apply oven cleaner to bottom of the pan.,
Cover and set outside.,
Scrub the pan clean and rinse well.",How to Clean a Scorched Pan3," While oven cleaner can be effective in getting rid of scorch marks, it should be used as a last resort because it is extremely caustic and may discolor the pan. You should never use it on a pan with a non-stick or other protective coating, though, because it will strip off the coating and ruin the pan.Because oven cleaner has the potential to damage cookware, you should only use it if you’ve tried other methods of cleaning your scorched pan and they’ve failed. If you’re planning to toss the pan anyway, it’s a worth a try to use the oven cleaner.

, Oven cleaner contains caustic chemicals that give off very strong fumes, so it’s important to take safety precautions before you use it. Cover your hands with a pair of rubber gloves to keep your skin safe from the chemicals. You should also make sure that your kitchen is well-ventilated before spraying the oven cleaner, so open a window or two if possible.If you’re especially sensitive to fumes, you may want to wear a dust mask over your nose and mouth when you’re using the oven cleaner.
Be sure to read all of the safety warnings on the oven cleaner’s packaging so you’re aware of any other safety precautions that you should take.

, Once you’re prepared to work with the oven cleaner, spray it over the scorched areas of the pan. Because the cleaner is so caustic, you don’t want to use any more than is necessary so cover the bottom of the pan with a light layer. You can use a brush to ensure that it’s spread over the entire pan.While spray oven cleaners formulas are usually the most common, you can also find cream and foam formulas that may work better when you’re cleaning a scorched pan.

, In order for the oven cleaner to fully penetrate the scorched areas and loosen the film and debris, you need to let it sit on the pan for at least a half hour. Because of the fumes, it’s best to place the pan outside while the cleaner on it. Cover the pan with a lid, and set it on a table or ledge outside your home.If you don’t have any area outside that you can set the pan, open a window and set it on the window ledge.

, After the cleaner has sat on the pan for approximately a half hour, use a scrub brush or sponge to scour the pan. The scorched film and debris should lift right off. Once you’ve cleaned the pan completely, make sure to rinse it extremely well to ensure that there’s no residue from the oven cleaner left on the surface.If you’re concerned about oven cleaner residue being left behind on the pan, wipe it down with a dry towel after you’ve rinsed it initially to see if anything comes off on the towel. You should definitely rinse it again if you notice any film, though you may want to rinse it again even if the pan is clean to be safe.

Determine if you have brass-plated metal.,
Wipe the brass hinge with soapy water.,
Use ammonia on unlacquered brass plate.",How to Clean Brass Hinges1," There are two kinds of brass hinges: solid brass hinges, and hinges made of brass-plated steel, zinc, or cast iron. Place a magnet next to the brass hinge you’re interested in cleaning. If it sticks, you’ll know it is not made of solid brass.If the brass hinge you’re interested in cleaning is made of brass-plated zinc, cast iron, or steel, clean it very gently or the brass coating might come off.;
, Mix hot water with a few drops of liquid dish soap. There is no need to measure the volume of soap or water – just get the solution sudsy. Dip a warm sponge or cloth in the water and wipe the hinge down.After you’ve given it a thorough once-over, dip an old toothbrush in the water and clean any crevices or hard-to-reach places that you weren’t able to wipe down during your first cleaning.

, If your brass-plated hinges are unlacquered, you could wipe the hinge with an old toothbrush or rag dipped in ammonia if soapy water doesn’t do the trick. Rinse the hinges off in your sink beneath swiftly-flowing water. Dry with a clean, soft cloth.Do not use this method if your hinges are lacquered, as you will damage the coating.
To determine if your brass-plated hinges are lacquered, conduct a visual inspection. The lacquer forms a thin, clear shell over the brass-plated hinge.
Brass plate is almost always lacquered.

Use a commercial cleaning product.,
Smear a tomato-based product on the hinge.,
Make a vinegar paste.,
Clean the hinge with a lemon.,
Create a paste from cream of tartar.,
Combine baking soda and vinegar.,
Coat the hinges in yogurt.,
Simmer the hinges in milk.,
Remove paint from your hinges with a crockpot.",How to Clean Brass Hinges2," A wide variety of commercial cleaning products can help you clean brass. While the specific directions for these products vary with manufacturer, generally you will spray the product on the brass hinge, then wipe it down with a clean cloth.Popular brass cleaning products include Wright’s Premium Brass Cleaning Polish and Brasso Multipurpose Polish.
Test the cleaning product on an inconspicuous area of the hinge before applying it to the whole thing. If the cleaning product causes the brass plate to flake off, discontinue use of that product and try another instead.
Consult manufacturer directions before using any brass cleaning product.

, Apply a thin patina of ketchup, marinara sauce, or tomato paste to the brass hinge using a paper towel or hand cloth. Allow the tomato-based product to remain on the brass hinge for about 60 minutes. Dip a clean cloth or sponge in hot, soapy water, then scrub the brass hinge.This technique also works with Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce.

, Combine equal parts vinegar, salt, and flour. For instance, you might combine two tablespoons of vinegar, two tablespoons of salt, and two tablespoons of flour. Smear this paste across the surface of the brass hinge. Wait for about 60 minutes. Rinse the hinge off with warm water. Wipe it down with a dry cloth until it shines., Cut a lemon in half and remove the seeds from one half. Cover the half of the lemon you removed the seeds from with salt. Rub the face of the lemon (the flat side covered in salt) over the brass hinge.As you rub the hinge, add additional coats of salt to the lemon as it flakes off.
Wipe the hinge down with a clean cloth.

, Combine two tablespoons of cream of tartar and one tablespoon of lemon juice. Rub the paste on the hinge using a clean paper towel or an old toothbrush. Allow the paste to sit for 30 minutes. Then, dip a clean cloth in warm water and wipe the paste away., Mix equal parts white vinegar and baking soda in a bowl with steep sides. For example, you could combine two tablespoons vinegar and two tablespoons baking soda. The ingredients will fizz when combined. Dip a soft-bristled brush or a soft cloth in the mix and wipe down the brass hinge for a minute or two. Wipe the hinge clean with a damp rag, then dry it with a clean dish cloth., Use a spatula to lightly cover the hinge in plain yogurt. Try to stand the hinges on their edges so as to coat the maximum surface area possible with yogurt. Allow the yogurt to dry overnight. Rinse the hinges thoroughly using warm water. Use a toothbrush to get the yogurt out of any recesses where it might have coalesced., Another dairy-based cleaning solution involves combing equal parts water and milk. For instance, you might mix five tablespoons of water and five tablespoons of milk in small pot. Whatever volume of each you choose to combine, ensure it coats the hinges completely. Place the hinges in the pot, bring it to a boil, then turn the heat to its lowest setting.The amount of time it takes to get your brass hinges clean by simmering them in milk depends on the extent of grime and tarnish the hinges have acquired. Use tongs to pull the hinges out every 10 minutes and examine them.
If they’re clean, turn the stovetop off and rinse your hinges in water.
If the hinges are not clean, drop them back in their milk bath.

, Place your brass hinges in a crockpot. Cover the hinges with water. Set the crockpot to low and let the hinges “cook” for a few hours. Pull the hinges out using tongs or just conduct a visual inspection to discern whether the paint is coming off.If the paint is coming off, remove it and restore the hinge to its rightful place.
If it is not, place it back in the crockpot for another few hours.
If, after another dip in the crockpot, the paint is still not coming off or has only partially come off, rub a cloth dampened with mineral spirits over the entire surface of the hinge. This should further loosen the paint.
This technique also works for removing lacquer from brass hinges.

Use soft cloths to clean your brass hinges.,
Apply oil after cleaning your brass hinges.,
Avoid touching your brass hinges.",How to Clean Brass Hinges3," Abrasive scrubbers made of steel wool or brushes with metal bristles will scratch your brass hinges. Instead, always clean your brass hinges with a clean, soft towel or dish cloth., A thin layer of oil can prevent brass from tarnishing. Dab a clean cloth with a bit of linseed, olive, lemon, or mineral oil. Wipe the brass hinge lightly but thoroughly with the oil of your choice., Touching the brass hinges can leave behind fingerprints, and the oils in your hands will hasten tarnishing. To keep your brass hinges looking new, adopt a “hands-off” policy."
"
Wash your hands first.,
Hold the record by the edge.,
Try canned air.",How to Clean a Record1," If you're going to handle records for cleaning, thoroughly scrub your hands first. That prevents you from transferring as much dirt and natural oil from your hands to the records, which helps keep them cleaner.When washing your hands, use soap and water, and scrub for at least 20 seconds, getting in between your fingers as you do.;
, To keep oils off the record, hold the record by pressing your hands along two opposite edges. Try not to touch the grooved part where the music plays. You can also use the paper label to hold the disc., It may be that you don't need to use a cleaning solution to clean the disc. You may be able to blow the majority of the dust and dirt off the disc using canned air, making the playback much better without using chemicals. You can find canned at big boxed stores near the electronics.It can help to blow off the record ahead of cleaning, anyway, so you don't scratch the record when you rub against the dust."
"
Try a record brush first.,
Warm up distilled water.,
Rub the record.",How to Clean a Record2," If the record isn't that dirty, a brush meant specifically to clean records might be your best bet for cleaning. These brushes are designed to get in the grooves, while be soft enough not to scratch your record. Simply run the brush over the record, following the direction of the grooves.You can find a record brush online or a specialty music store. Look for a small hand-sized scrubber brush.

, Warm water can help dissolve the dirt on your records. However, make sure it is just lukewarm, not hot, as that can hurt your records. You should be able to stick your hand in it easily. How much you warm up depends on how many records you have to clean. Start with a cup.Distilled water is better because it doesn't have the minerals and other additions that your tap water has. It can remove much of the grime on your records.

, Start near the middle, following the direction of the grooves. Move outward in a spiraling circle. Don't get the label wet. Once you reach the outer edge, move back the other direction, going inward in a spiraling circle. Switch to the other side.Let the record dry completely.

Rinse and dry.",How to Clean a Record3," You can't just pick up any old cleaning product to use on a record. They are too delicate for that, especially older records.Try a commercial cleaning product without alcohol, or if you're really in a pinch, a bit of dishwashing soap.There's some debate about whether or not to use isopropyl alcohol on records. Some say it's safe, while others say it can damage the record, especially older records. It's probably best to avoid any cleaner with alcohol in it.

, If you're using a commercial product, you likely won't need to do anything to the solution but apply it. For dishwashing soap, heat up about a cup of distilled water until its warm. Add in a drop or two of dishwashing soap and stir. You won't need a whole lot.Dip a microfiber cloth into the solution. Wring it out very well. You only want it lightly damp., Rub the solution in, starting in the middle and working your way out. Make sure to follow the patterns of the grooves. Once you reach the outer edge, move back in towards the middle going the opposite way. Repeat if needed.Avoid getting the label wet.

, Once you've applied the soap, you need to take it off. Heat a small amount of distilled water until warm. With a clean microfiber cloth, dip the cloth in the water, and then wring it out thoroughly. Follow the same pattern on the record that you did before, moving outward and inward on both sides of the record. Once you're done, let it air dry."

Use a cloth that doesn't scratch.,
Start with a bit of soap.,
Rub along the grain.,
Avoid intentionally oxidized details.",How to Clean a Silver Necklace1," A microfiber cloth or a jewelry-polishing cloth are ideal for polishing your necklace. These cloths won't scratch your jewelry like paper towels or even tissues can. You want something soft and lint-free for polishing.If you need to get into small areas, try a cotton swab.;
, If your silver necklace is only mildly tarnished, you can start by using a bit of dish soap. In a cup of warm water, add a few drops of the soap. Stir it up, then wet your cloth with the solution to start polishing your necklace., You may think the ideal polishing motion is circular. However, that can actually scratch up your silver. A better idea is to rub back and forth, making sure to go along the grain of the metal, which is less likely to scratch it.With the chain, you may need to gently rub it between two fingers, using the cloth.
Continue to move to clean sections of the cloth, so you're not adding tarnish back on to the necklace.
You can also use a clean soft-bristled toothbrush for detailed areas, though try not to brush too hard.

, In some cases, the person who made the necklace may have let certain parts of the jewelry darken to highlight details. If you have a piece like that, you need to avoid polishing those areas so you don't lose some of the beauty of your piece."

Assess the need to clean.,
Buy a non-ionic cleanser.,
Gather your supplies.",How to Clean a Gravestone1," The first thing you should do is to ask yourself whether or not the stone actually needs cleaning. Many people mistake the signs of aging for dirt or grime. Marble and other materials will naturally fade over time.Conservationists caution against an aggressive cleaning program. Every cleaning has the potential to damage the stone, even if you are exceedingly gentle.
Avoid cleaning the stone as a way to honor your loved one. If the stone doesn't need to be cleaned, you can find other ways to honor their memory.
If the stone has been dirtied by mud or other materials, than of course it is ok to clean it. Just be aware that once you begin cleaning a stone, you will find that you need to do it on a regular basis.;
, Time and weather can cause a gravestone to look less than pristine. If you notice the gravestone has become dirty, you will want to take time to carefully clean it. Make sure to choose the right products.Harsh chemicals can damage stones. Choose a mild, gentle soap.
Purchase a non-ionic cleanser. These soaps are available at retailers that sell conservation and janitorial supplies.
Non-ionic soaps do not contain the harsh salts that can damage grave stones. Read the label carefully to ensure that it says ""non-ionic"". Ask a member of the sales team for help if you are unsure.

, Once you have your cleanser, you are ready to gather the rest of your supplies. You will need clean water. If the cemetery has a faucet or hose you can use, take a clean bucket with you to hold the water. You can purchase gallons of distilled water to take with you if you are unsure if there will be running water near by. You should still take a bucket so that you can easily dip your supplies into the water.
Take some soft, clean cloths with you. Old towels or t-shirts will work fine.
Purchase sponges. Natural are best, as they will be less likely to damage the stone.
Take non-metallic scrubbing pads and brushes with you. Choose a few different brushes with a variety of stiffness levels.

Pick a neutral cleaner.,
Test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area.,
Use a little abrasion if needed.,
Scrub it down.",How to Clean Anodized Aluminum1," The best cleaners for anodized aluminum are in the pH range of six to eight. Seven is neutral (as opposed to acidic or alkaline), so you want cleaners that are close to neutral.Anything too acidic or too basic can damage the surface.Avoid cleaners with chlorine.
Dishwashing soap or Bar Keepers Friend are a good choices.
While you may reach for baking soda as an easy and natural cleaner, it's not a good choice for anodized aluminum, as it is on the basic side of the pH scale. It can end up damaging the metal, which you don't want. However, the opposite is also true: acidic cleaners aren't great either. Basically, don't use anything too harsh on anodized aluminum.;
, Before you use the cleaner on the whole area, try it out on an area that can't be seen well. Make sure the cleaner doesn't stain or damage the anodized aluminum before using it to clean the rest of the aluminum., A sponge with a bit of abrasion can help clean the tough surface of anodized aluminum. However, stick to something with mild abrasive properties, such as a scrubby sponge, not a steel wool scrubber. If it's only lightly soiled, stick to a clean rag or washcloth., Scrub the area with soap and water, focusing on particularly dirty areas. Start with a less abrasive tool, such as a clean rag or washcloth. If that doesn't work, use the scrubby side of a sponge to clean it off.Rub the metal in the direction of the grain.If you're washing an anodized aluminum pot, make sure you always wash it by hand. It shouldn't go in the dishwasher. Also, never plunge a hot pot into water, as it can warp it."

Polish the nickel with a soft cloth.,
Prepare a solution of soapy water.,
Wash the nickel plating.,
Rinse off the soap.,
Dry it off.",How to Clean Nickel Plating1," Before trying anything else, see how much grime you can clean by wiping it away. Many grease spots, smudges, and patches of grime can be buffed away with cloth and a little bit of warm, running water. Use a soft, non-abrasive cloth and rub down the nickel plating, applying extra pressure and attention to dirtied areas. Use small, circular motions to buff away the grime., Cleaning with soap and water is always gentler than using acid and should be tried first. Choose a mild dishwashing detergent. Fill a container full of warm water and add the detergent until the water appears soapy. Hot water, cold water, and abrasive soap will all damage the plating.

, The way you do this up to you and the supply of soapy water you have. Small objects can be washed in or near a container of soapy water. For larger objects such as nickel-plated stoves or immobile objects such as shower heads, take a soft cloth, dip it in the water, and use that to buff out the stains.Avoid using harsh scrubbers as much as possible, as they damage nickel plating.

, Run the plated object under running warm water. For larger, immobile objects, gather more clean water. Pour the water on the area or use a soft, clean cloth dipped in water to remove the soap.


Try doing this once a year to keep the staining and stress on the nickel plating to a minimum.

, Take a clean, soft cloth. Pass it over the wet areas. Make sure you remove all the water so it doesn’t seep into the nickel. This also gives you a chance to check for any remaining soap that needs to be removed. Keep working with the cloth until the plating is dry.

Try other polishes.,
Apply the paste.,
Scrub the silver.,
Rinse the silver.",How to Clean a Silver Necklace2," If your jewelry is more tarnished, you may need to get actual jewelry polish to clean the necklace. Alternatively, you can make a paste of baking soda and water and rub it into the necklace as a polish.Another option is half a cup of lemon juice with a tablespoon of olive oil.You can also use toothpaste. The ingredient in the toothpaste that polishes the silver is hydrated silica, so look for that ingredient; tartar control toothpastes will have more of this ingredient. However, whatever you use on your teeth is likely fine for silver,though gel varieties likely won't work as well., Put a small dab of the paste on the necklace. If you have precious or semi-precious stones on your necklace, this method may not be the best one, though you can try to avoid the stone. Just a pea-sized dab should be enough, and you can always add more later., For this part, you can start out just using your fingers, if you'd like, though only do so if you're using a natural paste; grab a microfiber cloth if you're using professional silver polish. Rub the paste into the silver, including the chain if it's also tarnished. Basically, it's like your rubbing soap into the silver, but you're using a paste instead.You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush (one you're not going to brush with!), but you can end up scratching it if you try to brush too hard., Once the tarnish is mostly gone, run the necklace under water. Carefully wash off all the paste, as any left on will look funny. You can repeat the process, as well, if you didn't manage to get all the tarnish off."
"
Set up the bath.,
Create the solution.,
Let the necklace soak in the solution.,
Remove the necklace.",How to Clean a Silver Necklace3," Start with an aluminum pie plate or a bowl with aluminum foil covering the inside. Add a tablespoon (15 milliliters) of salt to the plate. Next, add a tablespoon of either water softener powder OR baking soda.While some people use this method on necklaces with precious or semi-precious stones, it could cause damage, so it's better not to risk it if it is valuable. Similarly, it's best not to try this method on antique or fragile silver.
This process will remove all the tarnish, including decorative oxidized areas (black areas put in place to create a design).
You can also add 1/2 a cup (118 milliliters) of white vinegar at this point. Keep in mind, vinegar will cause the baking soda to react, so watch for overflow., Next, pour in hot water. A cup (237 milliliters) or so will be enough. It should be close to boiling, but it doesn't need to be boiling. Stir the water, making sure the salt and baking soda are fully dissolved into it., Once the solution is ready, put the necklace in the solution. It should be touching the aluminum, so that the tarnish will move from the silver to the aluminum. Let it soak for a couple of minutes. You can do a bit more if the necklace is especially tarnished., Use tongs or a fork to take the necklace out. With a microfiber, polish any areas on the necklace that need a bit more work. Be gentle with more fragile areas. Dry the piece off, and put it away."

Check for damage.,
Clean a granite headstone.,
Remove growth.,
Clean a marble gravestone.,
Use snails.,
Consult an expert.",How to Clean a Gravestone2," When you arrive at the gravestone, take a few minutes to assess the stone. Look for any obvious signs of damage. Check the front, sides, and top of the gravestone.Cracks are an obvious sign of damage. Flaking is also an indication that the stone is damaged.
If you see signs of damage, clean very cautiously. Damage indicates that the stone is weakened.
Avoid putting pressure on the weakened areas. It is better to leave some dirt than to put additional stress on the stone.

, Once you have checked out the stone, you are ready to start actually cleaning. Follow the directions on your cleanser. Mix it with the proper ratio of water.Dampen your sponges in your bucket of water. Once they are wet, gently begin wiping down the surface of the stone.
After you have removed the first layer of dirt or grime, you can use your brushes. Wet your brushes, then use them to gently scrub each part of the stone.
It is best to start at the bottom of the stone and work your way up. This will help you to avoid leaving streaks.

, Sometimes you will discover growth on the gravestone. Since it is exposed to nature's elements, this is completely normal. Lichen is especially common.Lichen are living organisms that are similar to a fungi. They come in many different colors, such as grey, green and yellow.
You can remove the lichen with an ammonia mixture. Combine one part ammonia with four parts water.
Using a clean sponge, gently scrub the affected area with the ammonia mixture. After you are done, rinse with clean, plain water.

, It is important that you know what type of stone you are dealing with. Different types will require different cleaning methods. Marble needs to be treated even more gently than granite.Pre-wet the stone with clean water. If there is growth, remove using a wooden scraper.
Apply non-ionic cleanser. Use the same method you would use for a granite stone. Repeat this process approximately every 18 months. Cleaning more frequently can weaken the marble.
Limestone is another popular choice for headstones. Clean limestone using the same method as the one used to clean marble.

, When it comes to cleaning gravestones, natural methods might sometimes be best. Some people have effectively used snails to clean their stones. This method is the most environmentally friendly.Snails consume many of the materials that grow on gravestones. For example, they will eat lichens, mold, and fungus.
Create a small tent over the gravestone. Use polyethylene to cover the stone, and use pieces of wood to keep it on the ground.
You can likely find several snails on surrounding graves. Collect them and place them in the enclosure that you have made. Make sure to poke several small holes for ventilation.
Check back on your snails after a few hours. If they were hungry, the stone will be pretty clean.

, If you have any concerns about the state of the gravestone, it is a good idea to talk to an expert. For example, an expert will be able to tell you the approximate age of your stone. He will also be able to definitively identify the material.Contact the cemetery to ask if they can recommend someone you can speak to. Conservationists typically know a lot about gravestones.
You can also reach out to a local museum. The staff can likely recommend an expert. Make sure to ask about the proper cleaning method and frequency for your particular stone.

Rinse the metal thoroughly.,
Move from top to bottom.,
Dry off the area.",How to Clean Anodized Aluminum2," Once the aluminum is clean, wash it off until the surface is free from residue. Any residue left on the aluminum could damage it. This step is especially important if you used any kind of harsh cleaner. It needs to be removed from the surface., When rinsing, it's important to start at the top and work your way down. That way, you're not rinsing residue back on to an area you've already cleaned off. It's more efficient and better for the metal overall., If possible, dry the metal off with a cloth to prevent streaking and spots. Plus, using a cloth can help remove any remaining residue. However, if the area is too big, you can just let it dry by itself. If you notice streaking, use a cloth on it to remove the streaking."
"
Buff out rub marks with an abrasive pad.,
Consider retreatment with wax.,
Apply other types of protective coatings.",How to Clean Anodized Aluminum3," If you have rub marks on your surface, try using a somewhat abrasive pad (like an abrasive sponge) on it. It should take out minor rub marks on the surface, helping it to look nice again., If your aluminum had an additional coating, such as beeswax, it can be beneficial to reapply a layer after cleaning.You'll likely need to melt beeswax first, then apply it with a rag, rubbing it into the metal., You can use other protective coatings to seal your aluminum, applied in different ways. For instance, you can paint on a protective coating, letting it even out on its own as you go.You can also use methylated spirits or any number of spray products meant to seal anodized aluminum."
"
Polish with metal polish.,
Apply a metal cleaner on discolorations.,
Scrub the plating.",How to Clean Nickel Plating2," When your nickel plating isn’t dirty enough to warrant harsher cleaning methods, apply a non-abrasive metal polish. Chrome polish works well on nickel plating. Apply a small amount of the polish to the plating, then wipe the surface in circular motions as you did while cleaning.Alternatively, you can try this step after using other cleaning methods in order to make your nickel plating shine.

, Find a non-abrasive metal cleaner at the store. Chrome cleaner works well on nickel plating. Apply the cleaner directly to the stained areas, particularly the green discolorations that build up on nickel with ease. Let it sit for a minute.WD40, which penetrates oil, can also be used.
Oven cleaners are another option and are useful for removing grease.
You may wish to test this method on a small spot not readily visible. If the plating is especially thin, the steel wool or scrubber will cause damage.

, After applying the bottled cleaner, try using a cloth first spread it over the plating. You can also use steel wool or a soft scouring pad on stubborn stains and discolorations. Use small, circular motions to work in the cleaner. Be as gentle as possible to avoid causing scratches to the metal.

Prepare a vinegar cloth.,
Scrub the dirty areas.,
Make a solution of vinegar and water.,
Soak the nickel in the solution.,
Rinse the plating.",How to Clean Nickel Plating3," Vinegar is a mild acid that has great effect on stains. Pour a small quantity of vinegar into a bowl. Soak a clean, soft cloth in the vinegar. Wring out the excess.

, Apply the vinegar cloth and gently attempt to buff out the stains. Move the cloth in circular motions with a gentle touch to avoid stressing the nickel as much as possible. Re-soak the cloth as needed., For stubborn stains, you may need to soak the nickel plating. Combine four parts water with one part vinegar in a container that will either contain the nickel piece or hold enough solution to put on the stains.Do not use straight vinegar. It is often too abrasive to expose to thin nickel coatings for extended periods.
Nickel plating is easily damaged by acid, so vinegar cleaning should be done sparingly on stubborn stains.
You can heat up your mixture to give it a little more cleaning power if you desire. This should only be done if the object won’t be soaked in it.

, Soak the nickel-plated item in the solution for several hours. The stains should have begun to lift. Alternatively, pour the vinegar solution over the object and let it rest for 30 minutes. Repeat as necessary.

, Use warm running water or apply a soft cloth dampened in water. Make sure all the vinegar is gone. Vinegar left on the plating will continue to wear away at it. Wipe with a second cloth if necessary to make sure it is all gone.

Prepare an ammonia pad.,
Scrub the dirty areas.,
Make a solution of ammonia and water.,
Soak the object in the solution.,
Rinse the plating.",How to Clean Nickel Plating4," Ammonia, like vinegar, is effective on stains. Pour a small amount of pure household ammonia into a bowl. Drip a scouring pad or rag into it.

, Apply your pad or rag gently to the object. Scrub with increasing intensity on the deep stains. This is best done on pure nickel to minimize the abrasion from the pad and cleaner., For a more intense cleaning solution, combine one part ammonia to three parts water. Never submerge the nickel plating in straight ammonia; after 30 minutes it will cause the plating to chip and flake., Place your object in the container. You can also pour the solution over the object. Let it sit in the ammonia mixture for up to 30 minutes.

, Use warm, running water to wash away the ammonia. Another option is to use clean, soft rag dipped in warm water. Run the water or rag over your plated item, making sure all the ammonia is removed.

Choose the right stone.,
Keep a record.,
Decorate the area.",How to Clean a Gravestone3," When you have to bury a loved one, there are many choices that you have to make. Picking the right stone is an important decision. Take some time to think about the stone that is right for the situation.First, choice the type of marker you want. You can look for upright, flat, or obelisk markers.
Choose your material. Markers come in a variety of materials, such as marble, sandstone, and granite. Granite is cost effective and very sturdy.
Talk to the cemetery. Check the regulations about size and type of marker before you make a purchase. There may be guidelines you need to follow.

, Gravestones to not require regular cleaning. Although it might seem natural to want to frequently clean the stone, resist the urge. Instead, you should clean the stone approximately 18-24 months. Some will require even less frequent cleanings.Write down the date each time you clean the stone. This will help you prevent over cleaning.
Talk to the cemetery about maintenance plans. Some sites may offer service plans. They will take care of the cleaning for you.

, In addition to properly maintaining the gravestone, there are other ways that you can honor your loved one. Consider decorating the grave site. Doing so can help you feel connected to the departed.You can leave flowers near the headstone. This is especially nice to do on holidays, anniversaries, or birthdays.
You can also leave small mementos at the burial site. For example, a baseball for a sports fan.
Ask the cemetery for a list of regulations. Some materials may not be allowed to be left behind.

Treat your drain with white vinegar, baking soda, and hot water.,
Treat dirty drains with a biological cleaner.,
Scour out a stinky disposal with ice, salt, and lemon peels.",How to Clean Drains1," This can help eliminate odors caused by the buildup of bacteria, grease, and organic residue in your drain. It can also help clean out residue to prevent a future clog. Pour ½ of a cup (118 ml) of baking soda down your drain, followed by ½ a cup (118 ml) of white vinegar. Cover or plug the drain immediately and let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes. Next, boil some water in a kettle or saucepan and pour the boiling water down the drain.A solution of baking soda and vinegar can also be used to clean stains and mineral deposits off of the area around the outside of your drain.;
, Regular preventative treatments can keep your drains smelling nice, get rid of potentially harmful bacteria and mold, and prevent future clogs. Biological or enzymatic drain cleaners, like Zep or Citra-Drain, are relatively safe and environmentally friendly. They are also safer for your septic system than most chemical cleaners. Follow the packaging directions for treating a drain to eliminate odors and buildup., If a garbage disposal runs well but smells bad, this probably means that organic residue and bacteria have begun to build up on the grinders. Fill the disposal with a few cups of ice cubes, a handful of course salt, and a few lemon peels. Let it grind this mixture for a bit to scour out buildup with an ""abrasive"" that will not hurt its steel grinders."

Use a plunger to clear a clog.,
Use a barbed plastic drain cleaning tool.,
Use a gas- or water-powered cleaner to blow out clogs.,
Use a heating pad to melt grease clogs.,
Treat buildup biologically.,
Call a plumber.",How to Clean Drains2," Plungers are great for unclogging toilets, but they also work well on clogged sinks and tubs. Fill the sink or tub with enough water to cover the drain and bottom. Press the plunger firmly down over the drain to create a tight seal and give it several quick pumps.Bellows-style plungers may work best.
If you have a double-bowl sink, you may need to close one of the drains with a plug or a washcloth before plunging in order to create a complete seal.
Keep a separate plunger for the toilet.

, Barbed drain cleaners, like the Zip-It Bath and Sink Hair Snare, are a great solution for clogs near the drain opening. Just slide the tool into the drain and pull it out. The back-angled barbs will pull out hair and other materials that have built up in your drain.

, Aerosol drain cleaners can blast clogs out of a drain with compressed air or gas. Water bladders use pressurized water to accomplish the same result.If you choose a gas-powered drain cleaner, you will need to make sure the device fits over your drain properly. It may be necessary to use an adapter. If you don’t create a good seal, the blast could be directed back at you instead of into the drain.
Water-based drain cleaning devices typically attach to a garden hose, but you may be able to get an adapter that will allow you to attach it to an indoor faucet.

, Wrap a heating pad around the trap pipe under the sink. Turn the heating pad on to warm up the pipe, then run hot water through the drain until the grease clears. Add a little dish detergent to help dissolve the grease., Use an enzymatic or bacterial drain cleaner overnight periodically for slow or partially clogged drains. Follow the directions on the package.Biological cleaners are slower to work and less effective than chemical cleaners, but they are safer for you, your plumbing, and the environment.
Biological cleaners may require repeated treatments to be effective.

, If all else fails, or if you don’t feel confident that you can safely handle the problem yourself, call in a professional to clear your clogged drain.If you live in a rental property, contact your landlord or property manager so that they can call someone for you."

Buy an inexpensive cable auger, or plumber's snake.,
Remove the trap under the sink, if necessary.,
Slowly push the auger cable or snake into the pipe opening.,
Keep cranking the auger until you meet resistance.,
Turn the crank the other way to withdraw the auger from the pipe.,
Test your drain and repeat the process, if necessary.",How to Clean Drains3," Augers are great for clearing deep clogs that can’t be reached by other means. If you don’t want to buy one, you may be able to rent one from a hardware store. While the cables coiled on a spool come in many lengths, a 25-foot (7.5 m) cable should be plenty for most household needs.You should also get rubber gloves with a good gripping surface and wear protective goggles, especially if you have recently used harsh drain cleaning products., Some sinks have a built-in strainer, so you may have to bypass this in order to reach the clog. The “trap” is a j-shaped pipe under your sink. Some sink traps can be removed by hand, but if this is not possible you may be able to remove it with a wrench or channel lock pliers. Have a bucket close by to catch any water that drains from the pipe after you remove it., Once it’s in a few inches, crank the handle on the auger while pushing the coil firmly into the pipe. The auger will slowly drive deeper into the pipe until it meets the obstruction.If your pipe has any sharp bends, you may need to wiggle the auger wire or turn the crank a little more firmly to get it through.

, If the auger wire encounters a clog that is too big or strong to break up, it will resist turning. Crank the handle a few more times to lodge the wire firmly in the clog, then wiggle it gently to help loosen up the blockage., If you successfully lodged the auger in the blockage, the clog should come out with the wire. Clean the debris off the end of the auger and dispose of them., Run a little water in your sink or tub and check to see if it drains properly. If not, try running the auger through your pipes a second time, and repeat as necessary until your drain is clear."
"
Use drain screens to prevent clogs.,
Keep grease and fat out of your drains.,
Perform maintenance cleaning on drains and stoppers.",How to Clean Drains4," Drain screens let water and small particles flow through your drain while keeping out hair, soap scum, and big particles of food. Use drain screens in your tub during a shower and in your kitchen sink while washing dishes., Grease can gradually build up in your plumbing to create clogs and foul odors, and can even cause more far-reaching issues outside your home, like sewer clogs.Never pour cooking grease down your drain. Wipe down greasy dishes with a paper towel before washing them, and use plenty of hot water and dish detergent to break up any residual grease., Pour a few gallons of boiling water down sink drains once a week as part of your regular cleaning routine. Regularly clean built-in sink stoppers, which can accumulate grime and clogging materials like hair."

Find the direction of the metal’s grain.,
Dampen a microfiber cloth in warm water.,
Wipe off the stains with the cloth.,
Dry the backsplash with a clean cloth.",How to Clean a Metal Backsplash1," Look closely at the metal backsplash. The metal particles may appear to move in a certain direction, such as side to side. If your backsplash has a noticeable grain, always scrub in the direction of it. This will prevent the metal from taking on tiny scratches., Use a microfiber cloth or non-abrasive sponge. Metal brushes and scrub pads will scratch your backsplash, so avoid them. Warm water cleaning, when done routinely, limits the need for deeper cleaning. Never use hot water on the backsplash.A mild detergent, such as a dish soap like Dawn or a non-chloride cleanser, can also be used for extra cleaning strength. Add a drop or two of the detergent to the water., Use the microfiber cloth to clean the backsplash. Work in circular motions along the grain. Most of the time, the day’s stains will come right off. Older stains are likely to require deeper cleaning.Never use scrub pads or wire brushes on the backsplash. These will scratch it.

, Get a dry cloth and use it to absorb the water on the metal. Although metal backsplashes are resistant to damage, hard water can weaken them. It’s better to dry the metal by hand so water doesn’t sit on it."

Stir them together to form a paste., Apply the paste to the stain using your cloth or sponge. Wait for the paste to dry. Take a clean, dry cloth and use it to wipe off the paste. Check to see if the stain has been removed., Mix an equal amount of vinegar and warm water. Add them to a spray bottle if possible, since this will allow you to coat the stain with an even, controlled amount of the mixture., Spray the mixture onto the stain. After five minutes, come back and prepare to finish treating the backsplash with a general wash.., Dampen a soft cloth in warm water. Rub the cloth against the metal’s grain over the stained areas. Make sure all vinegar is removed., Finish up by using a soft cloth to remove the water. Make sure no water is left or else it can damage the backsplash."

Blot stains immediately.,
Spray glass cleaner to remove fingerprints.,
Buff the metal with olive oil.",How to Clean a Metal Backsplash3," Use paper towels to blot grease and remove food spatter. Removing stains as quickly as possible prevents them from setting. Acidic food such as tomato sauce or lemon juice can damage metal over time, so don’t let those stains linger., Pick a non-chloride glass cleaner or all-surface cleaner such as Windex. Use it between washings to remove minor stains like fingerprints. Spray the cleaner across the surface of the metal. Wipe the fingerprints off with a cloth, then wipe up excess cleaner or allow it to air dry., To give the backsplash a shine, add a tablespoon of olive oil to a soft cloth. Spend a few minutes rubbing in the oil along the grain. Leave the oil alone and it’ll protect your backsplash from stains for a few weeks.Commercial metal polish can also be used, but olive oil works well and is less expensive. Other oils, including baby oil, may also work.

Wash your silver often and promptly after use.,
Don't use the dishwasher to clean silver.,
Polish your silver when light tarnish develops.,
Avoid scratching your silver.,
Store your silver correctly.",How to Clean Silver1," Silver that is frequently used rarely has tarnish problems. When tarnish is not yet present, or when it's just beginning to develop, simply wash your silver in warm water with a gentle, phosphate-free detergent. Make sure to use a non-lemon based detergent, as lemon-based products can spot the silver.









It's a good idea to wash silver separately from your other dishes because metal sinks and utensils can scratch silver, and stainless steel can damage the finish if it comes into contact with your silver.
Avoid using rubber gloves when washing silver, as rubber corrodes silver. Use a soft cloth to gently rub the silver clean and dry promptly with a soft towel. Gently buff the shine into dull silver with a soft cotton cloth.
Use nitrile gloves – they contain no sulfur that will promote the formation of tarnish. Cotton gloves are also acceptable.;
, The high temperatures and rough washing can change the color of silver and cause damage, especially to pieces that are porous. Do all of your silver cleaning by hand., Tarnish is a thin layer of corrosion that naturally develops on the outermost layer of silver and other metals. When you see the dark tinge of tarnish on your silver, simple hand washing may not suffice to remove it. Specially formulated silver polishes are your safest option for polishing silver, especially if you are dealing with an antique or a piece that has intricate designs etched into it. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully.









It's best to use a cellulose sponge for polishing, because it won't scratch like the sponges that come supplied with some polishes. You could also try cotton balls and use flattened Q-tips between fork tines.
Moisten a soft, silver-polishing cloth or the sponge included with the silver polish.
Rub the silver only in straight-line, back-and-forth motions (not in circles). Avoid scrubbing and simply let the polish do the job.
Rinse the silver under running water.
Dry the silver completely with a soft, clean cloth.














, Using a silver platter as a cutting board is never a good idea. Avoid storing sharp objects in a silver container, and if you stack silver, make sure each piece is padded. Don't throw silver utensils in the sink, as they may get scratched by each other or other dishes.








, Beyond prompt and frequent cleaning, the best way to preserve your silver is to store it correctly. Make sure each piece is completely dry before storing it. Wrap each piece in acid-free tissue paper or anti-tarnish paper. You can also wrap pieces in flannel (special flannels are made just for this purpose). Seal the wrapped silver pieces in an airtight plastic bag. A canister of silica gel placed nearby can help reduce humidity and ward off tarnish.









Never store silver where it can contact rubber, stainless steel, or paint.
For sterling flatware, the best way to keep it beautiful is use it on a regular basis and gently wash/dry it with gentle dish soap and water. If it's not in storage for a long time, it doesn't have a chance to tarnish deeply.
Many stores and catalogs that sell silver will also sell anti-tarnish silver chests lined with treated felt, or just the anti-tarnish cloth itself. These cloths lengthen the amount of time needed between polishings, but you still need to do it. They are also great for storage, as they keep the pieces from being banged around too much. If your silver chest doesn't have a drawer for serving pieces, you can just wrap them in a piece of anti-tarnish cloth or stripsand put that in a regular box.

Beware of using toothpaste as a silver polish.,
Use Baking soda.,
Put silver goods in 7-Up soda.,
Use a silver dip for heavily tarnished pieces.,
Try an electrochemical method.",How to Clean Silver2," Some toothpastes contain baking soda or other ingredients which are much too abrasive; even trace amounts can cause serious damage. Use polishes that are specifically formulated to remove tarnish from silver.








Some sources do recommend toothpaste if you for some reason can't get your hands on silver polish. However, this method should certainly never be used to clean valuable pieces of silver, since it can cause damage. Select a plain white toothpaste (not a gel) without the special whitening options. Take a soft, dampened cloth (old t-shirt scraps work just fine) or a damp sponge and put some toothpaste on it. Gently rub over the silver in straight, back-and-forth motions. Alternatively, you can wet the silver piece and gently apply toothpaste directly to the surface, which you can then wet again and proceed to polish. Do this gently. If you notice scratching at any point, stop and rinse the toothpaste off.













As the cloth or sponge becomes dark with tarnish, add more toothpaste to a clean part of the dampened cloth/sponge and continue gently polishing.













Rinse thoroughly with warm water and dry with a soft towel.













Some toothpastes contain baking soda or other ingredients which are much too abrasive. Even trace amounts can cause serious damage.

, Baking soda may remove stubborn tarnish, but don't use it unless you don't mind the risk of damaging the silver. It takes off a layer of silver along with the tarnish.









Make a paste of baking soda and warm water.













Gently polish following the directions for toothpaste above.














, The acid kills the dirt and helps it shine without damaging the silver.








, Commercial silver ""dips"" are available which can dissolve stains without rubbing the silver. Chemical dips work by dissolving the tarnish on an object at an accelerated rate. Dips are used by silver restorers when heavy black tarnish cannot be removed with liquid or paste polishes. Silver dips contain an ingredient called thiourea that reverses the tarnishing process. This can be extremely damaging to your silver if you aren't careful, so use dips sparingly. To use a dip, pour the liquid into a plastic container. Place the piece in the container and cover it with a lid, then let it soak for the time specified on the dip packaging. Rinse the piece well when you remove it, since traces of dip can eat away at the silver and cause pitting.









Contrary to what the word ""dip"" implies, professionals rarely actually soak silver in these products, or at least not for long. Chemical dips are wiped over the object with a cellulose sponge or cotton ball, as submerging the piece for long periods will remove factory-applied patinas and cause pitting of the object's surface. These surface defects will act like a sponge and more readily absorb tarnish-producing gases and moisture. The object may then require professional polishing to restore the original finish.Dips can potentially damage your silver and they will remove desirable patina. Dips also contain chemicals that are harmful to your health, so use this method sparingly or hire a professional to do it.
Chemical dips are made up of an acid and a complexing agent. Acids are corrosive and will damage niello, bronze, stainless steel knife blades, and organic materials such as wood and ivory. The ingredients can also be harmful to the user, which is why silver restorers wear nitrile gloves and work in a well-ventilated area. Chemical dips should never be used on objects that have sealed components, such as candlesticks and trophies with hollow feet, or teapots with hollow handles. Once the dip leaks into the cavity through small holes or imperfections in the joints, it becomes virtually impossible to wash the chemical out. For all the above reasons, this cleaning technique should only be used by qualified restorers., This is done by heating up an appropriately sized container of water and dissolving a large amount of table salt into the water. Use enough salt such that it takes at least a minute to dissolve in the hot water with constant stirring. Baking soda works as well. Shape a liner for the container from aluminum foil and place the foil in the container of hot water. Place silver that has been previously cleaned with soap into the bath (inside of the foil) for several minutes. The tarnish should dissolve away. Rinse the piece well when you're finished.

Be sure that the silver touches the aluminum, or else it won't work. The silver and aluminum, with the salt water between them form a battery, and when you touch the silver to the aluminum, it shorts the battery and a small current flows, allowing the chemical reaction to happen. This method is quick and better than a corrosive dip, but probably not as gentle as silver cleaning paste.

Wear gloves, safety glasses and a dust mask while looking for and repairing the leak. Depending on how long the leak has gone unrepaired, there could be mold present.
If there is an extensive amount of mold, hire a professional to remove it safely.;
, If the stain is from a long since repaired leak and the damage is only aesthetic, you may be able to remove the stain with a little elbow grease.


Use a one to one water and bleach mixture to try to blot the stain away. Be sure to wear safety glasses and gloves when you apply it.If that doesn't work, wait until it dries completely and simply primer and paint the stain to match your ceiling. As long as the drywall is intact and the leak is repaired, you're done!, Depending on the extent of the damage, you may just need to cut out a bit of drywall or you may need to remove entire portions.If you only need to remove a small portion of the ceiling, use a keyhole saw or similar tool to remove the affected area.
If the damage is extensive, you may need to use the claw end of a hammer or a crowbar to remove all of the damaged material.
Ensure all stained drywall is removed and that any material remaining is dry and not sagging.
Clean the area with household cleaner to ensure mildew and mold does not develop., Now that all of the damaged material is removed, it’s time to replace it with new drywall. Cut a portion of drywall that is the same approximate size as the area you cut out of the ceiling.
If the hole you are patching is small, simply place the newly cut drywall into the hole, then use drywall joint compound to fill the gap and serve as glue to keep it in place. Use a putty knife to ensure it is flat and even.
If the hole is larger, you may need help holding the replacement drywall in place while you use the joint compound to fill the gap and set.
Allow the drywall joint compound to dry thoroughly, then use fine sand paper to ensure it is flat and even.

, You will need to use a coat of primer on the drywall first, followed by a paint that matches the ceiling color.Many hardware stores can match the color for you if you provide them with a sample.
Repainting the entire ceiling will ensure the color matches throughout.
Adding a layer of shellac before you primer can help seal the repair."

Use your fingertip to help you clean a small area. Wrap the cloth over your fingertip and use it to rub the dyed or ink-covered area.
You can also try adding a small amount of dish soap to the water. Be sure to wipe the wall with water only after wiping it with soapy water.
Use a clean, smooth cloth first and then try a more abrasive cloth or a sponge if that does not work. Don’t use an abrasive cloth if you don’t have to.
Avoid using too much water when you wipe down your walls.Wet the cloth and then wring out excess water so that the cloth feels damp.;
, A pencil eraser is a safe, gentle way to remove ink and dye stains from a painted wall without removing the paint. You can also control the area that you are cleaning more easily than some other cleaning methods.Be sure to use a clean pencil eraser.

Use a scraper tool to remove the damaged popcorn material.,
Assess and repair the drywall damage.,
Apply new popcorn material to the ceiling.,
Prime and paint the repaired area.",How to Get Water Stains Off a Ceiling2," Just like with a drywall ceiling, failing to repair the leak will only result in having to repeat the repairs.


Make sure to wear protective equipment as you do repairs in the event mold has grown due to the moisture.
If your popcorn ceiling was installed prior to 1979, it may contain asbestos. In such a case, it may be better to contact a professional to conduct the repairs., If it's an old stain from a long since repaired leak, you may be able to simply bleach or paint the ceiling to cover the stain.


Try using a one to one water and bleach mixture to remove light stains. Make sure to wear protective glasses and gloves while applying the mixture.
For darker aesthetic stains, simply primer the spot to seal it and cover it with a matching shade of ceiling paint.

, Due to the moisture, it should scrape off fairly easily.Remove the popcorn material from the affected area with an extra inch or so on each side.
Scrape it until only the flat drywall is visible. The drywall may also have water damage on it.
Wear safety glasses and a dust mask to protect yourself from the falling material., You may not need to cut out or repair the water damaged drywall.


If the drywall is merely stained, you can seal it with a product like KILZ paint that will prevent the damage from spreading and serve as a seal. The damaged drywall will not be visible after you apply new popcorn material.
If the water damage to the drywall is substantial, follow the repairing a drywall ceiling steps above to repair it.

, As long as you’re certain the drywall is sound and dry, you can simply apply new popcorn material to the affected area.


If you repaired the drywall, ensure it is dry, sanded and clean so the popcorn material has a sound surface to stick to.
Use the ready-made popcorn material that comes in a tub. The spray can be difficult to control for small applications.Try your best to match the thickness and texture of the existing popcorn material on the ceiling.

, Once the popcorn material is completely dry, you can paint the repairs to match the existing ceiling paint. Painting the entire ceiling will ensure the color matches throughout.

Repair the leak and check for rotten wood.,
Sand the top layer of damage from the wood.,
Stain the wood.,
Bleach the wood.",How to Get Water Stains Off a Ceiling3," Wood ceilings are much more difficult to repair after water damage stains it. Unlike drywall and popcorn ceilings, you cannot simply remove a portion of the ceiling and replace it without leaving visible signs of the repair.Ensure you have identified and repaired the source of the moisture. Failing to do so will result in needing to do further repairs.
Wear gloves, safety glasses, and a dust mask to protect yourself from the possibility of mold.
Rotten wood will need to be replaced.

, If the water damage has not soaked all the way through the wood but rather dripped from a crack or gap in the wood, you may be able to sand past the damage.Always wear protective equipment when operating power tools.
Be careful not to sand in an uneven fashion so as to make any defined lines or textures in the wood.
Once you have sanded the damage away, apply a sealer or stain to the wood.

, If sanding alone cannot do the trick, you can also use a darker stain to match the hue of the entire ceiling.If the water stain is black, this method may not work, but the darker colors could draw less attention to the damage.
Some forms of wood cannot be repaired due to discoloration and any wood that is soaked entirely through will need to be replaced.

, For lighter woods like knotty pine you can use oxalic wood bleach to remove the dark stains caused by water.Wear protective eye wear as the bleach is a fluid you will need to apply above your head.
Use a sponge or rag that’s damp with clean water to wipe the bleach mixture on the ceiling in a controlled manner.
Once you have finished bleaching, mix one part white vinegar and two parts water in a spray bottle and spray it at the bleached area to neutralize the remaining bleach.

Use a magic eraser.,
Use a bleach pen for spot treatments.If you just have some small specks of dye or ink on your walls, then you may be able to use a bleach pen as a spot treatment.,
Try a bleach spray for white painted walls.",How to Get Ink or Dye Off a Painted Wall2," Magic erasers are cleaning sponges that use micro abrasive texture to scrub away stains. You can safely use magic erasers on many different types of surfaces, so this may be a good option for getting the dye or ink off of your wall.However, keep in mind that there is still a chance of discoloration.


To use a magic eraser, get the sponge wet and wring out the excess water, Then, rub the sponge over the dyed or ink-covered area of the wall until the dye or ink stain is gone.

, A bleach pen will lighten the dye or ink in a small area, so this may reduce the chances of discoloring the paint.


To use a bleach pen, go over the dyed or ink-covered areas with the tip of the bleach pen. The stains should lift after a few minutes.

, If you have white walls, then you can use some bleach cleanser to remove the stain. This is an effective way to get ink or dye off of your painted walls, but it will likely cause discoloration if your walls are not white.


To use a bleach cleanser, spray it directly onto the dye or ink, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe it away.
You should only use bleach cleanser as a last resort because it is the harshest option and there is a good chance that it will discolor your paint.

Act fast.,
Test the cleaning product on a discreet location.,
Rub gently and in a small area.,
Have some matching color paint handy.",How to Get Ink or Dye Off a Painted Wall3," The sooner you clean up an ink or dye stain, the easier it will be to remove. You may also be able to get away with an easy cleansing method like a damp cloth and water if you clean up ink and dye as soon as they get on your walls.If you didn’t notice the spill or waited to clean it, don’t worry! You can still remove the stain. It may just be a little harder to remove.

, You may want to test any cleaning option you plan to use on a discreet portion of your painted wall first to see if they cause any discoloration. This will give you a chance to see if the method works and whether or not it discolors the paint.


For example, you could try the cleaning option on an area that is behind a piece of furniture or near the floor.

, To reduce the chances that the cleaning product will mess up your paint, you can also confine the area that you clean to where the dye or ink has stained it. Unless the dye or ink is spread over a large area, this will require dabbing on the cleaning product or limiting your application of the product in other ways. Some things you can try include:


Using a cotton ball or cotton swab to dab on a cleaning product.
Cutting a magic eraser or sponge into small pieces for use on a small area.
Making small, precise movements with the cloth or sponge.

, If you do end up discoloring your paint in the process of removing the dye or ink, then you can always paint over the area to fix the discoloration. Find out the exact shade that was used to paint the wall and get a small can of this paint to touch up the area if it is discolored from the cleaning option you use.

If the magnet doesn’t magnetically cling to the object, it’s brass.
If the magnet does magnetically cling to the object, it’s likely that the “brass” piece is really a piece of iron or steel, covered with a brass coating.;
, Some brass objects are not meant to be bright, and therefore, any efforts to clean the piece might actually diminish its worth. If you are unsure of what your next steps should be in cleaning a brass piece, talk to a brass expert and discuss your cleaning options.Sometimes patina (the turquoise coloring that forms on brass and copper) can add a unique look to a piece of brass, and should be left alone.
Patina is used to evaluate many aspects of a piece of brass. For example, patina can be used to determine the age of a piece of brass, its current condition, and its potential value. Any removal or alteration of patina on a brass piece can significantly affect its worth., On modern brass pieces, an outer coating of lacquer serves as a layer of protection against oxidation. But, older, antique pieces of brass typically don’t have a lacquered coating.You can assess if a brass piece is lacquered by looking at its surface: it will have a clear finish covering the entire piece. Brass covered with lacquer will usually only tarnish if there is a crack in the lacquer coating.Lacquered brass is fairly easy to clean; all you really need is some soapy water. However, you might want to consider removing the lacquering if tarnish has formed underneath the lacquer finish.
If you are still having trouble figuring out if your brass piece has a lacquered finish, remember that lacquered brass usually has more of a yellow shading., The first line of defense for keeping your brass pieces clean is to regularly dust them using a soft rag.After dusting your lacquered brass, dip a soft cotton cloth into a mixture of mild dish detergent and lukewarm water. Wring out the cloth so it’s only slightly damp, and gently wipe the brass surface clean. Once you have cleaned the surface, use a wrung out cloth dipped in clean water to remove any remaining soap, and then dry the brass piece thoroughly.


If you are trying to remove tarnish that has accumulated underneath lacquered brass, you need to remove the layer of lacquer first.

, Hot water softens the lacquer layering covering brass. Place the brass piece in a sink basin, and pour hot water over the brass.The hot water will heat up the brass, making it expand. The lacquer will expand with the brass. However, when the brass starts to cool down, it will slightly shrink, but the lacquer won’t shrink with it. Once the brass is cool, the lacquer should be slightly separated from the brass surface, and can easily be peeled away.You could also try boiling your brass in water to remove the lacquer, depending on the size of the piece. All you need to do is immerse the brass piece in a non-aluminum pot with boiling water, and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, carefully take the brass piece out of the water, let it cool, and peel off the lacquer., Place the brass piece on a table that is heavily layered with newspapers. The newspaper will help protect the workspace by absorbing any varnish remover drippings.Consider using a paintbrush to thoroughly and evenly coat the brass piece with the varnish remover. Once you have applied the remover, let it sit for a minute or two, and then wipe away the varnish remover with a soft cloth. Be sure to consult the instructions found on the container of varnish remover.


Be cautious and follow the manufacturer's cleaning guidelines, because varnish remover is made from strong chemicals that could be dangerous.
Protect your skin and wear rubber gloves when handling varnish remover.
Because of the hazardous fumes from varnish remover, work outside or in an area that’s well ventilated.
Also stay away from open flames when working with varnish remover since it’s highly flammable., Make sure the brass is clean of all surface dust and dirt before you begin polishing. There are many kinds of commercial brass polishes, but you can make your own brass polish at home with lemon. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze all the juice from the half lemon into a small bowl. Add in either table salt or baking soda – it doesn’t matter which, the salt/baking soda is only acting as an abrasive – until you form a paste.This might require about a teaspoon or more of salt or baking soda. Apply the paste to the brass piece using a soft cloth.


Make sure you apply the paste going with the grain of the metal. If not, you could make tiny little scratches in the brass surface.
Don’t rub the paste too harshly into the brass piece. The abrasive salt/baking soda will gently remove the tarnish.
Consider using a soft-bristled toothbrush to clean the nooks and hard to reach areas of your brass piece., There are many eco-friendly brass cleaners that remove tarnish and restore shine to brass pieces without scratching and damaging the surface.


Sometimes, brass cleansers have an abrasive element in their formula, so be mindful to not damage fragile etchings on your brass piece.Stay way from muriatic acid. It does not properly clean brass, and can leave behind permanent stains.Undiluted white vinegar or ammonia can be highly effective in cleaning antique brass. Allow the brass piece to soak for an hour in either vinegar or ammonia. Both products are natural cleaning agents, and can give brass a lasting, shiny finish., Although you can make your own brass cleaner at home or use commercial brass cleaners bought from the store, consider using some of these other natural ingredients to clean your brass pieces:



Ketchup. Use a soft cloth to slather your brass piece with ketchup. Let the ketchup sit on the brass surface for approximately 10 minutes, and then wipe the ketchup off with a clean, damp cloth. Dry the brass piece thoroughly.Yogurt. Cover your brass piece with plain yogurt. The lactic acid in the yogurt is what works to break down and dissolve the tarnishing on the brass. Allow the yogurt to dry on the brass, and then rinse it off with water, and dry the brass piece with a clean cloth.White vinegar and salt. Cover the brass piece with white vinegar (either by pouring or spraying the vinegar over the brass surface), and then sprinkle salt over the vinegar.Wet a cloth with a little bit of vinegar, and gently wipe down the brass. Dry with a clean cloth.

, After you’re finished cleaning your brass piece, protect it from future tarnishing by applying a lacquered finish.You can apply the lacquer using either a paintbrush or a cotton ball. Consult the instructions on the lacquer container to see the manufacturer’s suggestions.


However you decide to apply the lacquer, be sure to only put on a thin layer. Watch for any dripping lacquer, because the drippings can dry, leaving your brass piece covered in drip streaks.Allow the brass piece to dry thoroughly before touching. After the lacquer is dry, wipe the brass with a clean cloth to give it some shine.

, It could be hard to differentiate if a brass piece is actual brass, or brass-plated. Hold a magnet near the brass piece and see if it's magnetically attracted to the brass. If the magnet does not stick, you are most likely handling brass. If the magnet does stick, it’s likely that your “brass” piece is actually a brass-plated piece of iron or steel.An alternative way to check if your piece is brass or brass-plated, is to use a sharp kitchen knife and scratch an inconspicuous part of the item. If the item is brass, the color in the scratch should be bright yellow.If the scratch mark is another color, like silver, then it is definitely another metal, and you still need to stick with non-abrasive cleaners so you don't remove the brass plating.

, Clean the entire brass-plated surface with a mixture of mild soap and cold to lukewarm water. Dip a cloth into the soapy water, wring out the cloth so it’s only slightly damp, and gently rub the surface of the brass piece.


Never try to polish lacquered brass. The polish tends to turn the surface of the brass piece cloudy.Don’t use cleaners containing ammonia on lacquered brass pieces, because the ammonia will break down the protective lacquer., Dip a soft cotton cloth into a mixture of mild dish detergent and lukewarm water, wring out the cloth so it is only slightly damp, and gently wipe the surface of the brass piece clean.You can use an old toothbrush to clean out the nooks and crannies in the brass piece.

, Rinse the brass piece with water, and dry it completely using a clean cloth.


Polishing brass-plated items can potentially remove some of the brass plating. If you plan to polish your brass-plated object, do so very gently.It may be helpful to test the polish on an inconspicuous area of your brass-plated item before you polish the entire piece.

Examine the stucco for chips or cracks.,
Seal the cracks and chips with caulk.,
Evaluate the problems areas.,
Mix a cleaning solution of concentrated cleaner and bleach.,
Mix a cleaning solution of Borax and dish soap.,
Use a pressure washer to saturate the wall with water.,
Spray on the cleaning solution.,
Allow the cleaning solution to sit for five to ten minutes.This will ensure the cleaning solution penetrates the stains deeply.,
Use a rotating scrub brush attachment on the heavily stained areas.,
Rinse the cleaning solution off the first section.,
Saturate the next section of the wall with cleaning solution.,
Do a spot check.",How to Clean Stucco," Before you clean stucco, you must examine it closely for any flaws. If you wash damaged stucco, water can get into the cracks, causing mold and mildew to grow, among other issues. If you locate chips and cracks in your stucco, don’t move forward with cleaning it until you’ve repaired the damage.You can repair minor damage (small chips, hairline cracks, etc.) yourself.
Damage beyond that is best repaired by a professional who is experienced with stucco work.;
, If you find relatively minor flaws in your stucco, seal them yourself using a color-matched exterior acrylic caulk. You can get this caulk at most home improvement stores. It might be difficult to find a caulk that's the exact same color as your stucco, but buy the closest you can get. As long as the repairs are minor, a slightly off-color caulk probably won’t stand out.To replicate the texture of the surrounding stucco, try pressing sand or another gritty substance into the surface of the wet caulk.
Give the caulk at least a week to dry completely before you attempt to clean the wall., What’s causing the stains and discoloration on your stucco? Is it dirt and general debris? Or it something else, like mildew or algae? Mildew appears as a black stain that looks a lot like dirt. If the black stain occurs near a place on the wall where water often drips or accumulates, such as under eaves, the black stains you see are most likely mildew, not dirt. If you have green staining, this is algae.


You will need to use bleach to clean off micro-organisms like algae and mildew.
If you’re dealing with significant staining over large areas of wall, consider having a professional clean the stucco., Buy a concentrated cleaner made specifically for use on exterior surfaces. These concentrated cleaners are available at any home improvement store. Look for products that say ""professional strength concentrate"" and include ingredients like acetic acid and sodium o-phenylphenate.Read the instructions carefully. They will tell you how to mix up the cleaning solution for that particular product. Most concentrated exterior cleaners are activated by adding household bleach and hot water.The bleach activates the solution and also helps to kill micro-organisms like mildew and algae.
Wear eye protection and rubber gloves when preparing and using the cleaning solution., If you want to avoid bleach, try Borax-based solution instead. Borax is a natural substance that is less toxic than bleach and still effective at killing mold.For this cleaning solution, you’ll need three ingredients – hot water, Borax and dish soap. Mix the following amounts in a large bucket:


2 gallons (7.57 L) of warm to hot water
2 tablespoons (29.5 mL) of dish soap
1/2 cup (118.2 mL) of Borax

, Pressure washers come with different nozzles that spray with varying amounts of water pressure. Stucco is delicate, so attach a low pressure spray tip nozzle to the pressure washer’s hose. Saturate the entire wall with water before you begin applying the cleaning solution. To prevent damage, make sure the water hits the wall at a 45 degree angle.


The nozzle should be held at least 24 inches away from the wall. Apply the water in an even stream.If you don’t own a pressure washer, you can rent one from most home improvement stores for about $75 per day.

, Fill a single pump sprayer with the cleaning solution. Divide your wall up into workable sections. Use the pump sprayer to squirt the cleaning solution on the first section of the wall. Start at the bottom and work your way up to the top until you’ve saturated the entire first section of the wall.


Focus on areas with heavy stains.
Pump sprayers can be purchased at home and garden stores. They come in various sizes – get one with a one to two gallon tank.

, Spray the section lightly with water once or twice while it soaks in the cleaning solution. Stucco is very porous and will soak up water, so after a few minutes you’ll need to add a little more water to keep the detergent activated.


If you are dealing with very stubborn mold, algae or mildew growths, you may need to allow the solution to sit for up to 30 minutes., Areas with rust and other heavy stains may need a little extra scrubbing. While the wall is still saturated in the cleaning solution, use a high quality rotating scrub brush attachment to work on the heavy stains.


This will loosen up the grime and debris and make it easier to rinse off.
If you’re dealing with rust, scrub it slowly and carefully., Attach the low pressure spray tip nozzle onto the pressure washer’s hose. Rinse the solution off the first section of the wall, starting at the top and working your way down to the bottom. You will be able to see the dirt moving down the wall once you begin at the top. Follow that line of dirt down with the hose, making sure you guide all of it to the bottom.Rinse the wall thoroughly so that no cleaning solution remains behind.
Finish one section completely before beginning the next one.

, Repeat the same actions as before and allow the solution to sit for five to ten minutes before you rinse it off with the pressure washer. Continue in this manner, section by section, until you’ve completed the entire wall.


Always rinse off the cleaning solution, working from the top to the bottom, to properly get rid of all the residue., Examine the stucco carefully. Check to make sure you haven't missed any areas of dirt. If necessary, repeat the application of cleaner and pressure rinsing to remove additional stains. Allow the wall to dry for at least 24 hours."

Dispose of the cloth when you’re done cleaning the wall., A lambswool duster is one of the best options for dusting walls. Because of its elongated design, the best way to use the lambswool duster on walls is to place it in a vertical orientation in the leftmost corner of the wall, then drag it across the wall to the other corner. If necessary, use a ladder as you move across the room.After dusting the first horizontal strip of the wall, drag the lambswool duster back across the wall in the opposite direction. Dust along a path just below that of the first. Continue in this way until the wall is completely dusted.

, Attach a wall brush extension to your vacuum. Then, vacuum the entire surface of the wall. Move the vacuum’s wall brush extension from the top edge of the wall where it meets the ceiling down to the base of the wall. This will allow you to clean the wall in a complete and consistent manner.A wall brush extension is a long tube which links the suction end of your vacuum to bristled opening on the other end.
Using the wall brush extension will prevent your wall from being damaged as the vacuum tube moves across it.

Keep the Velcro fastened when not in use.,
Spray the Velcro with an antistatic spray.,
Clean the hooked side of Velcro fasteners using another piece of Velcro.,
Use a crochet hook to clean Velcro fasteners.,
Use tweezers to remove stubborn debris.,
Blot the looped side of the fastener with duct tape.,
Wash the Velcro fasteners with soap and water.",How to Keep Velcro Fasteners Clean," An easy way to keep Velcro from becoming clogged with dust, pet hair, and other airborne debris is by keeping the strips fastened as much as possible. After removing shoes, clothing, or bags with Velcro closures, re-fasten the closures until the next use. You should also keep Velcro fastened when washing garments.;
, Another way to decrease the amount of dust that forms on Velcro fasteners is by spraying them occasionally with an antistatic spray. This reduces the static charge of the Velcro, which will discourage it from attracting dust.

, The rougher side of the fastener containing the small hooks tends to get clogged more easily with dirt and hair. A simple way to clean this side is by running another hooked Velcro fastener against it a few times. This tends to lift the debris to the surface of the 2 fasteners, where it can be gently lifted away by hand.

, If you can't find a spare piece of Velcro to use for cleaning, you can try using a small knitting and crocheting tool called a crochet hook. Drag the crochet hook through the hooked fastener of the Velcro, and the small groove in the hook will drag hair and dust along with it.

, If you still cannot remove some of the debris from the hooked side of the Velcro, you can try pinching and removing the offending material using tweezers.

, If the softer, looped side of the Velcro is soiled, you can clean it using duct tape. Wrap a length of tape around your hand, securing it using its own adhesive. Blot the tape gently against the Velcro several times, lifting the dust and debris away.

, Velcro can be washed using a mild soap and warm water if desired. This will clean dust out of the fasteners, as well as helping to remove any odors that may be lingering on the Velcro. You can wash the Velcro in your sink using dish soap and allow it to air dry afterwards.

Coax the zipper.,
Pinch below the zipper.,
Pinch above the zipper.,
Look for anything in the way.,
Check the teeth.,
Replace the zipper.",How to Loosen a Hard to Close Zipper1," Even if the zipper is structurally sound, sometimes some coaxing is needed. Gently unzipping the zipper further and then trying to zip it back up will sometimes solve the issue, especially if the zipper just caught on something.;
, This step is common, so you may have already tried it. If you haven't, try pinching the fabric below the zipper to squeeze the garment into its zipped position.Do this while gently coaxing the slider of the zipper upwards. This step can help if the issue is caused by the teeth trying to pull away from each other.

, Another common tactic that you can try is pinching above the zipper.This tactic helps gather teeth together when they're having a hard time catching, and it can help in cases where the zipper is having trouble because your tailored slim-fit trousers or flirty cocktail dress are a little too tight.

, If the zipper is still sluggish, closely examine the zipper. Make sure there isn't anything like thread or hair stuck in it. If something is in the way, pull it out to see if that fixes the problem, as it can keep your zipper from closing easily.You may need to move the zipper back and forth as you try to pull the thread or hair out of the zipper.

, One of the most common problem areas for a zipper is actually the teeth. Over time, the teeth can get bent out of alignment. Look to see if all of your zipper's teeth are straight and in line. If they're not, you can use pliers to pull them back into place. Just don't be too rough, as you can pull the teeth off., Another option is to just replace the zipper completely. You can do it yourself at home, or you can take to to a tailor's to be replaced. Most sewing stores sell zippers you can use to replace the one you have. However, having a professional do it will be easier, and it doesn't cost too much."

Check for rust.,
Apply vinegar.,
Try dish detergent.",How to Loosen a Hard to Close Zipper2," Sometimes, rust can form on the inside of a zipper or on a zipper's teeth. This problem can happen more often with cold-weather outdoor garments. If rust is present, use a household anti-rust lubricant like WD-40. Just be careful not to get it on the fabric of the garment.

, The issue could be caused by tiny pieces of debris getting in the zipper. That debris can cause the zipper to not zip as easily. Applying vinegar can help take care of the problem by cleaning it out, allowing it to zip more readily.


Soak a cotton ball with vinegar. With the garment flat, run the cotton ball up and down the zipper. Make sure not to get it on the fabric if you think it may bleed.
Apply it to both sides of the zipper, as well as the inside of the teeth.

, Dish detergent can be used to clean out your zippers. However, be sure to test the detergent on an inconspicuous place first. If it doesn't affect the color of the garment, scrub the detergent into the zipper, using a brush. Wash it out, and see if it helps your zipper be less sluggish."

Try a bar a soap.,
Use a graphite pencil.,
Try powder.,
Rub the zipper with wax.,
Use window cleaner.",How to Loosen a Hard to Close Zipper3," One simple solution for a zipper that's hard to close is a bar of soap. It doesn't really matter what kind you use. Anything you have on hand is fine. Rub the soap on the teeth of the zipper with the zipper open. Once you've rubbed some in, zip it up and down to get it lubricated well.The soap will help the slider move up and down more easily on the zipper.
Another easy option is petroleum jelly.
You can also use a bit olive oil, but be careful, as it could stain your clothes., Graphite works as a lubricant, making it easier to zip up stubborn zippers. Rub a graphite pencil along the inside of the zipper and the teeth. Make sure to hit all of the zipper, trying to get into the teeth as much as possible, as well as the back of the zipper. Move the zipper up and down a few times to help get the graphite in place., Powders can also act as lubricants for zippers. You can use most common household powders, such as talcum powder or baby powder. You can even use cornstarch. Just sprinkle a little on the zipper, and move it up and down to lubricate it.You may need to wash your clothes after using this method, if you're not careful where you sprinkle the powder.

, You can use wax paper, paraffin wax, or even candle or crayon wax. Basically, the wax will lubricate the zipper, making it easier to pull up and down. You'll need to lubricate both sides for this step to work.For the wax paper, tear off a small sheet of wax paper. Make sure it's wax paper, not parchment paper. With the zipper open, rub it on both sides of the zipper. Test to the zipper to see if it helped. If it didn't try it again.
For other types of wax, rub the wax onto the zipper with the zipper open. Wipe off any excess wax from the fabric. Blow over it with a really hot hair dryer, making the wax melt and allowing it to penetrate the teeth better. Once it cools, run the zipper back and forth to test it.

, One of the most basic and common lubricants is window cleaner. It's also not oil based, meaning it won't harm your clothes. Simply spray a bit on your zipper, then move the slider up and down to lubricate it."

These have instructions for washing, drying, and ironing your item, including:Washing recommendations (dry clean only, hand wash only, machine wash on delicate, etc.)
Temperature recommendations for water
Detergent recommendations
Drying instructions
Ironing instructions;
, It's important to know whether a garment's color is going to bleed; if it is, you should wash it separately from other items, or with items of a similar color only. To test this, dab the garment in an inconspicuous area with the corner of a white, damp cloth. If color comes off on the white cloth, then the item is not colorfast., Some items lose their shape when wet, and it's important to reshape them before they dry. For a precise reference, lay the garment out on a large piece of butcher paper and use a pencil to trace its outline. After washing, you'll put the item back on this paper and reshape it according to the outline (see Part 3, Step 2)., If you are washing multiple items in a sink or tub of soapy water, start with the light items (it's okay to wash several together at the same time) and gradually work your way to the dark items. Any garment that is not colorfast should be washed and rinsed separately., If the garment labels specify a certain type of detergent, use that. If nothing is specified, use a mild detergent or liquid dish soap.For delicate woolens, you can use a mild hair conditioner instead of detergent.

, The temperature of the water depends on the care label instructions. If they do not specify, use the following guidelines:


If you are washing regular machine-wash clothes, use water that is just warm to the touch (about 85 degrees Fahrenheit or 29 degrees Celsius). Warmer water is better for removing stains, but if it's too hot, the colors tend to run.
Delicates often require cool or lukewarm water., Let the detergent dissolve into the water before adding the clothes.







, For delicate clothes, you can allow them to submerge into the water themselves. The less you touch and agitate them, the better.









Machine-wash clothes can stand a bit more handling, so feel free to plunge these into the water.

, There's no need to oversoak: 98 percent of dirt comes out within the first five minutes of hand-washing. Plus, the longer a delicate garment stays submerged, the more likely it is to lose color, or change shape or size. For only lightly-soiled garments, two to three minutes of a soapy soak is adequate.







, With hand-wash clothes, the key is to do this very gently. Never twist, wring, scrub or rub these items: this can damage the fabric.









If you're washing non-delicates (i.e., whose care labels do not specify hand washing only), you can be a little more aggressive here, scrubbing the fabric against itself to work out dirtier spots.If you're doing a few light-colored items and then darks, start with the lights. Once they've soaked, remove them from the soapy water and repeat Steps 4-6 with the dark items. You'll also need to rinse them separately.

, You may want to move delicates aside so as not to be directly under the flow of water – even this amount of agitation can be damaging. Articles like cashmere sweaters should be removed completely after draining and re-submerged once the sink or tub is full again.








, Again, be gentle with delicates, or a little more vigorous with tougher items. If you're not sure if all the soap is out, sniff the garment to detect any soapy scent.









If you wish to add fabric softener to your hand wash, pour 2 teaspoons into the rinse water. Do not pour it directly on the fabric. This is an optional step, however. Check the care label in advance to make sure fabric softener is recommended.Repeat the draining and rinsing process as needed. If you didn't use too much detergent, it shouldn't take more than one or two rinses to wash out the soap.

, Be very careful here; do not twist or ring the garment, as this can stretch the material. If you are washing very delicate items like cashmere sweaters or bathing suits, you may want to skip this step altogether.








, Lay it on the butcher-paper outline (see Part 1, Step 3) and gently manipulate the item into its original shape.


If you prefer, you can let the garment dry on the paper, turning it once during the process. Otherwise, continue with the next steps., Ideally, this towel should be laundered multiple times so that no lint remains.

, Pat the garment into shape. Or, if you're transferring it from the butcher paper, lay the towel on top of the butcher paper, then slowly turn the whole thing over so that the butcher paper is on top. Remove the butcher paper and make sure the shape has been retained.








, The garment should be fully encased in the rolled towel.









If the towel becomes completely saturated, unroll it and repeat the shaping and rolling process with another clean, dry towel., If there are no instructions, a safe method is to shape the garment on a clean, dry towel and let it dry on a flat, moisture-resistant surface. Turn the garment over occasionally, and change the towel if it becomes too damp.









Sweater dryers are excellent for this as well: they are a large, flat, mesh surface that allows the item to dry flat.
If an item does not need to be dried flat, you can hang it on a drying rack. This works for things like lingerie.If you have access to a dryer and the care label recommends machine drying, follow the label's instructions for dryer settings. Note that delicates are not meant to be machine-dried.

, Be sure to check the instructions on the label first, and follow the temperature settings carefully. If there is no care label, test on an inconspicuous area with the iron at a low setting."

Ensure color consistency behind glass tile.,
Eliminate mortar voids.,
Create a strong bond.,
Protect glass tile installations from temperature variance.",How to Avoid Common Glass Tile Installation Mistakes,"


Since glass can be the sole material in an installation, it is essential to choose a bonding mortar that meets its unique demands. In most cases, the color of the thin-set mortar was not an issue when installing opaque ceramic tile. But with clear and translucent glass, the mortar appears through the tile: if the color varies in the mortar, it will in the glass tile too.
To eliminate variations across a glass tile installation, choose a glass tile mortar with a bright white shade that is controlled to a consistent standard color. The color consistency will ensure a uniform appearance on the face of the glass tile, even in large installations that require multiple batches of mortar. As an added bonus, the bright white shade of the mortar can enhance the color of the clear or translucent glass tile.;
,


A typical ceramic tile installation involves spreading a thin-set mortar on the surface with a notched trowel, then pressing the ceramic tile into the mortar to collapse the ridges and improve contact between the tile and mortar. Unfortunately, this practice can leave many voids in the mortar behind the tile. While this would not be a concern with opaque ceramic tile, the randomly distributed air pockets or voids may be visible through clear or translucent glass.
The mortar should still be spread with a notched trowel onto the substrate, but it should also be spread (back-buttered) in an even, thin film onto the back of the glass tile. Now, when the two mortared surfaces are pressed together, the back of the tile is already covered, so any remaining voids from the mortar ridges are hidden and do not show through the glass tile. Keep in mind that standard thin-set mortars can shrink and pull away from the tile, causing voids and air bubbles during the curing process, so make sure that the mortar resists shrinkage too.

,


Since the surface of glass is very smooth, it's important that the setting materials have a strong bond. Materials with a high polymer content have a high bond strength, ensuring that the glass maintains its spot in the installation.
Another installation concern is the glass-making method: small, boutique glass tile makers may not manufacture their products to meet industry standards due to surface treatments or tile backings. Metallic and painted backings will not bond well to cement-based mortars and may come loose. Similarly, mesh backing can trap water beneath the tile, weakening the bond or creating mold. Make sure to create a mock-up to test the tile installation materials before proceeding with the full-scale project.

,


Glass tile installations occasionally fail as a result of exposure to sunlight or other forms of heat. Glass tile and cement setting materials expand and absorb heat at different rates, which can lead to cracks in the finished surface. Once again, the polymers in the mortar will help to absorb some movement, but silicone caulk should also be used to create movement joints that can handle the flexing tiles.

, They can easily become stagnant in a drawer, especially if you keep them in an old piece of furniture or built in cabinet.


Wash your larger linens with a very gentle detergent and lukewarm water. Do not use bleach on colored items.
Wash smaller or delicate items by hand, in a sink with lukewarm water and a small amount of gentle detergent.
Use an extra rinse cycle if your table linens are very dirty. You can also use more detergent in this case.
Rinse washed linens well. Soap left in the fibers will scorch when ironed.

,


If you are washing them by hand, use a cream conditioner on your last rinse to make the white linens soft.

, It is a good idea to do your linen cleaning in spring, summer or early fall, when the weather is nice enough to allow line drying.


If you have to use a machine dryer, only leave the linens in for half the cycle. Take them out and hang them over a rack until they are almost completely dry.

,


If your cloth has a design or embroidery, iron it from the inside, so you don't risk hurting the designs.

, This is a step that applies mostly for formal linen use.

, Separate them by type, and stack them so the most used linens, like towels, are near the top. If your family is hunting for 1 of these popular items, they will not disturb or remove linens during their search, if their item is on top.

Seal the grout.",How to Apply Ceramic Tiles to Concrete," Using an acid based cleaner or deep cleaner of your choice, clean the concrete and allow it to dry thoroughly. Examine the floor and see if there are any cracks or pits that need to be fixed and use the proper concrete repair kit to repair them.


A muriatic or other acid-based cleaner is usually the best way to completely clean the concrete prior to installing tile.;
, Once your repairs have dried, take the time to seal the concrete. Once the sealer has dried, apply the concrete patch or leveler and make sure that you have a flat surface with no defects. The floor must be level or your tiles and grout will form cracks.


Cleaning the concrete should be done before adding a floor leveling compound. A sodium silicate or lithium silicate based sealer will help to waterproof and strengthen the concrete. Because silicates work below the surface, they won’t interfere with adhesion.

, Before installing the tile it is a good idea to lay our your design. Pre-plan which and how many pieces of tile have to be cut and where the cut tile will be placed. Chalk lines will become very helpful so make sure you mark the floor.

, After you have decided where you want to begin, follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer and begin to mix the mortar. Don’t mix too much in advance, as it will begin to set up on you before you can use it. Using your grooved trowel, begin spreading the mortar over a small area. Never spread out more than what you can cover with three or four tiles at a time.


Different kinds of tile require different types of mortar. Ask the sales representative who sells you the tile to help you choose the right one.
A grooved trowel will be necessary to spread the mortar. They are available with different sized grooves, so be sure to read the package directions on the mortar to ensure that you buy the right size.

, Lay the tiles into the mortar and using the spacers, make sure you are running even with the chalk line. As you move on to the subsequent rows, use the spacers to keep your pattern square. Once a tile is set, try to avoid touching it again.

, Wash the tiles off with a damp rag as you go to prevent clumps of mortar from drying on the surface. As you get to the end of the room, make sure your cut pieces fit properly, and then leave the mortar to dry for the manufacturer’s specified length of time.

, Mix the grout as specified on the package and begin liberally spreading it over the tile using the grout float. Use the float to make sure that there are no low spots, and then use a damp rag to wipe any excess grout from the face of the tile. Don’t worry at this point if the tile appears a little cloudy. Once the grout has had time to set up, repeat the process, again using the float to squeegee and extra grout off of the face of the tile.


Aside from being available in many different colors, grout comes in two varieties: sanded and un-sanded. The sanded variety is used when the gaps between your tiles is bigger than 1/8″. The sand gives the grout additional strength. Anything 1/8″ or smaller will be just fine using un-sanded grout. You will most likely find that you want to use the un-sanded grout in the smaller gaps because it finishes much smoother. Working sanded grout into a small gap can be frustrating.
One word of warning: if you are using marble tile on your floor, never use sanded grout! Make sure you install it with 1/8″ or smaller gap because you must use un-sanded grout with marble. The sanded grout will scratch the surface of the marble tile and it is not repairable.

, Once the grout is completely dry, take a wet rag and wash the surface of the entire floor. As the floor dries, you will probably notice a haze forming over the tile. Allow it to dry completely again, and then go back over it with a slightly damp rag – this should polish the haze right off.


A grout float can be used to work the grout into the gaps between the tiles.

, Once you have polished the remaining grout and mortar residue off of the floor and you are confident that the grout has fully cured, use the grout sealer to prevent stains and mildew from taking hold in the future.

, A bra strap wrapped around a delicate garment will break down fibers faster., Denim and other tough fabrics can cause more wear and tear on fibers. Just as you wouldn’t wash your athletic shoes with lingerie, you shouldn’t wash hard worn items with delicates.

, Modern HE washers use a slow, longer tumbling action to wash clothes. Although any contact with the washbasin can be hard on fibers, it is gentler than the traditional agitator washbasin., Purchase a detergent that is intended for HE washers. Fill it to less than the maximum amount, unless there is very heavy soil.

,, Don’t let the temperature rise above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius). Most modern detergent brands are just as effective in cold water., Again, unless there is heavy soil, it will be enough to wash the clothes and prevent fading.


If you have heavy soil in your socks, gym clothes or underwear, purchase an enzyme detergent. Wash these heavy soil items separately at 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26 degrees Celsius).

, If you live in a cold climate, your cold-water wash may run at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) instead of 60 (16 degrees). Since this temperature is too low to wash your clothes with most detergents, you will need to use a warm setting while the water is colder., Vinegar is said to set colors.

, Textile makers use salt to set dye in fabrics, so the clothes are less likely to bleed.Salt is a commonly used ingredient in color safe detergents.

, Heat and tumbling in the dryer will contribute to fading. Buy a rack and hang your clothes to dry inside.


Lay wool items out flat on a towel to dry them.

, Your clothes will usually smell fresh and retain more color than they would with constant drying cycles.

, Overdrying will beat up the clothes and fade them prematurely.

, Direct sunlight will start to bleach the fabric almost immediately. The closer you are to the equator, the stronger this effect will be.

If you have exposed drywall, you should only dust your wall and limit the use of water and other cleaners on it due to the material's porous nature.Dust your walls at least once a week to maintain them.

, Using acidic cleaning solutions could damage the appearance of your wall. To avoid this, use simple water and a cellulose sponge. Dampen your sponge but don't fully saturate it. Apply pressure on the sponge and move from the top to the bottom of your wall. Saturate your sponge when it becomes too dry. Continue to do this until you've washed the entire wall.In addition to being soft on your walls, cellulose sponges are made of bio-degradable materials that are good for the environment., Pour two cups (473.17 ml) of warm water in a bucket with three drops of mild dish soap.

Caulk any needed areas.",How to Tile a Shower," You may need to remove the shower pan and ceiling, as well. Do not put down any plastic because this can trap moisture and lead to rotting. Instead, use a product that you can paint on to help prevent moisture.





;
, If you fail to install a vapor barrier, you might grow mold and mildew as moisture from your shower escapes through the tiles and into walls. Improperly installed tile and grout can allow water vapor to pass into the space behind.








When installing a vapor barrier on an exterior wall, it may be helpful to seal a plastic vapor barrier to the concrete floor but not all the way up to the top of the ceiling. With insulation improperly installed, or in colder climates, there's a chance that condensation that forms behind the vapor barrier will cause the framing members to rot. In order to avoid that possibility, install the vapor barrier with space to spare so that the gap behind the vapor barrier can breathe. Use a roll on product, such as Red Guard.Wedi boards are another option some consider even better than cement board. If you choose a membranous barrier such as Trugard or Kerdi, you can install plain old drywall or you can just install a cement board instead.

, Putting up cement board is just like putting up drywall. You cut it to fit using a grinder with a diamond bit, and then screw it to the studs. Leave a 1/8"" gap between panels and then a very small space between the shower pan and the bottom of the backer so that the two don't squeak by rubbing together.









Use a hole saw with a carbide bit to cut the holes where the shower head and handles would come through.
Make the cement board flush with the tile lip of your shower pan by using shims behind the board to bring it out to the desired thickness. Make sure to use composite shims.
Use 100% silicone caulk to seal the seams between the panels and then apply the silicone behind the board on the stud. Add some seam tape between the panels as well.

, If using crown molding near the ceiling, lay down 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) of drywall instead of cement board. Nails used to fix the crown molding in place will not travel through the cement backer; you'll need to use moisture-resistant drywall such as greenboard in order to take the nails and affix the molding.








, If there's a gap between the backer board and the wallboard, you'll want to use seam tape and then feather the gap with thin set mortar so that it appears as one continuous back. Remember that the seams must remain tight with gaps 3/16"" or smaller.








, After you've feathered the edges to remove the gap, apply a high quality water resistant exterior primer over the feathered wallboard and backer.







, Measure up from the bottom of the backer board the height of a tile minus 1/2"". This will give you a 1/2"" overlap over the tile lip on your shower pan. Make sure that you allow room for the grout joints as well. Mark this with a sharpie or chalk and using a level, transfer the mark across the shower stall. This will be a guide for the top of the first row so that all tiles will be level. Only use dry tiles make sure that the lay out works as well.









Another way to plan out the first row of tiles is to measure the high part and low part of the shower pan. Make the cut spot on the low end a full tile, mark it, and then cut the tiles on the high side down to the level of the uncut tile on the low side.
Keeping grout lines away from the inside corners of the enclosure can prevent the need for tiny tiles and poor grout joints. Plan accordingly and always make cuts tight on the inside corner.

, You want your thin-set to be the consistency of peanut butter — not too thick or it will dry out and not too thin or you'll have a hard time setting the mortar with strength and cleaning.








Use an electric drill and a mortar mixing bit attached to your drill to mix your thin-set mortar. This will ensure even consistency and ultimately a better product. Let the mortar set for seven minutes and then mix it again.

, If you do not, the cement board will draw the moisture out of the thin-set too quickly, making for a brittle set that is susceptible to cracking.








, Apply mortar to the backer board along with back buttering and then set the tiles on top of that. It's a lot cleaner, too!









Be sure not to apply too much mortar to the back of a tile. You only need a little in each corner and a little dab in the middle for back buttering. More isn't necessarily better when it comes to thin-set. Keep in mind that back buttering is only necessary when you are using a larger tile (8"" x 8"" or larger) and you only need to add a little dab of thin set mortar to each corner.

, This will create a pleasant visual effect and allow each tile that is placed beside it on either side seem centered. After back buttering, simply press the tile onto the backer board and apply pressure to make sure that the mortar adhered properly to both the tile and the backer board. Then, give the tile a little twist and tap each one with a rubber mallet, especially the floor tiles.









Wipe away any excess thin-set mortar after pressing the tile onto the backer. Although you'll be grouting and caulking between the tiles, it's best not to leave any thin-set on oozing out from the sides of the tile. Dig out any oozing thin-set that you notice. Simply wipe away excess thinset with your finger or a Q-tip.
Use small shims or other spacers to allow a small amount of space between the bottom of the tile and the lip of the shower pan.Small pieces of cardboard work great as makeshift shims. After the mortar is set, you can simply remove these shims and caulk between the lip of the pan and the bottom of the tile.

, Spacers will leave you identifiable grout lines between tiles. Small 1/16"" or 1/8"" spacers (or even bigger) can be placed at several places on the x- and y-axis of the tile to leave adequate space for an even grout line.








, Continue until you reach the top of the shower stall. Measure up from top of the last row. Mark the line with a level as a guide for your next row. Spread thin-set onto your tiles with v-notched trowel and place the tile just below the marked line. Use spacers all around.









Make sure to measure every third or fourth row to ensure that you have an even grout line.

, This will make sure that the mortar has adhered properly to both the tile backing and the cement board backer.








, Mix up a batch of grout and let it rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Lightly wet the area you'll be grouting with a damp sponge and dump a bit of grout onto the area. Use a rubber float to smooth it into the joints, attacking each joint at a diagonal angle. After 30-40 minutes (check the directions on the bag of grout) you want to wipe the excess grout with a damp sponge and a circular motion. Keep wiping with a clean sponge until the tile is clear.









The tiles may look a bit hazy even after wiping, so you may have to buff them with a clean sponge to get rid of this haze.

, Then, seal the grout. Run a thin bead of liquid grout or aerosol grout sealer onto the grout line and wipe away. Let dry and then test its water resistance by dropping water onto the sealed grout. Correctly sealed grout will cause the water to bead up on top of it.








, Make sure to use a grout caulk to match the colors. As you caulk, remember to pull the caulk gun relatively quickly across the joint. Most amateurs caulk too slow and end up dropping too much caulk down on the joint. Other things to remember:









Keep the tip angled as you run the bead along the joint.
Match the speed with which you pull the caulk gun trigger with the rate at which you pull the gun along the joint. You don't want to be pulling the gun fast but triggering slowly, or vice versa.
After applying the bead of caulk, ""bed"" it by running a damp finger across the bead with light pressure.
Make sure that your grout chalk matches the grout.
Let the caulk dry and redo it if you are not happy with the results.

, If you are installing the marble on a floor that is already tiled then you must remove the old tiles first.


Ceramic tiles can be smashed with a hammer and then removed.
Vinyl tiles should be ripped up with a pry bar., Before installing any tiles you will want to make sure that the floor surface beneath the tiles is thoroughly cleaned and dried.

, Marble is a very soft tile and can be particularly susceptible to cracking if it is not installed on a level surface. Use the longest level possible to make sure your floor is level.


You can try sanding down any bumps that raise the floor or filling in any depressions in the floor surface with thin-set cement. Wait for the cement to completely dry before continuing.
You may also need to lay a plywood subfloor to make the floor level.
Marble should not be installed on a floor that has a change in height that is more than ¼ inch (6 mm) in a distance of 10 feet (3 m).

, Run your finger nails over the tiles to make sure there are not cracks or gaps in the polished surface of the tile. You should not use any tiles that have these cracks or gaps because they might break in the process of installation or use.


Most hardware stores will accept exchanges of tiles that have cracks or gaps in them.

, Plan your installation on paper using the floor dimensions and sizes of the tiles. Decide on your pattern for laying the tiles. You can lay them in rows or in a pyramid-like structure or in other patterns. Draw the pattern to scale on paper.


You want to keep most tiles full-sized so that you do not have to cut them.
You also do not want strips of tile that are less than 2 inches (5 cm) wide.

, Measure the center of each wall and make a light mark with a pencil. Then take a chalk snap line and hold it to either end of the centers of two opposing walls. Lower the line and snap it to the floor to make a chalk line. Do this for the other two walls as well. Where the two chalk lines meet is the center of your floor.


You usually want tiles to radiate from the center of your floor.

, Continue snapping the chalk line on the floor in the planned grid. This will mark down where your tiles should go.

, Place your tiles within the grid you have created. This dry-run allows you to identify areas where you will need to cut tiles to fit and will help you determine the best place to start laying the tile based on your pattern and the shape of the area you plan to tile.


If the gap between the last complete tile and the wall is less than 2 inches (5 cm) then you should move the center tile over. This makes the strip of tile in this area wider, which will look nicer when you lay your tiles.

, Be sure to wear heavy-duty work gloves and work one section of the floor at a time. The adhesive should be thick enough that you can use the notched edge of the trowel to make grooves in the adhesive without showing the floor below, but thin enough that it does not push up between the tiles.


The grooves ensure that the adhesive spreads evenly on the back of the tiles.
Choose the adhesive recommended for your type of marble. Ask at the location where you purchase your tiles about the proper adhesive to use., Lay the tiles on top of the adhesive within 10 minutes of applying the adhesive. Be careful not to slide the tiles into place or get adhesive on the top of the tiles.


Sliding the tiles into place will push up the adhesive and make the tiles uneven, causing them to crack.
Adhesive will be difficult to remove from the tops of the tiles.

, Use spacers to create the correct spacing between the tiles and keep them even with straight lines along the rows and columns. You should use 1/8 inch (3 mm) marble tile spacers.


Spacers help ensure proper placement of the tiles.

, Check the level of the tiles to ensure that no edge “lips”, or rises above the rest of the tiles. Take a length of wood and lay it across the tops of the marble tiles, using a hammer to lightly tap the wood down. This ensures that all the tiles are at the same level.


Use the piece of wood in both directions along the grid to make all the tiles exactly the same level.

, Place another tile against the wall so that the edge of the second tile lays on top of the first tile. Score a line in the first tile using a utility knife to mark your cut line for the correct width of tile needed.

, In order to minimize the risk of tiles breaking when they are being cut, saw three-fourths of the length of the tile, turn the tile around and then cut the remaining length. Repeat the process until you have cut all the specially sized tiles and placed them into the adhesive.


You can usually rent a wet saw for a day from a local hardware store or tool rental company.

, If you have put too much adhesive beneath the tiles or push the tiles down too hard then it can push up between the tiles. If this has happened then you must take a small knife to cut out these extra bits.

, Different adhesives take different lengths of time so check the adhesive instructions for the proper drying time.


Do not step on the tiles during this time or else you can make them uneven.

, Marble is very soft and prone to damage so it is important to apply a coat of high quality marble sealing agent before proceeding with the grout. This seal is also important because marble is very porous and grout can cause stains in the tiles.


Apply the sealing agent over the tops of the marble.
Even if you prefer the color and look of unsealed marble you can use a “grout release”-type sealer to prevent grout from sticking to the marble tiles.

, Grout, or mortar, will be used ot fill in the spaces between the tiles. Be sure to wear a dust mask, safety goggles, and heavy-duty work gloves. Wear a long-sleeve shirt to avoid any possible damage to your skin from contact with the grout.


Mix only enough as will be used in 15-20 minutes of work or else the extra can dry out and harden.

, This prepares the spaces for the grout or mortar.

, Spread the concrete evenly over the spaces between the tiles using a squeegee. Be careful to avoid getting cement on the tops of the tiles. Some will inevitably get on top of the tiles but you want to minimize the amount.


Try to push it into the spaces as much as possible to create a tight fight.
Wipe up any grout on top of the tiles as you go.

, Use a squeegee to spread out the grout and leave a smooth surface in the cracks. You can also use a gloved finger to run down the grooves and smooth the top of the grout.

, Use a damp sponge to wipe down the tops of the tiles to remove any excess grout. Try not to get extra moisture into the grout or else it can make it too wet.

, Allow the grout to dry for the length of time required by the manufacturer. Some will require long curing times to ensure maximum strength., Use a disposable sponge applicator to paint the grout with a grout sealer. This will help prevent stains and dirt from permanently discoloring the grout. It will also make cleaning easier later on.

, Clean your tools with water or acetone to remove the excess grout or mortar and prepare them for use once again.

Use regular white toothpaste.,
Apply the toothpaste to the mark.,
Use a sponge to wipe off the toothpaste.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Tile2," Do not use gel toothpaste. If possible, choose a toothpaste product that contains baking soda such as Arm & Hammer. Toothpaste is great for removing marks from tile that is textured., Cover the affected area with the toothpaste. Let the toothpaste set for a minute or two. The longer the stain has been on the tile, the longer you will want to let the toothpaste set.For example, if the marker has been on the tile for a 24-hour period, then let the toothpaste set for at least five minutes.

, After the toothpaste has set, begin wiping it off with a sponge. If your tile is textured, then you may want to use a toothbrush or a scrubbing brush to remove traces of the stain from smaller crevices in the tile.Once the stain is removed, clean the affected area with soap and water to remove any residue.

Purchase a black dry erase marker.,
Trace the affected area with the marker.,
Wipe off the marker with a paper towel.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Tile3," You can purchase dry erase markers from your local pharmacy, arts and crafts store, or discounted retailer. Make sure to purchase a black dry erase marker as opposed to a colored one.Remember to test a small, hidden area first before using it on larger, affected areas.

, Instead of tracing the entire stain, start by tracing a small part of the stain first. This method works best on smooth tile. For textured tile, the toothpaste or all-purpose solution may be more effective., Or you may use a rag or cloth to wipe off the traced sections. If the stain isn’t completely removed the first time, then re-trace the remaining spots with the dry erase marker. Wipe until the stain is removed.Use warm water and soap to clean the affected area after the stain is removed.

Find a source for scrap, broken or discontinued tile and stone.,
Put the pieces together.,
Set the pieces in place.,
Wait.",How to Make Tile Floors from Scrap Materials," All the marble and granite shown in the picture in the introduction was salvaged from the trash pile at a stone distributor/fabricator. Tile distributors also sell returns and discontinued styles at a discount. Collect pieces that are all roughly the same thickness. Don't be concerned about using colors and patterns that don't match - the variety is what makes the overall floor appealing.;
, If you have the inclination and mental discipline to work out a pattern first, draw it on the floor and then fit the stone to it. However, you can also just pick a corner and start laying out pieces, expanding on patterns suggested by shapes and colors in the materials, fitting them together as you would a jigsaw puzzle. Cut pieces as needed with a wet-cutting tile saw, fitting the stone together so the grout lines are 1/8"" to1/2"" wide. If you're making a completely abstract pattern, lay out the entire floor without mortar first - cutting and fitting can be very time-consuming.

, Once you're satisfied with the floor, mix about 2 gallons worth of white tile-setting mortar (the kind used for marble), carefully move several square feet of the pattern to the side, spread mortar in that area with a wide-notch trowel (check the mortar bag for recommended trowel size) and then set the stone back in place permanently. Check a few pieces to make sure they're roughly 3/4th covered with mortar. If they're not, spread additional mortar and/or spread some mortar on the back of the piece. Use metal washers or stone chips to shim up low pieces - all the pieces should be close to the same level so the floor is smooth and you don't stub your toe when walking. Dull any sharp, protruding edges with a tile saw or grinding stones. Wipe excess mortar off the tile and out of the grout lines within 20 minutes.

, After the entire floor is done, stay off it for 24 hours. Then apply a sealer or grout release (very important with rough stone tiles), let it dry, and finally grout using sanded grout. Work in 5 - 10 s.f. sections, wiping grout from the tile surface within 15-20 minutes of spreading it. Scrub off the fine haze after the grout has hardened (8 hrs.), then apply a final coat of sealer after a few days (check sealer instructions).

Enjoy your shower!",How to Create a Mosaic Shower Enclosure," In this example, it's a stud partitioned wall.
, Alternatively, you can use special shower cladding material; no need to use marine ply though. It may be a good idea to build some sort of access panel should access be required to the controls, but being a mosaic this isn't going to be that useful.,, Ideally, use the thick variety, but as long as it is strong it can be normal wrapping variety. Make sure it fits but isn't too tight. On the back of the paper draw circles, the more the merrier. This will help you match up your planned design accurately when you put it on the wall., Draw the design on the other side. Before you go too far, offer up the paper to the wall; the design should be on to the wall, the circles should be visible when the template is on the wall., If the design has a border do the borders first. Stick the mosaic to the brown paper using soluble PVA glue, with the side of the mosaic that needs to be exposed face down.,, If there are any designs running through the design, do those first.

This design had gold and silver swirls as well as a scattering of gold and silver.






On this design there are seven colour bands ranging from dark blue to lighter blue, then light green to dark green, so start laying the tiles following the design.







, The good thing about mosaic is you can't really get it wrong. You can start from both ends and make sections bigger or smaller depending on how many tiles of each color/design you have., Take your time!,,, You'll be applying the design ""backwards"" so that the brown paper is what you see (you'll remove it later). If you have some play at the bottom, start at the top., Use the circles that were drawn on the back to ensure the design is properly aligned., Once the whole panel is in place, leave for at least 24 hours for the adhesive to dry., After twenty-four hours use warm water and soak off the brown paper and soluble PVA glue so you are hopefully left with the mosaic pattern. If you have used just the right amount of adhesive, the mosaics will be stuck but the adhesive will not protrude beyond the tile gap., If not enough adhesive was used you may have to manually re-stick a few individual tiles that hadn't got enough adhesive. If too much adhesive was used then the excess may have squeezed too far between the joints in which case it needs to be cut chiseled back; either way take time to tidy it up., Get ready for grouting!, You have to then time it right so that the grout between the joints is dry enough to stay put but not so dry that you can't wipe off the grout from the tile face. For example, some grouts may allow two hours, but when you first smear on the grout you do need to have faith that you are going to be able to clean up the tiles., This is what you should be left with after grouting., The panel will hopefully match any existing panels., After the grouting has dried you can add some grout and tile sealant but if you have used high quality grout it is probably not necessary but it will help to keep the tiles clean., Apply sealant to the bottom where the grout meets the shower tray., When the sealant has dried the shower is now ready for use."

Choose plastic containers and garment bags you can close up and store in the closet or under the bed. Lay the clothes inside the container.Moths eat animal products such as wool, leather, and felt. They will chew through synthetic fibers to get to animal stains like sweat.;
, Read the directions on the box to find out how much of the product you need. To be an effective deterrent against clothes moths, you need to use enough mothballs. Simply lay the mothballs on or around the clothing., Close up the container. Make sure no air can escape. Once this is done, store the container in a safe spot, such as under the bed or in the closet. Over time, the mothballs will dissolve., The clothing will have a strong mothball smell, so clean it first. Soak the items in equal parts water and vinegar or add a cup (240 mL) of vinegar to the wash cycle. Place the water and vinegar combination in a spray bottle for use on clothing that can’t be put in a washer and dryer.Dryer sheets placed in a garbage bag with the clothing may also remove the odor.Do not machine dry the clothing until the smell is gone or else it will linger permanently.

, Vinegar is also useful for getting rid of the odor in the containers. Mix an equal amount of water and vinegar inside the container. Let it soak for a couple of minutes, then rinse out the container with warm water. Do this before storing the container or using it again.

Vinegar can also help you clean closets or other areas that smell like mothballs.

, A proper cleaning after usage removes stains that the moths seek. Wash all clothing, including your synthetics. Empty the pockets of lint. Remove sweat, perfume, and drink stains through your normal washing routine. Heat dry the clothing in a machine dryer to kill off any eggs or larvae present on the clothing.Don’t starch your clothing before storage. It’ll be food for the moths.

, Moths cannot get into plastic boxes or bags that are sealed, no matter how stained the clothing. Storing clean clothing in these containers is a great way to protect clothing without depending on toxic mothballs.You may see some people swear by cedar scents or chests. The scents don’t work, and the chests only work because they function as sealed containers., Once or twice a month, take out clothing not sealed in containers. Set them in a dryer and put them through a drying cycle. Otherwise, allow them to be exposed to the sun for a few hours. The heat neutralizes moth eggs., After exposing the clothing to heat once or twice a month, jostle free any existing insects. Give the clothing a good, hard shake. Alternatively, pass a brush over all sides of the clothing to remove any hidden eggs and larvae., You can’t use mothballs in the open, so you’ll have to keep your home clear of moth food sources. Vacuum out your drawers, closets, and furniture. Get all areas you normally don’t disturb, including under furniture. Use the vacuum to get all lint and hair.Any mice or rats that have eaten poison and died in hidden areas can cause moths, so do make sure to clean everywhere.

, Empty both of them of clothing. Get a surface cleaner or a mild dish or laundry detergent. Soak the rag in the solution and use it to wipe down the entire area. Clean off any clothing separately before reintroducing them to the storage areas., Boric acid is a powder that can be found at stores that carry pest control products. Follow the directions on the label to apply the product. You should only apply a dusting to every crack or crevice in your home. This will take care of any loose moths that may live there."

If you don’t have a garden, you could purchase some dried herbs from a grocery store. For instance, you could choose a selection of the following dried herbs and berries:Chamomile flowers
Myrtle leaf
Cinnamon chips
Mullein leaf
Orris root powder
Hawthorn berries
Allspice
Juniper berries
Hibiscus flowers
Cedar leaf tips
Whole cloves
Rose buds
Cardamom pods
Cinnamon chips;
, Find a dry, breezy room in your house. Tie a small batch of herbs together with a piece of string. Loosely wrap the herbs in a paper bag. Hang the herbs upside down on the wall or on a clothesline. It should take about ten days for the herbs to dry.Avoid putting the herbs in a plastic bag, which will encourage mold growth.

, A potpourri is an air freshener but is also used as a design element in your home, so you should attend to the visual appeal of the mixture. Try to find a balance between the different sizes, shapes, colors and smells in your potpourri.Combine fragrant herbs that mix well such as chamomile, dried peppermint leaves, lemon balm leaves, rosemary, bay leaves, cinnamon sticks and fennel seeds.
If you like the smell at the spa, try mixing lemon, rosemary, cinnamon and vanilla.Try a mix of cinnamon, cloves, star anise, apples and oranges.Include flowers such as dried rose petals and visual elements such as pine cones.

, A fixative will help to enhance and seal the fragrance of your potpourri. You can use gum benzoin, cinnamon powder, vanilla pods, frankincense powder, myrrh gum powder, angelica root powder, benzoin gum powder or orris root powder for the main ingredient in your fixative. You can get these ingredients from a spice store.Add an essential oil and mix everything together with a whisk. Combine three tablespoons of orris root powder and some essential oils.You could try the following essential oil blend:

Ten drops of organic ginger
Ten drops of organic geranium
Ten drops of organic clove
Four drops of organic douglas fir
Four drops of organic lemon

, Put on some gloves, such as kitchen or gardening gloves. Pour the fixative mixture over your chosen mix of herbs and berries. Fold the fixative mixture into the bowl of herbs until everything is thoroughly incorporated.You will need one ounce of fixative per batch of potpourri. One batch of potpourri is approximately four to six cups of dried ingredients., Put the potpourri in a nice display bowl. Move the herbs around until you are satisfied with the look of your bowl of potpourri.You could also store the extra potpourri in an airtight container. There is no guarantee it will last until you need it. However, you can always freshen it up by spraying the potpourri with some perfume.You could make little gift bags of potpourri for friends. Put some potpourri in a paper lunch bag and write your homemade recipe on the side.

, Smell the bowl of potpourri. At this stage, you can add additional essential oils of your choice. Start by smelling your potpourri observing whether or not there is anything missing. If you feel it could use a hint of vanilla, for instance, add some vanilla essential oil., You could display the potpourri on a kitchen table, on a dining room table or on a side table in your bedroom. If you are using it at the office, you could place it on a coffee table or on an empty portion of your desk.


Freshen your potpourri with some essential oil every few days. Sprinkle lavender oil, rosewater or verbena. You can find oils in health food stores. Add three drops of essential oil.

Prepare your wall.,
Wipe the wall with a damp sponge or cloth evenly, and then remove any traces of moisture with a dry cloth afterwards.,
Get the layout sorted.,
Apply the sticker.,
Remove the masking.,
Make sure that the vinyl bits of your wall sticker visible now have stuck firmly to the wall.",How to Apply a Wallsticker," First up, you need to make sure your wall’s ready for that wall sticker. Applying a wall sticker onto a freshly painted wall is a big NO. Make sure the wall sticker goes onto a wall with the paint coating over it in fairly cured and strong form.


One other thing is that getting a wall sticker onto a coarse textured wall surface is going to be tricky. The vinyl of the wall sticker wouldn’t properly adhere to the wall surface. A proper bonding is always obtained on a smooth surface.
Now that those are considered, and you’ve finalized on your wall and you’re bent on the transformation, keep in mind that a dust covered wall isn’t one of those things you’d want when you get a wall sticker on. The dust reduces the sticker adhesion.;
, Now your wall’s all ready to get that sticker slapped on.

, The next thing to do now after your wall has been sorted out for the sticker is to get your stickers arranged, and to figure which goes where, especially if the wall sticker you’ve chosen is a jigsaw of stickers.


Just lay it on the ground and do a rough layout quickly, and then afterwards, while you’ve got it all figured out, get a roll of tape and stick the top parts of the stickers onto the wall and in position with the tape.
Make sure the stickers aren’t cluttered, and if you’re confused still, make demarcations with a charcoal piece or a paper to sort it out. You're getting somewhere now.

, Before we get down and sticky with things, keep in mind there are three things on the wall sticker cutting you’ve received- the die cut vinyl which is your actual wall sticker, the wax paper which is the thick layer behind the vinyl and the application tape, which is used to place the vinyl in position before adhesion onto the wall, which is the top layer of the cutting you’ve received. #*Making sure the sticker is in tune to the demarcation lines, remove the wax paper backing and pulling the sticker towards you and making sure it is sufficiently taut, bring the bottom towards the wall and firmly press it onto the wall. Now, use a slightly blunt edged object such as a credit card to squeegee out all the air bubbles stuck between the wall and the application tape.


Make sure you go over and over again as you smoothen out the application tape with the squeegee, removing as much air bubbles as you can. Now you’re all ready for the last move.

, Now, this here is a little tricky. Pry out one corner of the application masking from the wall and slowly tug along the topside, along an edge, till you’ve got one edge of it freed from the wall.


Now, tug the application masking downwards, at about 180 degrees to the wall surface, firmly. No hurry now, no evil genius is going to end the world in a minute with some evil contraption, so take all the time you want to get the masking off.

, If you see any bits of the vinyl sticking to the applicator as you tug it down, don’t cuss at the sticker, instead just trace the application masking back to how it was and then using the squeegee, smoothen it out and then tug again, it should be in place now. Keep pulling till you’ve completely freed the application masking from the vinyl.

Remove all accessories from the wall.,
Clear your work area of furniture.,
Lay down a drop cloth.,
Clean the surface of the wall gently.,
Cover adjacent surfaces with painter’s tape.,
Buy a bucket of primer.,
Roll the primer onto the wall.,
Use a handheld paintbrush to fill in the gaps.,
Let the primer dry completely.,
Choose the right type of paint.,
Mix the paint thoroughly.,
Begin painting at the trim by hand.,
Paint the interior of the wall.,
Apply additional coats.,
Allow the paint to set up overnight.",How to Paint a Wall," Locate any knobs, outlet covers, light switch faceplates, thermostats and other items along the wall and take them off. Starting with a smooth surface with no obstructions will help the project proceed much more efficiently.Most accents can simply be unscrewed and lifted off. Be sure to keep up with small pieces like faceplates, separators and screws (labeling them can help).Any accents that you’re unable to remove can be covered with painter’s tape later on.;
, Find a place to store nearby furniture, appliances and other belongings until you’ve wrapped up your project. If space is an issue, you can also simply scoot these items away from the wall you'll be painting. Be sure to cover any remaining furniture with a drop cloth or sheet of plastic to keep it protected.Paint can be virtually impossible to get out of upholstered fabrics, so it's a good idea to safeguard your furniture even if you think it's a safe distance away from the wall.
Unplug all electronics and relocate them somewhere where they won't be damaged.

, Stretch out a canvas drop cloth or plastic tarp that will help catch spills and splatters once you begin working. For maximum protection, the drop cloth should extend all the way to the base of the wall.








Pass up flimsy floor coverings like newsprint or bedsheets. These materials are usually too thin to stop wet paint from soaking through.There’s no need to cover the entire floor. Just slide the drop cloth along as needed as you make your way from one end of the wall to the other.

, Wet a clean cloth or sponge with warm water and a mild liquid detergent, then wring out the excess moisture. Run the cloth over the walls from top to bottom to clear away dust and other debris that can interfere with the paint’s ability to set up properly.








Use a light touch—you just want to clean the wall off, not totally soak it.
A small amount of diluted TSP (trisodium phosphate) will be useful for removing stuck-on dirt and grime from walls in dirtier areas like the kitchen or basement., Painter’s tape can be used to protect the trim at the top and bottom of the wall and around doorways. It will also come in handy for putting over accents that are a pain to remove, like dimmer switches. Make sure to line up the edges of the tape precisely, or you could end up with a lopsided paint job.You can pick up painter’s tape from any home improvement store, as well as most major supermarkets and pharmacies.
Look for tape in different sizes. This will give you more flexibility over how to apply it and provide more coverage to keep paint from accidentally getting on other parts of the wall.

, For most jobs, a standard white primer will be your best bet. That way, the new paint color will be able to stand out. A gallon of primer should be enough to take care of most painting projects.Always use a primer when painting interior walls. Not only will it help the paint stick, it will also cut down on the number of coats you have to apply to achieve the same depth of color.Primer is especially useful when painting a lighter color over a darker color.

, Apply an even coat from the floor to the ceiling, covering the broadest areas near the center of the wall. The base coat doesn’t need to be too thick—as long as it's smooth and consistent, the paint will sit easily on top of it.








Try not to leave any bare patches, as this type of inconsistency can affect the final color of the paint.

, Work the primer into tight crevices and other hard-to-reach areas with the tip of the brush. Pay particular attention to corners, alcoves and the spaces around the trim and wall fixtures. Try to match the thickness of the rolled sections as best you can.Apply the primer using long, smooth strokes, then smooth it out by brushing it in multiple directions.
Remember to use your painter's tape for more precise lines and angles.

, Give the base coat a few hours to set up. It should be dry to the touch before you begin applying subsequent coats of paint. It may be more convenient to apply the primer in the afternoon or evening, then wait until the following day to tackle the paint.









Painting over wet primer can cause clouding and smudging, effectively ruining the coat.
Keeping your work area ventilated by opening a window or running an overhead fan or air conditioner will help the primer dry faster.

, When it comes to picking an interior paint, you have many options available to you. Consider not only color, but also the desired texture and finish you want for the wall. Pastels, for instance, can be used to brighten up the half-bath or sitting room, whereas darker shades can add a sense of size and dimension to communal areas like the kitchen.








Stock up on enough paint to be able to finish the project without running out. A single gallon is usually enough to cover about 400 square feet of wall space., Use an electric paint mixer or handheld stirrer to blend the paint to an even consistency. This will prevent the oils and pigments from separating, result in better coverage and a smoother finish. Once the paint reaches a uniform texture throughout, it will be ready to go.To cut down on sloshing and splattering, pour the paint into a larger bucket before you begin mixing.
Mixing your paint prior to starting a big project is essential, whether you're using a brand new can or one that's been sitting on the shelf for a while., Dip the tip of your paintbrush about 2"" into the paint, letting the excess drip off. Then, brush the paint onto the wall with the angled edge of the brush, starting at one of the room’s upper corners. Follow along the painter’s tape and work your way down using smooth, linear strokes until you’ve completed the outer perimeter of the wall.








Painting 2-3” outward from the trim will allow you to easily go over the rest using a roller.Pause periodically to rewet your brush when your strokes become faint.

, After you’ve painted the wall’s outer edges, use a wide roller to take care of the middle. The best method for painting with a roller is to apply it in alternating ""M"" or “W” pattern, working back and forth over the same section until it’s completely filled in. You can then move onto another section, repeating the same pattern.








A extended roller handle can help you reach the upper sections of the wall nearest to the ceiling.Only use as much paint as you need to cover the primer. Oversaturating your roller can result in unsightly drips in the top coat., Depending on how deep you want the new color to come out, you can roll on a second or even third coat of paint. Paint these followup coats the same way, starting with the outer edges of the wall and working your way inward. Be sure to wait about 2-4 hours between coats to give the fresh paint time to dry.Most walls shouldn't require more than a couple coats of paint. However, extra coats may be useful for walls with coarse textures or when painting over a darker shade.To avoid leaving obvious seams, make sure you go over the entire wall, including the area around the trim.

, Take one last look over the wall to check for thin spots, lumps, drips or other problem areas before calling it a day. Be prepared to give the top coat of paint at least twice as long to dry as you did the primer. In the meantime, try to resist the urge to touch the paint in order to prevent accidental smudges.








It usually takes somewhere between 24-48 hours for interior paint to cure completely.
Don’t forget to remove the painter’s tape once you’re satisfied with the look of the wall."

Rent or purchase the right tools.,
Determine the number of steel studs needed.,
Chalk the lines where the track will be fastened to the floor using a chalk box.,
Screw the lower lengths of track to the floor.,
Plumb the top track.,
Once plumb is established, attach the track to the upper ceiling.,
To trim to correct length, cut both side flanges of a steel stud.,
Join studs to tracks by clamping the two members tightly with C-clamp locking pliers.,
Fabricate metal headers by cutting the track 2 inches (5 cm) longer than the rough opening width.,
Secure electrical cable along the center line of each stud with plastic ties screwed to the studs.,
Add wood blocking as needed for doors, windows and cabinets.,
Hang drywall or sheathing using 1-1/4 inch (3.1 cm), self-tapping drywall screws.,
Finished.",How to Install Metal Studs," Working with steel studs requires a few special tools. You can typically get the best equipment for this at local construction rental stores. You will need:


Metal cut-off saw
Fasteners
A hammer drill
Screw gun
Chalk box
Level
Laser level or plumb bobClamps;
, You should typically allow for 1 stud per every 12 inches (300 mm) of linear wall space. Purchase steel plates — also called tracks — for the bottom and top of the wall by measuring the linear feet of the wall and doubling it. Add an additional stud for each side of a window or door.

, Snap a chalk line across the perimeter of the floor to outline where your track will need to go.

, Use the chalk line to position your lower track and screw the track in by first drilling a hole into the track and stud, and then fastening with a screw. If you're drilling through concrete, try using the power nailer or hammer drill for an easier time.


Negotiate corners and long straight lines when laying track. Overlap track corners by flattening the first track’s side flange so the overlapping track can slide right into place. On longer, straight runs, overlap the adjoining tracks at least 6 inches and secure the overlap to the floor with a concrete screw.

, To make sure that the upper and lower track are plumb, you can use either a laser level, a plumb bob, or two water levels:


To use a laser level, simply place it in the bottom middle of the track and turn it on to shine a vertical laser up to your wall. This point will be your plumb point on the upper wall. Most contractors recommend using a laser level for efficiency and ease of access.
Using a plumb bob is similar to using a laser level. Attach the string to the top of the wall and let the bob come to a rest at the plumb line on the bottom of the floor.
If you have neither a laser level nor a plumb bob, you can try using two water levels pressed together. Keeping both levels together, extend one to the ceiling and other to the floor, making sure that both levels are plumb. Mark off your plump line on the floor or ceiling.

, Use a drill and screw gun to the attach the track, pretty much just as you attached the ground track.


If your track runs perpendicular to the ceiling joists, fasten the track to the joists with self-tapping drywall screws.
If your track runs parallel to the ceiling joists, fasten the track to the joists with drywall anchors or secure it with grabber screws and glue., Use straight-cut aviation snips for this. Bend one flange up, clear of the snips’ jaws, and cut across the stud’s web.


For easier electrical and plumbing installations later on, keep all the keyhole knockouts aligned by cutting all studs to length from the same end. Protect your hands with heavy-duty gloves.
To cut multiple pieces at once, use a miter saw with a metal cutting blade.
Make cutting the studs with aviation snips easier by first scoring the studs with a utility knife on both sides and then bending the stud back and forth until it breaks apart.

, Drive a 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) No. 8 pan-head screw in the middle where they meet. This should be done at medium speed.


Choose a clutch setting strong enough to drive the screw home, but not so strong that it strips the screw hole and weakens the joint.

, Cut each flange of the track (on both ends) 1 inch (2.5 cm) lengthwise. Bend the web down 90 degrees using sheet metal locking pliers.

, Pop a plastic bushing into each knockout in order to keep the cable from rubbing against the sharp edges.

, If your steel stud wall seems flimsy, keep in mind that it gains full rigidity once drywall or sheathing is applied.

, They should be spaced every 8 inches (20.3 cm) along edges (where two sheets meet on a stud) and 12 inches (30.5 cm) on centers located elsewhere.


Use screws with a fine thread instead of a coarse one.
Check your local codes. They may require screws placed closer together, and you're better off having too many than having to add more after the inspector comes.

, Your new metal studs won't rot, sag, or be susceptible to fire. Learn how to hang drywall and finish the process.

,
Fit each subsequent sheet or panel into place until the area your are working in is complete.,Prime and paint the soffit or ceiling according to manufacturer's recommendations.",How to Install Cement Board Soffit Panels," Soffit and ceiling cement board products are available from a number of manufacturers and have a variety of surface finishes. You can research these at building product retailers, lumber and building supply stores, and larger home improvement warehouses. Here are some things to consider:

Dimension. Sheets can be in various sizes, from 12 inch (30cm) widths to 48 inch (121cm), and in lengths up to twelve feet (3.6 meters). Thicknesses are available from 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch (6.5mm to 1.3cm).
Surface. The surface of these products are available in rough-sawn lumber finish, faux stucco, and smooth.
Perforated or non-perforated. For ventilated soffit applications, the cement board product is available in perforated sheets, for non-ventilated, solid sheets are available.


 

;
, Cement board requires support at a maximum of two foot (60cm) spacing, and additional blocking may be required at sheet edges to insure the surfaces are flush after installation. The best results are achieved when blocking is installed at all edge and end joints. Because of the weight of this material, joists or other framing members must be capable of supporting the total weight after installation.
, For ceiling and soffit installation, exterior grade, paintable screws with countersink heads are required by some manufacturers. These should be able to penetrate the framing member a minimum of four times the thickness of the panel being installed. If you choose to use nails, hot dipped galvanized or stainless steel siding nails are recommended.
, Install all framing members and roofing components to assure the assembly will not be exposed to weather until the installation is complete.,, Allow enough space so that positioning the board can be accomplished without damaging the edges, but make sure any exposed joints will have an acceptable appearance. Trim or batten strips may be used if joints are not tight enough to offer an acceptable appearance.
, There are several methods used for cutting cement board:

Circular saws. Special saw blades are available for cutting cement board, but carbide toothed circular saw blades will give satisfactory cuts if the amount of cutting is not excessive. Avoid breathing the dust produced by sawing, either by using a fan or wearing a NIOSH approved respirator.
Pneumatic or electric sheers can be used for thin boards, but are expensive and usually only practical for a professional installer.
Scoring and snapping. Using a straightedge and scoring the board with a sharp utility knife, then bending it (similar to cutting gypsum wallboard products) is a technique that can be used––it produces very little dust, but is less precise and doesn't give a smooth, flat cut.

, Be very careful if large holes occur, or if holes are very close to the edge of the board, as this can cause breakage if carelessly handled in installation., Screws can be driven through the board without pilot holes, however, if a certain spacing is required, laying out the screw locations and drilling pilot holes will make meeting this requirement simpler, and will make starting the screws easier.
, Sheets must be supported carefully, or they will break, and because of the weight of the material, at least two people should be engaged in this step. If the installers are working from a ladder or scaffold, a ground person may use a piece of lumber to help hold the panel up while the installers position the piece and tack it in place.
,, Install trim and caulk joints as needed, clean up surfaces where blemishes or spoiling from screw penetrations has occurred.

Find out if you can return your sheets.",How to Buy Microfiber Sheets," If you can, test out other fabric types to determine which you prefer. Microfiber is generally not as soft as cotton or silk. Other textiles are also better than microfiber for moderating temperature. Cotton is very breathable, keeping you cool during the summer and warm during the winter. Linen is great for moderating temperature in high humidity.


Consider linen if you sweat a lot at night. However, linen often has a rough texture.
Egyptian cotton is generally considered the softest type of cotton, but there are now some brands that market lower grade products as “Egyptian cotton.”;
, Price is the major advantage for microfiber sheets. Microfiber sheets can cost as little as $20, whereas high quality cotton sheets might be several hundred dollars., Microfiber is durable and easy to wash. Cotton, on the other hand, is liable to shrink when washed. Microfiber might not be the most luxurious fabric, but you can buy it at a good price and keep it for a long time without investing a lot of effort into care., Your bed will be a twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, or California king. You should buy sheets that match. Also consider whether your mattress is unusually deep; measure how deep it is ensure that your sheets will be a good fit.


You should get sheets that are at least as deep as your mattress, preferably a little bit deeper. Otherwise, the sheets are liable to come off the mattress, especially if you sleep on the side of the bed., For a larger selection and more competitive prices, check popular online retailers such as Amazon, eBay, and Overstock. This will give you a sense of what prices are competitive even if you do go to the store. Importantly, some online vendors include product reviews, which will help you ascertain the quality of the sheets.


Unfortunately, a lot of the labeling for sheets is deceptive, so you should strongly consider doing research on a product before making a large purchase.

, Consumer Reports is a good resource for getting an objective review of a product. Unfortunately, Consumer Reports has found that the vast majority of sheets are falsely advertised and poorly produced. Search online for consumer reports and sheets to get reviews for individual products., The gold standard for determining the softness of a sheet is thread count. The higher the number, the softer it should be. That having been said, many manufactures artificially inflate thread count, meaning that this is no longer an entirely reliable measure.A thread count from 200-800 is often ideal. Manufacturers that advertise thread counts of over 1000 have often used tricks that might actually detract from the quality of the sheets., Denier measures how thick a fiber is. The thinner the fiber (and thus the the lower the denier) the better. For a fabric to be considered microfiber, it must have a denier lower than .9. The best microfibers currently in production are generally somewhere between .5 and .6 denier., Weave is the way that threads are interwoven together and it influences the feel and durability of sheets. Percale is standard and has a durable and crisp feeling, Sateen has a smoother, silkier feel, but is less durable. Jersey is soft and comfortable, but inclined to shrink., Because so many features of labeling are unreliable, test sheets wherever possible. Touch fabrics on display beds.


Try holding the sheet up to a light. If too much light shines through, the fabric is probably light and flimsy.

, You can buy microfiber sheets in solid colors or in patterns. Think about what will work in your room. Buy microfiber sheets that will match your comforter or quilt.

, Sheet sets come with a flat sheet, a fitted sheet and depending on the size, 1 or 2 pillow cases. It is often cheaper to buy sets of sheets, rather than purchasing each piece individually.

, She might have more information to share. Ask for her recommendations and see what her opinion is of the sheets you are considering. Ask about care and durability.

, Each store has a different return policy, so make sure you know how to return or exchange your sheets if you change your mind after trying the sheets out at home


Remember you might find that the sheets don’t fit as well as you thought, or that they don’t feel the way you would hope. Many sheets have also been known to fall apart rather quickly."

Select appropriate molding to be your chair rail.,

Determine the height of your chair rail.,

Measure and cut any miters for the chair rail, especially if you are turning any corners that are not 90º.,

Measure the length of the chair rail carefully.,
Paint or finish the molding.,
Paint, paper, or panel the wall behind where the chair rail will go.,

Locate the studs in the wall and mark them with a pencil or bits of masking tape.
,Measure up from the floor and/or use a level to mark the chair rail height at each end of each piece.,Have an assistant help hold the chair rail at the marked height.,

Drive finishing nails through the chair rail all the way into the studs.,

Use a nail set to recess the nails slightly into the molding, so that the heads are inset.
,

Putty over the nails.,Touch up the paint or finish anywhere you have added putty or caulk.",How to Install a Chair Rail," It can be narrow or wide, depending upon the style you wish to add to the room, but it should be appropriate to go in the middle of the wall; it should lie relatively flat against the wall as well.
, You can place a chalk line or strip of masking tape on the wall to help visualize the height while you decide. It will probably be somewhere between 30 and 36 inches (75-90cm) high, though some go higher for dramatic effect. Here are other factors to consider.




 One way to decide the height of your chair rail.

The height of your chairs. Whether or not you are installing the chair rail to prevent damage to the wall, compare its height to your furnishings. It will help achieve a unified look.
Windows in the room. Will you break the chair rail for windows, or position the chair rail below the windows?
The height of any paneling that will go above or below the chair rail. If the chair rail will mark the top edge of wainscoting, for instance, simply follow the top edge of that material.

, If you have such a corner, look for an angle measuring device at your hardware store. Measure the angle, divide by two, and cut the chair rail on each side of the corner to the half-angle measurement., Miter corners, especially interior corners first, then measure at the height where the chair rail goes. Walls are not always exactly plumb or square. If necessary, miter the corners at the opposite ends. Regardless of whether the ends are mitered for interior or exterior corners, or not mitered at all, the back of the chair rail should be as long as the segment of wall against which it will rest., It is easier to finish the molding with it before it goes on the wall. Lay it on a drop cloth or newspapers or across a pair of sawhorses, and finish it to match other molding in your home., Again, this is simpler before the rail is installed. A simple way to define a space or change the appearance of a room is to paint or paper a different color or design above and below the chair rail.,,,, Take care not to hit the molding with the hammer, as it will mar.,, If you like, caulk the joints where the ends of the chair rail segments meet.,"
"
Set aside some space in which to work and an area in which the bricks can dry for a time - up to two weeks, possibly.,
Prepare a pit that will be used to mix your sand, clay, and water.,
Perform a ""jar test"" to determine your soil suitability.,
Calculate the volume of your wall:


Measure the length of the wall in feet.,
Obtain materials:


Sand (about half - 50% of your total volume).,
Create a form for making the bricks.",How to Build an Adobe Wall1,";
, One way to do this is to get about 20 cinder blocks and arrange them in a square, two layers deep. Then line the inside of the pit with a heavy duty tarp.

, Fill a jar (or plastic bottle - make sure it's see-through) halfway with the soil sample. Fill it the rest of the way with water. Shake vigorously for about a minute, then let it sit overnight. The next day, the soil will have settled into distinct bands. The bottom of the jar will have the larger-sized materials - sand and small pebbles - with smaller and smaller sized particles banding towards the top. The top band will be the clay or different silt. Ideally, the three bands will be about the same size. If your sample has more than a third sand (the bottom layer), you may not need to add any sand to your adobe.

,
Determine the height of the wall in feet.
Since bricks (and thus the wall) are made 10"" (25.5 cm) thick, multiply the length by height by 0.83 (10 in = .83 ft).
Divide that by 27. This is the total volume in cubic yards of the wall.

, Sand is usually sold by the ton - you can calculate tonnage by multiplying your volume by .83. The sand should be relatively fine sand - beach sand or slightly larger works fine. NOTE: The amount of sand you mix in is very dependent upon the clay you have available, your climate, and how strong you want the wall. It's entirely relative - and there's really no wrong way to do this.
Clay (about a third of your total volume). Again, clay or fill dirt is usually sold by the ton. Multiply your volume by .9 if it is dry, .7 if it is wet.
Straw (about 10 - 20% of your total volume). Straw is sold in bales of various sizes. The most common ""big"" bales are 14""x18""x36"" (35.5 centimeter (14.0 in) x 45.7 centimeter (18.0 in) x 91.4 centimeter (36.0 in), which is .15 cubic yards. So multiply your total volume by .015 to get the number of ""big"" bales you'll need.

, A typical form is made using two 2x4 studs, which are 96"" long. Note that a typical stud is actually 1.5"" (3.8 cm) by 3.5"" (8.8 cm), which is why the lengths are odd (25.5"", for example).
"
"
Shovel together sand and clay in the pit.,
Add water - enough to make the mixture ""soupy."",
Mix together - the easiest way to do this is to take off your socks and shoes, roll up your pant legs, and jump in with both feet.,
Lay out a tarp and shovel on several shovel loads of the mud.,
Sprinkle a couple of large handfuls of straw onto the mud.,
Stomp on the mixture.,
Pick up one side of the tarp so that the mixture falls back onto itself - sort of like kneading dough.

,
Keep mixing together in this way, adding straw as needed, until the mixture is fairly solid and hard to knead.

,
Grab large handfuls of the mixture and put them into the brick form.,
Let the bricks dry in the form for a short while - 15 minutes at least.,
Let the bricks sit where they are and dry a while - an hour or so.",How to Build an Adobe Wall2," These should be mixed according to the amounts you have and your own desires - again, there's really no wrong way.
,

, Mix around until you don't find any dry patches.

, As you scoop out the mud, try to let excess water drain back into the pit. You can also use a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket to scoop out mud onto the tarp. Cover about a third of the center of the tarp.

, You want to break it up so it's not clumpy - and take out any ""sticks"" of straw that might hurt when you step on them.

, The goal is to thoroughly mix the straw and the mud, so stomp around a lot.

,,, Make sure to push the mixture into the corners well, and punch it into the form so it is filled and solid.
, You can then remove the form and start filling it again.

, When they're solid and dry enough to move, stand them up on their sides to dry some more. It may take a week until they're dry enough to build the wall with.

"
"
Lay a foundation of gravel or stone.

,
Lay bricks flat on your foundation.

,
Use the mud mixture - or mud and straw mixture - as mortar between bricks.,
Use the mud mixture (it should be drier than the mixture you made for the bricks) as a plaster once the wall is built and dry.",How to Build an Adobe Wall3,",, You can layer the mortar up to 4"" ( 10 cm) thick, though 1"" or 2"" (2.5 cm - 5 cm)is probably enough.

, This adds a stucco look to the wall, which can look very pleasing to the eye.

Choose sheets that will fit your mattress.,
Choose a sheet material.,
Decide on a style and theme for your sheets.,
Check the thread count on the label.,
Select a comforter that matches your sheets.,
Choose a duvet.,
Consider buying a bedding set.,
Buy pillows and pillowcases.,
Incorporate a quilt.,
Wash your new bedding.",How to Buy Bedding," Find out which size you need to purchase by checking the tag on your mattress. Queen and King are the easiest bedding sheet sets to find in stores, while Full and Californian King are a bit more rare. Twin bedding sets are usually made for single-person beds.Be sure to look for fitted sheets that are deep enough to fit over the mattress, and take mattress thickness into consideration. Sheet sizes are typically as follows: Twin, 39 x 75""; Full, 54 x 75""; Queen, 60 x 80""; King, 76 x 80"".;
, The type and quality of fabric you choose will affect how comfortable you are as you sleep, so choose wisely; cotton or cotton blends are the most recommended choice. Flannel sheets can keep you warm in the winter, but on warmer evenings you could be too hot in flannel sheets., Do you want a stripe, polka dot, or a floral design? The bedding is the first thing that people will notice when they walk into your bedroom, so select bedding that matches your tastes. If you want to make an impression, choose bold colors; if you would rather display understated bedding, choose muted, cool colors such as dark blue or grey., Thread count refers to the density of the weave in threads per square inch. The higher the thread count is, then the more expensive the sheets are because more material, spun more finely, is needed to make them. Higher thread count indicates better quality. At minimum, your thread count should be 175-200, but for quality sheets, aim for a thread count of 350., Pick a comforter that matches the theme and style that your bedroom expresses. If you live in a warm climate, consider a lightweight comforter. Thick, heavy comforters are ideal for cold climates., A duvet is a removable cover typically made of down feathers. It should be spread over your sheets. If you choose to use a duvet, you most likely will not need a comforter as well., Most bedding sets come with a fitted sheet, a top sheet, a comforter, and one or two pillowcases. This packaged deal can be an easy way to save money. You may need to buy a blanket or additional bedding separately., Remember to supply yourself with pillows and pillowcases, since no bed is complete without a place to rest your head. If possible, buy pillowcases that match your sheets and comforter. Small throw pillows can be a colorful and fun accent to your bedding., A patterned quilt can add a splash of color to your bedding. It can also give your bed a more comfortable and unique feel. Spread the quilt over the bedding, or fold it and place it at the foot of the bed., Check that your machine can handle the load of bedding. Some comforters may require that you to take them to be professionally dry cleaned, or you can bring them to a Laundromat, which tend to have a few larger machines for this purpose. Be patient and follow the care directions (found on the product's tag).If washing at home or at the Laundromat, avoid using harsh detergents. Use the extra rinse cycle. Allow the comforter about 3-4 hours to dry completely."

Be aware that there is such a thing as a bunk sheet.,
Decide what size bunk bed sheets to buy.,
Determine which side of the sheets will have the opening.,
Determine what fabric you would like.",How to Buy Bunk Bed Sheets," Bunk bed sheets differ from regular sheets in that the fitted sheet and the top sheet are sewn together at the foot of the bed and up the wall side. The fact that they are attached eliminates the need for tucking in all those hard to reach places. Although the perfect solution for bunks and lofts, these sheets aren’t just for bunk beds––bunk bed sheets are perfect for any hard-to-make bed or for people who have a hard time making up a bed. Bed bunk sheets help to ensure that bed making is quick and easy, which in turn encourages everyone to make their beds.

For example, children are more apt to make their beds with easy sheets like these. Some elderly folks might buy bunk bed sheets if they have trouble bending or lifting to tuck sheets.
Don’t forget the teens or college kids who are always off to somewhere in a hurry.;
, Buy bunk bed sheets in the same size as the bunk bed's comforter. The only dimension that is different will be the mattress depth or pocket. Since bunk bed sheets are custom made to every order, you can have the fitted sheet portion cut to your exact mattress thickness for a snug fit. A snugly fitted sheet will make it easier to tuck the top sheet in on the front side of the bed., Since the wall side is sewn closed, it is important to have the opening on the proper side. It is possible to move furniture around to accommodate your sheets if you choose the wrong side but it is easier if you can determine the opening side from the outset. 

Position yourself at the foot of the bed looking toward the bed. Then compare your perspective to select the appropriate side opening.

, Bunk bed sheets come in many colors and a number of fabric choices.  

A 50/50 cotton polyester blend is the most economical. It is a stiffer, crisper fabric, it launders well, it wears well over time, and it wrinkles less. 
A blend with higher cotton content will still have the same features and is slightly softer but still crisp. If softness is most important, 100% cotton is a better choice. It is the most comfortable for sensitive skin, it launders well if removed from the dryer promptly however it wrinkles more, and it may pill over time.  
A cotton flannel sheet is very soft and warm for cooler climates, it launders well, it may shrink slightly, and it tends to hide wrinkles. Some folks even like flannel in the summer if they are using air conditioning. 
Finally, if you want a little indulgence, try bamboo bunk bed sheets. They are made of 100 percent viscose bamboo ,which is as soft as cotton sheets but absorbs and breathes more. Bamboo sheets are also antibacterial and anti-fungal.

Prepare the area for installation.,
Mark the top level line.,
Mark the studs.,
Glue and nail the panels from left to right.,
Cut custom pieces as necessary.,
Install the baseboard and upper moldings.",How to Install Wainscoting1," Remove existing baseboards, chair rails or skirt moldings. You should also remove outlet plates. Measure the linear footage of the room or wall with a tape measure in order to determine the number of panels you will need to purchase.


Allow wood wainscot panels to acclimate in the room where they will be installed for at least 48 hours. This will prevent expansion and contraction of the paneling from occurring after installation.;
, Establish a level line around the room for the top of the panels. Measure the appropriate height of the panels, up from the floor, and using a level as a straight edge, lightly pencil a guideline on each wall. A laser level will make this easiest.

, Use a stud finder tool, or gently tap the wall with a hammer, to locate the wall studs and mark them just above the level line.

, Apply construction adhesive to the back of a full panel and set it into place beginning in the corner of the room. Ensure the top of the panel is flush with your level line. Hold the panel in place and secure it with paneling nails. Try to anchor the molding into the marked wall studs whenever possible. Continue installing panels in the same manner, leaving 1/16 inch (2.54 cm) of space between each panel, until you arrive at the next corner.


The bottom of a piece can be sanded down or trimmed if there is variation in the floor and the piece will not fit. However, you should double check that the top level line was made correctly.
You will need to cut a hole for an outlet when you see that a panel will cover one. Cover the outlet in brightly colored chalk, line up the panel, press the panel into the chalk to get your outline, and then cut out the shape with a jigsaw.

, Measure and cut the final panel with a jigsaw to accommodate the appropriate length of the wall.

, Ensure the molding is flush and level with the top of the wainscoting. Again, secure each piece to a wall stud when possible.

Place the sheets in the washing machine.,
Add one cup of baking soda.,
Wash on a regular cycle.,
Add a cup of vinegar during the rinse cycle.,
Line dry the sheets.,
Wash again.,
Remember that your sheets will become softer every time you wash them.",How to Soften Stiff New Sheets1," After removing your new sheets from their packaging, place them directly into the washing machine.


If they are queen size or larger, you may want to wash the top and bottom sheets separately to give them enough room in the machine.;
, Instead of your normal laundry detergent, add one cup of baking soda to the machine.


It's important to omit the detergent, as it tends to lock chemicals into the sheets. These chemicals contribute to the stiffness of the sheets, so it's better to remove them.

, Set the machine to a regular cycle using warm water, and turn the washer on.

, When it's time for the rinse cycle, turn the temperature of the machine to cold and add a cup of white vinegar.


This will help to soften the sheets further, but is completely optional. The baking soda will work on its own., When the rinse cycle is finished, remove the sheets from the machine and hang outside to dry in the sun.


This will help to soften them further. If you don't have space to dry them outside, place in the dryer and dry on a low setting - drying at too high a temperature can cause shrinkage., Once the sheets are dry, you can wash them a second time using the regular amount of detergent.


Although washing them twice sounds like a lot of work, it really helps to soften the sheets.
Dry outside or in the dryer, then iron them (if you like) and place them directly on the bed.

, Good quality sheets will become softer after every washing, drying and ironing cycle.


For ultimate softness (and durability) buy good quality cotton sheets with a high thread count."

Gather your materials.,
Prepare the area for installation.,
Mark the top level line.,
Mark the studs and utility lines.,
Plan out your spacing.,
Attach your panels.,
Attach your top rail.,
Attach your stiles.,
Attach your baseboard and shoe molding.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Install Wainscoting2," You'll need 1/4"" plywood for the back panels, 1x4 lumber for the stiles, 1x6 lumber for the baseboard, and 1x2 lumber for the rails. You'll need to rent a circular saw from your local big box hardware store to cut the lumber and panels to size. A laser lever, scrap wood for stile spacing, stud finder, pneumatic nail gun with 2.5"" and 1.5"" finishing nails, and other tools can also be helpful. , Remove existing baseboards, chair rails or skirt moldings. You should also remove outlet plates. Measure the linear footage of the room or wall with a tape measure in order to determine how much wood you will need.


Allow wood to acclimate in the room where it will be installed for at least 48 hours. This will prevent expansion and contraction of the paneling from occurring after installation.

, Establish a level line around the room for the top of the panels. Measure the height of the room, divide that by 3, and create your panels to reach that height or close to it. Once you've calculated the height, draw and then mark (with painter's tape works best) a level line around the room. A laser level will make this easiest.


You may want to try to place the top edge of the panel just a little higher than the panel really is if you know that your floor is uneven. This will keep down the amount of trimming you need to do. Shoe molding can always be placed at the bottom to hide gaps that occur with an uneven floor.

, Use a stud finder tool, or gently tap the wall with a hammer, to locate the wall studs and mark them just above the level line. If you can locate the utility lines, you should mark those on the wall as well, to help avoid hitting them with nails.


Utility lines are often found around water sources or immediately next to the studs closest to outlets and wall lights. Be careful when nailing in these areas.

, The size and orientation of your room will determine what your paneling looks like, so specific measurements unfortunately cannot be given. There are a few basic guidelines you should follow though, in order to figure out where everything should go:


Try to get at least a few stiles placed over a stud. This will help seal your panel to the wall.
Don't place a stile over an outlet or other unusual feature. This will only create more cutting and measuring for you.
Try to line up your stiles to cover gaps between panels, helping to hide the seam.
Set the spacing of your stiles in a way that looks good for the size of room you have. The smaller the room, the further apart the stiles should be. Larger rooms can be spaced the same as studs: 16"" center-to-center.

, Add construction adhesive to the backs of the panels and place them on the wall, staring at the corner and covering the longest wall first. Line the top of the panel up with your level line and secure the panels into the studs with a pneumatic nail gun and 1.5"" finish nails (should be placed at the top and bottom, so that they will be hidden by the rail and baseboard). Go around the room until all of the panels are placed.


You will need to cut a hole for an outlet when you see that a panel will cover one. Cover the outlet in brightly colored chalk, line up the panel, press the panel into the chalk to get your outline, and then cut out the shape with a jigsaw.

, Line up the 1x2 rails so that they are flush with the top of the panels and then nail them into place with 2.5"" finish nails. These should also be nailed into studs whenever possible.

, Next, glue and nail the stiles in place exactly how you attached the top rail. Start with two stiles at the corner of the room, and then use the spacer at the top and then again at the bottom as you nail the two ends into place. Use a carefully cut piece of scrap wood as a spacer and a laser or normal level to make sure the stiles are nailed in as straight as possible.

, Next attach the baseboard the same way you attach the the stiles and top rail. Don't worry about any gaps left at the bottom by uneven floors: that will be covered up by shoe molding which goes up last.


You can also add molding at the top to cover uneven rails and paneling or just use a flat piece if you want a usable ledge.

, Sand the completed wood surface, cover any nails with a nail crayon, and then paint or stain the wood as desired. Enjoy your new wainscoting!

Use fabric softener.,
Use turpentine.,
Use Epsom salts.,
Use borax.,
Use salt.,
Finished.

",How to Soften Stiff New Sheets2," In addition to a cup of baking soda, you can add the recommended amount of your favorite fabric softener to the machine when you wash your new sheets. This provides extremely soft sheets. Alternatively, you can just use the softener on its own., Add half a cup of turpentine to the washing water with the sheets and wash on a regular cycle using warm water.


Rinse thoroughly to remove most of the turpentine. Hang the sheets outside or on a clothes horse to dry.
It is very important that you do not put the sheets in the dryer after washing with turpentine as turpentine is combustible and could cause a fire.

, Fill a laundry tub with cold water and add 50g of Epsom salts. Stir the sheets around in the tub for two minutes (use a wooden spoon if you don't want your hands to get cold!)


Leave the sheets to soak overnight in the Epsom salts mixture. The following morning, rinse the sheets out thoroughly, then hang them outside to dry., Fill a laundry tub with cold water and add 6 tablespoons of borax to the tub.


Add the sheets to the water, stir them around and leave them to soak overnight.
Rinse thoroughly the next morning and hang outside to dry.

, Fill a laundry tub with cold water and throw in 2 handfuls of salt. Add the sheets and leave them to soak overnight. Wash, rinse, and dry as usual.

Decide on a level of firmness.,
Measure the space you plan to put the bed.,
Find a store(s) to shop at.",How to Buy a Mattress1," If you haven’t purchased a mattress in a while, it’s good to see what options are available before going to a store.


Check prices online to see what you feel is reasonable based on what is being offered.
Mattress brands are often coming out with new styles of mattresses including ones that offer adjustable firmness levels and temperatures. Decide how high-tech you want your mattress to be, as some of these may only be available at specialty stores or online.
Look up what special features may be offered by each mattress brand including a trial period or money-back guarantee. If desired, you can print this information to bring to the store with you.;
, Although this is difficult to determine without first testing mattresses, a few physical factors can help direct your decision.


If you have back problems, consider a medium-firm to firm mattress choice. These are best for supporting your lower back and reducing back pain.
Pillow-top mattresses are best for people who aren’t too light, as they won’t have enough weight to suppress the top and the springs to a point that it makes a difference in comfort. Larger people typically find pillow-top mattresses more comfortable for this reason.
Ignore the spring count that is given as proof for a mattress’ supposed quality and firmness or softness. Studies have shown that the number of springs doesn’t actually affect how comfortable the mattress is., Nothing is worse than finding and purchasing your perfect mattress, just to realize you can’t fit it in your house. Check your space availability in your bedroom, and then decide on a size of mattress to fit.


Twin mattresses are the smallest size, and measure on average 39”/75”.
The next largest size after a twin mattress is a full or double mattress, which measures at 54”/75”.
The queen sized mattress is the most commonly purchased by couples for its size and relative price. It measures at 60”/80”.
King size bed is the largest standard sized mattress available. It is 76”/80”.
Some mattress brands and stores offer an extra large bed called the California king, which measures at 72”/84”.Be sure the mattress size you intend to purchase not only fits inside your bedroom, but also through all doors used to enter the room.

, Typically, specialty mattress stores will have more informed salespeople and information on mattresses than a generic furniture store. Be sure that where you choose to buy has a good reputation and helpful employees.

Avoid letting price be the biggest factor when choosing a pad.,
Look for layers.,
Search the Internet for sales or bargains on the mattress pad you select.",How to Buy a Waterproof Mattress Pad," Not only will you need to know the bed size (twin, full, queen or king), but you will need to know the actual height, length, and width dimensions as many mattress pads only come in small, medium, or large. You'll need to know your actual sizing to purchase the one that's appropriate, otherwise the pad might not fit your bed or the extra bulk from your sheets may not fit correctly once the pad is installed.;
, There are benefits and limitations to each option, and you'll need to know which one will suit your lifestyle the best before purchasing.


There are disposable pads, which get thrown away after being soiled.
Reusable cloth mattress pads can be washed in your laundry machine and used over and over again.
Vinyl mattress pads covers encase the entire mattress in a zippered pouch. The vinyl option usually makes a bit more noise but provides easy cleaning. All you need to do is wipe it down rather than washing it.

, If you have an adult bed wetter, he or she may produce more urine than a toddler, so consider investing in a thicker pad to help guarantee protection. Generally the thicker the pad, the more expensive the product. If price is a concern, buy the product that most closely matches your actual need rather than the thickest and most expensive.

, While more expensive, high density foam is the best choice in the long run because it lasts much longer than other materials, but if durability isn't a concern you might be able to get by with a lesser product.

, In most cases, mattress pads that are significantly less than other options are made of cheap materials. This results in having to replace the pads frequently due to tears or damage. In a short time, you may end up paying twice as much as you would have if you'd chosen a better quality item.

, The best waterproof mattress pads will have 3 layers, including a bottom layer designed for absorbency, a middle waterproof layer, and a top layer that is usually made out of soft cloth and provides cushioning. Top-end varieties have even more layering for superior comfort, but as long as your choice contains the basic 3, you can be assured of a good product.

, Many online retailers offer discounts you can't get in a store, and you might be able to save a significant amount of money. Research your top options as well, in case the stores have better deals on those options. Don't forget to calculate in shipping charges before purchasing to make sure you're still getting a better deal than purchasing through a local store.

File the receipt, warranty, and trial paperwork.",How to Buy a Memory Foam Mattress," Each memory foam mattress lists its density in the product information. High-density foam is defined as above 5 (2.27 kg) and especially 6 lbs. (2.72 kg). This mattress will feel quite firm at first, but it will adapt to your body to relieve pain and pressure points. Lasting about 8-10 years, it’s the best choice for those looking for durability, although it will cost more., Mid-grade foam is defined as 4 to 5 lbs (1.81-2.27 kg). This option should also provide you with a durability of about 8-10 years, and it may be more comfortable and less costly than high-density foam., Low-density foam, normally 2 to 3 lb. (0.91-1.36 kg), will likely feel more comfortable when you lie down, as you’ll sink into the layer. While this foam is less expensive than higher density options, it’s also less durable. You may have to replace it within 4-6 years., The ILD is another important indicator of firmness. Low ILDs will give you a soft and comfortable surface, while highers ILDs create resistance and support for your back. You generally want lower ILDs (10-11) for the top layers and at least one layer with a higher ILD (20-40) to prevent low-back pain., Memory foam is a temperature-sensitive material that softens as it comes in contact with your body heat. This is what gives it the ability to contour to your body, but the foam can also get overly hot at night. Many memory foam mattresses now offer top layers made with different materials to increase ventilation and keep you cool., Gel memory foam increases the air circulation in memory foam, providing a cooler surface. This option also offers increased and more balanced support for your back. This may help relieve chronic back pain.Be aware that the gel memory foam will be cool at first, but it will heat up to match your body temperature over the course of the night. Gel layers may only help you fall asleep.

, Natural latex foam maintains the same general softness and support as memory foam, but does not have its temperature sensitivity. This will likely prevent you from experiencing the cloud-like feeling that comes from memory foam. However, natural latex will not cause you to “sleep hot,” and it won’t give off any chemical odors., CertiPUR-US is an American-based non-for-profit program that prevents foam from including harmful metals, chemicals, ozone depleters, or dangerous gas emissions. Most mattress companies will advertise that their products have received this certification.While companies from all over the world can be CertiPUR-US-certified, the certification adheres to American standards. These standards are comparable with the European-based Eco-label., The density of latex and memory foam mattresses already inhibits the spread of allergy-causing dust mites. The bamboo cover will supplement this resistance, as bamboo is naturally dust and mildew resistant., Before you decide on a product, check out previous buyers’ experiences to avoid falling into a consumer trap. Reviews will provide you with information about the relationship between the cost and the overall comfort and quality of the mattress.

, Even if you plan to make your final purchase online, it’s extremely important that you lie down at least once on the mattress you intend to buy. Mattress stores will allow you to test their beds by hopping on and getting comfortable, so take advantage., Give yourself ample time to fully experience the mattress. Try moving around and lying in various positions. Many memory foam mattresses are made specifically to suit back, side, or stomach sleepers, and it’s important that you test these labels. Some beds will also inhibit your movement, and you’ll want to know this before you buy., Learn exactly what will be required of you when you have a warranty issue. What counts as an issue covered by the warranty? Will you be responsible for packaging and shipping the mattress? Most importantly, how long has the manufacturer been in business? A lifetime warranty from a company that's only been in business for a short while is probably worthless.


Most warranties will cover problems with the mattress that appear to be manufacturer related. Warranties will rarely cover damage caused by you or by normal wear and tear., You should be able to test out your memory foam mattress to see if you have any issues or don’t like the feel of the material. These trials generally last between two weeks and a month. Be sure you understand the return policy in case you end up not liking the mattress.The company will likely require the mattress to be in as-new condition at the end of the trial period if you choose to return the product. Any damage to the mattress will almost certainly prevent you from making a return.

, If you’re in a local store, you may be facing overpriced products. Talk to your salesperson to negotiate these prices down to match the minimum prices you can find for the product online. Larger chains should already match these minimum prices.If you face resistance in this conversation, try telling your salesperson that you’ve found the same product for a better price elsewhere. While they may tell you that you’re welcome to make your purchase where you’d like, they might also take the opportunity to prevent you from walking out the door.

, Both stores and online vendors should have coupon options available. Search online for printable coupons to take in the store with you, or apply promotional codes at the end of your online purchase. You can also search your town’s weekly advertising circular for local couponing options.

There are a variety of online options for finding coupons. Honey is an internet add-on that will automatically search for and apply coupons to your online purchases, or you can use RetailMeNot.com to look up specific stores., Buying your mattress in a store means that you have a physical location and specific person to visit if you have problems with your product.When you buy in a store, you’re usually guaranteed assistance in moving and setting up the mattress.

, Online purchasing will allow you to avoid haggling with a salesperson over prices. However, be aware that your purchase may not meet your expectations, especially if you didn’t visit a store to test it out. It may also be more difficult for you to return a mattress purchased online.

Note that online vendors may only ship “compressed,” or rolled-up, memory foam mattresses that need about a day to fully decompress before you can sleep on them.

, Whether you make your purchase online or in the store, set aside a specific place on your computer or in your house for your purchasing records. You should be sure that the receipt, warranty paperwork, and any trial period agreements are somewhere that you can easily access and won’t forget about."

Test out mattresses.,
Ask about a comfort guarantee.,
Take it for a trial run.,
Check the warranty.,
Purchase the necessary mattress add-ons.,
Negotiate the price.",How to Buy a Mattress2," In order for you to know how well you like a mattress, you must test it out in the store. Search around looking for mattresses that meet your criteria, and then lay on each to see how you like them.


Lay on each mattress for at least 2-3 minutes, and up to 15. The floor models are out specifically for this reason, so don’t be hesitant to lay in the store for a bit.
Ignore descriptors on tags such as “ultra plush,” “super soft,” or “extra firm.” These aren’t regulated terms and are used freely within each mattress brand without consistency between them. Instead, just lay on the mattress to get a feel for how soft or firm it is.
Try a firm, a plush, and a pillow-top mattress to get a feel for which type you prefer. Compare these types all within the same mattress brand to get the most accurate idea of which you like best.
Ask to see a cutaway of the mattress if it’s available, so you can see exactly what it is you may be sleeping on.

, A comfort guarantee varies between brands, but is a certain period of time after you’ve purchased your mattress in which you can return or exchange it for free.


Always do this before you purchase and verify at purchase to make sure you are getting the correct information.
Find out how long the comfort guarantee lasts for, as this can be different depending on each brand.
Learn if you must pay for shipping to/from your home if the mattress doesn’t work out for you. This way you won’t be surprised by extra costs later.

, Many mattress brands and stores allow you to test the mattress in your home for up to thirty days. If you can, take this opportunity to verify that this mattress meets your sleep needs.

, Make sure that the mattress you are purchasing offers a minimum ten year, non-prorated warranty.

, Although buying just a mattress is all that seems necessary, you must also purchase a minimum of a box spring to support it as well.


Always buy a new box spring with your new mattress, as old box springs wear out over time and lose the desired support and firmness.
Purchase a waterproof mattress protector to cover your new mattress. This not only makes cleanup easier should something spill on it, but will keep the warranty intact. Many warranties void out if the mattress is stained or spilled on., The prices of mattresses can often be lowered with a little bartering done with a sales associate or store manager. Use the numbers you found online earlier to determine if you are getting a good deal.


Include the cost of old mattress pick-up and the delivery and setup of the new mattress in the total cost.
Ask for freebies; many stores will throw in free services if they are simply asked."

Be wary of U.S Department of Agriculture labels.,
Do not solely rely on a label.",How to Buy an Organic Mattress," Flame retardants are one of the biggest concerns people have when it comes to organic mattresses. The main concern is the retardant-polyurethane foam, which can releases chemicals into the air known as polybrominated-biphenyl-ethers (PBDEs). These chemicals can stay in the system for a long time, and you will breathe them in when you sleep on a mattress that contains polyurethane foam.Look for a mattress that does not use polyurethane foam as a flame retardant. Check the ingredients label and, if necessary, ask a worker at the store about any flame retardants the mattress includes.
While polyurethane foam is the main concern, other flame retardants can also be dangerous. Chlorinated tris is a chemical frequently used as a flame retardant that may be carcinogenic. Firemaster 550 is a cocktail that contains a variety of potentially harmful chemicals.;
, Synthetic latex may not be as dangerous as other non-organic materials. The way latex is produced often includes the use of potentially carcinogenic materials in order to get latex soft enough for comfort. While more research is needed, synthetic latex may not be the best material for an organic mattress.Remember, even natural latex is processed in a manner that uses potentially harmful chemicals. No latex is 100% organic, so you should consider other materials besides latex when settling on an organic mattress.

, Boric acid is used as a pesticide in many mattresses. It is frequently used in the lining of mattresses to ward off pests like roaches and bed bugs. When you sleep on a mattress that contains boric acid, you're being exposed to small levels of the chemical over time. This can cause health problems, such as blistering of the skin. Babies exposed to boric acid may experience convulsions.Boric acid can be particularly dangerous for infants and young children. If you're buying a mattress for a baby or child, you should be particularly vigilant about avoiding mattresses that use boric acid.

, Formaldehyde is a chemical often used in mattresses and other household products. When inhaled over a long period of time, this can cause health issues like burning in the eyes and nose, coughing, and skin irritation. When selecting a mattress, make sure the product does not contain any formaldehyde., Mattress stores are not required to tell you about the materials used in their products. Ingredients can only tell you so much. Even if a chemical is not listed on a mattress's ingredients, the mattress may still have been exposed to that chemical at some point. Always research a mattress on your own end before making a purchase.An internet search can tell you a lot about the mattress. You can google the brand or company for a more extensive list of chemicals used in a given mattress.

, As labels like organic and natural can be misleading, where you shop makes a big impact on the quality of your product. Look for a store in your area that matches your values. A store dedicated to selling organic bedding specifically is likely to provide greater variety of legitimately organic materials. Workers in stores that sell organic bedding will also be better equipped to answer your questions.If you can't find an organic mattress store in your area, look for a place online.

, You want to make sure you're getting your mattress from the right place. At a store truly committed to supplying organic materials, workers will not hesitate to answer any questions you have.You should ask for how much of a mattress's materials are organic. Some mattresses may be labeled organic, but only use around 10% organic material.
Ask about how a mattress was made. Even mattresses made with organic material may have been exposed to harmful chemicals in a factory.
At a legitimate business, workers should be able to tell you everything you need to know about where a mattress comes from and how it was made. You should also do some research on your end, however, just to confirm the claims.

, Organic wool is not produced with any harmful toxins or chemicals. It's generally the best material to go for when selecting an organic mattress. Wool is able to regulate body temperature well, reduces back pain, and absorbs sweat. A wool mattress will keep you comfortable at night without exposing you to anything harmful.Make sure the wool in your mattress is certified organic. This means the exposure to pesticides and other chemicals is greatly limited.
Wool also has natural fire retardant properties, allowing you purchase a fire safe mattress not treated with harmful chemicals., Organic mattresses can be very expensive. If a 100% organic mattress is not in your price range, go for an organic cover. A 100% organic wool cover can provide some protection from chemicals used in an non-organic mattress without costing a lot of money.You can also simply place a cotton sheets over your mattress. These tend to be largely organic and can provide some protection between your body and a mattress.
As with purchasing an organic mattress, make sure to do your own research on any cover you purchase. You want to make sure a mattress cover is genuinely organic.

, If you find the right organic mattress, you do not want to undo your efforts by using sheets made with harmful chemicals. In addition to purchasing an organic mattress, make sure to buy sheets made from organic materials.Wool is usually the highest quality, most organic material you can buy in terms of sheets. Go for 100% organic wool, if possible, when selecting sheets.
Organic cotton can be frustrating, as it wrinkles easier. However, materials used in wrinkle-resistant cotton can be toxic. You may also find organic cotton is slightly rougher, but it will soften over time.
If you go for bamboo bedding, make sure it's chemical free.

, Not all organic labels are equally trustworthy. Many labels come from third party certifiers, which may have lax standards. When it comes to organic labels, there are two labels you should look for to assure your product is truly organic: the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) and the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS).The GOTS assures that 95% of the materials used are certified organic. It also bans the use of certain chemicals, including polyurethane, even used in amounts as low as 5%.
The GOLS is what you should look for if you're going for a latex mattress. This assures organic latex is used in the mattress. A truly organic latex mattress will have both the GOLS label and the GOTS label.

, Some labels do not assure that a mattress is completely organic, and can be very misleading. If you see such labels, it does not necessarily mean the mattress is not organic. However, you should look for GOTS and GOLS labels in addition to these labels, as well as do some research on your end.The Organic Content Standard 100 does assure consumers that organic materials are used to make the mattress. However, it does not mean the mattress does not contain certain flame retardants or chemical-laden dyes.
The CertiPUR-US only assures the foam used in a mattress is organic. Other components of the mattress may contain harmful chemicals.

, While this label may seem legitimate, USDA requirements for certifying something organic are somewhat lax. A USDA label only assures a small portion of a mattress's components are certified organic. The mattress may very well contain a variety of harmful materials., Even the best labels do not provide 100% assurance that a mattress is organic. Even mattresses made from over 90% organic materials may be exposed to chemicals at a factory. Before using a mattress, air it out for 48 hours. This will help get rid of any chemicals the mattress was exposed to in a factory or mattress store."

Consider buying an air mattress.,
Purchase a sleeping pad.,
Consider purchasing a sleeping bag.,
Evaluate whether a folding cot would be a good solution.,
Choose a sofa or ottoman with a sleeper function.",How to Buy a Temporary Bed," The air mattress (or ""air bed"") is one of the most popular temporary bed solutions for all manner of applications, including camping, moving, and accommodating overnight guests. Benefits of air mattresses include their ability to be stowed away in a small space when not needed and their high level of insulation from cold ground temperatures.


Air mattresses must be inflated using a pump. Using a hand pump can be time consuming and tiring, while using an electric pump requires access to an electrical outlet. An electric pump also makes it more difficult to achieve the precise level of air pressure that you want, so consider buying a hand pump for minute adjustments even if you primarily use an electric pump.
Air mattresses can be difficult to keep inflated if they are punctured or torn. For this reason, they should be protected from any pets in your home that might tear the mattress with their claws or teeth.;
, An alternative to an air mattress is a sleeping pad. These pads have a similar plastic exterior to air mattresses, but they contain a pad of open-cell foam inside. This foam tends to be more supportive than an air mattress, but makes sleeping pads bulkier when stored. Sleeping pads often come in ""self-inflating"" models, which means the foam draws air in through a valve when in use and is compressed back down for storage.

, Sleeping bags provide one of the simplest and most versatile temporary bed solutions. They are compact and can be placed nearly anywhere, and unlike the options above, they do not require additional bedding for comfortable use. However, sleeping bags do not provide much support, and so may not be an ideal choice for accommodating overnight guests.

, Folding cots are compact and inexpensive, and do not require any additional equipment such as air pumps. Unlike sleeping bags, they lift the sleeper off of the ground, providing insulation from cold floors, airflow for ventilation in warm temperatures, and separation from uneven terrain when camping. Because of its design, a cot tends to be one of the narrowest options for a temporary bed, so it may not be ideal for a person with a large frame.

, If accommodating overnight guests is your goal, consider working the temporary bed into your furniture setup. There are many options available for sofas and ottomans that fold out into twin or double-sized beds. In addition, a daybed could be used as seating during the day and could accommodate guests at night.

Gather your supplies.,
Find a small, squat glass jar with a two part lid.,
Use the metal disk part to trace a circle onto a sheet of scrapbook paper.,
Cut the circle out using scissors and set it aside.,
Fill the jar half way full with baking soda.,
Add 10 to 20 drops of essential oil.,
Close the jar.,
Shake the jar to mix everything up.,
Use a needle to poke holes into the paper.,
Use your air freshener.",How to Make Your Own Air Freshener1," This air-freshener uses baking soda, which helps absorb odors. It also uses essentials oils, which give off a fragrant scent. Here's what you'll need to make this simple air freshener:Small jar
Scrapbook paper
Baking Soda
10 to 20 drops essential oil
Scissors
Pen or pencil
Needle;
, The lid needs to have a metal ring part and a flat disk part. You will need the ring part to hold the scrapbook paper to the jar and the disk part to trace a circle. You can use any size jar you want, but a small, squat jar would be ideal. This way, you won't need to use as much baking soda; you only need a little bit of baking soda to get the full effect.


You can spray paint the metal ring part to make it match your paper and room decor.You can find scrapbook paper at an arts and crafts store. If you cannot find any scrapbook paper, try using some leftover gift wrap. You can also take a sheet of printer paper, and draw pretty designs on it with markers.

, Take the lid apart and set aside the metal ring; you will be using it later. Place the metal disk onto the back/blank side of the scrapbook paper. Use a pen or pencil to trace around the metal disk. Once you are done tracing, you can discard or recycle the metal disk. You will not need it anymore after this.


You can choose any color or pattern you want for the paper, but consider choosing something that matches the decor of your room or the season.
If you cannot find a jar with a two part lid, then draw a circle onto a piece of loosely woven fabric (such as burlap) and cut it out. The circle needs to be a few inches wider than the moth of the jar., You will be using it in a moment. Discard or recycle the rest of the paper.

, How much baking soda you need will depend on the size of your jar., The more oil you add, the more fragrant your air freshener will be.You can use all one scent, or you can play around with mixing different scents such as lavender and vanilla, or mint and eucalyptus.


Lavender is great for bedrooms, because it is relaxing.
Citrus is great for family rooms and kitchens because it's refreshing and energizing.
Eucalyptus and mint are great for bathrooms because of how fresh they smell.

, Place the paper disk you just cut out on top of the jar. Make sure that the disk is centered and that the design is facing you. Place the metal ring on top of the paper. Twist the metal ring close. The paper disk will have replaced metal disk part. You are using a paper disk instead of a metal one for this air freshener because you will need to poke holes into it. It is easier to poke holes into paper than into metal.


If you are using fabric, place the fabric on top of the jar. Make sure that it is centered. Secure it to the neck of the jar with a piece of ribbon or a rubber band. Do not put the lid on it or you will trap the fragrance inside the jar.

, You may notice small clumps forming from the essential oil. Keep shaking the jar until those clumps disappear. If the clumps don't disappear, then take the lid off and crumble them up with a fork. Be sure to replace the lid when you are done.

, You can poke the holes randomly, or you can make a design, such as a heart, star, or spiral. The more holes you poke, the better the scent will be able to waft through.

, You can place it in any room you want. You will need to shake the jar every few days. Over time, the essential oil will get weaker, so you will need to add a few more drops when that happens.At some point, the baking soda will stop being effective because it will have absorbed all of the bad odors in the room. Plan on replacing it every one to three months.

Make the bed.",How to Remove Blood Stains from a Mattress," To remove any stain from the mattress, you'll have to be able to access the mattress directly. Remove pillows, comforters, duvets, sheets, and anything else from the bed that’s covering the mattress.Set pillows and decorative items aside so you don’t trip on them while you're working.


Pre-treat sheets, pillow cases, comforters, and other washable bedding with an enzyme cleaner or stain remover if there's blood on them. Let the cleaner soak for about 15 minutes, and then wash the items in the washing machine.;
, Soak a clean cloth in cold water. Wring out as much excess water as possible so the cloth is cold and damp. Press the cold cloth into the blood stain and blot the area to saturate the stain. Do not rub, as this can rub the stain deeper into the mattress fibers.Use cold water only, as hot water can set the stain and make it even harder to remove.

, When you’ve saturated the stain with water, use a clean dry towel and blot the area to soak up excess blood. Continue blotting until the area is dry and no more blood is coming off on the dry towel.Do not rub with the towel to avoid pushing the stain deeper in.

, Rinse your damp cloth with cold water. Wring out the cloth to remove excess water. Blot the stain again to saturate it. Then, switch to a fresh dry cloth and blot up as much water and blood as you can until the area is dry.


Keep alternating between soaking and blotting until the dry cloth comes away clean., There are a number of cleaning solutions you can try to clean blood stains from a mattress. Oxygenated bleach or a commercial enzyme cleaner is your best bet, because these cleaners are specifically designed to break down proteins in organic matter like blood.Other cleaning solutions you can try include:


½ cup (118 ml) of liquid detergent mixed with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of water, and whisked until frothy and foamy.One part baking soda mixed with two parts cold water.½ cup (55 g) cornstarch mixed into a paste with 1 tablespoon (19 g) of salt and ¼ cup (59 ml) of hydrogen peroxide.
1 tablespoon (15 ml) of ammonia mixed with 1 cup (235 ml) of cold water.
1 tablespoon (13 g) of meat tenderizer mixed into a paste with 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of cold water.

, For liquid cleaners, dip a clean cloth into your cleaner and wring out the excess. Blot the stain with the cleaner until it’s saturated. For pastes, use a knife or your finger to apply enough cleaning paste to the stain to cover it completely.Memory foam mattresses especially shouldn’t get wet at all, so only apply as much cleaner as necessary to saturate the stain.Don’t spray liquids directly onto a mattress. Mattresses are very absorbent, and if liquid doesn’t dry properly, it can break down the mattress fibers or cause mold problems.

, This will give the cleaner time to penetrate the stain and break down the proteins, making the blood easier to clean up., After 30 minutes, use a clean toothbrush to scrub the stain and work in the cleaner. You can also use a clean cloth to blot the area again. As you scrub or blot, the stain should start to break up and disappear., Soak a fresh cloth with cold water. Wring out the excess. Dab the area that you just cleaned with the cloth to remove any excess cleaner and leftover blood that may still be in the mattress.


Continue blotting until all traces of the paste, cleaner, and blood are gone., With a fresh, dry towel, blot the area one last time to remove as much excess moisture from the mattress as possible. Lay the towel over the area you cleaned, and press down with both hands to apply pressure to the area and absorb the moisture.

, Once the stain is gone, leave the air mattress bare so it can air dry for several hours, or ideally overnight. This will ensure there's no moisture trapped in the mattress, and protect the mattress from mold. To speed up the drying time, you can:


Aim a standing fan at the mattress and turn it on high.Open curtains to let sunlight dry the mattress.
Open a window to increase the fresh air in the room.
Take the mattress outside to dry in the sun and fresh air for a few hours.
Use a wet/dry vacuum to suck up water., When the mattress is completely dry, vacuum the entire surface to remove excess dirt and other particles. Regular cleaning will help keep your mattress like new for longer. Use the upholstery attachment, and vacuum the top, bottom, sides, and seams of the mattress.

, Mattress covers are waterproof covers that protect the mattress from spills, stains, and other accidents. When you spill something on the mattress, for instance, the cover wicks away the moisture and prevents the mattress from getting wet.Mattress pads are easy to clean. If you spill or have an accident, clean the cover according to the care instructions. Some pads will be machine washable, and others can be cleaned with a damp cloth.

, When the mattress is dry, clean, and outfitted with a protector, put on the fitted sheet that you washed, followed by any other sheets, covers, and pillows that you normally use on the bed. The sheets will also help to protect the mattress from sweat, dirt, and other debris as you sleep.

Never leave your air freshener unattended.,
Use the air freshener within two to three days.",How to Make Your Own Air Freshener4," The best things to use for this sort of air freshener are expired spices, fragrant herbs fresh from the garden, and left-over citrus from your last cooking or baking project. Listed below are some combination ideas to get you started. It is enough to fill one pot or a 2 pint (0.95 liter) mason jar. If you are using a small container, use less of the items listed. Here are some combinations to give you some ideas:To create a scent perfect for winter or fall, combine 1 sliced orange, 1 to 2 cinnamon sticks, ½ tablespoon of whole cloves, ½ tablespoon of whole allspice. For a final touch, consider adding 1 anise star.
If you like something that is fresh and sweet at the same time, try 2 sliced lemons, 3 sprigs of rosemary, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
Another fresh and sweet combination is three to four sprigs of thyme, ½ teaspoon of mint extract, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 3 sliced limes.
To create a forest-y, winter-y scent, combine a handful of pine needles, 4 bay leaves, and 1 whole nutmeg. Be sure to grate the outer layer of the nutmeg; this will help it release its scent.

, You don't want to fill the pot with water. The water level should not come past the top of your ingredients.

, This will heat up the ingredients, and give off a pleasant scent. You can continue simmering the ingredients in your pot, or you can transfer the ingredients to another heat source. Here are some ideas to get you started:Transfer the ingredients into a crock pot. Turn the crock pot on, and leave it uncovered so that the ingredients can release their pleasant scent. This will be a little more subtle than simmering on the stove.
Transfer the ingredients into a fondue pot. Keep in mind that if your fondue pot uses candles, you will need to keep an eye on the candles. The candles will usually burn for 3 ½ to 4 hours.
You can also transfer the ingredients into a jar, mug, or small bowl, and place it on top of a mug warmer, a candle warmer, or a tea pot warmer.

, As the water continues to heat, the ingredients you used will give off a pleasant smell. If the smell it strong enough, it may even go into other rooms as well. Do not leave your air freshener unattended however!

, As the water continues to heat, it will evaporate, and the water level will drop. If it drops too low, your ingredients will scorch. You also want to use hot water when you refill so that you don't lower the temperature.

, If you need to leave the house, turn your stove, crock pot, or warmers off, and extinguish any candles that you are using. Transfer the ingredients into a jar, and place the jar into the refrigerator.

, Keep it in a jar in the fridge whenever you are not using it. If the water starts to get murky, consider adding a few slices of citrus or a sprig of whatever herb you were using."

Twist the lid well to ensure that the covering is securely in place.It’s important to use a jar covering made of paper or cloth, such as cheesecloth, cotton, or linen. These materials will keep the baking soda from spilling out but still allow the scent out of the jar. Don’t use a metal or plastic covering that will block the baking soda from absorbing odors and the essential oils from giving off their scent.

, When the lid and covering are secure on the jar, the air freshener is ready to go. Set it out on a table or countertop wherever you want to freshen the air. The kitchen and bathroom are ideal locations, but you also can place it in your bedroom, living room, or family room.If the air freshener seems to have lost its scent, shake the jar. That will redistribute and freshen the scent.

Sprinkle the freshener over your carpet and let it sit.,
Vacuum the freshener up.",How to Make a Baking Soda Air Freshener3," While the essential oils in the air freshener will help give your carpet a pleasant scent, adding herbs that complement the oils can intensify the effect. Start by grinding 2 to 3 sprigs of the dried herbs in a coffee grinder or blender so they’re fine enough to mix with the baking soda.You can use whatever herbs you like, but it helps to choose those that correspond with the essential oil. For example, if you’re using lavender essential oil, use dried lavender for the most intense lavender scent. You can also pair dried rosemary with rosemary essential oil or dried mint with peppermint essential oil.
If you prefer, you can be creative with your essential oil and herb combinations. For example, try pairing lavender essential oil with dried rosemary for a unique scent. Dried sage also pairs well with lemon essential oil, while dried mint and wild orange essential oil are a good combination.

, After you’ve ground the herbs, add them along 1 cup (180 g) of baking soda, and 30 to 40 drops of an essential oil of your choice to a glass jar that has a lid. Place the lid on the jar, and shake well to thoroughly mix the ingredients.You can use any essential oils that you like, but you should avoid tea tree oil if you have pets. It can be toxic to animals.
Citrus essentials oils lose their scents quickly, so you should avoid them if you want a long lasting scent for your carpet.
You may want to use an antimicrobial or antibacterial essential oil in your carpet freshener. Oregano oil, cinnamon oil, and thyme oil are good options.

, Even when the air freshener ingredients are mixed, it’s best not to use it right away. Let the mixture sit in the jar overnight to ensure that baking soda fully absorbs the scent of the essential oils., After you’ve allowed the mixture to sit overnight, you can use the carpet freshener. Sprinkle it lightly over the carpet that you want to freshen, and allow it to sit for approximately 15 minutes.You can use a spoon to spread the air freshener, or place a shaker lid on the jar so you can sprinkle directly from the container.

, Once the carpet freshener has sat on the carpet for several minutes, vacuum the carpet as you normally would. Make sure to vacuum up all of the baking soda mixture to truly freshen the carpet.Before using the carpet freshener, check your vacuum cleaner’s instruction manual to ensure that the baking soda won’t damage the appliance or clog the filters.

Use a plastic bottle if you can. Essential oils may degrade certain types of plastic.

, You can use equal parts of both vanilla and cinnamon essential oil, or you can use a little bit more/less of one of them. For example, if you really like the scent of vanilla, you could do 7 drops of vanilla essential oil and 5 drops of cinnamon essential oil. You will need 12 drops of oil total., This will help distribute the essential oils throughout the baking soda. Keep shaking until you don't see any clumps in the baking soda.

If you need to, use a funnel to help guide the water into the bottle.


If you can't fin a diffuser bottle, any small bottle with a short, narrow neck (such as a perfume bottle) will do. Make sure that the bottle is glass, as essential oils tend to degrade certain types of plastic.

, If you can't find any vodka, you can also try witch hazel or rubbing alcohol instead.

, You can use equal parts vanilla and cinnamon essential oil, or you can play around with different proportions. For example, you could do 7 drops of cinnamon essential oil and 5 drops of vanilla essential oil. You need 12 drops of oil total.

, Plug the bottle up with a cork or your finger. If the bottle came with a screw-on cap, use that instead. Shake it briskly to combine the ingredients, then open it back up again.

, You may not notice any fragrance right away. There is still one more step you have to do. Right now, you are just soaking the reeds.

, Take the reeds out of the bottle, and turn them around. Stick the dry ends back into the bottle, and place the bottle down on a table. Your room will eventually get a soft, vanilla-cinnamon fragrance.

If you don't have the time to bake your own, buy some from the bakers. That way, you get a lovely smelling kitchen AND yummy food!;
, Flowers can make a whole room smell lovely-why not try growing them in your garden or even in a window-box? Then when spring/summer comes around, your house will smell gorgeously like flowers and the outdoors

, Houses will smell stuffy if there is no air. If it's a nice day, let the air in. Even have your door open if it's safe to do so. That way, you'll seem friendly and when you have guests in they will compliment you on your great smelling home

, The bathroom is a difficult one to get smelling good naturally. Try the previous step-opening a window to let the fresh air in, or try using bicarbonate of soda/vinegar to dispel any bad odours. If you have a bathroom extractor fan, obviously run that when someone is in the toilet

, Choose nice, natural good smelling products that complement each other For example, switch to beeswax polish which smells absolutely gorgeous-just rub it on in small,circular motions to release the smell and also to leave your unpolished wooden surfaces shining and healthy. Pair this with a natural lavender cleaning spray to evoke the smells of summer and a garden buzzing with busy bees

Use a mattress pad.",How to Make Your Bed," Whether you're making your bed after getting up in the morning or after washing your sheets, the first thing to do is to clear the bed. Be sure to take off pillows, stuffed animals, comforter, e.t.c.









Take the duvet/blanket off, the top sheet and any pillows and set them aside (preferably not on the floor).
You can leave the fitted sheet (the one with the elasticated corners) on the bed.;
, If the fitted sheet is not already on the bed, you will need to put it on. Do this by tucking the elasticated ends of the sheet around the corners of the mattress.









Make sure the sheet is tucked tightly around the corners of the mattress - you may need to lift the mattress slightly to achieve this.
Make sure the fitted sheet sits smoothly on top of the mattress, without any creases or wrinkles.

, Next, take the top sheet and spread it over the bottom sheet. Remember that the side with the large hem should go at the top of the bed and the hem should be aligned with the head of the mattress.









If your sheets are patterned, the patterned side should face down (so you can see the pattern when the top of the sheet is folded back).
Make sure the top sheet is spread evenly over the mattress, with the same length of sheet hanging over both sides of the bed.

, The term ""hospital corner"" refers to a specific method of folding the end of the top sheet tightly under the mattress. It is the trickiest step in making a bed, but is also the part which will make your bed look neatest.









To make a hospital corner, tuck the end of the top sheet between the mattress and box springs at the foot of the bed. Don't just stuff it in though, make sure it is smooth and wrinkle free.
On one side, grab a piece of the top sheet approximately 16 inches (40.6 cm) away from the foot of the bed. Lift it up and fold this section of sheet over the top of the mattress, so it forms a 45 degree angle from the corner of the mattress.
Holding the folded piece of sheet in place on top of the mattress, tuck in any sheet hanging below the mattress on that side of the bed. Do this as neatly as possible for best results.
Now, let the folded piece of sheet on top of the mattress drop down. If you prefer looser sheets, you can stop here. But if you prefer to tuck your sheets tightly, you can tuck the hanging edge of sheet smoothly between mattress and box springs, all the way along the side of the bed.Repeat on the opposite side of the bed. For more detailed step-by-step instructions and pictures on how to make hospital corners, see this article.

, Once the top sheets is tucked in place, you can lay your blankets, duvet or comforter on top.









Make sure the duvet is spread evenly over the bed, with the same amount of overhang on each side of the bed.
The top edge of the duvet/comforter/blanket should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the edge of the top sheet at the head of the bed.

, Take the edge of the top sheet at the head of the bed and neatly fold it back over the top edge of the duvet, blanket or comforter. Notice how you can see the pattern on the inside of the sheet now?









If you're using a blanket or thin comforter, you can fold the blanket and sheet back together, so the hem of the sheet is no longer visible. Duvets are usually a little too thick to fold.
If you like, you can tuck the edges of the folded blanket and sheet underneath the mattress for a very neat and tightly-made bed. This is how they do it in the military!, Grab your pillows and give them a good fluffing before you place them of the bed. To fluff a pillow, grab it on either side and squeeze the sides together before releasing - kind of like playing an accordion!









Smooth out the pillow cases then lay each pillow flat at the head of the bed, to fill the space between the folded over duvet and the headboard.
If you have more than two pillows (on a queen bed) stack the extra two pillows directly on top of the bottom ones.

, Now your bed is almost complete!









To finish it off, take any decorative cushions or pillows you might have and place them in an upright position at the head of the bed, leaning against the sleeping pillows for support.
If you have an additional blanket, quilt or throw blanket that you like to keep on your bed for aesthetic purposes (or in case it gets cold!), fold it neatly in half and lay it evenly over the bottom half of the bed.

, Making your bed every morning is a simple but beneficial habit.









Just by taking two minutes to make your bed every morning, your bedroom will look neater and feel more peaceful. And just imagine how good it will feel to slip between the crisp sheets of a well-made bed each night!
It may be hard to believe, but making your bed everyday will actually boost your happiness levels!, People are often unsure about how frequently they should wash their sheets. The answer? Once every 1 to 2 weeks.









Although every 1 to 2 weeks is preferable, you could probably leave up to a month between washes, at a stretch. But if you notice an unpleasant odor hanging around your bedroom, you'll know why.
Duvets, comforters, blankets, or anything that doesn't come in direct contact with your body can be washed approximately every three months., Anyone who uses a duvet knows that duvet covers can be a nightmare to put on. However, there is one trick you can use to simplify the process:









Turn your duvet cover inside out, then reach your arms inside to grab one of the corners in each hand (like a sock puppet). Now, through the duvet cover, grab the top corners of the duvet firmly - one corner in each hand.
Holding tightly to the corners, shake the duvet until the duvet cover turns itself right-side out. Then just tuck the bottom corners of the duvet inside and snap or button the cover shut.
Other than that, the best advice is just to be patient and to enlist the help of a family member or friend!

, If you don't have one already, it's a good idea to purchase a mattress pad. Just make sure it's the appropriate size for your bed.









The mattress pad goes on over the mattress, but under the fitted sheet. It protects the mattress from becoming dirty, while also adding an extra layer of comfort to the bed.

Find an oven-safe pan or dish.,
Re-arrange the oven racks so that you can place the pan or cup of vanilla on the middle rack.,
Pour two capfuls or two tablespoons of vanilla into the pan or cup.,
Bake the vanilla in the oven for up to 20 minutes or until the odor has left the building.,
Consider reinforcing the vanilla smell if your home smells particularly funky.",How to Get Rid of Home Odors Using Vanilla Extract," Alternatively, use an oven-safe coffee mug or similar heatproof container. Turn your oven to 300ºF/150ºC.


You don’t want to actually cook the vanilla, just warm it, so if your oven runs hot, decrease the temperature to 275ºF/140ºC.






Do not use a non-stick pan as the odors might be compromised by the chemical make-up of the non-stick surface and you may not get the true essence of the vanilla. You want the aroma of the vanilla to permeate the cooking device, which will translate over to your home. Prefer ceramic, terracotta, glass, etc. style containers.;
, This way the extract won’t burn or scorch.

, Using good quality vanilla extract will help bring out more aroma.


Lace the vanilla extract with a few vanilla bean pods to enhance the scent. The beans will support the extract and give the vanilla a more sugary aroma.







,


If the vanilla smell seems a bit on the strong side, open a few windows and allow the breeze to diffuse the fragrance.






Set the kitchen timer so you don’t forget the vanilla is in the oven. Twenty minutes is usually adequate to refresh the home. Setting the timer will remind you to turn off the heat and remove the pan from the oven or stovetop.







, Pour two tablespoons of vanilla into a pan and cook the vanilla at low heat on your stovetop. As with the oven method, only cook for about 20 minutes and set the timer to remind you to remove it.

Put on the mattress pad (optional).",How to Make up a Bed Neatly1," A bed ruffle, also called a valance, will help to keep dust from collecting under the bed while providing a decorative accent. The bed ruffle goes on top of the box spring, covering the box spring and bed frame. It does not require washing as often as sheets, but it should be washed from time to time.


Not all beds have or need this. If yours has an external frame that serves this purpose, or if it is a captain's bed or waterbed, skip this step.;
, Your mattress pad is a protective covering that goes on top of your mattress. It also adds a slight cushion to the bed. The mattress pad should be fitted for the size of your mattress. Tuck in the top two corners of the mattress pad, and then the bottom two corners.

Make sure that the sheet matches the size of the mattress, whether it's a full, twin, queen, or king-sized mattress, so that it will fit snugly in place. Here's how to put on the fitted sheet:


First, pull the sheet over the top two corners of the bed.
Next, pull and smooth down the other two corners, pulling the sheet over one bottom corner, and then the other.
Continue to smooth down the sheet, and tuck it into the bottom of the mattress, just above the box spring. It should fit neatly if it's the right size.
Sometimes, it can be tricky to put on a fitted sheet alone. Get the help of a friend or family member so each of you can tackle two corners at the same time.

, The top sheet is not fitted but should ideally match the color of the fitted sheet. Spread the sheet evenly across the bed, with the finished side facing down. Let the extra length of the sheet fall evenly over the sides of the bed.


The top edge should hit the top of the mattress, and the bottom edge should hang over the end of the bed.

, Tuck the bottom of the top sheet into the mattress until it fits snugly between the mattress and the box spring.

, Pick up the bottom edge at one bottom corner and hold it out. Tuck in what is left hanging down at the corner, then let the edge fall and tuck it in as well. This will create a vertical fold known as a hospital corner. Repeat this process for the other bottom corner.


Tug firmly on the sheet to create a snug and smooth surface.

, Keep tucking them in until the top sheet smoothly fits under the mattress.

, Align its long sides with the long side of the mattress. The top end of the blanket should be about 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm) from the top of the bed. It should also hang evenly over the sides of the bed.

, Tuck the bottom corners of the blanket into the mattress, just as you did with the bottom corners of the top sheet. Make sure not to crumple the edges.

, Tuck it into both sides until you've created a smooth surface.

, Fold about a foot of the top sheet over the blanket. Now the good side of this sheet is showing. Smooth out the top sheet, and tuck in both sides into the the sides of the mattress.


Now you can decide whether you want to tuck in the top corners of the top sheet or just the bottom two. If you frequently use the bed, then just tucking in the two bottom corners will be best because tucking in all four corner will make it difficult to get into the bed. But if the bed is rarely used and is in the guest bedroom, then this may be a good choice.

, Make sure that both sides are draped evenly over the bed. You don't need to tuck in the bedspread.

, Put pillowcases on, then the pillow shams. Fluff the pillows and put them at the top of the bed. The pillows should match in size. If the bed is a king bed, you can even consider putting in three pillows so the space is filled.


The pillows should sit at the top of the bed.

Clean all crystals carefully.,
Clean the frame.,
Dust light bulbs gently.",How to Clean a Crystal Chandelier1," Switch off the light switch that controls the power for your chandelier. Wait until the light bulbs on your fixture feel cool to the touch.


You can disconnect the electricity as an extra precaution, but only do this if you are confident in operating your home’s circuit breaker or have assistance from a knowledgeable electrician. You should not need to adjust any electric wiring in this process.;
, While you’re waiting for the bulbs to cool, prepare your workspace. Place a tarp or drop cloth over the floor under your chandelier, and set up a stepladder or taller ladder securely under the chandelier.


To prevent any parts dropping and breaking, you can lay down a thick blanket to absorb the fall.
Make sure your ladder is at a height that is comfortable to reach all parts of the chandelier., Working on your ladder where you can reach the chandelier, spray a glass cleaner or specific chandelier cleaner on a cotton cloth that is clean and soft. Wipe down each crystal with the damp cloth, then immediately dry with a separate dry cloth.


Try wearing an apron with pockets while you work, so that you can keep the cleaner, cloths, and any other supplies easily on hand.Instead of two cloths, you can wear two soft cotton gloves for better control and dexterity. Spray one glove with the cleaner to wipe crystals down, and keep the other glove clean to dry them. If you have a lot of crystals, you may want several pairs of gloves., Work your way around the chandelier to clean every crystal with your cleaner and cloth, wiping with the damp cloth or glove and drying with the clean one.


When cleaning the crystals, always spray cleaner onto a cloth first, rather than directly onto the fixture.
While cleaning, don’t twist or rotate the chandelier to access each side or part. This could damage or weaken its parts or supports, risking falling and breakage. Instead, carefully descend and move the ladder to position yourself in the right spot to reach and clean each part separately., Wipe the frame and any other parts of your chandelier with just a dry cloth or an appropriate chandelier cleaner or metal cleaner.


Ensure that you use a cleaner that is intended for the type of metal or other material that your chandelier frame is made out of, otherwise you run the risk of discoloring or tarnishing it.
Clean any metal hooks or fasteners for the crystals with a dry cloth only, as cleaner can tarnish or strip the finish off of them., Clean off the light bulbs in your fixture with a clean, dry cloth. Make sure that all bulbs are screwed in properly and don’t appear browned or discolored.


If any light bulbs are dim, burnt out, broken, or missing, take this opportunity to change them out with new bulbs of proper wattage.If a bulb appears to have more stubborn stains, you can very gently clean it with a cloth damp with cleaner, or replace the bulb entirely.

Position a flat sheet over your mattress.,
Tuck the bottom of the flat sheet in at the foot of the bed.,
Choose a corner at the foot of the bed to start with.,
Grab the bottom of the sheet 16 inches up from the foot of the bed and lift it up to form a tent shape.,
Tuck the excess fabric underneath the mattress.,
Let the sheet fall back down over the side of the mattress.,
Tuck the hanging edge tightly under the mattress.,
Repeat on the other corner (or corners, if you are using your flat sheet as your fitted sheet).,
Smooth out any wrinkles on top of the sheet.",How to Make a Hospital Corner1," A flat sheet is a sheet that is rectangular in shape, with no elastics or rounded corners; it is different from a fitted sheet, which has rounded, stretchy corners made for hugging your mattress.


If you have a fitted sheet, place this on the bed first before laying your flat sheet on top of it. Then, lay your flat sheet out on your bed with three sides of the sheet hanging off the mattress at the sides and foot of the bed. Align the top of the flat sheet with the top of the mattress (at the head of your bed) so that it is flush with the mattress, not hanging over it.
If you do not have a fitted sheet, place the flat sheet over the mattress so that all of its sides hang evenly over the mattress (at the sides, head and foot of the bed).;
, Lifting the bottom of the mattress lightly with one hand, use your other hand to tuck the sheet beneath the mattress, moving from one corner of the mattress to the other.









Once you have put the mattress back down, slide your hand (or, if you prefer, both hands) between the mattress and boxspring (or base) to ensure that sheet is smooth and not bunching anywhere.
You might also tug lightly on the outer ends of the sheet that are still hanging down on either side of the mattress to help keep the sheet taut and smooth.
If you do not have a fitted sheet and are using the flat sheet to lie on top of once you’re in bed, repeat this process at the head of the bed, lifting the mattress slightly and tucking the top end of the flat sheet beneath the mattress.

, Move to one of the two corners at the foot of your bed in preparation for your first hospital corner. For each corner, you’ll be working with the side of the sheet that you have not yet tucked up under the mattress — i.e. the long side, which is hanging over the side of your bed.

, Your hand will be right in the centre, or peak, of the “tent”, and the two sides should fall back down to the mattress at roughly 45-degree angles. As you make the “tent” with one hand, use your other hand to hold down the sheet where the bottom of the “tent” meets the surface of the mattress, roughly at the corner.









As you hold up the sheet with one hand and hold it down at the corner with the other to form a tent shape, you’ll see that some excess fabric still hangs down at the corner of the bed. This is the excess fabric you’ll be working with in the next step.

, Grab the excess fabric that still hangs down around the bed corner you’re working on and tuck it under the mattress. If possible, do this while still holding up the “tent” with your other hand. As you tuck in the fabric, guide the sheet with your hand so that it moves around the corner of the mattress as smoothly as possible.









If you have trouble making the sheet smooth with one hand, you can place the “tent” on top of the mattress and use both hands to smooth the corner. You can also hold the “tent” (now placed on top of the mattress) firmly with one hand as you smooth the excess fabric with your other hand.

, Let go of the long side of the sheet (in which you just made a tent), allowing it to fall back down over the freshly tucked corner and the side of the bed. For a crisper corner, hold the corner in place with one hand as you let the sheet fall. In some hospital settings, you stop here, as shown in the picture.








, As you tuck the sheet under the mattress, use your hand to smooth out any wrinkles that appear in the sheet on top of the bed as you go.








, Start at the foot of the bed. Once you’ve completed those two corners, you can move on to the top of the bed if applicable (if you aren’t using a fitted sheet).

, Run your hand along the sheet on top of the bed to smooth out any wrinkles. If there’s quite a bit of excess fabric on the sides of the bed after you’ve done this, tuck it underneath the mattress.

Reassemble the chandelier.",How to Clean a Crystal Chandelier2," Turn off the power that controls your chandelier. Wait to do any work until the light bulbs on your fixture feel cool to the touch.


You do not need to disconnect the electricity, but you may as an extra precaution since this step involves disassembling the fixture. Disconnect power from the room only if you are confident in operating your home’s circuit breaker or have assistance from a knowledgeable electrician. You should not need to adjust any electric wiring in this process.

, While you’re waiting for the bulbs to cool, prepare your workspace. Place a thick blanket on the floor under your chandelier, as well as across a nearby table or whatever surface you plan to place chandelier parts on. Set up a stepladder or taller ladder securely under the chandelier.


A heavy, thick blanket or cloth is essential for underneath your workspace, as it will soften the landing and prevent breakage in the case of pieces falling during disassembly. If you don’t have one, fold over another cloth several times to make it thicker.Make sure your ladder is at a height that is comfortable to reach all parts of the chandelier.Inspect your chandelier and take photos from several different angles and distances so you will remember how to reassemble it later., Carefully remove each crystal from the chandelier and place it on a nearby surface that is stable and covered with a blanket or thick cloth.


You may disassemble other larger parts of the chandelier or take down the whole fixture entirely if it is possible to do so safely and without affecting wiring or the fragile parts of the chandelier.
You may need needle-nose pliers or a similar tool to unfasten each crystal piece, depending on your chandelier. You can also use them to reshape the crystal fasteners during reassembly to strengthen them., Fill a sink with warm water and a small amount of mild dish soap. Line the sink with a cloth or towel to provide padding. Place crystals into the padded sink and rub each one separately with your fingers in the soapy water before rinsing and placing on a soft, clean towel.


Take care to prevent crystals from hitting against each other or against hard surfaces of the sink to avoid cracking or chipping.
There is no need to use a sponge or brush to clean crystals with the soapy water, and in fact this could end up scratching them.
Dry the crystals with a soft, absorbent cloth immediately after rinsing. This is essential to preventing dried water spots from forming., If you need to, clean the frame, bulbs, and any other parts of the chandelier with a soft, dry cloth. Replace bulbs if they are dim, broken, or discolored.


You may be able to use the same soapy water or other cleaner on the frame or other parts of the chandelier. Check first about the variety of metal or other material they’re made out of to find the right cleaner for it.
Be sure to thoroughly dry any moisture that has remained in light bulb sockets or other areas of electrical connection. Dry as best you can with a cloth, then leave parts out to dry further for several hours before assembly if necessary.

, Work from your photos or memory to replace all parts, bulbs, and crystals to where they belong in the fixture.


While assembling, work from the top down and from inside to out to put all the pieces back together easily."

Try to clean every 12 months.,
Decide on a deep or shallow clean.,
Dust in between cleanings.",How to Clean a Crystal Chandelier3," Aim to clean your chandelier with either the “crystals on” or “crystals off” method every year for a fixture that remains shining and bright.


Observe your chandelier periodically for visible dust, cloudy crystals, or spots. These are all indications that you should clean your fixture right away.
Clean more often if your chandelier is located in a kitchen, as it will build up more grease and grime than in other areas of the house. Entryways are another area in which a chandelier may need more frequent cleaning., If you’ve never cleaned your chandelier, opt for a deep clean by performing the “crystals off” method. Otherwise, the less time-intensive “crystals on” method will typically suffice for regular cleaning.


Choose a deeper clean particularly if there are stubborn spots or a cloudy, milky quality to the crystal that isn’t removed by a simple dusting.

, To make your clean last longer, use a soft feather or lambswool duster to lightly clear dust from the frame and crystals. You'll need a stepladder, but you do not need to disassemble the fixture.A good general rule is to dust every few months, or whenever you notice a visible layer of dust or haziness on the crystals, frame, or bulbs.
It’s also a good idea to dust before any wet cleaning, as you can remove larger dust and dirt particles ahead of time."

Empty waste baskets every day.,
Ensure the public area is presentable.,
Clear off desk spaces to keep clutter to a minimum for a clean company office.",How to Clean a Company Office," Paperwork that is piled up throughout the office space not only looks messy, but also makes it difficult and time consuming to refer back to important documents when the need arises. There are a number of ways loose papers can be organized during the office cleaning procedure.


Filing cabinets are perfect for storing things like invoices, work orders, estimates, vendor information, product specs and customer profiles. Label files according to their specific use and file documents away whenever you clean the office.
If you must keep certain documents on hand for immediate reference, then you can make use of desktop trays and wall mounted ""pockets."" This is a good idea for things like bills to be paid, open customer files, paperwork that must be filed away and documents in current dispute.
To save space, consider scanning documents that can be archived and storing them electronically.;
, Not only is this necessary for a clean company office, but also for the safety of your employees and customers. Restrooms are a high traffic area and need to be cleaned every day.


Scrub toilet bowls with a disinfecting cleaner and a toilet brush. Wipe the seat, the lid, the outside circumference of the bowl, the tank and the base of the toilet with disinfectant. Use toilet bowl deodorizing cakes to maintain freshness in between cleanings.
Wipe sink and counter areas with a disinfecting cleaner.
Sweep and mop the floors.
Refill soap dispensers and paper towel holders, and replace toilet tissue rolls.

, Use a duster to blast dust out of tight spaces like keyboard keys, vents and fans. Wipe electronics with a soft rag moistened with a disinfectant spray.

, Because food is often prepared and stored in the break room, a clean break room is necessary to your employees' health and safety. Additionally, a clean break room is good for employee morale.


Keep the refrigerator clean and organized. Make it a point to throw out old food every week and wipe down the interior with a rag dampened with disinfectant.
Spray countertops, sinks, tables, chairs and shelves with disinfectant spray and wipe with a wet rag.
Clean the inside of the microwave with a disinfecting rag. This should be a part of your daily office cleaning, as microwave messes can become hardened and difficult to clean if left to sit over an extended period of time.
If you use a dish drainer, clean it every day along with the dishes to prevent mildew.
Wash hand and dish towels regularly, and replace dish sponges as needed.

, This includes garbage in the break room, office spaces, conference room, public area and restrooms.

, If your customers or clients visit your place of business, then a clean company office is the first impression they will get. Therefore, you need to put a lot of care and attention into presenting a space that is representative of what you want to convey about your business.


Seating should be free of dust, crumbs and stains.

Make sure the sheet hangs down equally on both sides of your bed.,
Place a blanket on top of the flat sheet.,
Grabbing the flat sheet and the blanket together, fold hospital corners at the bottom 2 corners of the bed.,
Leave the sides of the sheet and blanket hanging down.,
Fold the sheet and blanket down at the top of the bed.,
Tuck in the sides.,
Run your hand along the top of the bed to smooth out any wrinkles.

",How to Make a Hospital Corner2," The sheet covering your mattress could be either a fitted sheet or a flat sheet that has already been folded into hospital corners (as per the “Folding Hospital Corners” method).

,, Note that the sheet will not hang down equally at the head and foot of your bed: it will be aligned with the head of your bed and it will hang down over the foot of your bed.

, The thicker your top blanket, the more difficult it may be to fold hospital corners with. If you really want to mimic military style, the standard blankets we see on top of military beds are not cushy quilts but thick, coarse wool blankets.









Some people like to place the blanket 6 to 12 inches down from the top of the flat sheet (i.e. from the top of the bed); others like to line the blanket up perfectly with the flat sheet. You can experiment with what best suits your tastes.

, Unlike with regular hospital corners, you will not be folding the flat sheet separately from your top blanket; you will fold them simultaneously, so that they are folded together.








, Don’t tuck these in just yet, as you’ll want to work on the top of the bed before finalizing the folds by tucking in the sides.

, Exactly what you do here will depend on how you’ve aligned your flat sheet and blanket, but the end result will be similar no matter what: the sheet will sit folded neatly over top of the blanket. It should look sort of like a cuff on a shirt sleeve or pants.

, Now that you’ve made the appropriate folds at the top and bottom of the bed, you can tuck in the sides. Be sure to hold the sheet and blanket together as you tuck them underneath the mattress.

The pillow should sit on the exposed sheet that you will sleep on. It should sit above the flat sheet and blanket that you’ve just folded down on top of your bed.








, This blanket should be similar to, if not the same as, the top blanket of your bed. To fold something in half vertically means to fold it so that the long sides are touching.

, It should cover your pillow and hang down equally on both sides of the bed. The top of the blanket should hang several inches over the head of your bed. Ensure that the blanket still reaches down far enough below your pillow so that it covers both the pillow and the folded sheet/blanket just beneath your pillow.

, Just as you’ve done in previous steps, fold the blanket into hospital corners at the two top corners of your bed.

, Pull the blanket taught on both sides to smooth out any wrinkles before tucking it beneath the mattress. When you tuck it in, avoid lifting the mattress as this might loosen the sheet and blanket already tucked beneath it. Simply slide the blanket in beneath the mattress using your hand.

, Run your hand over the bed one final time to smooth out any wrinkles. The purpose of this blanket is to seal your bed against dust, so you want to ensure that it’s tightly fitted to your bed, with no gaps or wrinkles.

Scrape out the nozzle.,
Wipe down the exterior.,
Test the fogger fluid.,
Purchase fog machine cleaner.,
Follow the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions.,
Avoid overdoing it.,
Watch for decreased output.,
Clean before storing.",How to Clean a Fog Machine," The vinegar mixture can be quite stinky and gives off an overwhelming odor, especially when used indoors. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, take your fog machine to an outdoor space when you want to clean it. This will be much better for you and anyone else who might be around.Try cleaning the fog machine in your backyard next to an outdoor electrical outlet. If you can’t find a space like this that works, consider cleaning it in your garage with the garage door open.;
, Remove the tank from the machine. Unscrew the cap and dump the remaining fog liquid out in the sink. Make sure to empty it completely.


Don’t worry about rinsing the tank out after you dump it. The vinegar solution will work to clean the tank for you.

, Using distilled water and distilled white vinegar, make a cleaning solution that is equal parts of each ingredient – half vinegar and half distilled water.


Be sure to use distilled water only, not tap water. Tap water contains minerals that can leave deposits inside your machine that will build up over time and cause problems later.

, Put the tank back in the fog machine and pour the mixture of vinegar and distilled water into the opening. It should go into the same tank that is normally filled with fogging fluid.You’ll need to use enough of the mixture to thoroughly clean the machine. The tank should be mostly full. For most fog machines, this is probably about half a liter of the cleaning solution.
Turn the machine on and let it run with the vinegar water mixture inside it.

, Once you’ve run the vinegar and water mixture, you should pour some distilled water (not mixed with anything) into the fog machine and run it once like this. The water will help flush out any remaining vinegar smell inside the machine and will help clean it out a bit more.Let the machine air dry once you have finished this procedure.

, Unplug your machine and allow it to cool down completely. Check the output nozzle (where the fog steam comes out of) for any deposits or debris. If you see something, use your fingernail or another firm object to scrape the opening of the nozzle.Additionally, you can try using a pin (or small needle) to clean out any remaining dirt. Move it in and out of the nozzle hold a few times to remove excess build up.

, Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior of the fog machine. Be sure to get in all the nooks and crannies of the machine to clean off any dust or residue that may have built up over time.


Performing this kind of regular maintenance should prevent the machine from needing aggressive cleaning as often. It will also help prolong the life of your fog machine.

, Once you have finished cleaning the fog machine, you can put some more fogger fluid in it to make sure it is working properly again. Let the machine run and produce fog for at least several minutes before you decide that it’s working the way you want it to.Never store (or stop using) a freshly cleaned fog machine without first running another batch of fogging liquid to make sure it works.

, There are quite a few products available online for purchase that are intended for use in cleaning fog machines. Simply purchase the cleaning fluid and run it through your fog machine. Make sure to do the procedure outdoors so you don’t stink up the place with a chemically smell.Remember to always clean your fog machine before you store it.

, Your fog machine should come with an owner’s manual that gives specific cleaning instructions. If you do some sort of cleaning routine that isn’t recommended by the manufacturer, it could void your product warranty.If the cleaning techniques don’t work, you may need to contact your manufacturer for a replacement, as long as your machine is still under warranty. So try not to do anything that may void the warranty.

, Most fog machines don’t need to be cleaned regularly. In fact, fog machines typically don’t need to be cleaned at all unless you have been putting low quality fog liquid products in your fog machine – these lower quality products can cause the fog machine’s heater to clog.You definitely don’t need to clean your fog machine every year unless it starts exhibiting some symptoms indicating it needs a good cleaning.
Cleaning a fog machine too often can cause it to stop working altogether.

, The main sign that your fog machine needs to be cleaned is when you start noticing a significant decrease in output of the fog effect. If your machine isn’t producing fog as much as it used to, then it’s probably time for a cleaning.Since you don’t want to clean your fog machine too frequently, you should wait until you see a significant decrease in fog output – not just a small change.

, If you use your fogger once a year (like at Halloween) and then put it away in storage for the rest of the year, you should clean the fog machine before you pack it up for storage. Don’t wait until you bring it out the next year because a clogged fog machine that sits unused for months on end will most likely be permanently unusable when you try to use it again.Before you store your fog machine for an extended period of time, check its output to ensure you don’t need to clean it before storing it.

Apply lemon juice or vinegar to any stained areas.,
Allow the cleanser to sit for a while.,
Wipe down the stained surface.,
Rinse thoroughly.",How to Clean a Ceramic Sink Without Chemicals1," These mild acids are especially effective at removing rust stains. If you use lemon, you can either squeeze the juice onto the stain or gently rub the stain with a lemon wedge.

Shake on a generous quantity of baking soda.Make sure the sink is only slightly damp when you apply the baking soda. Baking soda dissolves quickly in water, which makes it ineffective as an abrasive.

, Use a slightly damp (not soaking wet) scrubber to gently rub away the dirt. The baking soda should form small clumps that take the dirt with them as they come up.Use a non-scratch scrubbing sponge.
Avoid steel wool or pumice stones for this purpose, as both can do a lot of damage to ceramic or porcelain sinks.

Soak the beer keg in the alkali wash. Once you’ve shaken or agitated the keg with the alkali mixture inside, leave the keg and its components to soak for at least an hour.,
Drain and rinse the alkali wash. After ideally about 24 hours of soaking, dump the alkali wash out of the bucket and the keg.,
Soak the keg and its parts in a sanitizer solution.,
Rinse the keg components in the alkali wash bucket.,
Reassemble the beer keg.",How to Clean a Beer Keg," A keg will have to be completely depressurized before it is disassembled, otherwise you risk damaging the keg and hurting yourself. Leave the tap open and let any remaining liquid and pressurized air escape before trying to remove the lid.Once the hissing sound caused by escaping pressurized air has stopped, the keg will be completely depressurized.;
, Before you begin cleaning the interior of your keg, you’ll need to remove the top. The lid can usually be lifted off easily by squeezing and lifting the retaining bail, and the rubber gasket underneath can be pried off with your fingers.The lid and O ring can both be cleaned using warm, soapy water and a sponge before they’re placed in the alkali wash.

, Your keg should have two valve assemblies on top: one for connecting the air line and one for connecting the beer supply line. Use a wrench to unscrew these two valves. You will need to use a standard hex wrench to unscrew the valve assemblies. The size of the fittings can vary, so try different wrench sizes until you find one that fits.The valves will likely be connected to the body of the keg either by ball-lock or pin-lock connectors. Although the two types of connectors are slightly different, they both serve the same function and can be removed with the same type of wrench.

, Kegs and their components are best cleaned using an alkali wash designed specifically for cleaning brewing equipment. Mix the cleaner with hot water in a separate bucket according to the proportions specified by the manufacturer.Powdered Brewery Wash (PBW) is a popular example of a commercially available alkali-wash cleaner. Other commercial keg cleaners are available for purchase at a homebrew supply store or your local hardware or home supply shop.
The abrasive alkali mixture will harm unprotected skin, so wear protective plastic gloves to keep your hands safe.

, The lid, gasket, and valves should be placed into a clean plastic bucket for soaking (your fermenter bucket should suffice). Make sure that the bucket is large enough to allow each piece to be fully submerged in liquid.Agitate the bucket to shake the components in the solution, and let the bucket sit overnight.

If you’re worried about children, animals, or insects falling into the bucket, cover it with a plastic lid or a small sheet of plywood.

, Fill the keg as high as possible to ensure that the entire interior is cleaned, and make sure that the lid, gasket, and valves are completely submerged. Then seal the keg lid, and shake vigorously.If the keg is too large or heavy for you to pick up and shake, you can tip the keg up on its edge and roll it back and forth. This will slosh the cleaning fluid around inside.

, If you have time, let the keg soak overnight. The alkali mix will continue to clean the inside of the keg while it sits undisturbed., Rinse the keg and its parts once with hot water. If you are at a bar or brewery and can heat your rinse water to a specific temperature, aim to make it about 161°F (71.5°C).Once you’ve rinsed the interior of the keg, any remaining residue can be scrubbed away using a regular carboy brush and then rinsed with warm water.
However, most alkali wash formulations are designed to work without scrubbing.

, Cleaning a keg is pointless without the extra step of sanitizing, which gets rid of all microbial life that could ruin your beer. Pour a gallon of water into your keg, and follow this with a no-rinse sanitizer. Then let the solution sit for 3-5 minutes. Finally, pour the sanitizer solution out of the keg.Popular acid washes that are sold at homebrew supply stores include Saniclean and Star San. Both of these products are designed to be used without rinsing afterwards.

, Now that you’re ready to put the components of the beer keg back together, it’s time to clean off the lid, O-ring gasket, and valves. Wearing a pair of protective plastic gloves, reach into your alkali-wash bucket and pull out the keg components, then rinse them clean under warm water.Once you’ve rinsed the O-ring, gaskets, and valves, dry them off using a clean towel or cotton cloth.

, First, re-attach the two cleaned valves to their respective housings in the keg body. Then place the cleaned O ring back on top of the keg opening, and replace the lid on top. Press down firmly on the lid until it snaps back in place under the plastic bail.Once you’ve reassembled the components of the keg, store the entire assembly in a clean, dry area until use.

Otherwise, direct the stream of water over the surface with your hands or a cup. Keep rinsing until all traces of baking soda and limescale are gone., Use a clean cloth or towel with a soft texture. Move in gentle circular strokes with the grain. Continue until the surface of the sink is completely dry. If you leave any water deposits, the lime or calcium in your water will contribute to new buildup."

Open your drain stopper.,
Boil a pot of water.,
Pour the water down the drain.",How to Clean a Bathtub Drain1," Hit the switch on your tub or unscrew the drain stopper to an open position so that water can go down your drain. If water is slow, or your tub fills up and doesn't drain, your drain has to be unclogged before you can clean it.;
, Bring a two-liter (8.4 cups) pot or kettle of water to a boil on your stovetop. The hot water will be able to flush any loose hair or soap scum in the drain., If you have metal pipes, you can pour the boiling water directly down the drain. You should do this at least once a week to flush built up soap scum and gunk that's left over from bathing."

Clean or upgrade your air filters.,
Get an air purifier.",How to Reduce Dust in Your House1," If your house is heated and/or cooled by a central system, you can change the filters as a means of controlling dust levels in your air. Dust will continue to build up in your home, but a quality filter can slow down the rate of dust accumulation.


A standard air filter will only filter big particles from the air to prevent damage to your heating or cooling systems. To reduce dust, it is recommended that you use high-quality paper or pleated fabric filters that are disposable and replace them every 1 to 3 months.;
, These machines clean the air by trapping dust particles. They're great for high-dust households or families with dust allergies.Air purifiers only clean the air in the room they're in, so consider getting one for each bedroom and the living room.

Remove your drain stopper.,
Pour a cup of baking soda into the drain and let it sit for 20 minutes.,
Remove the gunk from the inside of your drain with a bottle brush.,
Flush the drain with a pot of boiling water.",How to Clean a Bathtub Drain2," Tubs will have different types of drain stoppers depending on what kind of tub you have. Some stoppers like a push-pull stopper will require you to remove screws in your drain while others simply require you to unscrew the stopper to pull it free. To clean the inside of your drain, you'll need to completely remove the drain stopper., Use a measuring cup to measure out a cup (180 g) of baking soda, then pour it down the drain. As the baking soda sits, it should absorb the unpleasant odors coming from the drain., Get a bottle brush that is at least 1 1/4 inches (3.17 cm) in diameter and stick the brush end into the verticle pipe connected to your drain. Move the brush up and down while rotating it to remove the gunk from the inside of your drain. Pull all of the dirt and hair out of the drain with the brush., Fill a large pot with boiling water and pour it down your drain to flush all of the baking soda down the drain. Once it's done, you may need to repeat the steps to fully deodorize your drain.You can also boil vinegar instead of water to further deodorize your drain.

Vacuum twice a week.,
Sweep the floors every few days.,
Mop the floors often.,
Dust with microfiber cloths.,
Wash your bedding often.,
Beat your cushions and rugs once a month.,
Clean your walls from top to bottom.",How to Reduce Dust in Your House2," Using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter will ensure that you're sucking up as much dust as possible. Vacuum all the carpeting in your home, focusing especially on high-traffic areas. You can also vacuum other flooring. Vacuuming frequently really cuts down on how much dust is able to build up under furniture and in corners - you'll probably notice a difference right away.Be sure to change your vacuum filter frequently.
Make sure your vacuum is in good working order. A broken vacuum will just spit the dust back into the air, making the problem worse.

, Using a broom and dustpan to get rid of the dust on the floors you don't vacuum is another great way to reduce your household dust. Sweep frequently in areas that tend to have a lot of dust, like doorways, hallways and the kitchen floor. Toss out the dust in your garbage can to make sure it doesn't reenter your household.

, Going over your flooring with a wet mop is a great way to collect the dust you missed while sweeping. If you mop frequently, you'll be able to get the dust under control. Letting it go too long will make it a lot more difficult to clean up all the dust and dirt, and you may need to do some scrubbing.

, Not all dusting cloths are made alike. If dust is an issue in your house, it might be time to spring for a microfiber dusting cloth. This fabric is designed to trap dust and hold it. Using an old t-shirt or towel tends to move the dust around rather than actually getting rid of it. Same goes for feather dusters - your furniture will look cleaner, but the dust particles have simply moved into the air.


Use microfiber cloths to dust all surfaces where dust tends to accumulate, like the top of your mantel, desk, side tables, and so on. Wet cloths tend to collect dust better than dry cloths, so when you're dusting furniture that isn't wooden, try wetting the cloth first.
Wash microfiber cloths immediately after dusting to get rid of everything the cloth collected. Don't use dryer sheets when you run them through the dryer, though; fabric softener reduces the cloths' capacity to hold the dust.

, Sheets, blankets, comforters and pillows are places where dust tends to accumulate, often causing people to wake up with stuffy noses from breathing dusty air all night. Every time you get in or out of bed, you unknowingly send swirls of dust into the air. The solution is to wash your bedding often, especially if you or your family members have dry skin, or if your pets sleep with you in the bed.


Wash sheets and pillowcases about once a week if you have a high-dust household.
Wash other bedding and blankets once every three or four weeks.

, Like your bedding, your furniture cushions and your rugs have a tendency to pick up a lot of dust over time. Every time you sit on your couch or walk on your rug, you're sending dust into the air. Every 3 months, take your cushions and rugs outside for a few whacks and eliminate as much dust as you can.


An old broom handle is a great tool to use for beating rugs and cushions.
Beat them all over, not just in the same place.
Keep beating rugs and cushions until you don't see dust particles flying into the air with every whack.

, Every few months, when your house is due for a deep cleaning, go over the walls, trim and baseboards with microfiber cloths. Clean the top of the walls first, making your way down to the bottom. That way you'll be able to collect all the dust that falls down as you clean.

Get rid of knick-knacks.,
Remove piles of magazines and books.,
Use fewer textiles in your house.Throw blankets, pillows, tablecloths, and plushy furniture also contribute to household dust - by producing it and trapping it, too.,
Keep your closets clean.,
Keep unused clothing in boxes or bags.,
Have people take off dirty shoes at the door.,
Groom your pets regularly.",How to Reduce Dust in Your House3," If every room in your house has a lot of decorative items sitting around, it will be a lot harder to reduce your dust. Go through your house and do a sweep for dust-collecting items that you don't really need. This will leave your surfaces much easier to clean.


For those items you really want to keep, consider moving some of them to a room that isn't used as frequently by your family. That way, the main rooms in your house won't be as likely to accumulate dust.

, As these items degrade over time, they produce a lot of dust. Having piles of them around the house is a sure way to create a dusty atmosphere. Place your books on bookshelves, and regularly recycle magazines and other paper items. Store paper items you want to keep in plastic bags so they won't make your house dusty.

, If you can pare down your linen and cloth items, you'll see a reduction in the amount of dust flying around the house.


Instead of buying cloth furniture, go for leather or wood. It may be that one piece of older furniture is disintegrating and producing dust. If so, get rid of it.
Wash your blankets and pillows frequently.

, Every time you open the door to your closet, tiny changes in air pressure cause flakes of fiber to shed from clothing and fabrics, and these flakes of dust accumulate on the ground. If your closet is messy, you are less likely to clean the closet floor during your cleaning routines. When the closet floor is clear, cleaning is simple and prevents the dust from leaving the closet and floating elsewhere.


Hang up your clothes neatly instead of keeping them in piles or stacks.
Have a place for your shoes to go, rather than throwing them all in a bin.
Regularly vacuum the floor of your closet to reduce the amount of dust in there.

, Out-of-season clothing should be stored away rather than left out until next year. When clothing and fabrics are kept within closed containers, they are less likely to be disturbed, resulting in fewer pieces of dust.


It is recommended that you store within transparent containers and bags so you can just look to see which items are where.
When dust accumulates on the containers themselves, you can easily wipe them down.

, Mud and dirt that gets tracked into the house will eventually contribute to your household dust as it dries out. On rainy days and during the winter months, you might consider asking people to take off their shoes at the door. That way, you can keep the dust produced by these items contained to one area, which you can clean frequently.

, Dogs and cats contribute fur and dander to the household dust count. Brushing them regularly is a big help. Groom your pets in the bathroom or laundry room rather than on the living room couch or in the bedroom, since these areas are harder to keep clean. Also wash your pets' bedding frequently.

To pull the gunk and hair from the drain, you'll need to make sure that you can access the verticle pipe that runs from your drain., You can purchase a plastic snake that has teeth on it from a home improvement store or you can use pliers. Work your tool into the drain, and try to snag any grime or hair that's caught in the drain. Carefully pull the hair and gunk from the drain with your tool and use your fingers to pull the rest of it out. Continue doing this until you've removed all the built up hair from the drain., Dispose of any hair or gunk into a waste bin and run your bathtub water. Make sure that the water flows down the drain before wiping down the tub and getting rid of any excess debris that was pulled up from your drain.

Remove the overflow drain faceplate.,
Fill the overflow hole with a damp rag.,
Fill the tub with water.,
Plunge your drain.",How to Clean a Bathtub Drain4," To plunge your drain, you'll also have to remove the faceplate from the overflow hole. The overflow hole usually has a metallic faceplate with screws and is usually under the spout for your bathtub. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws from the faceplate and then remove the faceplate itself.On certain tubs the overflow drain will have a switch to open or close the drain on your bathtub. In this case, you must remove the entire drain attached to the overflow faceplate.

, Filling the overflow hole with a rag will create the suction that's required to clear drains with the plunger. Shove a cotton towel or rag into the hole and try to make it as air tight as possible., If the tub isn't already filled with water, fill it up with two to three inches of water. Take extra care to not overflow your bathtub., Plunging helps free any obstructions that may be in the pipe. Place the plunger over the drain and press up and down on the handle. After 30 seconds of plunging, see if the drain flushes normally. If it does not, continue repeating the process until the tub drains."

, Before using your bamboo steamer, soak it for about 20 minutes. This will prevent the bamboo from burning during use.Soaking might not be appropriate for your bamboo steamer.Consult manufacturer directions for information regarding whether soaking is warranted to prevent burning your steamer before use.

, Your bamboo steamer will require more cleaning if you place food directly on its lattice surface. Instead, cut a piece of parchment paper to a size that your bamboo steamer can accommodate and place the food you want to steam on that. Alternately, place a heatproof plate on the steamer lattice, then place the food you wish to steam on the plate.Ensure that any plate or parchment paper has a border of open space around its perimeter that will allow the steam to rise and envelop whatever you’re trying to steam.

Wash the bowl by hand with hot, soapy water.,
Rinse the bowl with hot water.,
Dry the wooden bowl with a clean towel.,
Set the bowl in a drying rack to finish drying.",How to Clean Wooden Bowls1," Grab a soft washcloth or a soft sponge and put a few drops of mild dish soap on it. Soak the cloth or sponge with hot water and wipe the bowl down thoroughly inside and outside. In the process, don’t submerge or soak the bowl in the water.Wooden bowls absorb water easily, which is why you shouldn’t soak or submerge them. It’s important, for the same reason, that you never put wooden bowls in the dishwasher.
Don’t use a scrubbing pad or steel wool unless your bowl has a tough buildup. Soft cloths and sponges are enough for basic cleaning.;
, After a quick but thorough wash, rinse the entire bowel with hot water. Be sure not to submerge the bowl in the water when you rinse it. It’s important to get all of the soap off of the bowl so it doesn’t get scummy.Try to rinse the bowl in about five seconds rather than letting it linger in the running water.

, Wipe the entire bowl down with a clean, dry towel to remove as much of the moisture as you can. Because wood retains water easily, you will not be able to get it completely dry with a towel. Just make sure that it is only slightly damp when you finish.It may help to press the towel into the bowls more than you would when drying other materials. The pressure will draw some of the moisture out.

, After drying the bowl with a towel, put the bowl in a drying rack and allow it to sit until it is completely dry. You may need to let the bowl sit overnight to dry completely. Check the bowl after a few hours if you don’t want to leave it overnight.Don’t put a wooden bowl that is still wet into the cabinet, as this might keep it from drying completely and can ruin the bowl or cause mildew.

Give wooden bowls a deep clean with salt and lemon.,
Disinfect wooden bowls with vinegar and water.,
Use fine-grit sandpaper to gently buff away buildup.",How to Clean Wooden Bowls2," Every so often, your wooden bowls can use a deeper clean than soap and water. Pour some coarse (large grain) salt into the bowl. Cut a lemon in half, and rub the juicy pulp over the surface of the bowl. Briefly wash with hot water and mild dish soap after scrubbing.Lemon juice is commonly used as a disinfectant and the salt provides a slight abrasion to the bowl’s surface. A lime can be used, also, and regular table salt will have a similar effect.
Scrub the outside of the bowl, too.

, Mix three tablespoons (44.4 ml) of white vinegar into one cup (240 ml) of hot water. Dip a washcloth into the mixture and rub the entire surface of the bowls with the solution. Let the vinegar sit for five minutes, then follow the standard washing procedure afterward.Depending on how often you use the bowls, disinfect them after every five uses or so.

, If you have been using your bowls for years, they may develop stuck-on residue. Take fine-grit sandpaper and gently rub it with the grain of the wood. This will remove a thin layer of buildup. Sand a little bit out from the bad spot to blend it in with the rest of the bowl.You only need to sand the area that has a lot of buildup, not the entire bowl, but if the entire bowl has buildup, it’s okay to lightly sand the whole thing.
Remember, you only want to buff away the extra, non-wood layer that has developed. Don’t apply so much pressure that you start taking off wood.

Buy food grade mineral oil.,
Wipe the entire surface of the bowl with mineral oil.,
Let the bowl sit overnight.,
Wipe the excess oil off of the bowl with a clean paper towel.",How to Clean Wooden Bowls3," Wooden bowls can become dry and may eventually crack, so it is important to treat them with oil sometimes. When you’re looking for oil at the store, make sure it is labeled as food grade. You may also find mineral oil that specifically says it is for cutting boards, butcher blocks, or wooden dishware.You may find mineral oil that is not specifically labelled as food grade. Some of this is safe for consumption and some of it isn’t. If you’re unsure, look for “white mineral oil,” as this is the kind that has been refined enough for consumption.

, Take a clean, dry paper towel and pour a small circle of mineral oil onto it. Wipe the bowl completely, inside and outside, with the mineral oil. Apply the oil in some kind of pattern to make sure you don’t mis any spots.Don’t be afraid of putting too much oil on the bowl. If it seems like the first application soaked into the bowl, put a second, or even third, coat onto it.
Depending on how much you use your bowls. Treat them with mineral oil every couple of months or at least two times a year.

, Set the bowl on a clean spot on the counter or table and leave it overnight. The oil will soak partially into the wood, moisturizing it and coating the surface. If you are in a hurry, try to let the oil sit for at least 30 minutes.Allowing the mineral oil to sit for a short time will still help the bowls last, but not as well as letting the oil soak in for longer.

, After the bowl has sat and soaked in most of the oil, take another dry paper towel and wipe the entire surface of the bowl. There will be some oil that doesn’t soak into the wood, and it is best to remove this excess. Discard the paper towel afterward.


Put them back in the cabinet for later use, or go ahead and use them now. The purpose of using food grade oil is that it’s safe for consumption.

,
To remove black marks left by cutlery on Italian ceramic plates clean them with a good quality, non-abrasive metal cleaner.

",How to Preserve the Beauty of Italian Ceramic Dinnerware," They should not be placed in the oven or microwaves or directly on a burner. Italian ceramics are kiln fired twice at more than 1,600 °F (870 °C), so they clearly can stand high temperatures. However, the risk of cracking or chipping sever ware or dinnerware when very hot and unevenly covered with food is real.;
, Italian ceramic plates like to be tempered with warm tap water before serving very hot foods or liquids. It’s important to avoid possible thermal shock and cracking.

, Pay attention when placing the pottery into the machine: ceramic pieces have to stay far apart to avoid touching each other during the dish washing cycle.

, Use a plastic scrubber for the worst bits. Don’t use scouring powders or other harsh remedies.

Determine if your fine china is durable enough for the dishwasher.,
Check if there is a gentle setting on your dishwasher.,
Use a mild liquid dishwasher detergent that does not contain lemon or bleach.,
Rinse food particles off the china using warm water and a rubber spatula.,
Load the china into your dishwasher carefully.,
Use the shortest, gentlest wash.,
Clean fine china right away.,
Remove any rings or jewellery from your hands.,
Use gentle cleaning tools like a sponge or a plastic brush.,
Wash each piece individually with warm water and mild liquid detergent.,
Apply a gentle scrubbing agent to any coffee or tea stains.,
Let the china air dry or use a soft towel to dry them.",How to Clean Fine China in a Dishwasher," Start by examining your china to determine if it can withstand the dishwasher. Fine china can be classified into two types: porcelain china and bone china. Both types are kiln fired at high temperatures, so they are pretty durable and non-porous, meaning they may be able to withstand the occasional run in the dishwasher.Fine china that has been made recently, within 10-15 years, may be able to withstand the dishwasher. Some fine china makers will also note on the bottom of the china if it is dishwasher safe.
If the china has a delicate gold or platinum gilding, you may not want to run them through the dishwasher, as these decorations can fade or react badly to high heat.
Most china that is twenty years old or more are too delicate for the dishwasher or have patterns on them that are considered vintage. You may not want to risk damaging them by washing them in the dishwasher. As well, if the china is a family heirloom, you may want to consider hand washing the china instead.;
, Many high-end dishwashers will have a special wash cycle for fine china or a delicate cycle. Look to see if your dishwasher has a delicate cycle or a gentle setting.You should also think about how forgiving your dishwasher is on normal plates and dishware. If it tends to be more punishing on everyday dishware, it may not be all that gentle on fine china either.

, Look for a mild liquid detergent as a powder detergent can be too grainy and abrasive on the china.Never use regular non-dishwasher detergent inside your dishwasher; otherwise it'll break the dishwasher, as well as leave unremovable stains inside the remainder of the dishwasher and the dishes themselves.


Avoid liquid detergents that are lemon-scented or contain bleach, as the acids in these ingredients can be harsh on the surface of the fine china., It is important that you never let food particles sit on the fine china for a long period of time, as the acid in the food particles can eat away at the glaze on the china. Rinse the china with warm water if you don’t have time to wash them right away, or try to wash off the food particles as soon as you can.


Do not use utensils to scrape the food particles off the china as this can scratch or damage the china. Instead, use warm water and a rubber spatula to gently remove the food particles from the china., Space them out evenly in the dishwasher so they will not bump against each other when the dishwasher is turned on. Make sure each plate and cup is secure in the dishwasher so they will not bump or move around. A loose china plate can clank against another dish, leading to chipping and other damage.You should also avoid cleaning smaller items like utensils in the same cycle with the fine china. If possible, keep other dishes and utensils separate from the fine china in the dishwasher or wash them in a separate cycle.

, This will prevent the china from getting too hot during the wash cycle. Depending on your dishwasher, you may need to stop the washer before it goes into the drying cycle. This will prevent water deposits from forming on your china and protect the china from heat.You should then remove the china from the dishwasher and towel dry the china by hand. This will prevent the china from being damaged by heat.

, Try not to let the fine china sit with food particles on its surface for a long period of time, as the acid in the food particles can damage the china. You should also avoid soaking the fine china overnight in warm water as this can weaken the china. Instead, roll up your sleeves and commit to cleaning the fine china as soon as it is no longer in use. This will ensure the food particles come off the fine china easily and the fine china is not in danger of being damaged., Start by taking off any rings or bracelets that could clank or hit the fine china as you wash it.You may also want to lay a thick towel or a rubber mat at the bottom of your sink to protect the fine china from getting nicked or chipped during the wash.
Push the tap out to one side or to the other sink, if you have two sinks, so there is no risk of you hitting the fine china on the tap.

, Go for a soft sponge and a plastic brush or a rubber spatula that will be gentle on the fine china.Avoid metal cleaning tools like steel wool or sponges that have a rough and scratchy surface. Never scrape the surface of the fine china with metal utensils, as this can damage the fine china.

, Rather than stacking the fine china on top of one another, lay them all out flat on the kitchen counter and wash each piece individually. Use warm water and a mild detergent that does not contain lemon or bleach.


Take your time as you wash each piece of china. Rub the surface of the china carefully and gently to avoid scratching the china.

, If the china has stains from coffee or tea, you can use a gentle scrubbing agent to spot clean these stains. You can also use baking soda and water to gently remove the stains.You can also remove water deposits on your china, which tend to develop when china is run through a dishwasher or water is left to sit on the china for too long, using apple cider vinegar diluted in water.

, As you wash each piece of china, place them upright in a wooden or plastic drying rack so they can air dry. You can also have someone help you dry them using a soft towel.Once your fine china is completely dry, store it by placing cloth napkins, paper doilies, or coffee filters between each place and saucer. This will prevent scratching and chipping. Do not stack or hang fine china tea cups.
If you use your fine china less than once a year, you should wash the fine china annually to preserve the glaze and the paint on the fine china.

Plant ginger, which has a strong smell that aphids hate, and is a useful deterrent.

,
Use a commercial aphid killer.,

Use a solution of:

8 cups of warm water
1/2 cup of vegetable oil
6-8 drops of dish soap (Do not use too much soap, as it can burn the leaves.)
A pinch of cayenne pepper.


Shake well and use this weekly on infected plants.

, One example is 1/4 cup of chopped ginger with 1 cup of warm water. Let it soak for 2 hours, shake well and spray all over the plants.

, These will appear naturally during heavy aphid infestations and will help to control the aphid population, but will likely not eliminate the aphids.Alternatively you can purchase these natural controls online to supplement the naturally occurring aphids predators. Note that it is important to not use a broad spectrum insecticide on aphids for it will kill the beneficial insects in your garden (including pollinators).

, These include alyssum, nasturtiums, carrots, marigolds, dill, cilantro, mustard, and chives.

,, Use care with this, as it can be toxic to you, children, and animals.

, Ants can kill insects that feed on aphids, so using an ant killer around your plants may help. Ants also herd (farm) aphids. Meaning that the ants will keep the aphids alive and protect them as an available food source.

Unfold your dinner napkin.,
Fold it in half lengthwise with the ""right"" side out.

,
Lay it out on the table before you with a short end lined up with the table edge.

,
Pleat it, starting at the short edge.,
Pick up the napkin, holding the pleats in place, and fold it lengthwise with the pleats on the outside.,
Only concentrate on the unpleated part of the napkin from here.,
Let go of the pleats while holding the triangular end of the napkin.",How to Fold a Dinner Napkin As a Fan,";
,,, The pleats should each be as wide as your index finger. Make sure they are even, not one too skinny and the next too wide. That would make your fan wobbly. Stop when you have reached the middle of the napkin.

, Hold the pleats firmly.

, You will make a triangular sort of ""stand"", comparable to the stand on the back of a picture frame:


Right behind the pleats, hold the open edge of the napkin and fold it straight across over the folded edge. You now have the pleats, then a triangular shape with the napkin end hanging over the folded edge.
Fold the end of the napkin over the folded side again. Hold it in place firmly (as well as holding the pleats) and turn the napkin so that the fold touches the table.

, The pleats will fall open in a half-circle fan. The triangular ""stand"" you folded behind the pleats will keep the napkin from falling over.

Resist the urge to attack the snake with a broom or stick.A snake won't attack you unless it feels threatened by you.,
Determine whether or not it is venomous.There are methods to discover if a snake is venomous.Some major qualities of venomous snakes are fat bodies, large fangs, and slit-like eyes.,

Modify your yard.",How to Deal With a Snake in the House," All snakes, venomous or otherwise, will not pursue a human being unless provoked.Know that you are a larger predator and that the snake will keep to itself if you don't bother it.


If you see that the snake has coiled itself up and opened its mouth wide, then you know that it sees you as a threat. Step away slowly to avoid any further risk.
Remember that snakes are positive forces in our ecosystem, controlling rodent and insect populations.While it's not comforting to see one in your home, you really don't want to kill it, as it does control pest populations within your area. Prevent cruelty against snakes by not acting out in fear.;
, You'll also want to keep your eyes out for the iconic rattling tail.


If you think that you may live in an area where one of these species lives, make sure that you can identify them.Four major species include:
The Copperhead. A pit viper with a tan and copper coloration. Their bites are very painful, but rarely fatal.
The Coral Snake. The most dangerous of the four. They can be recognized by their red, yellow and black stripes. Know that they can be easily mistaken for the Milk snake, a harmless beast, because of their very similar colorations. While the colors are the same, the patterns on the two species differ. The rhymes ""Red on Black, friend of Jack"" and ""Red on Yellow, kill a fellow"" will help you differentiate between the Milk snake and the Coral Snake, respectively.
The Cottonmouth. A quick, cranky snake with a brown and olive body. When threatened, they will stand their ground and flash the light ""cotton"" lining within their mouths.
The Rattlesnake. The most infamous and recognizable snake on this list, the Rattlesnake has a brown coloration with lighter stripes, as well as its iconic rattling tail.
There are also a wide variety of different vipers, cobras, and other venomous snake breeds. Check your local wildlife brochure to see what may be lingering in your area. It's best to be familiar with any potential snakes in your area. This way, you'll always be prepared for the worst.

, Regardless of whether or not the snake is a present risk, you'll want to make sure to reduce any and all potential dangers.Because of their size, your pets and children are at larger risk than a fully-grown adult. Their motion is also far more unpredictable, especially with your pets, and they are more likely to agitate the snake. Calmly move them away from the danger so that you can safely deal with the snake.


If you suspect that your pet has been bitten, bring them to your local veterinarian or call National Animal Poison Control. There may be some redness, swelling, or bruising on your animal. If so, you should act quickly, as they may be at risk of further harm or death.

, Even if you have the smallest suspicion that you have a venomous snake on your property, you must avoid entering its proximity. You might not want to leave the snake completely alone, as it could travel to another place in your home, but you should not attempt to get close to it. If the snake is mobile, however, and you worry that your presence might provoke it, evacuate the area and call Animal Control.

, You shouldn't try to push the snake with the broom. Simply open the door and attempt guide it out softly. Because the snake's presence in your home is most likely completely accidental, it might be trying to get out itself.

, A heavy blanket or laundry hamper is best for this. If the snake is agitated, it will calm down soon after being covered. When it can't see you or its surroundings, the snake will feel less at risk.


Placing heavy objects around the edge of the blanket will prevent the snake from slipping out from underneath it and moving elsewhere. This will buy you some time to deal with it accordingly.

, If you're still not positive that the snake isn't venomous, do not, under any circumstance, attempt to move it. Be sure to wear some sort of hand protection, either gloves or oven mitts, before handling a snake. Approach the snake slowly, being careful not to scare it. The best way to hold a snake is directly under its belly, near the tail. Inch your hand underneath its body, keeping a solid, but not overly firm grip. You don't want to injure the snake by squeezing too hard. Let it slither in your hands a bit, as this will make it feel more comfortable. Walk it away from your property and release it safely into nature.
If you've trapped the snake under a blanket or other cloth material, you can scoop it up and transport it outside that way. Still be cautious about holding it too tightly, especially as you can't see its movement.

, This is the best solution, after you've restricted the snake, if you don't want to handle it yourself. They will safely catch and release it far from your property.

, If you cannot see the snake, but know that it is hiding in a dresser or other dark enclosed space, you should not attempt to catch it. Move all family members away from the immediate area. Because you can't see the snake, you have no idea if it's venomous. It may also currently be in a state of agitation.


If you come across a snake outside your property, you should also leave it alone. If the snake is not venomous, then it is of no real risk to you. It should find its way out of the yard on its own terms, and it's unlikely that you'll have to worry about its presence. If the snake is venomous, then you can quickly evacuate the area and get further removal help.
Never attempt to kill a snake. Most illegitimate bites happen when people try to kill a venomous snake.

, While having snakes on your property might be hard to avoid, you definitely don't want them entering your home again.Snakes like cool and dark places, so you should seal any entrances to your basement with diameters that are larger than a quarter inch in diameter.


They also could be entering through loose window frames or door sweeps, so you can make sure those are securely fastened. Any vents or drains that lead into your home can be covered with screening, so that the snakes cannot pass through.

, If you have birds in your backyard or a rodent problem in your home, you may be attracting snakes onto your property. It's often hard, however, to get rid of small mammals who are native to the area, especially those who are part of your ecosystem.

, Snakes love mice and rats. Because our buildings are made mainly out of timber, rodents often find shelter in the space between the exterior and interior walls. If you hear scratching noises or find evidence of mouse trails in your kitchen, get an expert to solve the problem. Remember, no mice, no snakes!


Leaving out your pet food can also attract mice which will, in turn, attract snakes. Cover up your pet food when they aren't eating, or bring the food inside
A mouse can easily get through a hole the size of a pencil. If there are holes in your walls, fill them immediately.High-pitched sound devices are now becoming a popular way to discourage vermin from entering homes; evidence shows some positive results. Remember, snakes always follow their food source.

, Whether or not you are attracting them intentionally, birds inhabiting your yard will attract snakes. Bird feeders will not only attract birds into your area, but also mice and rats, who will feed on any fallen seed.While snakes might not be interested in the seed itself, they will be interested in the animals that feed on it.


Natural bird repellents are rarely effective, and you don't want to be poisoning any birds or snakes in your area.If you want to remove birds from your yard, you should start by filling any vents or holes in your home that might attract them to roost.
Bird netting or sticky pads can repel certain species from setting up their nests in your yard. Scare tactics, such as audio recordings of their species in distress or predator decoys, can often be helpful. Just know that you'll have to cycle through a few options, as birds are intelligent and will adapt.

, If you're still having trouble keeping snakes away, you can prevent snakes from entering your yard by building a snake fence.Take a strong piece of steel and stick it the ground, flush to your fence. Angle it at 30 degrees, so the snake won't be able to scale it and enter your yard.


You might also want to consider trimming your grass or shrubs, as small predators like snakes love to hide in these shaded, overgrown areas.
Use mortared rocks instead of freely stacked stones, as snakes will hide within your rock walls.
If you're concerned about your children or pets, you can build a small fenced off area for them to play in, minimizing the risk of them coming across a snake.

White napkins are a classic choice here, but you can also use colored or patterned napkins. If using a patterned or colored napkin, begin with the pattern or colored side down.;
, Bring the right corner of the napkin over to the left corner and crease the fold.









Reinforce the fold by running your fingers along it. It is important to have a crisp line here.

, Unfold the napkin and turn it over, maintaining the diamond orientation with the center crease running between the top and bottom corners.








, For this fold, imagine the 90-degree angle of the bottom corner as divided into three 30-degree angles. You want to bring the right corner towards the left along a 30-degree line. Crease the fold that you've made.









It might help to imagine the new fold as pointing to a one o'clock position.

, Line up the left corner and edge with the right edge and crease the fold. Now you have folded the diamond in thirds.

Place something heavy on top of the folded napkin for one minute.,
Repeat Steps 1-4 on another napkin.,
Put the napkins together to make a heart.",How to Fold a Napkin Into a Swan2," If there is a design on one side, place that side facing down.









Note that you can use either a square or a rectangular napkin for this step.
Napkins of stiffer material may be easier to work with.

, Make the rolls relatively tight.









If you are using a rectangular napkin, make your rolls so that they run the long way.
To be sure that your rolls are equal halves, make a light crease through the center of the napkin for reference by folding it in half and unfolding. (If you're using a rectangular napkin, make the crease so that it runs the longer length of the cloth.)

,









Holding the napkin lengthwise in front of you, fold it about two-thirds of the way back on itself.
Next, take the part you've folded over and fold it back on itself once again, this time in half.

, A hardcover book or plate will do the trick.









When the minute is up, remove the weight.

, If you want to make a uniform swan heart, use a napkin with the same design. If you prefer to mix things up, choose a napkin with a different pattern or color.








, It may take a little time to figure out the right positioning for your swans to stay upright. If you're having trouble, try adjusting how much you bend their necks and where you place their heads together.









Keep in mind that very smooth table surfaces may cause the swans to slide away from one another; try to place them on a tablecloth, placemat, or other surface that offers a bit of friction.

Establish how many people you need to set the table for and decide what food you will serve.,
Have the necessary cutlery and tableware for each person.,
Decide if you are going all winter white or using an accent colour.,
Cover the table with a winter white tablecloth, preferably fabric.,
Add table mats, serving mats, and doilies (if you want to use these items).

,

Add place markers if desired so each person knows where they are to sit.",How to Set a Winter White Table," You must do this so that you can identify what you need to obtain and what you already have that you can utilize.;
, Each person will need at least:


One napkin
One glass
One knife
One fork
One spoon

, Choose whatever accent colour you like if you'd like to have an accent. If you don't want an accent colour, then remember that you will almost certainly have to add gold or silver for flatware, unless you can obtain white flatware. Some accent colours you may wish to consider are the following:


Red
Navy blue
Forest Green
Gold
Silver

, White is a popular colour for tablecloths; you shouldn't have too many issues finding one you like in a store or shop, or even online if you don't already have one. Thrift stores, second hand shops and charity shops might have interesting vintage or even antique table cloths. Your tablecloth doesn't have to be plain white fabric; you can use a damask cloth, a cloth with borderie anglaise edging, an embroidered cloth, or whatever you choose, as long as it's winter white. Make sure your chosen cloth is clean and pressed. If you want to economize, a very well-ironed white sheet folded in two may suffice.

,,, Ideally, these will match your tablecloth perfectly. Fold the napkins in a fancy way if you know how; if not, fold them into quarters. Consider napkin rings for your winter white table. Napkin rings can be a great way to introduce your accent colour or emphasize the winter white theme.


If you choose silver, gold or plain white napkin rings, consider tucking a sprig of holly or a small sprig of evergreen foliage into the napkin ring along with the napkin.
If you can't match your tablecloth exactly, then you could use napkins in your accent colour. This will look better than a pure white cloth and off-white napkins.

, Add side plates if they will be required. Be sure to place everything correctly, if you feel this is important; this means knives on the right, side plates on the left, cutlery for each course from the outside in, and so on.

, If appropriate, place a candelabra and candles on the table. Use white candles or use your accent colour. If you don't have candelabras, use candle sticks, candle holders, or even small glass jars. Your candles don't have to be tall; sometimes tall candles get in the way of dinner conversation, so utilize tea lights in appropriate holders if you prefer.

, Flowers are a common table centrepiece. White flowers with dark green foliage will add to your winter white theme. Flowers may not be considered wintery by everyone, so consider an arrangement of holly, ivy, evergreen foliage, etc. White Christmas decorations, such as baubles, can be arranged as a centrepiece.

, Add a water jug; a crystal jug would compliment the winter white theme. Don't put bottles of water on the table if you can avoid it; it looks a little tacky. Place a butter dish or two on the table if you are serving bread, and a bread basket or dish. If you wish, line your bread basket with a napkin.


Add a salt cellar, pepper grinder, and any other condiments required.
Put sauces into dishes or bowls; it's tacky to plonk the ketchup bottle on the table.
If you are having a tea party, remember the sugar bowl and milk jug.

, Add confetti sparkles to the table if you like that sort of thing. Drape winter white velvet or silk ribbon along or around the table or use your accent colour. Scatter petals, real or fake, on the table. Small dried leaves, fake leaves, or evergreen foliage can also be used. Beads, pearls, sequins and small crystals can all beautify a winter white table setting.

, These are another way to add your accent colour. Add markers to your guests' glasses if you like, in winter white or your accent colour.

Know where to put your fork when you are finished with a bite, and when you are finished with the meal.",How to Use a Fork1," Generally, you will use whichever hand is most comfortable to pick up and hold your fork. However, there are some cultural differences you should be aware of. The type of meal you are eating may also affect your choice of hand. Take a look at these tips to help you choose which hand to hold the fork in:Europeans tend to keep the fork in their left hand throughout a meal.
Americans will often hold the fork in their right hand while eating.
If you don't need to observe table etiquette, hold the fork in whichever hand is most comfortable.;
, Once you know which hand to pick the fork up with, you'll need to learn the proper way to hold it. Holding your fork properly will give you more control over it and allow you to observe good table manners. There are also two ways of holding your fork; the American method and the European style. Keep these steps in mind whenever you are picking up and holding a fork:To hold your fork in the European fashion, the end of the handle should be in the palm of your hand. Your pointer finger should be placed on the back of the fork, near the head of the fork. Your thumb will be placed on the outside edge of the fork handle. Grip the fork with the rest of your fingers, preventing it from dropping of shifting while in use. The tines of the fork should be pointing downwards in this style.
To hold your fork in the American style, pick the fork up like you would hold a pencil. Hold the fork between your index and middle fingers, near the joint where the fork head meets the handle. Your thumb will go on top of the handle, resting about halfway up. The points of the fork will be pointing upwards, allowing you to stab or scoop food. Hold it up close to the top.

, There are two different ways to hold your fork while cutting with a knife; the American method and the European method. Knowing which method to use can help you observe proper local etiquette, make a good impression and enjoy your meal.Europeans will hold their fork in the left hand and their knife in the right hand.
If you are eating in a European style dinner, do not switch hands during a meal. Always hold the fork in your left hand.
When Americans are cutting food they will hold the fork in their left hand and the knife in their right.
When Americans move to eat something with their fork, they switch hands and hold the fork in the right hand.

, You'll need to hold your food in place with the fork while cutting it. Pick up and hold the fork as you normally would, likely in your left hand. Place the prongs of the fork into the food you are cutting and hold it in place. With your opposite hand, pick up and hold knife in the same way you did with the fork and begin using it to cut your food.You'll be holding the fork in your left hand and the knife in your right hand.
The handles of your fork and knife should rest against the palm of the hand holding them.
The pointer fingers should be extended and will rest on the back side of your fork or knife.

, Once you've gotten a good handle on the fork, you can begin using it to eat. Find a piece of food that is a comfortable size to eat and bring the tines of the fork down into it. Apply just enough pressure to stick the food onto the tines of the fork. Make sure the food is secure and won't fall off the fork when you bring it towards your mouth.

, Once you feel the food is secure, you can bring it up to your mouth and begin eating it. Move slowly and carefully as you take the food off of the fork with your mouth. If you aren't paying attention, you might miss your mouth, drop the food, make a mess, or even stab yourself. Once the food is near your mouth, use your teeth to gently remove it from the fork and enjoy.

, You can let wait-staff know if you are done with your meal by placing your silverware in a specific position. Depending on how you put your silverware on your plate, you can indicate that you are still eating a dish or that you are ready to move onto the next. Keep these positions in mind when placing your silverware down between use:Americans will place their silverware at a ""10 and 20"" position. If the plate was a clock face, the points of the knife or fork will point to ""10 o'clock"", while the handle points to ""20 minutes"".
In America, place your fork in the center of the plate and your knife above it, leaving a gap between the two. Make sure they are both in the ""10 and 20"" position to indicate that you are still enjoying the current course.
When Americans are finished with a course, they remove the gap between their fork and knife, placing both in the upper right portion of their plates. Keep both the fork and knife in the ""10 and 20"" position.
Europeans will cross their knife and fork in the lower portion of the plate to indicate they are still eating the current course. The points of the fork and knife should be facing away from you.
In Europe, placing your utensils in the ""10 and 20"" position at the plate's center will indicate you are finished with that course.

Use 100 percent cotton.,
Prewash the fabric and dry in the dryer (since you should always be drying napkins in a dryer to kill all the germs that can accumulate on them).,
You'll need about a 1-1/4 yards of fabric for two napkins since these napkins are lined.,
Cut the fabric into pieces that are squares (fat quarters, as they call them in quilting circles) -- at lest 18 inches (45.7 cm) but can be as large as 22-1/2 inch squares.

,
Once you have a pile of at least 12 squares, with the wrong sides together, pin two fabrics together.,
Pin around all sides of the fabric, right sides together, but mark one side with a pin that is vertical -- that will be your signal to start and stop on that side.

,
Using about 12 stitches to the inch gauge, start about a third of the way down one side and sew around all the next three sides, pivoting at the corner, then sew down about a third of the way down the side you began sewing on.,
Trim the corners.

,
Now turn the napkin inside out, using a corner turner or a knitting needle (be careful if you use a needle, not to tear the corner), gently push the corners out.

,
Press the napkin, pulling the seams out to be sure the seam is on the edge.

,
Now top stitch a half-inch from the edge, all around the entire napkin.

,
Enjoy!

",How to Sew Cloth Napkins for Everyday Use," If you are on a budget, you can buy cotton curtains or cotton sheets and use them. Just make sure you wash them in hot water and dry in the dryer. Very important!;
, Press the fabric to remove any wrinkles.

, Why the lining? It helps keep the corners from curling, which helps you avoid ironing the napkins when they come out of the dryer!

,, Remember, they can all be coordinated but each napkin can have two different fabrics on it.

,, Your seam allowance should be slightly less than a half inch -- but more than a 1/4th of an inch.

Look at the forks on the table.,
Pay attention to which course or meal you are eating.,
Select the appropriate fork.",How to Use a Fork2," You may find that there are many different forks that have been set out before you at a dinner table. Each fork will have a specific use and time to use it during your meal. Knowing which fork to use and when to use it can be helpful, allowing you to enjoy your meal and make a good impression. Take a look at some of the different types of forks you might see: The largest fork is the dinner fork and it is used with the main course.
Salad forks are usually the smallest fork at your table setting.
Fish forks are slightly larger than the salad fork and slightly smaller than the dinner fork.
Oyster forks are unique, having only two prongs. This fork will be placed with the spoons.

, Each fork is provided for specific parts of a meal. Many of these forks will help you enjoy your meal, making it easier to pick the food up based on the fork's size and shape. Take a look at what type of food is being served to learn which fork you should be using.Generally, you will begin by using the fork on the outer left. Use the next fork to the right for each new course.
Each course will likely require you to switch which fork you are using.
If salad is being offered, make sure you are using the small salad fork.
For the main course, it's safe to use the largest dinner fork.

, Once you know which fork to use and when to use it, you can confidently make the right choice during a meal. Using the correct fork may seem like a small detail, but it can help make a good impression and allow you to demonstrate proper table etiquette. Always try to use the right fork during a meal. Remember to hold the fork properly.
Use your left hand to hold whichever fork is appropriate.
Pick the right fork for the right course.

Cut an empty toilet paper roll into thirds.You can also use a paper towel roll instead; in that case, cut the roll into rings as thin or as thick as you'd like.,
Hot glue the end of a long piece of jute string inside the cut toilet paper roll.,
Start wrapping the jute string around the cut toilet paper ring.,
Continue wrapping until the entire ring is covered, then glue the end of the string inside the napkin ring.,
Hot glue a rustic or natural decoration onto the top of the napkin ring.,
Let the glue set before using your napkin ring.",How to Make Napkin Rings1," Many people find a serrated bread knife the easiest for this, but you can also use a pair of scissors instead; be careful not to squish the roll too much.


Sometimes, toilet paper rolls will have little bits of paper stuck to them. Try to peel these off as best as you can.
For sturdier napkin rings, use the cardboard tube that comes inside a container of plastic wrap or aluminum foil.;
, If you don't have any hot glue, you can also use fabric glue instead, as it dries fairly quickly.As a last resort, you can also use tacky glue, but you'll need to hold the string in place using a paper clip or clothespin until the glue dries.You will need about 95 to 120 inches (2.413 to 3.048 meters) of jute string per napkin ring. You might find it easier to cut it in half first., Pull the string around the outer edge of the ring, then bring it through the center hole. Keep wrapping and winding the string, all the way around the ring. Gently push the loops of string against each other so that you don't see any gaps., If you have a lot of string left over, trim it until you have about an inch (2.54 centimeters) or so leftover, then tuck the excess inside the ring, and secure it with glue. At this point, you can also snip off any loose or fraying bits of string.If you cut your string in half, now is the time to cover up the other side of the ring!

, Starfish, sand dollars, and flat seashells work great for the rustic, seaside look. For a rustic, country look, try fake flowers instead.Flowers that go well with this rustic theme include mini sunflowers, daisies, and poppies.


You can also use fabric glue for this, but tacky glue is not recommended, as it will take too long to dry, and your decoration may slide off.

, If you used hot glue, this should only take a few seconds. If you used fabric glue, this may take several minutes.

Make a fork bracelet.,
Use a fork while baking or cooking.,
Plant seeds using a fork.",How to Use a Fork3," Making a fork bracelet can be a simple and enjoyable project. Many forks even feature interesting designs on them, which can help make a fashionable bracelet. Try using these easy steps to create your own fork bracelet:Use a fork to make a bracelet Find an old fork that you would like to use.
Bend the fork into a bracelet shape. Bend the fork in the same direction that the tines are already bending.
You may want to use pliers to get a better grip and more accurate bend.
The fork's tines should be touching the butt of the fork's handle when finished.
You can try painting the fork or decorating it however you want once it's bent into shape.

, Having a fork handy while baking and cooking is always a good idea. Some recipes will call for small holes to be made, to allow heat or air to escape. It can be fun to use a fork to make patterns in pie crust or frosting as well. Make sure you've always got a fork ready to help make cooking or baking a bit easier.


Drag or press the fork tines in frosting to create unique designs.
Pushing a fork into a pie crust or baked good can add a interesting look.
Some recipes call for small holes to be made to prevent too much heat from building up. You can lightly stab the item with the fork to make these holes.

, Forks can be a simple tool to use in the garden, especially when planting seeds. Many seeds are very small, requiring you to make tiny spaces for them in the dirt. A fork is a great way to quickly make great planting spaces for your seeds. The next time you need to plant small seeds, try using an old fork to help make the job a bit easier.


Forks with smaller tines are better suited to seed planting.
Stab the fork into the dirt to make small holes for the seeds.
Drop the seeds into the holes left by the fork tines and lightly cover them with dirt.
Check the requirements for each type of seed you are planting. Some seeds like to be planted deeper than others.

Cover a cardboard tube with wax paper, and secure it at both ends with rubber bands.,
Cut the burlap or lace ribbon.,
Wrap the ribbon around the cardboard tube, and secure it with two sewing pins.,
Apply Mod Podge, or a similar decoupage glue, over the fabric until it is completely saturated.,
Stand the cardboard tubes upright, and wait for the glue to dry.,
Take the napkin rings off of the cardboard tubes.,
Let the napkin rings finish drying, if necessary.,
Decorate the napkin rings further, if desired.",How to Make Napkin Rings2," You can use an empty paper towel tube or an empty toilet paper tube for this. The longer paper towel tube will allow you to make several napkin rings at one time, however.The wax paper will prevent the glue from sticking to the cardboard tube, and allow you to slide your finished napkin ring off easily.


You can also cut a piece of wax paper longer than the cardboard tube, wrap it around the tube, and then tuck the ends inside it., Choose some burlap or lace ribbon that is the same width as what you want the napkin rings to be. Wrap it around your cardboard tube, add ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and cut it.


If you absolutely cannot find burlap or lace ribbon, you can use regular or lace fabric instead. The edges will not be finished, however, and will give the napkin rings and even more rustic feel.

, Overlap the two ends by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then stick a sewing pin straight into the cardboard tube, at the top and bottom of the seam., Use a foam brush to do this, and focus especially on the seam. Be sure that the Mod Podge or decoupage that you are using has a matte finish., This will take about 4 to 5 hours.If you are having troubles getting the tubes to stand upright, you can place them over a narrow salt or pepper shaker, the top of a long-necked bottle, or even a paper towel holder.

, Pull off the rubber bands and remove the sewing pins. Slide the napkin rings off of the tube; don't worry if the wax paper comes with it. Carefully peel away the wax paper, if needed.


Do not get impatient with this step. The Mod Podge must be completely dry.

, Thicker materials, such as burlap, might still be a little damp inside. If this is the case, stand the napkin rings up right, and let them finish drying.For extra support, you might want to brush on an extra layer of Mod Podge or decoupage glue over the outside and inside seam.

, Once the napkin rings are completely dry, they are ready to use. You can also decorate them further, however. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Hot glue some small, silk or felt flowers to burlap napkin rings for a rustic/fall look.Hot glue a large jingle bell to a burlap napkin ring for a cozy cottage/winter look.
Wrap some thin, jute string around the middle of lace napkin rings for a country-chic touch, and tie it into a bow.Hot glue a pastel-colored silk rose or peony to a lace napkin ring for a vintage look. You could also add some pearl beading to the edges.

Prepare your flowers.,
Attach your largest flower first.,
Add your medium-sized bloom next.,
Continue taping your flowers around the napkin ring.,
Use your flower napkin rings.",How to Make Napkin Rings3," You can use fresh flowers or silk flowers for this. For the most unique and interesting looking napkin rings, choose a variety of sizes for your flowers, such as: fern, baby's breath, and rosebuds.

, You can use any type of metal or plastic ring for this—it just needs to be wide enough to hold your napkin. Curtain rings, shower curtain rings, and binder rings are all perfect for this.

, Pull or cut off any large leaves and trim the stems down to 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters). If you can, cut the flower stems at an angle.If you are using fake flowers, cut them using wire cutters. Some fake flowers have wires inside of them, which can ruin a pair of scissors.
Consider sorting your colors by size: small, medium, and large. You should have more small flowers than large ones.
Keep fresh flowers in a bowl of water to keep them fresh while you work.

, Hold the stem parallel against the ring. Wrap a piece of florist's tape around the ring, extending the tape just past the end of the stem.

, Position the flower so that the bloom is just next to the first one; the stem will be overlapping the first stem. Tape down this new flower in a similar fashion.

, Alternate between large and medium sizes. Be sure to include some greenery (such as ferns) and tiny flowers (such as baby's breath) for the most varied effect.

, If your event is still a few hours away, and you are using fresh flowers, mist the napkin rings with water, then store them in a cold room. The flowers will stay fresh for up to 4 hours."

Add your beads onto the memory wire.,
Use your round-nosed pliers to make another loop at the end of the wire.,
Add some charms, if desired, using jump rings.,
Use the napkin ring.",How to Make Napkin Rings4," Make sure that you are using a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters. Memory wire is very strong, and it can damage a more delicate pair of beading or jewelry wire cutters. Do not cut the three coils apart; this will make one napkin ring.

, Pinch the end of the memory wire with the tip of your pliers. Wrap the wire over the top of the pliers forming a loop. Make sure that you are bending the loop back towards the arch of the wire., You can use any type of beads you'd like. You can even play around with different shapes, sizes, and colors. For a more professional look, work in odd numbers for each design. For example, you could have three seed beads, and one large, brown bead, followed by three more blue seed beads. Leave about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) at the end of your wire bare, so that you can make the end loop.

, Pinch the end of the wire with your plies, and curl it in on itself to make a loop.

, Use a pair of pliers to open up a jump ring, then slip your desired charm onto it. Position the jump ring wherever you want it to be on the napkin ring (between two beads or at one of the end loops), then close it.


Open your jump ring by pulling the two ends past each other, like a door. Don't pull them away from each other by pulling on them.

, Roll or fold your napkin into a tube or rectangle, then wrap the napkin ring around the middle. If you'd like, you can gently fluff out each end of the napkin for a fancier look.

, Remember to use the 5 basic utensils of a dinner knife, salad fork, dinner fork, and a teaspoon. Formal dinner party settings will also include a soup spoon, dessert fork, dessert spoon, and a butter spreader.

, For a formal event set a small salad plate and soup bowl on top. Informal settings can omit either the salad plate or bowl, or both, depending on the courses you will serve.

, Lay your teaspoon next to the knife. The utensils should be placed longest to shortest from the plate and moving to the right. Utensil handles should point toward the edge of the table.

, Place the dinner fork next to the plate and then lay the salad fork to the left of that. The same rules apply for the heights of the utensils and the way the handles are pointing.

, Place a soup spoon in between your dinner knife and teaspoon on the right of the dinner plate. Lay your dessert fork above the dinner plate with the prongs pointing to the right. Parallel to that, moving toward the center of the table, you will place your dessert spoon with the bowl on the left. A bread and butter plate and butter knife can be placed just left of the dessert utensils.

Add your cleaning ingredients.,
Add boiling water to a pan.,
Add your silverware.,
Remove and buff your silverware.",How to Clean Silverware So It Sparkles1," Mix one teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of baking soda into a cup of hot water. These ingredients will react with the aluminum foil, which will help to clean and polish your silver.








Scale this recipe as needed. For example, if you have a larger piece of silverware, you may want to use 3 cups of water, in which case you should add 3 teaspoons each of baking soda and salt.
You can also add 1/2 cup of vinegar to the mixture for each cup of water. This will speed up the cleaning time.
Add the vinegar last, and be careful pouring it, as you will notice a reaction with the other ingredients.;
, To get started, boil some water. Then pour it into a pan that has been lined with aluminum foil. The aluminum foil is crucial to this process, so don't forget to line your container.








Make sure the pan is big enough to hold all of the silverware you want to clean. If you don't have a big enough pan, you can clean your silverware in several batches.
This process will cause the tarnish to leave the silver and stick to the aluminum in the foil. To avoid tarnishing your pan, you may want to avoid using an aluminum one.

, Once your solution is ready, place your silverware in the pan. Make sure that each piece of silverware is touching the aluminum foil and that no two pieces are overlapping.Avoid placing any silverware that has other materials (including other metals or stones) in this solution unless you have confirmed that this is a safe cleaning methods for those materials as well.
Do not place antique silver knives in this solution, as many are held together with glue, and the solution may dissolve the glue., Depending on how tarnished your silverware is, you will want to let it soak for between 30 seconds and several minutes. Once it appears clean, remove each piece and use a clean rag to buff it.

, This method will require a little bit of patience, but it will be worth the wait. Let your silverware sit in the baking soda or borax for at least 30 minutes. Letting it sit for this long will give the cleaning agents time to do the hard work, so you won't have to do as much scrubbing., Once you have let your silverware sit for 30 minutes, use a damp cloth or sponge to scrub the baking soda or borax into the silver. Then rinse off each piece and buff with a dry cloth. Your silver should be sparkling clean!


You should not have to scrub vigorously, as the dirt and stains should already be loosened. A light touch will do the trick.

Choose your preferred cleaning agent.,
Scrub your silverware with the paste.,
Rinse and buff your silverware.",How to Clean Silverware So It Sparkles3," For this method, you can use either toothpaste or a mixture of baking soda and water. Both should give you great results in a short amount of time.If you use baking soda, combine three parts baking soda and one part water to create a paste. You want a consistency that is similar to that of toothpaste. If it is too thin, add more baking soda. If it is too dry, add more water., Apply a dab of your chosen cleaning paste to a soft cloth. Then use it to scrub each piece of silver. Be sure to scrub all areas of your silverware equally to achieve have a nice, even finish.You may have to rub a bit vigorously, especially if your silver is very tarnished.
If this method does not seem to be working, try allowing the paste to sit on the silverware for several minutes before you begin scrubbing again.

Root out some cool cutlery.,
Determine what each piece of cutlery could be turned into by way of hooks.",How to Make Hooks and Hangers from Old Cutlery1," Check your drawers for lonely pieces of cutlery or silverware or use spares from sets that have many pieces. If you don't have interesting designs at home, rummage through the sales bins in department stores or kitchenware outlets. For even more fun though, try antique, thrift and used item stores for older, more eclectic finds––in fact, these utensils will often have a range of lovely patterns and embossing that will add flair to your home décor. Another place to look for interesting cutlery is online; check out auction sites and sites like Freecycle. When choosing cutlery, here are some key things to bear in mind:


The cutlery must be all metal––plastic, semi-plastic, wooden or other breakable/non-bendable cutlery won't work.
Use cutlery in good condition. Avoid using pieces that are flaking or badly stained. They risk detracting from your décor.
If the cutlery appears weak, use if for a different craft purpose. The cutlery needs to withstand being bent into its new shape.
If you're planning a row of hooks (such as for a coat hanging space), varied patterns can look just as elegant as matching ones. In fact, the designs may prove more interesting mixed up.
Weave a story into the cutlery you choose. For example, instead of allowing your grandmother’s old set of cutlery to gather dust in storage, use those pieces (perhaps with your family’s permission) to become your hanger art.;
, The size and sturdiness of the cutlery will determine the viability of its end hook purpose. For example, teaspoons should only hold light items, such as keys, baby bonnets or the dog's leash. On the other hand, full size forks and spoons may be able to take the weight of a coat or bag, depending on how you attach them. To choose one of the mounting methods suggested below, match the cutlery to the method. Of course, you're also free to experiment with your own approach to making hooks.

"
"
Wear appropriate protective gear when bending and drilling the cutlery.,
Choose good tools to work with.",How to Make Hooks and Hangers from Old Cutlery2," You're dealing with metal and if it is placed under stress and a part of it flings eye-ward, you risk losing an eye. It is recommended that you wear eye protection (goggles or safety glasses) and also gloves when manipulating and drilling the cutlery.

, The tools needed are basic:


Bending the cutlery: In some cases, you'll be able to bend the cutlery with your own strength. In other cases, you'll need the help of another item to apply pressure. Items that might help you complete the projects include: a vise and rubber mallet or hammer; piers, channel locks, or a vice grips; an anvil; fishing wire; and screws.
The drill: The drill and bit should be suitable for drilling through metal––some drill bits are designed specifically to do this or are combination bits for both wood and metal. Ask to borrow one from a friend if you don't have one already.
Wire cutters: In some cases, these may come in handy.
Vice grips: This might be handy to help hold the cutlery piece in place for bending.
Screws: For attaching to the wall, wood or other object used.
Liquid nails (industrial strength glue): If you don't want to deal with drilling holes, try liquid nails. This might be strong enough to attach the cutlery hooks to a variety of surfaces––be sure to check the product instructions first.

, Bend the hand from around the middle to form a slight U-shape hook. Keep the hook slightly facing outward––don't press too far back toward the cutlery.


Whether you bend toward the front of the fork or spoon, or away from it, will depend on your preference for the final look, as well as whether the base of the cutlery has a monogram you'd like to show. If you bend to face the front of the spoon or fork, a monogram at the base of the handle will be hidden, whereas if you bend the hook toward the back of the fork or spoon, the monogram will show up clearly on the outside of the hook. This is much better where you want the monogram to feature.

, The hooks should be located for ease of use, such as near the stove, above a work space, over the sink, etc.

,, Attach each utensil hook with a screw. (Or use liquid nails if you're not drilling.)

Boil two eggs.,
Wash the silver pieces.,
Place the eggs in a plastic baggie.,
Mash the eggs.,
Add your silver pieces to the bag.,
Allow the pieces to set for several hours.,
Remove and clean the silver.",How to Put an Antique Finish on Your New Silver1," For one piece of jewelry, you will need two boiled eggs. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil, then carefully add your two eggs. Boil the eggs for 10 minutes before removing them from the heat source.If you are going to be finishing a large piece or multiple pieces of silver, you will need more eggs.
Set the eggs aside to cool. You can pour out most of the boiling water and add cool water to speed the process.;
, Use liquid dish soap and water to clean the pieces you will be antiquing. Gently scrub them with your fingertips before rinsing away the soap. Dry your silver pieces well to make sure that there is no lingering water in the crevices of the silver.The purpose of washing the pieces is to remove oils that can prevent the silver from oxidizing.
After you wash the pieces, it’s better to wear gloves so that you won’t get finger oils on the silver.

, Choose a sealable plastic bag that is large enough to hold both the eggs and the silver pieces you want to finish. Without peeling your eggs, add them to the bag, leaving enough room for the eggs to move around some. Ideally, the eggs should not be piled on top of each other because that will make it hard for you to mash them.If you have a lot of eggs because you are doing multiple pieces, then you can use more than one bag.
If your silver piece will not fit in a bag, mash the eggs, then add them to a larger container that fits your item.

, Use your hands to press the eggs, causing them to break up into small pieces. Eggs naturally contain sulfur, which will oxidize the silver. The more you press the eggs, the more sulfur you will release, meaning that the process will work more effectively., Place the items in the bag and make sure that they are fully covered with egg. You can roll the silver around in the egg or fold the bag so that the eggs are mashed against the silver., While you will start to see a color change after about 15 minutes, your piece will likely need to set for 5-8 hours, depending on your color preferences. If you just want a light antique finish, then the time will be shorter. For best results, check regularly to see if the color matches your desires.Don’t forget about your silver. If you leave it in the eggs for too long, then it may be damaged.

, Knock off the pieces of egg that are stuck to your silver, then wipe it with a clean cloth or napkin. Thoroughly wash the jewelry with soap and water, making sure that all traces of the egg are gone. If you have egg left on your piece, it will start to smell.You can use a toothpick to remove bits of egg from crevices.
Dry the silver once it’s completely clean.

Continue to dip and check until you reach your desired color.,
Mix baking soda into water to create a neutralizing bath.,
Dip your piece into the neutralizing bath.,
Rub baking soda onto the high points of the silver.",How to Put an Antique Finish on Your New Silver2," Mix liquid detergent and a few drops of ammonia into a bowl of hot water. Immerse your silver and scrub away any dirt, oil, or residue that may be on the item. Use a soft bristle brush, such as a toothbrush, to work in the cleaning solution.If you don’t have ammonia, you can still wash your item with just liquid detergent., Add two cups (.5 liters) of water to a large bowl or container. Add ¼ teaspoon (1.25 milliliters) of patina gel to the water. Stir until the mixture is a pale yellow.


A darker yellow solution will work faster, but a quick finish will not be as strong. It’s better to allow your piece to treat for longer in a weaker solution.You can purchase liver sulfur patina gel at craft supply stores or through online retailers.

, Don’t immerse your item. Instead, dip the piece into the solution then pull it out after a few seconds. The patina gel will work quickly. After you dip, check the color to see if it is your preferred finish.Wear rubber gloves while you dip the silver to protect your skin.

, You may need to dip the piece several times to reach your preferred shade, but don’t be tempted to rush the process by immersing it because a rushed process can result in an uneven or damaged finish. Only leave it in the solution for a few seconds at a time.Additionally, allowing the item to oxidize for too long can cause pitting., Your neutralizing bath should contain water and a small amount of baking soda. Sprinkle a few pinches of baking soda over the water, and then stir it. You don’t need much baking soda to create your solution., You need to neutralize the patina gel or it will continue to darken your item even after you have removed it from the solution. The baking soda in your neutralizing bath will deactivate the sulfur, stopping the oxidation process. Dip the piece for a few seconds, then remove it to check the finish.Don’t allow your items to soak, as this could remove the finish you just added.

, If you want your piece to look natural, remove the finish from the high spots. Rub a small amount of baking soda onto the raised areas of your piece to restore the polish to those areas. This will make your antique finish look more natural.If you want a more consistent color or are happy with the look of your piece, you can skip this step.

Place the glass jar or piece of glass in your freezer.,
Let the wax contract for at least an hour.,
Use a table knife to remove the wax from the glass jar.,
Swab the glass to remove any wax remnants.",How to Remove Wax from Glass1," Freezing works best for small votive holders or candle jars. Once your candle has cooled to normal room temperature, place it in the freezer.









If you put it in when it's too hot, you'll risk cracking the glass from too quick of a temperature shift. Make sure the glass is cool to the touch before you freeze it.;
, As the wax and glass begin to freeze, the wax will begin to contract and separate from the sides of the glass, pulling away and making it much easier to remove.







, Remove the glass from the freezer after an hour has passed and try to tap the wax out on the palm of your hand. Use your finger or a dull knife to scrape and remove the remaining wax from the glass.








, Remove any small remaining pieces of wax residue using a cotton ball or cotton swab soaked in baby oil or vinegar.Rubbing with a slightly damp paper-towel can be just as effective. It might take some elbow-grease, but it should come up.

Boil some water.,
Cut up the wax to loosen it.,
Pour the boiling hot water into the glass jar or votive that contains the wax.,
Let the wax cool.,
Remove the wax from the water using your fingers.,
Clean the jar of any wax remnants.",How to Remove Wax from Glass2," Bring a pot of water to boiling using the stove or microwave while you prepare the wax. The water doesn't need to be at a rolling boil, just hot enough to melt the wax. Imagine you were heating up water for a cup of tea that you wanted to drink very soon.









Alternatively, you could heat the jar while you're doing the dishes. Run some water and get it as hot as you can stand, then soak the jar for a while at the bottom of the sink.

, Use an old knife to cut a series of slits into any large chunks of wax that remain in the glass from which you want the wax removed.








Alternately, you can use a fork to separate smaller chunks of wax, or skip this step completely if only a thin coating of wax or residue remains in the glass., The wax should immediately begin to liquefy, and start to float toward the surface of the water.








, Allow the water and wax mixture to cool off for between 15 and 20 minutes. During this time period, the wax will begin to harden slightly on the surface of the water, making it easy to remove.








, If there are any remaining pieces of wax stuck to the glass, use the knife to gently pry them from the glass. They should be soft and pliable, making the job much easier.








, Soak a scrub sponge in hot water and wring out the sponge until it becomes damp. Then use it to clean out the jar, removing stray wax. You could also dampen and use a paper towel in place of a sponge.

Find the proper scraping tool.,
Loosen the wax with some damp heat.,
Carefully loosen the wax with your scraper.,
Wipe down the glass.",How to Remove Wax from Glass3," Ideal for the job is a sharp razor blade or window scraper to gently remove wax from a flat surface, such as a glass table top. These are more ideal than a pocket-knife or other rounded blade that might scratch the glass. You want to be very gentle if you try to scrape the wax off a surface that you're unable to heat or wipe.








, Soak a sponge in some very hot water and try to moisten the wax and loosen it slightly before you go at it with the scraper. You might even be able to wipe it off completely, making scrapes unnecessary.








, Focus on using soft, gentle strokes to prevent the razor blade from slipping, and to also prevent the blade or scraper from leaving scratches on the glass surface. Continue to scrape until all wax residue has been removed from the glass surface.








, Use a damp, warm cloth to remove any small amounts of wax residue that have been left behind, cleaning it thoroughly. It's easy to leave behind a waxy or cloudy residue, making the wipe-down particularly important.









Alternately, you can spray glass cleaning solution on the wax and clean off using a paper towel or soft rag. It might take several passes before you get it up completely. Be diligent!

Pick the color of your sailboat.,
Find a square napkin to use.,
Lay your napkin flat on a surface.,
Use an iron on your napkin.,
Decide on your type of fold.",How to Fold a Napkin Like a Boat1," You will want a napkin that has a darker tone, like a brown, if you want to replicate the look of a sailboat. However, you can also use whatever color napkin you have. This would be the best time to also decide whether you want a double-sided napkin. Your napkin should be colored on both sides, rather than just the outside.


Paper napkins are great for birthday parties, while cotton and linen napkins allow for a more professional look (hotels, restaurants, etc.).;
, A 20X20 inch napkin is the ideal size for your sailboat. Naturally, the bigger the napkin the bigger the boat. Your napkin should not be too thick, otherwise you will not be able to fold it properly. If you cannot find a perfectly square napkin, try one that is as close to square as you can get it. This extra half an inch or so will even allow you to make the folds easier.Another great option is to cut your napkin to a square size. However, you want to make sure to not leave any frayed edges when you do so. This is better for paper napkins, rather than nice family napkins used for holiday dinners.

, First clean the surface with a duster and/or glass cleaner. This will prevent your napkin from becoming stained. You can put it on a table, a desk, or a nightstand. Do not lay it on soft surfaces otherwise it will be hard to make the folds., This would be the best time to get out any excess wrinkles that might make your sailboat look bad. Only use an iron if you are using a cloth napkin. Do NOT iron a paper napkin. Use an iron on low, and gently press against the napkin. Make sure to get both sides.

, There are three different types of sailboat napkin folds: wind-drawn sailboat (upright), the stable sailboat (flat), and the party sailboat (upright). A wind-drawn sail is more for formal occasions like a dinner date. The stable sail can be used for any occasion, but typically formal. The party sail is mostly for festive, informal occasions. Check what event you are planning, and how each of the sailboats matches up.

Separate the bottom folds.",How to Fold a Napkin Like a Boat2," Start with the napkin facing you in the square position. Make sure that your napkin is open and flat before you begin your fold. Apply pressure with your hand if you would like a more crisp look to your sailboat. A tight fold will also allow the use of more fabric in your sailboat., Make sure when you make this fold, the open edges are towards your body. Pull the corner all the way down until it is about one inch from the bottom edge. This should create a right angle. Apply pressure to the fold with your hand for a more crisp look., Fold it all the way to the left. Make sure the corner of the flap is flush, and even, with the corner you press it against. Press your hand against the fold to create a crisp crease., Pull the corner from left to right. Make sure the edge lines up nice and smooth. Crease the fold with your hand. If the fabric becomes too thick to crease, use a heavy object like a paperweight to make the fold. If you prefer a more ""fluid"" sail, don't crease the fold. There should be 1/2-1 inch of excess fabric left at the bottom of your napkin, after you complete this fold., You will want to make sure that you fold it upwards at least 2 inches (5.1 cm). This flap will form the boat in your sailboat. Adjust this fold upwards or downwards if you want a smaller or larger boat., There are two major folds of fabric, both of which have been lifted up 2 inches (5.1 cm). The flap away from the ""sail"" you want to separate away from the flap closest to the ""sail."" Use your thumb and fold one of the flaps upwards. Take the other flap and fold it backwards.

Crease the fold with your hand, or a heavy object like a paperweight. Then turn the napkin around, so the fold is facing downwards., Take the left corner with your hand and fold it down. Do this until you have a straight edge running down the middle. Note: you are not folding it left to right, but down. Do this until there is about one inch of fabric left at the bottom. Crease the fold you have made with your hands., Take the right corner and fold it down. Do this until you have a straight edge in the middle. You should now have two edges in the middle (from the left and right folds) that are basically touching each other. Crease the fold with your hand or a paperweight., Pull the bottom left flap upwards. Do this until the top flap meets the bottom fold. Now do the same with the bottom right fold. Lift it up until the top right flap meets the bottom fold. Crease both folds with either your hand or a heavy object., This will create the ""boat"" part of the sailboat. Pull up the bottom edge as much as you would like, depending on the size of the boat and/or sail you want. Once this is done, lay the napkin on a plate."

If you have a rectangular napkin, feel free to use that. If not, take the left edge of your square napkin, and fold it until the edge reaches the middle. Take the right edge, and fold it until the edge hits the middle. Crease both folds with your hands.After you have folded, open the napkin back up. You should have 4 sections. Cut off one of the outside sections and you are ready to begin.

, Position the napkin so that the top and edges are the small sides of the rectangle. Fold down the top edge until it meets the bottom edge. Crease the fold with either your hand or a small, heavy object like a paperweight., You can do one at a time, or both at once. Fold them towards the middle, until the two corners meet. Make sure the two edges of the flaps are flush with one another. Finally, crease the folds with your hand or a paperweight., There should be two bottom flaps. Lift the top flap up until you are covering about half of the triangle. Flip your napkin over, and flip up the other bottom flap the same way. Crease both of these folds again, with either your hand of a heavy object., On each of the flaps you just folded up, are two corners, totaling four. Use your finger to poke in each of these corners. When you get done with all four, lay the flaps back down. Poke the corners in even more to make sure the edges of the poked in corners line up. You should now be left with what looks like a triangle., After you do this, grab the two sharp corners and pinch them together. While holding the corners together, press down on the rest of the napkin. Give the new edges a crease with your hands or a heavy object. You should now be left with what looks like a diamond., The bottom corner is the corner with the two flaps, not the one that is simply a flat corner. Fold one of the bottom corners up, until you form a triangle. Flip the diamond around, and lift up the other bottom corner. You should now be left with what looks like a small hat (triangle)., Just like you did before, open up the triangle, and pinch together the two sharp corners. Flatten out the rest of the napkin while you are pinching the corners. You are now left with a diamond shape again., Slowly pull them open. Tape the corners together to maintain the sturdiness of your boat. You now have a napkin party sailboat. You can just lay them out as they are, or add in chips/candy into the open area of the boat."

Aside from a few specific napkin types, serviettes are almost always perfect squares. Cocktail napkins are generally too small to fold, but most other napkins will be large enough for most fancy serviette folds.


Cocktail napkins are usually six to 9 inches square (15 to 23 cm).Tea, luncheon, and hors d’oeuvre napkins are between 12 and 16 inches square (30 to 41 cm).
Lunch, buffet, and informal dinner napkins range from 18 to 24 inches square (46 to 61 cm).Serviettes for formal or multiple course meals generally range between 22 and 26 inches square (56 to 66 cm).;
, Wash your serviettes in the washing machine or by hand with a mild detergent. When they are clean, wring out your serviettes, but don’t worry about drying them.


Do not use fabric softener on serviettes you’re going to starch.
Don’t worry about laundering and starching your serviettes if you are using disposable paper napkins.

, Dissolve two tablespoons of laundry starch in some cold water. Pour two pints (946 ml) of freshly boiled water into a clean sink, laundry tub, or large bowl. Add an additional two pints of cold water and mix in the dissolved starch. Stir to combine.Soak each serviette in the starchy water, making sure to saturate each one. Wring out the serviettes to remove as much excess water as possible.
Hang the serviettes to dry, but remove them from the line when they are still a little damp.

, Open your ironing board and preheat your iron. Use the proper setting based on your serviette fabric. When the serviettes are still slightly damp, press each one individually to remove all creases and wrinkles. Store flat until you are ready to fold them.

, On a large, flat surface, lay out a square serviette. Position it so it’s in a diamond orientation with the bottom corner facing you. Fold the left corner to the middle. Fold the right corner to the middle so the two corner points are touching.Finally, fold up the bottom corner so that it covers the two corners in the center like an open envelope.
Place cutlery inside the open envelope.

, Lay your serviette flat. Fold it in half on the diagonal and orient it so the fold is the closest edge to you and the point is away from you. Fold up the right half diagonally so the bottom right corner meets the top point of the triangle. Repeat on the left side. Your serviette should now be a square again (oriented like a diamond) with a seam down the middle.Turn the napkin over, keeping the open corners at the top. Fold the napkin in half to bring the top point to the bottom point.
Turn the napkin over again with it oriented the same way, with the tip of the triangle facing you.
Use the center pleat to fold the napkin in half and stand it up.

, Fold a napkin in half twice to create a smaller square. Position the napkin with the open corner at the top left-hand side. Fold the top layer back to the bottom right-hand corner in a diagonal fashion. Flip the entire serviette over so the open corner is in the top right. Then:Use your eye and divide the serviette into thirds. Fold the right third of the serviette back, then fold the left third over top of that.
Tuck the bottom right corner of the napkin into the diagonal fold.
Flip the napkin over and insert the cutlery into the diagonal pouch.

, You need two napkins for this one: one in green and the other in any color you choose (say, red, for instance). The green serviette will create the leaves, while the red one will create the flower itself.Fold the green serviette in half diagonally. Fold it in half diagonally again. Set it aside.
Fold the red serviette in half diagonally. Position it so the point is facing you, and the fold is the farthest side from you. Fold the pointed end over so it extends about an inch beyond the fold. Fold the bottom edge over as well, but only fold it so it comes within an inch of the fold. Start at one end and roll the napkin up into a cylinder.
Take the green napkin and position it so the point is facing you. Open the second fold of the green serviette to place the rose in the middle, making sure the top of the rose extends above the folded edge of the green napkin. Refold the green serviette back over the rose. Place the two serviettes together in a glass and drape the green serviette over the sides of the glass.

, Fold a napkin in half to create a rectangle, and then fold it in half again into a smaller rectangle. Fold the serviette in half lengthwise, and lay it on a flat surface with the folded side on the left. Place a fork in the center of the serviette, perpendicular to the napkin. Bring the open end of the serviette over the fork and pull it through the loop created by the fold, tying the fork in the bow., Fold the serviette in half twice to create a smaller square. Position it so the open corners are in the bottom right-hand side. Take the first layer from the bottom right and fold it back diagonally to match up with the top left corner.Peel the next layer from the bottom right and fold it diagonally as well, but leave a one-inch gap between the corner and the top left corner, so the layers will be staggered.
Repeat this process with the third layer, leaving a one-inch gap between it and the previous layer.
Finally, fold the last layer over as well, leaving the one-inch gap.
Carefully turn the serviette over and fold the bottom two corners in toward the center to make the serviette into a diamond shape. Fold it over again and lay it down.

, Fold the napkin in half into a rectangle and lay it down so it faces you widthwise (with one of the shorter edges nearest you). Fold up the bottom inch of fabric. Then, fold that one-inch fold back underneath itself. Continue folding the serviette back and forth on itself in an accordion style. Leave three to four inches unfolded when you get to the top.Turn the napkin over and fold it in half lengthwise. Take the two open corners from the unfolded napkin and fold them diagonally to the accordion folds. Tuck the corners into the pocket between the two layers of accordion folds.
Pick up the napkin by holding the open ends of the folds together and place the other end on the table. Spread open the accordion folds to create the fan.

, Fold the serviette in half twice to create a smaller square. Position it in a diamond orientation with the open corners at the tip of the diamond (and the folds nearest you). Fold the top layer down in half, bringing the top tip down to match the bottom tip.Fold the next two layers down in a staggered fashion like you did with the diamond fold. Leave the last layer unfolded.
Fold the sides of the diamond in to the center. Flip the serviette over. Place utensils in the pouch.

, Fold the serviette in half diagonally and point the open tip toward you. Fold the tip over so it overhangs the original fold by an inch (like with the rose). In a lengthwise fashion, accordion fold then entire serviette.Hold on to all the layers at the base of the accordion and place the base of the serviette in a glass. Fan out the top of the folds so they extend over the sides of the glass.

, Follow the first few steps of the pyramid: fold the serviette in half diagonally with the tip facing away from you. Fold the left and right sides in to the center to create a square shape with a seam down the middle. Flip the napkin over with the bottom tip facing you (and the open tips facing away).Fold up the bottom third of the napkin. Flip the napkin over again. Fold the left side diagonally to the center and a little beyond. Fold the right side in a similar fashion, slightly overlapping the left side in the middle.
Turn the serviette back over.

, Follow the same first steps as the cone to create a square shape with a seam down the middle. With the open tips pointing up and away from you, fold up the bottom three-quarters of the napkin.On the flap you just folded up, now fold the top tip back down over itself so the tip meets the center of the bottom fold.
At the very tip of the serviette, fold down the top third of the right and left flaps and tuck them behind the first flap.
Turn the napkin over. Fold the left third of the napkin, followed by the right third. Tuck the tip of the right flap inside the pouch of the left flap to secure it in place, and turn the napkin over.

Understand how glass responds to heat.,
Heat the outer glass.,
Cool the inner glass.,
Try using a bowl of hot water.,
Gently pull the glasses apart.",How to Separate Stuck Glasses1," Most commonly, glasses get stuck together when they are stacked immediately after they are washed. Glass expands when heated, and contracts as it cools, and this is sufficient to stick glasses together in some cases.Never fear: you can use this to separate the glasses. You will need to cool the inner glass and heat the outer glass in order to free them from each other.


To avoid this problem in the future, be more careful about stacking glasses. Let glasses cool before you stack them. If you wash with cold water, this should not be a problem.;
, This method carries some risk, so you should use it with care. Since the outer glass is the one that has shrunk around the inner glass, this one needs to expand to allow the inner glass to slip away. Gently heat the outer glass by running it under the hot tap for a minute or so. With any luck, the glasses should come unstuck. If not, you may wish to consider cooling the inner glass, by filling it from the cold tap.


Avoid using ice or boiling water. The sudden change in temperature could cause one or both glasses to shatter violently, which could be very dangerous. The glass is already under compression, making the situation especially risky.

, If you cannot free the glasses by simply heating the outer glass, try to cool the inner glass. The outer glass will expand, and the inner glass will contract.

, First, fill the top glass with cold water. Then, fill a shallow bowl with hot water and bathe the base of the bottom glass into the heat. Let the glasses sit like this for a few minutes, then try to pull them apart., The temperature difference should separate the glasses. Hold the glasses firmly, with one hand on the bottom of the bottom of the outer glass and one hand encircling the rim of the inner glass. Twist and tilt the glasses, and gently tug them apart.


If the glasses won't come unstuck, try giving them more time to expand and contract. Leave the bottom glass to sit in the bowl of hot water. Try again a few minutes later.

Sort the glasses.,
Rub the lipstick smudges with salt.,
Wash the glasses as usual, whether by hand or in the dishwasher.",How to Remove Lipstick from Glassware," Put those with lipstick marks to one side. These will need special attention before washing them.;
, The salt will remove the lipstick stain from the glass without much effort. You can wear gloves if you don't want lipstick on your hands.

, You don't need to brush off the salt; it will come off as part of the washing process.

"
"
Try to twist or tilt the glasses apart.,
Be gentle.,
Consider breaking one of the glasses.,
Try blowing air between the glasses.",How to Separate Stuck Glasses2," Any given glass is unlikely to be perfectly round, so the upper glass may only be ""pinched"" between two points in the lower glass. If there is movement when you tilt the glass, you're in luck, and detaching them will be far simpler.

, Remember not to apply excessive force. If you are too rough, you might shatter one or both of the glasses. If the glasses come unstuck unexpectedly, they might slip or shoot out of your hands.


Make sure that you have a firm grip on each glass. Dry the glasses before you begin, and dry your hands. If your hands slip, the glass might fall and shatter!

, If you absolutely cannot get the glasses unstuck, breaking one may keep you from losing both. Place the glass on a solid, easy-to-clean surface, or hold the base carefully in your hand. Tap the outer glass gently with a hammer, on the rim, until it cracks. There is a risk that you might break both glasses – but this can be a great last-ditch effort.


Afterward, be sure to gather all shards of broken glass. Safety first!

, Sometimes, there is a thin layer of water between the glasses that keeps them stuck. Try squeezing a straw between the two glasses, then blowing in. A small amount of air should suffice. However try blowing in as much air as you can because the straw is being squeezed,

"
"
Apply light lubrication.,
Pour the oil between the glasses.,
Twist the glasses apart.",How to Separate Stuck Glasses3," If the glasses are stubborn, and you're making no progress by simply tilting/twisting the glasses apart, the next step is to apply some light lubrication. A bit of olive or sunflower oil may do the trick. Try using soap. This is especially effective if the glasses are ""pinched"" together, rather than stuck fast.


Consider using the oil method in conjunction with the heating method. This may be effective on especially stubborn glasses.
Try using WD-40 oil as a last-ditch resort. Spray it between the glass. The oil should spread thoroughly by itself, and it should be relatively easy to pull the glasses away from each other. Make sure to wash the glasses thoroughly after doing this: WD-40 is toxic to humans.

, Work the oil into the pinch point by gently tilting the upper glass back and forth. As you rock the glasses, the oil may loosen them up enough that they come apart. Wet the glasses so spread the lubricant around.


Try using some kind of thin drinking straw or a knife to push the liquid in thoroughly. Be gentle!

, When you think they are lubricated enough, grab the inner glass with your dominant hand and the outer glass with your other hand. Twist the glasses in opposite directions to loosen the grip. At the same time, pull them apart with a lesser force. Focus on trying to twist it more than pulling it. If the twisting works, the glass should come off by itself.


Don't try to pull the glasses straight off! The force needed to grip the glass could break the glass itself.

Wrap the decanter in a hot washcloth.,
Drip hot water into the decanter.,
Submerge the entire decanter in hot water.",How to Remove a Stuck Glass Decanter Stopper1," Wet a washcloth in hot water and wrap it around the decanter’s neck. This can slightly expand the decanter to release the stopper.


Wait five or ten minutes to allow the heat from the washcloth to transfer to the glass.
Remove the washcloth and gently attempt to remove the stopper. You can tap lightly with a wooden spoon on the sides to loosen it.;
, If possible, allow some hot water to drip in between the stopper and decanter. This should warm and dissolve anything built up between the two.


Try this if the stopper is small and recessed enough into your decanter to allow you access to drip water into the space. If it is not, you can run hot water over the entire area to loosen it.
Gently tap the sides of the stopper with a wooden spoon to loosen it. Do not use a metal spoon or other metal object, as it may break the glass., Fill a sink or other vessel large enough to cover your decanter with water. Allow your decanter to soak in the water for several minutes.


Keep the decanter in the hot water for about 10 minutes. Add more hot water if it becomes cool. You can even let it soak overnight if it doesn’t come loose.Remove the decanter from the water and attempt to remove the stopper. Tap gently with a wooden spoon at the sides of the stopper to loosen it.

Soak the glass object and sticker in hot soapy water.,
Remove the sticker.",How to Remove a Sticker from Glass1," A good 10 to 30 minute soak should help soften the paper or vinyl of the sticker and make it easy to remove with your fingers.


The water and soap helps dissolve the glue and break its bond with the glass.
If you can't soak your glass object in water, soak a hot wet washcloth or sponge and dampen the sticker area.;
, Use your fingers to gently lift the sticker off or use a dull knife to scrape off the sticker by gently prying a corner of the sticker off, then wedging the blade between the sticker and glass until it is completely removed.


Be sure to pick a knife that is dull and not sharp to touch. Dull knives have been through wear and tear so when you use it on a glass surface, you won't run the risk of scratching the surface.
Alternatively, you can purchase a razor scraper that is designed to remove adhesives off surfaces.

Heat vegetable oil.,
Drip oil between the decanter and stopper.,
Gently attempt to remove the stopper.",How to Remove a Stuck Glass Decanter Stopper2," Warm up vegetable oil, olive oil, or coconut oil on the stove or microwave for use in unsticking your decanter stopper.


You only need to use a small amount of oil. Heat it to a temperature that is comfortable to the touch.

, Use your heated oil to drip a small amount in between the glass of the decanter and the stopper. This should warm and loosen any particles or residue that cause sticking.


Try using a medicine dropper to pour the oil more precisely into the small gap, or pour the oil liberally over the area for the chance for some of it to drip inside.
Leave the oiled decanter to sit in a warm place, like in the kitchen while cooking, to allow the oil to stay warm and loosen the stopper.

, After allowing the oiled decanter to sit in a warm place, gently wiggle the stopper to loosen and remove it.Tap the sides of the stopper with a wooden spoon or another object that won’t break the glass to loosen it.
Note that the oil may drip into the contents of the decanter, so it may need to be disposed of. The stopper and the neck of the decanter should also be cleaned to remove the oil.

"
"
Wipe down the stopper and neck.,
Clean the inside of the decanter.,
Store the decanter in a clean place.",How to Remove a Stuck Glass Decanter Stopper3," Clean the connecting parts of the decanter after each use or before storing for a long period of time. This will help avoid the buildup of residue that causes sticking over time.


Use a damp cloth without any other cleaner to gently wipe down the decanter and stopper.
You can also try wrapping a piece of paper around the stopper before placing it in the decanter in order to store it for a long period of time., Remove stains or residue from liquid that has been left for a long time in a decanter with a stuck stopper.


Fill the empty decanter with warm, soapy water and two tablespoons of uncooked rice. Swirl the mixture periodically over 30 minutes to remove stubborn stains, then rinse thoroughly with warm water.You can also try a small amount of vinegar, baking soda, or denture cleaner in water to clean the inside. Always make sure to rinse thoroughly with just water afterwards., Keep your decanter in a place you’ll use it often, or store it inside a cabinet or other area with little dust. This will help avoid particles that make the stopper stick over time.


Keeping the decanter in a relatively warm and humid place may help keep it loose and lubricated.
Use the water or oil methods of loosening the stopper every so often during storage so that it does not become more stuck over time.

Alternatively, you can purchase a razor scraper that is designed to remove adhesives off surfaces.
In some cases, the sticker might come off very nicely after being treated with soap and hot water.

, It's a great universal cleaning agent that lifts and dissolves dirt and grease.Adding oil to it makes it into a paste for easy application on any surface.


Any cooking oil will work. You can use olive oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil.

, Cover these surfaces with cloth or paper and tape them up with masking tape to seal them off from paste leakages.


Surfaces you want to protect from include plastic, painted surfaces, wood, or fabric.
Baking soda is relatively safe so if you do accidentally drop paste on an unwanted surface or your skin, there should be little to no damage if you clean it off right away.

, Leave this on for a few minutes and let the baking soda do its magic.


For very stubborn stickers, leave the paste on overnight.

, The residue glue and paper should have softened enough for you to wipe or scrub away the sticker clean.


Alternatively, you can use an abrasive cloth or sponge like steel wool to give extra scrubbing strength. However, be careful not to scratch the glass surface.

Fill a bucket or sink with hot water and washing soda.,
Soak the object for 30 minutes.,
Pull the object out of the water.",How to Remove a Sticker from Glass3," Half a cup to a cup of washing soda depending on how much water you're using should work.The washing soda and hot water acts a dissolving agent that melts the sticker's glue to break its bond from the glass surface.


Use gloves when handling washing soda as it can cause skin irritation. Washing soda binds better with hard water, or water with many minerals dissolved in it, to create a more abrasive foam than baking soda and washing detergent to better clean surfaces and clothing., You can soak it even longer or overnight for more stubborn stickers.

, Since washing soda is a much stronger alkaline than baking soda, the sticker should slide off the glass surface or be very easy to lift off.


Remember to rinse the object thoroughly after soaking it in washing soda, especially if it is an objected used to consume food like a jar or glass cup.

Heat up your glass surface.,
Peel the sticker off.,
Use soap, oil, or any glue removing agent.",How to Remove a Sticker from Glass4," Use a blow dryer on its highest setting and dry the sticker for 1 to 2 minutes. Or you can place the object in the sun for a couple of hours. The heat should melt the adhesive, but the sticker should be promptly removed or the adhesive might cool off again and harden.


If you're trying to get a sticker off a window of your car, park your car in a very sunny place for 2 to 3 hours.
Heat a glass or plastic item with hot water. Wait 15 seconds or so. If the label is on a flat surface like a lid, for example, run the hot water on the opposite side of the label while peeling off the label.

, Use your fingers to gently lift the sticker off. Be careful, the surface will be extremely hot. Alternatively, use a dull knife to scrape off the sticker by gently prying a corner of the sticker off, then wedging the blade between the sticker and glass until it is completely removed.


Be sure to pick a knife that is dull and not sharp to touch. Dull knives have been through wear and tear so when you use it on a glass surface, you won't run the risk of scratching the surface.

Put some rubbing alcohol on a paper towel, napkin, cotton ball, cotton swab, or a cloth.,
Rub the sticker with alcohol.",How to Remove a Sticker from Glass5," This method is especially helpful of you can't soak the glass object in a bucket of water. It is also relatively mess-free.


Rubbing alcohol is flammable. So be careful where you use it. Do not use it on a stove or heated area. Use rubbing alcohol in a well ventilated place., The sticker should come off or you may have to repeat these steps until it lifts.


Rubbing alcohol is a solvent, or cleaning agent that dissolves other substances such as the sticky glue on stickers. It dries almost immediately so it can be used to clean electrical objects without risking water damage.
Try holding the alcohol dampened item over the glass surface to soak the sticker.

Protect yourself and surfaces that might be damaged.,
Spray WD-40 evenly on the sticker.,
Wipe the sticker away with a clean washcloth.",How to Remove a Sticker from Glass6," WD-40 is a powerful dissolvent that dissolves adhesives but is also a powerful chemical solution. Be sure not to get any on you, on fabrics, or even the glass surface.

, In order to avoid getting any on the glass, you might want to spray WD-40 on a clean cloth and wipe it on the sticker instead.


Be sure to protect your hands by wearing gloves.

, The sticker or decal should come right off with a little but of scrubbing. For particularly stubborn stickers, you may have to use a razor scraper or dull knife to remove it.

Spread the napkin out flat.,
Lift the napkin by its center.,
Smooth out any folds.,
Slide the napkin ring over the pinched end.,
Puff up both ends.",How to Fold a Napkin for a Napkin Ring1," This method of napkin folding is quick, simple, and easy to duplicate, making it a good choice for beginners. To start, lay your napkin flat on your table or work surface. Flatten out any folds or creases you see.


Note that this method works best with large, square, cloth napkins. For the nicest-looking results, use napkins without wrinkles, stains, or frayed ends.;
, Pinch the very center of the napkin between your thumb and forefinger. Lift it up so that it's not touching the table or work surface. The napkin should hang below your hand in gentle, flowing folds.

, If needed, use your free hand to straighten out the folds of the napkin so that it hangs freely. Alternatively, shake it up and down a few times with the hand you're pinching it with.


When you're done, the napkin should hang downward loosely like a pair of drapes.

, Grasp the middle section of the napkin with your free hand to hold it in place. Then, use the hand you were pinching the napkin with to slide the ring over the napkin's folded end and pull it through.


If possible, push your ring up the napkin until it's held in place by the bulk of the napkin. Not all napkins are thick enough for this — if yours isn't, just slide the ring up an inch or two and set the napkin down.

, Next, simply puff up the unfolded end of the napkin to give it some visually appealing volume — this is easiest with hefty cloth napkins. For added panache, give the smaller bottom part of the napkin a quick fluffing as well. Congratulations! You're done. Arrange your napkin as you wish.


There are many different ways you can arrange your napkins for maximum impact — for instance, you may want to place your napkin directly on a plate to draw attention to it or put them all in a basket in the middle of the table so that your guests can grab them as they need them. It's up to you!

Crease your napkin in half.,
Accordion-fold your napkin.,
Fold the accordion-ed napkin in half.,
Insert the folded end into your ring.",How to Fold a Napkin for a Napkin Ring2," This method isn't much harder than the basic ""puff"" fold above, but it looks incredibly elegant, making it a great choice for when you're trying to impress your friends. To start, lay your napkin flat and fold it in half. Press down on the fold to make a firm crease. Unfold the napkin.For this method, it's more important than normal to use a stiff, square cloth napkin. These sorts of napkins hold creases more easily than paper napkins, making your final ""fan"" shape look much sharper. In addition, if you don't use a square napkin, the dimensions of your fan may be off.

, Folding parallel to the crease you put in the napkin, make alternating folds from one side to the other. Aim to fit about four to six folds on each side of the central crease — the precise number doesn't matter. Press down to form creases as you go. When you're done, your folded-up napkin should be a long, skinny, ""accordion-ing"" strip.


Note that your original crease should act as one of the folds in your ""accordion"".You may need to adjust the width of your folds slightly to get them to line up perfectly with the crease. Over time, this gets easier.

, Next, find the middle point of your accordion-ed strip and fold it over itself so that its edges line up. This should leave you with one round, folded end (probably too thick to crease at this point) and one open, fanned-out end.

, Now, all you need to do is put the napkin in your ring. Pull the ring up over the folded end of your napkin until it's about halfway up. Pull on the edges of the open end of your napkin to fan it out and display the accordion-ed folds. Congratulations! You're done.


As usual, you can make a bold statement by simply putting this folded-up napkin in the center of your plate. You may also want to try putting the folded end in a skinny glass or champagne flute for an exotic, peacock-like arrangement."

Fold the napkin in half.,
Roll one end of the napkin to the middle.,
Roll the other end into the middle.,
Pull the ring over the rolls.",How to Fold a Napkin for a Napkin Ring3," This fold is simple, formal, and easy — perfect for last minute preparations for a wedding or fancy party.To start, fold the bottom edge of the napkin up to the top to make a rectangle. To be clear, the bottom edge of your napkin should be folded and the top edge should be open.


While a square napkin is best here, the material of the napkin isn't as important for the double roll as it is for other types of napkin folds because the napkin doesn't need to support its own weight. Thus, this is a fine choice if you're working with paper napkins.

, Next, take one side of the napkin and tightly roll it inward. Stop when you reach the rough middle point of the napkin. Use the napkin ring or a plate to hold this roll in place while you tackle the other edge.

, Next, repeat the same rolling procedure for the other side of the napkin. The two rolls should meet in the middle of the napkin. They should be roughly the same size — if they're not, you may want to make minor adjustments so that they're symmetrical.

, Simply pull the ring over the double-rolled napkin so that it rests roughly in the middle point. That's it! Your napkins are ready to be given to your guests or arranged as you please. If you have any spare ribbon lying around, these skinny rolls look even better tied up with a bow!


Don't forget to arrange your napkins rolls-side up — otherwise, they'll just look like an ordinary roll or bundle.

Fold the napkin diagonally.,
Roll from the long end to the point.,
Fold the napkin in half.,
Stuff the folded end into your ring.",How to Fold a Napkin for a Napkin Ring4," This amazing fold looks breathtaking when pulled off correctly but doesn't require much more work than any of the standard folds above, surprisingly.To begin, lay your napkin flat on your table or work surface and fold one of the top corners to the opposite bottom corner. Your napkin should look like a triangle when you're done.


As above, a stiff, square cloth napkin works best here. You may find that this fold needs more stiffness than any of the other ones in this article — more so than the others, this fold uses the natural strength of the cloth to support the weight of the napkin.

, Grab the long, wide end of the napkin and start rolling it toward the point of the triangle. Roll as tightly as you can. The more tightly you roll your napkin, the more easily it will be able to hold its final shape, so the tighter, the better.


When you're done, your napkin should look like a narrow, skinny, roll. The edges of the napkin should make repeating diagonal lines on the surface of the roll.

, Taking care not to let your roll unravel, fold the napkin roughly at its middle point. The ""points"" at the ends of the roll should align with each other. Keep a grip on the folded base of the napkin to keep it from unrolling.

, Next, take the folded end of your napkin and push it into the ring (it should fit rather snugly — if your ring is too big or too small, this can be tricky). The two rolled-up edges of the napkin should stand upright, resembling a pair of skinny candles. Congratulations! You're done.


One great trick for arranging your napkins with this fold is to bring the folded edge of the napkin flush with the bottom of the ring and stand it upright. The ring should resemble the rim of a candlestick, enhancing the candle-like appearance of your napkins. Note, however, that this arrangement is very easy to tip over."

Pick a cloth napkin set.,
Choose a square napkin set.,

Examine the cloth and prep for stain removal.,
Wash your cloth napkins.,
Dry your napkins.",How to Fold a Napkin Into a Fan," You should begin with the napkin lying flat and unfolded. Take the right side of your napkin and match the right edge to the left edge. You want to make sure that the sides are perfectly matched the whole way. Then press down on the fold to make a sharp crease.








Your square napkin should now look like a rectangle.;
, With the rectangle's long sides to the left and right, grasp the edge of the short side closest to you and fold it up toward its body. The first fold will determine how large the pleats for the fan will be, so determine for yourself if this is how big you want them to be. There is no right or wrong answer to this, just personal preference. Once the pleat is the size you want it to be, press down on the fold to make a sharp crease.To make a bigger pleat, make the size of the folded over portion bigger. To make a smaller pleat, make the size of the folded over portion smaller.

, Gripping the area you just folded over and creased, raise it again to fold away from you. However, this time you will want to fold a width twice as wide as before. Before you make the crease like in the previous step, gather half of the folded area and fold it back toward you. This will create a series of folds that stack on top of each other like an accordion.








Alternatively, you can create the accordion fold by first folding one way and then the opposite way, stacking the napkin's pleats on top of each other as you go.
Continue this process about halfway up the rectangle, maintaining an identical size for each pleat as you go along.
This creates half of the fan portion of your display.

, Grasping the accordion tightly in one hand, turn your entire napkin upside down. Then, fold it in half so that you create another, smaller rectangle. You want to match the edges of the accordion fold to each other and the edges of the previously unfolded area together. Press down to make a sharp crease.








Now you have made the entire fan portion and have prepared the back to become the stand.

, Grasp the upper edge of the rectangle that is unfolded. Bring it down and across so that it creates half of a pentagon that lines up with the closest edge of the fan. Press down to create a crease., Turn the cloth over so that the face previously lying on the table now faces upward, and vice versa. Fold up the end of the pentagon that hangs down past the accordion up into itself so that it wraps around itself.








Alternatively, you can tuck the end back end into the accordion folds of the fan.

, Open up the last crease you just created so that the back stand forms a sort of l-shape with a portion that can lay parallel to a table or plate. Then release your grip on the accordion and spread the ends so that it ""fans"" out. Your standing fan napkin is now complete and ready to be displayed on a plate or table.







, Begin with your napkin laying as a flat, unfolded square. Make narrow accordion pleats that stack on top of one another evenly.Determine how big you want your pleats to be by making the first fold to-size. Then make the next fold twice as wide. However, before you crease that fold, fold half of the extra-large pleat the opposite direction, creating pleats identical in size to your first one.
Do this for the entire length of the napkin.

, Take one short end of the accordion pleats (it doesn't matter which) and fold them in half on top of each other. You don't have to make the crease here particularly sharp if you don't wish to. Your accordion pleats should now be half as long but twice as thick., Taking your napkin ring, work it over the the folded end of the napkin. Do not push it up too high; a few centimeters to an inch should probably be plenty.You should still be able to freely spread the fan's edges; if you can't, you've slid the ring over the wrong end.

, Using your fingers, spread the fan's ""blades"" as large as you'd like the fan to go. Place the fan either on or next to plate for display.Unlike the standing fan, this fan displays lying down.

, Although both cloth and paper napkins can be folded into fans, a cloth napkin will give a greater feeling of elegance to the occasion. Cloth napkins also have the additional benefit of being less wasteful: you can reuse them for multiple parties and avoid adding to a landfill by keeping and reusing them.You can buy cloth napkins at stores like Bed Bath & Beyond, Crate and Barrel, and even Amazon.
Linen napkins are generally regarded as the best quality cloth napkins available, but for a more casual affair cotton is acceptable., Although you can use rectangular napkins if you can't find a square one, square napkins are ideal. Although you may only be planning to use these napkins for fan folds this time, you may want to reuse them later with different folding techniques, and some of them do absolutely require a square napkin.You can use a T-square or two rulers aligned perpendicular to one another at a 90 degree angle to double check your napkins' squareness.

, Although the industry standard for napkins is white, there are a world of patterns and colors that you can explore in cloth napkins. By color coordinating your napkins to the rest of your party's or event's decor, you can make it even more memorable and special.Light colors create a sense of space.
Dark colors create a more intimate atmosphere.

, Although this will probably not be a problem if you've never used these napkins before, if this is your second or third time using these napkins, or you have rented them for the occasion, you'll want to check to make sure they're clean and stain free. It would be incredibly embarrassing for a guest to open their napkin and discover a huge grease stain on the cloth. You can treat for the following common stains like so:Food stains: use a pre-treatment solution like Shout, Spray N' Wash, or Resolve Stain Remover before washing. Follow the product's directions featured on the packaging (each product will have slightly different directions, so be careful).
Candle wax: scrape off as much of the excess wax first and then place the napkin between two paper towels. Iron the tablecloth between the paper towels to soak up more of the wax. Finish with an application of Goof Off, Goo Gone, or candle wax remover.
Oil or grease: apply and scrub at with clear dish soap (which is formulated to get rid of grease and oil).
Red wine stains: prep the stain by applying white wine, club soda, or salt paste.
Coffee stains: apply diluted vinegar and then soak the cloth in warm, not hot, water.
Ink: use hairspray or denatured alcohol.

, Soak your linen from 8 hours to overnight in your washing machine with cool water; you should add laundry detergent to it. In the morning, drain the washing machine and refill it with hot water. Wash the cloths with as short a cycle as possible to avoid abrasions to the material and add an extra rinse cycle since linen absorbs more soap and detergent than many other materials.Do not use chlorine bleach on white linen napkins. While bleach will restore most white cloth to its original state, chlorine bleach will actually yellow linen.
Avoid putting any other items in the washing machine. Other fabrics will increase the amount of friction that the linen will experience, and if they are of a different color those colors could run onto the napkins.
Do not use any fabric softeners on linen.
Repeat as needed if you notice any stains upon completion.

, The best way to dry linen is to hang it up on a line outside using some clothing pinchers during a warm, sunny day. If it's wet and rainy outside, you can lay the napkins flat on top of some terrycloth towels inside. Finish this off by first spraying the material with starch and then ironing the napkins on a low heat.Starching and then ironing your napkins will help them to keep their form once folded and to have extra crisp creases.
Do not use a mechanical dryer to dry your linen napkins. Doing so will weaken the fibers, causing them to become brittle and shortening the longevity of your napkins.

Peel tape from the glass.,
Choose a chemical solvent.,
Take safety precautions.,
Apply the solvent to the glass.,
Leave on the solvent for a few minutes.,
Wipe off the residue.,
Wash the glass.,
Repeat steps if necessary.",How to Get Tape off of Glass1," Before you apply any solvents, remove as much of the tape as you can by hand or scraper. Peel back as much of the tape as you can with your hands and fingers. Scrape away any lingering bits or residue with a knife, razor blade, or scraping tool. You may find that peeling and scraping may remove less adhesive tapes such as magic and electrical.Use a scraper with a single blade and handle to prevent injury. Scrape the tape away in a motion away from you. Apply gentle pressure on the glass so you don’t scratch it.;
, Some types of tape—such as duct, bondage, filament, masking, and packing—can be particularly pesky to remove. If you can’t seem to remove tape from a glass surface, use a commercial lubricant, solvent, or even petroleum-based product to get it off. Some chemical solvents that can make your job easier are:Petroleum: including mineral spirits, paint thinner, and naphtha (also sold as lighter fluid)
Isopropyl or rubbing alcohol
Acetone, including nail polish remover
Degreasing agents with d-Limonene such as Fast Orange or Goo GoneLubricants including WD-40
Aerosol furniture polish, Chemical solvents can be toxic and should be used and stored with caution. Not using chemical solvents properly can cause fires and harm your health. Taking the time to read product labels and using the solvent it in a well ventilated area may prevent unnecessary accidents when removing tape from glass. You should also wear gloves when applying solvents to glass to protect your hands.


Read the product label closely for any suggestions or warnings about your chemical solvent. If you have any questions, contact the company at the phone number given on the label.Make sure the area you use the solvent is well ventilated. The fumes may be dangerous if inhaled for too long. Open any windows in the room or use a fan to bring in fresh air. If you don’t have any windows or a fan in your area, try and remove the glass to an area that is well ventilated. Consider taking a break every few minutes to get some fresh air.
Keep the solvent and its container away from children, pets, and flames.

, After taking the necessary precautions, saturate the taped area with your chosen chemical solvent. You can pour it on directly or apply it with a paper towel, cotton ball or swab, or clean cloth. Use the solvent only on the area with tape to decrease the chances of overwhelming fumes or fire.Cover the entire taped area as well as the immediate border of the tape and its residue. Make sure that you’ve put enough solvent on the area to saturate it without it getting other surfaces wet.
Avoid applying the solvent or rubbing it in with your fingers or hands unless you are wearing protective gloves. Not doing so may cause your skin to have a bad reaction., It takes a few minutes for a chemical solvent to penetrate and break down the adhesive in tape. Allow the product to sit on the glass for at least 15 minutes. The more pesky the tape, the longer it should have to get the tape off of your glass. Use the time the solvent is soaking into the adhesive to get some fresh air and check that there is nothing hazardous near it., After the solvent has had a few minutes to break down the tape adhesive, wipe off the tape and residue. It may take a few passes with the cloth to remove the solvent and tape, but wipe until the glass is dry or you don’t see or feel any more tape or adhesive.Use a clean, lint-free cloth to wipe off the glass. Cloth with lint or that can rip easily can leave an even bigger mess on the glass, especially if you didn’t get off all of the tape. You can also use a scraper if you prefer or the adhesive is a bit stronger.

, Because solvents are toxic and can cause skin reactions, it’s important to wash off the glass when you’re done wiping it. This can also help remove lingering residue and will leave you with clean, gleaming glass.Use a glass cleaner or hot water and a dish soap to clean your glass. Dish soap can help further cut an oil or residue. Make sure you don’t wash the glass with household or personal items.Scrape or scrub off any lingering residue in the soap and water. You can use a kitchen sponge, scrubber, or steel wool to get any tape off of the glass. Use only new sponges or scrubbers and throw them away after use so no one else in your family uses them on personal items.

, In some cases, you may not be able to get tape off of your glass with one application of solvent. Repeat the process 2-3 times or until you are able to remove the tape and its adhesive."

Heat glass with a hairdryer.,
Soak the glass in boiling water.,
Get rid of tape with an olive oil.,
Dissolve tape and adhesive with vinegar.,
Rub on a baking soda mixture.",How to Get Tape off of Glass2," Heat is an excellent way to remove tape and its residue from glass. Directing a hairdryer towards the tape and adhesive will soften them and make it easier to peel away.Turn your hairdryer to high heat and direct it on the tape for 45 seconds. Then test a corner of the tape to see if it comes up easily. If not, heat for another 45 seconds and check if the corner comes up more easily. If the tape is over a large area, break it up into smaller sections. Pull the tape as you go.

, Moist heat can also be useful for removing tape from glass. It may work especially well on very sticky tapes or residue. Try soaking the glass in hot or boiling water if a hairdryer doesn’t work. Leaving the glass in the water for 30-40 minutes may soften and dissolve the tape and adhesive enough so they simply wipe right off.


Fill a sink with hot or boiling water. Be sure to not burn yourself. Place the glass in the sink and leave it for 30-40 minutes. If the glass is too large to put in the sick, soak a dishcloth in the water and place it directly on the taped area. Leave it for the same amount of time. Wipe off the tape and any residue.
Try adding some dish soap or vinegar to the water for better removal.

, Your kitchen is a great place to find items that can quickly, naturally, and easily get tape off of glass. You likely have olive oil as a staple in your diet, now you can put it to work against tape and adhesive. Try other vegetable oils such as canola or safflower if you don’t have any olive oil on hand.Apply a few drops of oil over the area with tape and let it sit for a few minutes. You can also soak a paper towel with the oil and leave it on the glass. This allows the oil to penetrate the tape and adhesive. Once the olive oil has sat, scrape the tape and any good with your fingernails or a razor blade until it comes up and forms little clumps.
Wipe the area with a clean paper towel. You can wash it in soap and hot water to clean it or remove lingering residue.

, Mild acids like vinegar often work well to remove tape and its adhesive residue. Leave diluted vinegar on the tape for a few minutes to let it work its magic.Mix one part water to one part vinegar. Then soak a dishrag in the solution. Either wrap the cloth around the glass or set it on top of the glass. You can also safely hold it in place with your hands if you can’t set the glass on the ground. Allow the mixture to penetrate the tape and adhesive for a few minutes before you remove the cloth. You’ll likely notice that the tape is much less sticky.
Wash the class with a dish soap and warm water to remove any lingering tape or residue.

, Baking soda is an abrasive that can help pick up bits of tape and residue. Mixing it with an oil or acid such as lemon juice makes a natural paste that can scrub off and remove tape from glass.Mix equal parts baking soda with a vegetable oil, water, or lemon juice until it forms a paste. Rub this paste onto the area with tape and leave it on for a few minutes.
Wipe the paste off with a clean cloth. The tape should come off relatively easily. If there is any lingering tape or residue, use one of your kitchen scrubbers to remove it. You don’t have to worry about using a new one, as a baking soda paste is natural and safe to use.
Consider soaking your glass in boiling water for 30-40 minutes before rubbing on the paste. This can remove paper or other materials that may be stick to the tape or adhesive.

, Depression glass was made in a variety of hues. Pieces in common colors such as light to medium green, pink, amber, and clear are easier to find. Canary yellow, amethyst, cobalt blue, red, jadeite (opaque green), opaque black (may appear as an intense purple), and milk glass (opaque white) were made in lesser quantities and are more difficult to find., The most popular patterns of Depression glass today are Cameo, Mayfair, American Sweetheart, Princess, and Royal Lace. However, nearly 100 different patterns were made by 20 different companies, so you will have your choice of patterns.Other patterns include swirls and spirals, bubbles, birds, cherry blossoms, buttons and bows, horseshoes, pineapples, and more.You may want to choose to buy a variety of patterns, or stick to one that you really like.

, Be aware that many pieces of Depression glass have flaws that are characteristic of this type of glassware. Depression glass often has bubbles, imperfections, and marks because it was made using an inexpensive process and cheap materials.In addition, some of the molds that were used to make Depression glass were uneven or ill-fitting, resulting in pieces with dents, irregular areas, and other imperfections.
These flaws add to the charm of Depression glass. Just be sure to avoid pieces with signs of extreme wear and tear, such as large chips, nicks and cracks.

Spray paint your colander.,
Make a display with one kind of fruit.,
Choose many different fruits of one color.,
Create a more traditional fruit bowl.,
Make a seasonal bowl by adding flowers to the look.",How to Make a Colander Centerpiece1," If you don’t already have an extra colander on hand, you can find one for a dollar or two at a local thrift store. You’ll want to make it presentable enough to command attention at the center of your table. If you like its color or design as it is, just give it a wash and dry it well. You can also add a couple coats of spray paint to give your tablescape a pop of color.Get a spray paint primer and give your colander a priming coat first. Let it dry for at least an hour, and sand away any drip marks or imperfections if necessary.
Then, add a coat of your favorite color. Spray on a second coat if necessary, and give it a full day to dry before putting anything in it.;
, You can try adding one kind of fruit in a color that will complement the room’s decor. Consider going with green apples or bright oranges for a fresh pop of color.Alternatively, you could choose many different kinds of a particular fruit to show off how it can vary. For example, you can choose red delicious, golden delicious, granny Smith, gala, and green apples to show how one fruit can vary in beautiful ways.
You can also arrange different kinds of oranges, tangerines, and clementines for an arrangement with a uniform color but lots of size varieties.

, Try using strawberries, apples, and grapes in similar shades of red for a uniform color palette with lots of sizes and textures. You can place them in a colander painted in a complementary color, like green or light blue, to make your red fruits stand out even more.


You could also go with bright green apples and grapes, or fruits with earthier tones like pineapples and kiwis.

, Try gathering an assortment that resembles a traditional cornucopia. Think about composition and form when you’re positioning the fruit. Imagine your fruit bowl as the subject of a classic still life painting.


Depending on the size of the colander, use two or three apples and a couple of oranges to provide the foundation of your assortment.
Next, use two or three bananas and place them on one side. Try to use bananas that are still attached to each other at their stems.
Add a bunch of grapes, or even a few small fruits like kiwi, to add more variety and complete the look.

, Try placing a mason jar filled about halfway with lukewarm water in the center of the colander. Create a fall harvest look by placing apples, small gourds, or a mix of the two around the jar. Cut a bouquet of sunflowers so their blooms will sit just above the jar and elegantly spill out over the fruit and gourds.For a fuller floral look, you can find a bouquet of inexpensive clearance greens or wheat at your supermarket or florist, cut them to size, and add them to your sunflowers bunch.

Choose two different types or sizes of wineglasses.,
Choose fluted or tulip-shaped (champagne) glasses for sparkling wines and champagne.,
Look for cut over rolled edges to the glass.,
For wine accompanying dinner, choose wine glasses that are slightly larger so that they can accommodate larger pours, around 4 to 6 oz each, while still having ample empty space in the bowl.

,
For wine tasting events, choose small, inexpensive glasses.,
For serving fine wines, choose glasses that are clear in color and do not have any painted or etched decorations.,
Purchase the best wineglasses that you can afford.,
Prefer dishwasher-proof wineglasses over hand-wash only.",How to Choose Wine Glasses for a Wine," Select smaller wineglasses for white wine and larger glasses for red wine. Generally, more full-bodied wines work best in slightly larger glasses while lighter, fruitier wines can do well in smaller glasses. The reason that white wine glasses need to be smaller is that white wine should not warm up too much before it is consumed. As for the size of red wine glasses, the more generous, the better, to allow for a third fill and the rest of the glass permitting aeration.


Select a balloon shaped wineglass to allow the wine to promote better flavor and to allow the wine to develop its full bouquet. Wine needs room to breathe and a tapered shape is the best for releasing the aroma.
For still wine, have a fine, plain and colorless glass. If the glass is chunky, has designs or color, you won't be able to appreciate the appearance of the wine inside.Wine expert Joanna Simon recommends that a glass should be able to fit a quarter bottle of wine to about a third to half of the glass.;
, This shape helps keep the bubbles intact for longer and ensure the best flavor and aroma while drinking the sparkling wine.


Avoid using the Champagne saucer or coupe for champagne; it causes both bubbles and bouquet to disappear instantly., This is more finished look and feels pleasant to the mouth touch.

,, Wineglasses just for tasting wine at a wine tasting party don't need to be as pretty or expensive. Indeed, since you will often need many and some are liable to be broken by guests, prefer cheaper ones for such occasions. Smaller tasting glasses are optimal, particularly if many wines will be served at one time and over the course of the evening. They are easier to clean and you can fit more in front of each guest on the table. Also, tasting pours tend to be smaller so that each wine can make it around to each guest and each guest can drink more wines without getting too tipsy. A small pour in a very large glass can get lost and be hard to assess how much has been consumed.

, While colored glass and decorations may make the glass pretty to look at, it detracts from the appreciation of the wine inside, particularly for wine tastings.

, The experience as a whole when drinking wine matters, including the glass.


While you can find good deals on stemware on the internet through various companies, it is best to see the glasses firsthand to really appreciate their clarity, size and how they feel in your hand.

, This will save you time and effort.


Wineglasses made from glass can be washed in the dishwasher and provide easy care. For non-greasy glasses, wash them on the shortest cycle without detergent. For dirtier glasses, use a little detergent but no rinsing aid. Open the door at the end of the cycle to let the glasses air dry without humidity.For hand-washing, use hot water and a minimum of detergent.
If you do choose crystal glasses, expect them to require a bit more care and as they are delicate and can only washed by hand.

Gather your supplies.,
Prop the ball up on a cup.,
Glue the candy on.,
Prepare the pot.,
Complete the topiary.",How to Make a Candy Centerpiece1," You'll need a pot, a styrofoam ball, foam for the pot, a stick to attach the ball to the foam in the pot, and hot glue. For an edible ball, you can still use styrofoam, but you'll also need aluminum foil, meringue powder, powdered sugar, food coloring, and water. Of course, you'll also need the candy you want to use.If you want to skip the glue altogether, you can use stick candy that you stick into the foam, rather than glue on.
You can use any kind of small candy you want, such as jelly beans, peppermint candies, gumballs, candy-coated chocolate candies, or even chocolate kisses. For gravel, try pieces of rock candy or jelly beans.
You can also use paint, ribbon, and/or stickers to decorate the pot.;
, Using a cup to hold the ball makes it easier, as it can give you more space to work on the ball without holding on to the candy while it's drying. For an edible arrangement, cover the ball in foil. Balance the ball on top of the cup before you begin gluing.

, For a simple topiary ball, simply glue your candy on the foam ball, making sure to get it all covered with the candy so you don't see the white underneath.You can also make an edible glue with royal icing, if you prefer.To make royal icing, mix together 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of meringue powder and 4 cups of powdered sugar. Add in 1/4 to 1/2 of a cup of warm water, a tablespoon at a time, and use a hand mixer to incorporated it in. Keep adding it in until it's a thick paste. Thicker is better for this application. You can also add food coloring to tint the glue.
Let the candy dry thoroughly before working with it again. Make sure to leave a spot where the stick can go in.

, Cut the foam to fit the inside of the pot. Decorate the pot how you'd like, using paint or stickers. Place the stick in the center of the foam, ready for the ball to go on top. It can help to use a bit of hot glue on the bottom of the stick to make sure it stays upright., Add candy or other decorations as ""gravel"" to the pot on top of the foam, or you can use glass beads. You can make it edible by using foil and then the edible glue. Once everything is dry, assemble the topiary by impaling the topiary on top of the stick. It can help to use a bit of hot glue on the top of the stick to hold it in place."

Place a block of florist’s foam in your colander.,
Add flowers and work from big to small.,
Use seasonal veggies instead of flowers.",How to Make a Colander Centerpiece2," You can find florist’s foam at the supermarket or florist. Line the bottom of the colander with tin foil, then add a moistened block of foam to the colander’s center. You might need to trim it using a knife if the block stands higher than the edge of the colander., First stick the stems with the largest blooms, like hydrangeas or kale, into the floral foam. Then, add sunflowers, roses, or any other medium-sized blooms in your bouquet. Finally, add in berries, baby’s breath, or any other smaller pops that you desire., Mix up two or three white and yellow flowers with artichokes, broccoli, asparagus, and kale. Cut wooden skewers into four or five inch segments and stick them into the veggie florets. Again, work from large to small as you compose your seasonal centerpiece.First position larger florets, like the broccoli and artichokes.
Then add medium-sized florals, like asparagus and two or three white or yellow flowers of your choice.
Finally, add sprigs of fresh herbs to add color and texture and complete your composition.

Create a quick, five minute succulent planter.,
Prepare a more permanent colander planter.,
Add succulents to your planter.,
Use seasonal thrillers, fillers, and spillers in your colander planter.",How to Make a Colander Centerpiece3," Place three succulent plants in your colander, leaving them in the pots in which you purchased them. Fill the colander with pebbles or gravel, and shift the pots into positions you find attractive as you fill. This solution works well if you just need a quick centerpiece, such as for an impromptu lunch or picnic.If the gravel or pebbles you have on hand are smaller than the colander's largest holes, try lining it with sheet moss, cut plastic, or tightly packed soil before adding the pebbles or gravel.

, To make a more permanent planter, you’ll need to prepare the colander to host whatever plants you’ve chosen. If you’ve opted for succulents, place a layer of gravel about a half inch thick at the base of the colander. Then add cactus soil until the colander is about three-fourths full, leaving enough room for your plants.


Succulents need plenty of drainage, and the gravel base will help drain moisture. Pack the cactus soil in tight where you need to if you have trouble with grains slipping through the colander holes. If the holes are too large, just use gravel throughout.If you’ve chosen seasonal flowers or plants, like pansies or petunias, you’ll need to line the base of the colander with sheet moss, so it retains moisture better. Add potting soil to the lined colander, again leaving enough room for the plants.In a pinch, you can make a liner by cutting a plastic bag so it fits the colander base, but poke a couple small holes here and there so it can drain a bit.

, You can plant a few species of succulents for a chic but low-maintenance centerpiece. You’ll only need to water these plants every few weeks, or when the soil is completely dry. Just be sure to take the colander planter to a sink or other safe place for watering so you don’t make a mess on your table., If you go with plants other than succulents, try mixing spillers and fillers in with your blooms.


Spillers, such as ferns or sweet potato vine, tumble out of the container and add more interest.
A filler, like a dusty miller or begonia, adds volume to your composition and may or may not have flowers.
Use a spiked plant or colorful bloom as the thriller, which adds a pop of drama and variety to your container.Depending on the exact plants you choose, you’ll need to water them every couple days. Again, be sure you take the planter to a safe place for watering to avoid messes.

Gather what you need.,
Glue the candy canes on.,
Add a ribbon.,
Fill the vase or can.",How to Make a Candy Centerpiece2," You'll need candy canes or candy cane sticks, as well as a vase, ribbon, hot glue, and something to put in the vase, such as candy or flowers.If you don't want to ruin a vase, you can use a leftover can (such as a soup can) for the same effect; just be sure to wash it out well and take the label off., With the hooks facing outwards at the top, glue the candy canes vertically onto the vase or can. Make sure to glue them right next to each other, so the vase or can doesn't show underneath. Go all the way around with the candy canes.You can glue them with or without the plastic, but you may need to coat them with a clear varnish afterwards if you glue them on without the plastic.

, Wrap a ribbon around the middle of the vase or can, going around the candy canes. It's a good idea to glue it in place on the inside of the ribbon, as it will have a tendency to slip otherwise. Tie the ribbon in a bow. You can also glue a small peppermint candy in the middle of the bow., Finally, add in your decoration of choice to the middle of the vase. You could use a flower, such as red carnations. You could also fill it with a candy of your choice, including more candy canes, for guests to eat."

Hold the glass carefully by the bowl and not by the stem.,
Rinse the glasses in lukewarm to hot water.,
Wipe the glass clean with a long-handled sponge.,
Use a mild, odorless dish soap if needed.,
Rinse each glass well, inside and out, with hot water.,
Place the wine glass upside down on a soft towel so that it can air dry.,
Dry the glasses with a soft, lint-free towel if you live in an area that has hard water.,
Know that some stains may be permanent.",How to Clean Wine Glasses1," The stem is fragile, and the glass can break easily if you hold it by that. Instead, cup your hand around the bottom of the bowl, with your fingers to either side of the steam.


This method will also work for regular wine glasses.
If you are cleaning painted or glittered wine glasses, use this method.;
, If the water is too hot for you, it is likely too hot for the wine glass; water can cause glass to crack if it is hot enough. Sometimes, this is all that is needed to clean the glass.

, Avoid sticking your hand into the glass itself, or you will risk breaking the glass. Instead, find a soft sponge attached to a long, plastic handle. Focus your cleaning on the places that get the most dirty, such as the rim, the bottom of the glass, and the outside of the bowl.


Do not use steal wool or a scouring pad.Also, avoid using anything with stiff, plastic bristles. All of these can scratch the surface.

, Usually, a simple rinse and light buffing with a soft sponge is all that is needed. If the wine glass is especially dirty, however, you might need to use a mild dish soap. You will not need a lot; a small drop will be enough.


Try to use a low-alkaline detergent, if possible., Be sure to get rid of any soap residue. Crystal absorbs odors and flavors easily. If you don't rinse the wine glass well enough, your next glass of wine might have a slight soapy flavor.

, The soft cloth will help protect the rim from the hard surface of your counter or table.

, This will help prevent any hard water stains. Use a soft, lint-free cloth, such as microfiber.

, Crystal is a very porous material. It absorbs flavors and is easily damaged. If the crystal wine glasses have turned foggy because they were cleaned in the dishwasher at some point in time, the damage is permanent. The heat of the dishwasher would have baked the detergent into the glass.

Start with a square of plastic and candy.,
Make a flower.,
Add a stick with a sharp end.,
Ready a vase.,
Make the bouquet.",How to Make a Candy Centerpiece3," You'll need a square of plastic, about 5 inches (13 cm) by 5 inches, to put candy in. You can even use the non-zip plastic sandwich bags, though you won't put the candy inside the bag. Rather, lay the bag out flat. You'll need small candies, such as jelly beans, gummies, and small chocolate candies in solid colors., Spoon a small amount of candy onto the plastic square. Gather up the corners of the bag until the candy is in the center. Make a little bag out of the plastic by turning the candy in your hand with the corners sticking up, much like putting a wrapper on a lollipop. Use a twisty tie to secure the plastic where you twisted it, just above the candy., Begin wrapping a second piece of plastic around the bag you've already made, much as you did the first piece of plastic. Put a stick in between the layers. The sharp end should be sticking out, as it will go in foam later. Tie the second layer up with a twisty tie.Continue making flowers in other colors of candy, so you have a whole bouquet. You can use shades of the same color, such as shades of pink, or make a rainbow bouquet.

, Find a vase. Pick a foam ball that just fits into the vase. It's best if the foam stays near the top of the vase. Slide the foam ball in, pushing it down gently to make sure it stays in place. If it's slightly too big, you can use a bit of hot glue to hold it in place., Stick the candy flowers down into the foam, adding them all around the ball. It can help to make a hole with a stick without flowers first, so you don't squash your candy. Keep adding flowers until the ball is full, then poke in some fresh or fake leaves in places to add texture and color."
"
Choose your supplies.,
Build the vase.,
Layer the candy.,
Fill the smaller vase.",How to Make a Candy Centerpiece4," You'll need two vases. One should be a hurricane or other large-style vase, preferably with a stem. The other vase should be a straight-sided cylinder that fits into the first vase. The second vase doesn't need to be quite as tall as the first one, but if it's not, you'll need a small ramekin to go underneath. You'll also need small candies in colors of your choice and flowers to fill the smaller vase., Place the ramekin in the bottom of the larger vase if your smaller vase is too short to reach the top of the larger vase. Place the ramekin bottom-side up. Set the smaller vase on top of the ramekin. Make sure both are centered in the larger vase., Pour candy in between the smaller vase and the larger vase. Try layering colors for a more interesting effect. For instance, for a Christmas vase, you could add a layer of green candy, then a layer of red candy, and finally, a layer of white candy. Keep layering the candy until you reach the top of the vase., The final step is to fill the smaller vase. You can use silk flowers as the center, though fresh flowers will also work if you're careful. You can also simply fill the middle vase with a different kind of candy, so that guests can snack on them.Add a ribbon for a sophisticated touch.

Avoid bright colors.,
Choose monochromatic elements.,
Aim for consistency.,
Avoid anything disposable.",How to Create a Minimalist Tablescape1," The ideal palette for a minimalist tablescape contains just two colors: black and white. These are visually anchored by a third element, wood. Wood provides texture and difference where white and black objects provide uniformity. Select objects – plates, centerpiece objects, chairs, and runners – that are either black, white, or wooden.Green – the common color of plants that comprise minimalist centerpieces – is another common element in minimalist tablescapes.
Instead of using a bright red tablecloth, don’t use any at all. Or, if you really want to include a tablecloth, use a wispy white one.;
, Monochromatic – “one-color” – elements are free of busy patterns and designs that are incompatible with minimalist design principles. Instead of plates with an American flag on them, for instance, opt for entirely white ceramic. This will give your plates a clean look and allow diners to focus on their food.


Instead of napkins with a fanciful illustration on them, get plain white or grey napkins. (But avoid black napkins – they’re a bit grim.)

, Minimalist tablescapes are free of the messiness that accompanies random collections of plates and bowls, mismatched tableware, and glasses of different colors and sizes. When setting a minimalist table, pretend you’re at a nice restaurant. Everyone dining at a minimalist table should have the same flatware, the same plates, and the same chairs and cups.

, Plasticware, paper plates, and plastic cups have no place in a minimalist tablescape. Instead, spring for a more permanent dining set that corresponds to minimalist principles. With a more durable dining set, you’ll be able to create minimalist tablescapes far into the future."

Choose short-stemmed wine glasses made out of glass.,
Plan on washing the glasses separate from the rest of your dishes.,
Place the glasses upside down on the top rack, and space them so that they are not touching.,
Use a small amount of odorless detergent.,
Use a short, gentle cycle.,
Skip the drying cycle.,
Dry the glasses by hand if you live in an area with hard water.",How to Clean Wine Glasses2," Do not use this method for crystal wine glasses, or for wine glasses with long, delicate stems. Also, do not use this method for painted or glittered wine glasses.

, Do not load them in with anything that is very dirty or greasy. The grease can get on the glasses and smear them., Try to have about a hands width between each glass. This will lessen the chances of the glasses bumping against each other and chipping.

, The less detergent you use, the better. Also, try to use a mild, low-alkaline detergent. Do not add any rinse-aid. Rinse-aid may help prevent water stains, but it will also leave behind a chemical residue that will affect the flavor of your next glass of wine.If the wine glasses are stained, consider adding half a wine glass of white vinegar into the wash cycle., If you can, try to use a lower water temperature setting as well. The higher the water temperature, the more likely your wine glasses will be to crack.

, Instead, open the door at the end of the cycle to let the glasses air dry without humidity., Gently wipe them dry with a soft, lint-free cloth (such as microfiber), and put them away.

Bring a pot of water to a boil over the stove.,
Hold the wine glass upside down above the water.,
Wait until the steam covers the wine glass.,
Wait a few moments, then take the glass away.,
Wipe the wine glass off with a soft, lint-free towel.",How to Clean Wine Glasses3," Fill a pot with water and place it on the stove. Turn the stove on to high and wait for the water to begin boiling. This method is generally safe for wine glasses made out of crystal or glass. It may not be safe for painted or glittered wine glasses, however.

, Slip the stem between your fingers loosely so that the base is resting on your hand.

, If the steam is not covering the glass, try bringing it closer to the water. Do not let the glass touch the water, however, or it may crack.

, The hot steam will have sterilized the glass.

, Choose a soft cloth, such as microfiber, and wipe down the inside and outside of the glass."
"
Line the bottom of plastic container with a soft cloth.,
Fill the bowl with warm water.,
Add five tablespoons of white vinegar.,
Lay the wine glass down in the container.,
Wait one to two hours before removing the wine glass.This will give the acids in the vinegar enough time to dissolve the stains.

,
Rinse the glass using fresh water.,
Set the wine glass upside down on a soft, lint-free cloth to air dry.",How to Clean Wine Glasses4," The container should be large enough to fit your wine glass. The soft cloth is important, as it will help protect the wine glass from getting scratched.


This method is great for glasses that have turned foggy. It is also good for tough wine stains.
Do not use this one painted or glittered wine glasses. Soaking these glasses in water for long periods of time can cause the paint or glitter to flake off.

, Use just enough water so that the wine glass will be covered if you put it in.

, The vinegar will dissolve any wine or mineral residue. If you can't find any vinegar, you can use some baking soda or washing soda instead. Make sure that the washing soda or baking soda are completely dissolved; any remaining specks may scratch the glass.Washing soda will help remove cloudiness, but it may not remove wine stains. Baking soda will work the same way, just not as well.

, The wine glass should be completely submerged. If it isn't, add some more warm water.

,, Hold the glass by the bowl. Do not hold it by the stem, especially if it is a crystal wine glass. The stem is very fragile, and may break. If the wine glass is still foggy, it is possible that the damage is permanent. Wine glasses, especially those made from crystal, often turn foggy if they are washed in the dishwasher., Spread the cloth over your table or counter. Set the wine glass upside down on it. If you live in an area that has hard water, you might want to dry the glass off by hand using a soft, lint-free cloth instead.

Let the walls determine the balance of colors on the tablescape.,
Choose the right table.,
Include a small centerpiece.,
Don’t use a tablecloth.",How to Create a Minimalist Tablescape2," A well-designed tablescape should be in dialogue with everything around it. When creating a minimalist tablescape, you should try to work with, rather than against, the primary color of the environment.For instance, if you have white walls – which are ideal for minimalist design – you could complement them with a set of navy napkins or a navy table runner.
If you have colorful walls, you might have a harder time finding a good way to achieve a minimalist tablescape. Focus on incorporating wood and white-colored elements into your tablescape.

, Rustic-looking tables of unpainted wood tend to be favored in minimalist tablescapes. Ideally, the wood will be medium or light in hue, though darker woods can also work in the right environment (for instance, in a space where the walls are white)., Unlike a more traditional tablescape that might feature a big vase of flowers or a cornucopia, a minimalist tablescape should have just one single, clean-looking centerpiece. If you have a very long dining table – for a wedding, perhaps – it would be okay to incorporate one other repeated element that complements the plant. You could alternate the plant with, for instance, a series of white candles in clear glass.Take a long black serving dish and place a couple small bricks of floral foam in the bottom of the dish. Place a series of low cups – either plastic or clear glass – inside the dish. You should be able to get four to sit on the floral foam. The others can sit directly on the floor of the long serving dish. Stuff the cups with a lush green plant like selaginella until overflowing.
Other examples include a single white candle in a plain-looking copper candlestick holder, a succulent in a squat, black pot, and a single white rose or tulip in a small black or clear vase.
Make your centerpiece seasonal, if possible. For instance, in the fall you could choose a few small pumpkins or squashes.

, A table cloth detracts from the color and texture of the table itself. If you choose to use anything, use a long runner – thin strip of cloth that goes from one end of the table to the other, and drapes down slightly over the ends of the table somewhat.


If you absolutely must have a tablecloth, select a white or light-colored tablecloth. If you can pull off a darker tablecloth – a navy, for instance – try it out. You can always remove it if you decide later it doesn't work."

Identify the pest.,
Remove standing water.,
Keep your kitchen clean and all food in containers.,
Keep your house clean and clutter free.,
Deny access to your home.,
Try the less toxic pesticides first if other preventative measure fail.,
Use more volatile pesticides if necessary.,
Consider getting professional help.",How to Control Pests1," While the preventative steps are similar for all types of pests, you will want to focus on removing certain types of food (i.e. ripe melon for fruit flies) or cleaning certain areas (vacuuming the carpet for fleas), depending on the pest. If you decide to use a pesticide, you will need to make sure it is suitable for the pest you are trying to kill.;
, Insects and rodents need water to survive.Keep your bathroom and kitchen areas as dry as possible.
Fix leaking pipes.
Don’t let water collect in trays under plants.
Don’t leave your pet’s water out overnight.

, Food attracts pests. Ripe fruit will draw fruit flies. Unsealed grains will attract mealy moths. Flies and cockroaches will eat any crumbs they can find. A clean kitchen is a key step in ridding your home of pest.


Wipe up any spills with soap and water. A paper towel or dish towel alone may not be enough.Regularly unplug your toaster and remove crumbs.
Store your food in sealed glass or plastic containers. Lids that clamp shut work better than screw-on lids.
Keep ripe fruit,as well as rice and other long-term storage items, in the refrigerator.
Store pet food in a clean, sealed garbage can so that rodents cannot get to it.
Wash dishes daily, or submerge them in soapy water until you can get to them.
Take out the trash daily. Used sealed trash cans and be sure to keep them clean., This will remove hiding places for insects, as well as removing their eggs.


Vacuum regularly. In particular, vacuum the affected areas using a crevice tool. Dispose of the vacuum cleaner bag in a sealed plastic bag, so no pests can escape.
Comb and wash your pet frequently. If it has fleas, talk to your vet about flea medication.Get rid of clutter where pests hide, such as stacks of newspaper, magazines, or cardboard.
Clean appliances by unplugging them and sweeping them out, vacuuming, then wiping down with a damp rag. Make sure to let the appliance dry completely before reconnecting the appliance to the power source.
Store clothing and linens in sealed plastic boxes or bags to protect them from moths and to remove homes for mice and rats.

, Pests frequently enter through poorly sealed windows or doors, or through cracks in walls and floorboards. Removing points of entry is key if you wish to keep your home pest free.


Use silicone caulk to seal any cracks and crevices in baseboards, moldings, cupboards, pipes, ducts, sinks, toilets or electrical outlets.Place screens in front of heating and cooling vents. Repair holes in existing screens.
Install screens and weather-stripping on doors and windows.
Keep vegetation, mulch, stacked firewood, and other debris at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) form your home.
Ensure all cracks, crevices and gaps around pipes and other penetrations on the walls of your home are properly sealed.

, Less toxic pesticides are safer for both you and the environment.


Dust boric acid on cracks and crevices. It is poisonous to crawling insects like ants, cockroaches, and silverfish, but is far less toxic to humans.Try tamper-resistant bait boxes, which are safer than sprays, powders or pellets, all of which spread pesticide residues. Bait boxes are particularly recommended in areas where food, plates, or cookery are stored. Look for bait boxes that use a nonvolatile chemical like boron, and be sure to keep them out of reach of children.Try insecticidal or fatty-acid soaps. They kill soft-bodied insects like fleas and mites on contact, cut are practically harmless to humans and mammals, unless ingested., Avoid frequent application; use them only to target specific threats.Read the label to be sure you have the right pesticide and are using it correctly.


Pesticides labeled “broad spectrum” kill many pests, while those labeled “selective” work only against a few. Read the directions for use to be sure the pesticide will work for you.Start with less toxic pesticides. Check the label for the “signal” word that indicates how dangerous the product is to humans.“Danger” means poisonous or corrosive.
“Warning” means moderately hazardous.
“Caution” means least hazardous.


Never use outdoor pesticides indoors. They last longer and are more volatile. Provide adequate ventilation. Open windows and run fans. If the pesticide requires an unventilated room, leave the house.
Apply sprays to limited areas, such as cracks.
Always remove pots, pans, dishes and food before spraying. Let the spray dry before replacing.
Never dump leftover pesticides in the garbage or down the drain. Check with your public works department about how to dispose of them.

, If preventative measures and over-the-counter pesticides do not work, you may be better off paying for pest control services.

Purchase glasses that can be painted.,
Pick up chalkboard paint and brushes.,
Prepare glasses for painting.,
Paint glasses.,
Use glasses to mark your guest’s name and identify drinks.,
Finished.

",How to Design Chalkboard Wine Glasses," A wine glass with a nice stand is ideal, but all you will be doing is painting a swatch of chalkboard paint on the glass so your guest can write his or her name. Highball glasses are fine (you can paint a swatch along the bottom) if you don’t want to use wine glasses.


Go for a durable glass. Wine glasses can be delicate and can break easily if you don’t purchase a decent grade of glass. For this project, go for quality so that you won’t go through the effort of painting them only to have them break.






Plastic glasses can work for this project. Make sure the glasses are completely clean and free of dust and debris.;
, You will need special paint designed specifically for chalkboard creation, typically found at the local home improvement or hardware store.


Purchase paint brushes that will allow you to paint a small area and make precise strokes.






Grab painter’s tape, which will allow you to make clean and distinct lines on the glasses.







, Tear off a piece of painter’s tape and mark the area where you will paint. Create squares, rectangles or mark off the area along the base of the wine glass for painting.


Inspect the glass to ensure it is clean and the area to be painted is free of dust and debris.







, Consider applying two coats of paint, waiting an ample amount of dry time between coats. Paint evenly as you will be writing on the painted area once it’s completely dry.

, Instead of using a wine charm, provide each guest with a piece of chalk that they can use to mark their drink.

Look for early signs.,
Mow the lawn.,
Water the grass.,
Use insecticide.,
Leave the lawn alone for three days.",How to Control Armyworms1," Because they feed at night, you may not see the caterpillars right away. Brown spots on your lawn are often the first sign that you have an armyworm problem. An increase of the number of birds in your yard may be an indication of armyworms. The earlier you treat the problem, the easier it is to control and less damage a lawn will sustain., Trimming your grass short is perhaps the best way to discourage the presence of armyworms. Consider mowing your lawn a bit shorter than you normally would, and keep it groomed., Watering your grass, especially when done right after mowing, also causes caterpillars to move on to other lawns. Develop a regular watering routine, and remember to also water your grass right after mowing., Spraying the grass with a liquid insecticide is a very effective way to eradicate armyworms. Granular insecticides are generally less effective against armyworms. Choose a liquid insecticide, and follow all manufacturer's instructions (as these can vary from product to product)., After you apply liquid insecticide to your lawn, it is important to avoid mowing and watering for at least three days. This gives the insecticide time to work."

Use identical chairs.,
Use clear cups.,
Use plain silverware.,
Pick appropriate dishes.",How to Create a Minimalist Tablescape3," If you have a hodgepodge of chairs, the visual simplicity will be disrupted. Try to get chairs that are the same color as the table. If you have chairs that are two colors, match one color to the table and the other to the wallpaper and/or the table runner.For instance, if the dining room walls are blue and the table is white, choose blue chairs, white chairs, or blue-and-white chairs.
The ideal chair is made of wood and shows its natural grain. Painted white or black wood is a close second.
Chairs can also be plush and padded in a more modern style, as long as they are white or black.
If you have a long enough table, you might choose to forgo chairs altogether and instead introduce long wooden benches for your diners.

, Colored cups will throw off the minimalist style of the tablescape. They can be short or tall in shape, and it’s okay if they have a few dimples or simple designs across their surface. Avoid clear cups that resemble a mug with a big handle.


Cups should be completely clear glass and free of logos or designs of any sort.

, Unadorned silverware is the only option for a minimalist tablescape. Avoid brass or gold-colored tableware. Look for a tableware set of plain silver, free of filigrees and other decorative elements.One permissible exception to embellishment is wooden (even realistic faux-wooden) handles for the tableware.

, White dishes are the only real option for a minimalist tablescape. White ceramic is clean, modern, and minimalist to the max. White dishes shift attention to the food, which should be the focus of the dining experience.


The plates and bowls should all be of the same color and from the same set.
Choose plates that are smooth and arc up gently toward the lip, without any contrast in texture between the edge and the center of the plate.
Bowls, likewise, should be free of decoration and variation.

Identify the rodents.,
Identify the damages.,
Decide on a control method.",How to Control Moles and Gophers1," Moles and gophers are often confused because they both form tunnels and destroy grass, plants, and soil. Understand the difference between the two so that you know what kind of problem you are facing.


Moles are about six to eight inches long with slim snouts and small eyes and ears. They have gray or black fur and flat feet that look a bit like human hands.Gophers have gray, brown, or white fur, tiny eyes, ears, and whiskers. They do not have the same flat feet that characterize moles. ;
, Moles and gophers tear up your garden and lawn from beneath the ground. Both rodents create tunnels, but gophers can be more destructive. They are known to destroy utility cables and water lines in addition to your plants.


Moles create tunnels often along the edge of a concrete road or a house. The tunnels can sometimes be seen from above ground, but are often invisible and beneath the surface. Tunnel exits show dirt piles that are circular and look like small volcanoes. Gopher tunnels are flatter than mole tunnels and do not run along the edge of man-made surfaces. The dirt mounds are shaped like semi-circles and often appear with a small hole in the center. , Moles and gophers can be controlled in various ways. There are ways to gently repel the rodents from your area. However, you may also consider removing these pests with traps or poisons.


Poisons can be dangerous to your plants and other animals. Be careful and strategic with lethal chemicals.

Identify the pest.,
Keep your yard free of pests by removing hiding places and breeding sites.,
Prepare your garden to limit pests.,
Plant the right mix of plants to combat pests.,
Plant decoys to lure insects away.,
Attract beneficial predators to fight pests.,
Get your hands dirty.,
Use row covers to protect seeded beds, transplants, or young plants.,
Try biochemical pesticides.,
Use pesticides if necessary to combat pest.",How to Control Pests2," While the preventative steps are similar for all types of pests, you will want to focus on certain types of decoy, beneficial predator, or pesticide depending on the pest.

, Piles of wood under or around your home attract ants. Tree clippings, fallen leaves or dropped fruit may harbor insects. Pet droppings attract flies. Standing water breeds mosquitoes.

, A carefully tended garden with good drainage will attract fewer unwanted plants and insects.


Consider a raised bed, particularly for clay soil with poor drainage.
Before planting, try tilling to break up the dirt, and add sand for better drainage.
Clean up debris to remove homes for pests.
Mulch to prevent weeds, but be sure to pull back the mulch from the plants you are growing, as mulch can provide a home for insect pests., Monocultures are a delight for pests, and exotic plants are often vulnerable to local pests. By varying what you plant year-to-year and row to row, you can cut down on pests.


Select healthy seedlings that are appropriate for you area. Native plants, in particular, are frequently more resistant to local pests.
Alternate rows with different types of plants, and mix ornamentals in amongst your edibles.Pests are less likely to spread if another edible plant is not nearby.
Don’t plant the same plants in the same space year after year. That way, you can save your plants from being ravaged by pests that survived the winter.
To get rid of nematodes (worms that eat roots), plant a thick cover of marigolds one season, then turn them under the soil. Next year, you can plant whatever you like with no fear of nematodes., Growing a single decoy weed amongst your cultivated crops can keep them pest free, with a little work.Redroot pigweed will attract blister beetles away from tomatoes. Be sure to check the weed each morning and shake the beetles off into soapy water to get rid of them.
Arugula will attract flea beetles, which also eat eggplant, brassicas, and potatoes. Check the arugula every day and use a handheld vacuum to suck up the beetles.
Planting nasturtiums at the base of tomato plants will attract aphids. Remove the flower and throw it away once it has attracted a good number of aphids.

, Birds and predatory insects can fight unwanted insects without the need for pesticides.


Install a purple martin house. These bird eat many of the larger insects that pray on garden plants.
Plant flowers that will attract beneficial insects, such as wasps that eat caterpillars. Try members of the umbel family: dill, Queen-Anne’s-lace, parsley, and carrots. Sweet alyssum, all kinds of mint, and chamomile are also effective.Your local County Cooperative Extension Service, nursery, or garden association will have more information on how to attract beneficial predators.
Purchase predatory insects or microscopic pathogens such as fungi and bacteria. You can often buy them at your local garden store.

, Use spading, hoeing, and hand picking to remove weeds that provide food and shelter for pests. Set traps for insects and mice.

, They are an excellent barrier against a wide range of pests.When covering seeded beds or transplants, leave plenty of slack in the material to allow for growth, and be sure to bury the edges in the soil so that pests don't sneak in.
You can leave row covers over crops like onions and carrots all season. Other crops, such as beans or cabbage should be uncovered once they are well grown.
Plants like squash that require pollination by insects must be uncovered when they start to flower, or can be hand pollinated.
In hot weather, be sure to remove covers to prevent excessive heat.

, Pesticides like pheromones and juvenile insect hormones can protect your plants, and are harmless to humans., Particularly on edible plants, you will want to use the least toxic pesticide possible to get the job done. Read the label to be sure you have the right pesticide and are using it correctly.


Pesticides labeled “broad spectrum” kill many pests, while those labeled “selective” work only against a few. Read the directions for use to be sure the pesticide will work for you.Check the label for the “signal” word that indicates how dangerous the product is to humans.“Danger” means poisonous or corrosive.

Look for armyworms and/or droppings.,
Mow your hay fields.,
Use insecticide.",How to Control Armyworms2," Look under your plants for armyworms and/or signs of their frass (droppings). You may also find larvae hiding under plant debris. If you are growing barley or wheat, you may find worms inside of the heads.Newly hatched armyworms may have no distinguishing marks, but older armyworms will be either brown with yellow stripes or green with light stripes.
Armyworm droppings resemble black pepper.

, If armyworms have infested your hay field, mowing the field is the first course of action. As the hay dries, the armyworms lose interest in it as a food source and move on., You can apply insecticides to the field using either ground or aerial equipment.The following insecticides have been proven effective on controlling armyworms:


Asana XL should be used only on corn crops and should not be applied within 21 days of harvest.
Permethrin is also only for use on corn and should not be used within 30 days of harvest.
Carbaryl (Sevin) may be applied either to corn or wheat. Do not do more than two applications and do not it apply within 21 days of harvest.
Ethyl is useful for corn, sorghum and all small grains but can only be applied with an aerial application. Do not apply ethyl within 12 days of harvesting corn or sorghum, and within 15 days of harvesting small grains. After you apply the ethyl, post notices that the field is being treated, and stay out of it for three days.
Lorsban can be applied to corn and sorghum. Do not allow livestock to graze in the field for at least 15 days after you apply lorsban. Do not feed meat or dairy animals grains treated with Lorsban until at least 35 days have passed.
Lannate or Malathion can be used on all crops. Do not spray these insecticides within seven days of harvest and stay out of the field for two days after treatment.
Methyl is used for aerial application on corn and small grains only. Do not apply it within 12 days of a corn harvest, or 15 days of a small grain harvest. Post notices in the fields, and stay out of them for two days.
Warrior can be used in corn, sorghum or wheat fields. Do not apply it within 20 days of corn harvest or 30 days of sorghum or wheat harvest."

Watch for moths.,
Release trichogramma wasps.,
Attract beneficial insects and birds.,
Apply neem oil.",How to Control Armyworms3," In order for your natural approach to be effective, you must catch the infestation early. In early spring, begin monitoring for the presence of moths, and/or damage to your plants.Armyworm moths are grey with distinctive white dot on their forewings.
You may choose to set pheromone traps to catch moths. This will allow you to get a better look at their markings.

, If you've caught the problem early in the season (late spring or early summer), you can release trichogramma wasps. These wasps will parasitize and ultimately kill armyworm eggs.You can purchase these wasps from some garden supple stores, or online.

, Unfortunately, the use of pesticides and insecticides can kill beneficial insects, along with armyworms. Instead, by encouraging the presence of these insects, as well as birds, you can naturally keep your armyworm population at bay. You can do this by avoiding the use of insecticides/pesticides, and by planting wildflowers., If the introduction of other pests has not done enough to quell your armyworm problem, try using neem oil spray. Apply neem oil spray to your crops, making sure to cover stems and the undersides of leaves, as well. Avoid watering for at least 1-2 days after application.Neem oil can be destructive to armyworms at various stages of their development.
Additionally, neem oil is anti-fungal.

Do not overwater your soil.,
Use plants.,
Use smells and repellants.,
Create barriers.",How to Control Moles and Gophers2," Gophers and moles are attracted to certain environments. While you may not be able to change aspects of your garden, understanding what attracts rodents can help you get rid of them.


Gophers are attracted to most plants. They are herbivores, and eat any type of plant including garden weeds. They will quickly take advantage of old tunnels, so check your garden for gophers that have moved out.
Moles prefer moist and fertile soil where they can feed off insects, worms, and snails. Don’t attract moles by over watering. Moles especially like grub worms. Manage wet climates by removing grub worms in your soil. , Both moles and gophers tend to stay away from daffodils, marigolds, and castor bean plants. Be careful with castor bean around pets and children. It is considered a poisonous plant. , Both moles and gophers dislike castor oil. Create a rodent repellant using six ounces of castor oil, two tablespoons of dish oil, and a gallon of water. Spray the concentrate throughout the garden, especially after rain.


Gophers are particularly sensitive to smells and sounds. Try putting coffee grounds, fish, or pet waste in the gopher holes. These are all smells that drive gophers away. Additionally, consider using a noise-maker like wind chimes or radios to scare off gophers., Build a fence around the affected area. The fence should stretch two to three feet below the ground and about six to 12 inches above ground.


Use malleable wire fencing. The fence needs to extend beyond the vertical depth of the trench to create a curved “L” shape under ground. This will discourage rodents from digging deeper into your space! The fencing above ground will keep gophers from feasting on your plants. "
"
Use traps.,
Try poisonous baits.,
Attract predators.",How to Control Moles and Gophers3," Once you locate the main tunnels, determine the right trap for your rodent. Some traps require digging, while others can simply be placed near the entrance of the hole. Traps kill the rodent and are recommended for gardens or farms. Traps are reusable, and, unlike baits, they do not present the risk of poisoning other living beings or harming your crops. Try pincher traps, box traps, and black hole traps for gophers. These traps will either choke or smash the gopher causing it to die.Try cinch traps, scissor traps, and chocker loop traps for moles. These traps will either smash, choke, or impale the gopher as it passes through. Avoid live traps. Live traps are not recommended because rodents often urinate and carry lice or ticks. This may later spread disease throughout your area.
Gophers have an acute sense of smell. Wear gloves to cover up your human scent when setting a trap. Wash the trap with dish soap right before placing it in the hole. Afterward, cover the trap with leaves. , There are a number of companies that sell baits for gophers and moles. When used correctly, the rodent will eat the bait and die. Although baits are known to be effective, many warn against the use of chemicals, especially since traps and natural repellants are safer.


Be very careful with poisons. You may accidentally poison your pets or other harmless animals in your area. Poisons may also be dangerous for your crops or flowers., Cats, dogs, snakes, and owls may help you catch a mole or gopher. Predators alone will not always get rid of gophers and moles but they can be used in combination with natural repellants and traps. Set up an owl box or purchase a gopher snake. Gopher snakes are non-venomous and can be placed in mole and gopher tunnels. Be careful when attracting snakes or owls, as they can be harmful to smaller cats and dogs.Cats and dogs may scare off rodents with only their smell. Cats and dogs can be very effective but only if your pet has the personality for it. If you have several active pets, they may catch enough rodents to control the issue."

Open your door or window. The bat is looking for a way out. Open a door and leave it open to give the flying bat a clear path. The bat may sense the fresh air and fly out of your house.;
, Stay out of its way and watch for it to land.

, If the bat lands low, toss a towel carefully over the bat. It will not be able to take off again. The towel should cover the bat without causing injury.

, Keep the bat wrapped inside. You should expect to hear clicking noises when the bat is frightened. It is best to presume that the bat might try to bite through the towel, so put on gloves or oven mitts to be safe.

, If the bat lands high on your wall or ceiling, place a coffee can or plastic container over the bat. Slide the lid of the container cautiously between the bat and wall. Keep the container as close to the wall as possible. Do not pinch the bat.

, Set the trapped bat on the ground some distance from your house. Close your door so that the bat does not accidentally fly inside again.

, Walk away and watch. The bat will attempt a few hops, then become airborne. Bats have some difficulty taking off from the ground.

, If the bat is too tired or scared to take off, you may want to place it near a tree. The bat will climb the tree where it can drop into flight.

, You should wear a leather glove. Do not squeeze too tightly. Place the bat on the trunk of a tree. It will grip the bark and climb away.

, The sound waves will help the bat see the outline of the door and it will fly out on its own. The bat was probably just chasing bugs when it flew into the house.

Catch the lizard if you can.,
Try chasing lizards at night.,
Know the benefits of having lizards around.",How to Chase Lizards out of Your House1," It's no good trying to chase a lizard away when he still has dozens of places to hide. If you see a lizard in a room, clear away the furniture so that the lizard won't just run underneath until you give up and go away. Move couches away from the walls, move benches and chairs, and move anything else that could be a great hiding place for a lizard.


Lizards like to hang out on the walls as well as underneath objects. If you have a lot of clutter on your shelving, take that away so the lizard won't scurry down and hide among your stuff.;
, Close the doors to other rooms in your home and stuff towels in the cracks - lizards are remarkably flexible and can easily squeeze under cracks in doors. Make sure the only open doors and windows are exits to your yard or outside area - otherwise, you'll just be chasing the lizard around your house.

, Lizards are quick little critters, as you've probably learned before when you tried to chase one. It's a lot easier to get lizards to move where you want them to go instead of darting to and fro when you have a friend helping you herd them in a certain direction.


Walk toward the lizard in the direction of the exit. Have your friend block the most likely place where the lizard will try to run.
Keep walking toward the lizard and heading him off when he tries to hide. Move him closer and closer to the exit until he leaves of his own accord.

, When you have a stubborn lizard on your hands, you might have to help him along with a little nudge from a newspaper. Gently tap the lizard in the direction of the exit, and angle the newspaper so the lizard can't run in the wrong direction. Don't hit or smash the lizard with the newspaper - be careful not to hurt him.


Some people find that lizards are afraid of peacock feathers. Try using a peacock feather to sweep the lizard along if you have one handy. It couldn't hurt!

, Some people have found that spraying cold water from a water bottle helps move lizards along more quickly. Fill a water bottle with ice and water and give the lizard a light squirt. The lizard will want to leave the premises as soon as possible.

, If you've got a slow lizard on your hands, you might be able to trap him and release him outside, rather than having to chase him around the house. Find a jar large enough to trap the lizard and get a stiff piece of cardboard. Trap the lizard under the jar and scoot the cardboard under the jar until the lizard is standing on it. Pick up the lizard and take him outside, then lift the jar and release him.

, Some lizards come out more often at night, and that's the easiest time to chase them. If you tend to see lizards around when the sun goes down, chase them out at night instead of waiting until daytime.

, While the sight of a lizard hanging out in your living room might be disconcerting, many view this as a welcome occurrence. Lizards help humans by eating pesky insects that make our lives more difficult, like flies and crickets. Not only that, a lizard in the house is said to be a sign of good luck. If you can handle sharing your space with a little lizard, consider letting him chill out in your house for awhile.

Keep your house clean.,
Remove any open or leftover food from around the house.,
Expose problem areas.,
Get a cat.,
Seal the house.",How to Chase Lizards out of Your House2," Lizards go where they can find food - which, for them, means insects. If you have a big insect population in your house, lizards will start to gather there. Keeping your house clean is the best way to keep insects out. Make sure you sweep and vacuum regularly, and don't let dirty dishes and dusty clutter pile up too much.

, Along the same lines, having food crumbs and leftovers around the house can attract insects and lead to lizards coming inside. Clean up all leftover food and make sure your surfaces don't have crumbs sitting around.

, Take note of where in the house you have seen the lizard: which rooms, which corners, under what furniture. Moving the furniture and cleaning that area might help it seem less attractive to lizards.

, Cats like to eat lizards just like they love mice. Having a predator around will surely keep your lizard population manageable.

, Lizards might be getting in through cracks underneath your doors and alongside your windows. Make sure your house is completely sealed to keep them from coming in.


Patch holes in your home with hardware cloth to keep lizards out.
Use caulk and door seals to make it more difficult for critters to come in.
Have screens on your windows and make sure they close tightly.

Consider the theme of the wedding.,
Find decorative objects that can hold place cards.,
Choose reception favors that are within your budget.",How to Choose Placeholders That Serve As Reception Favors," Because placeholders are not only purposeful, but are also a decorative element, it is important that they compliment the wedding's color scheme and theme. For example, if the wedding reception is an outside garden party, floral-printed frames might be more appropriate favors than stately candlestick holders.;
, There are a number of places where you may look to find placeholders for your reception, such as online wedding supply stores, craft stores, retailers and/or wholesalers. Anything can be used as a wedding reception placeholder, as long as you can put a name on it. Consider the following ideas:


Frames make great wedding reception gifts, as you can insert guests' name cards in them to serve as placeholders, and guests can take them home to use as picture frames.
Statuettes can be personalized to function as placeholders. You may opt to hang name tags on the figures, or choose figures that can hold place cards with guests' names on them.
Utilitarian items like jewelry boxes, photo albums and planters can double as placeholders and reception favors. Simply print, stencil or engrave your guests' names on the items and put them at each place setting.
Edibles can be used as placeholders. For example, you may opt to use candy bars with the wedding details and the guests' names printed on the wrappers, wrap candies in decorative sacks tied with name tags or use icing to write names on cookies.

, The larger your budget, the more expensive your favors should be. A good rule of thumb is to spend at least $2.50 per guest, but you may be able to spend more, considering your favors will be doing double-duty as placeholders.

Consider some night hunting and shifting.",How to Naturally Deter Scorpions,"  While this method may not be effective against scorpion infestations, it works well if you just have the occasional unwanted 'guest'. Scorpions tend to be found around water sources, so a great place to look with care is around your sink, shower recess, or bathtub in the bathroom, and around similar wet areas in the laundry and kitchen. If you find a scorpion, it's just a matter of covering them with a wide enough plastic container, sliding a piece of cardboard under the container to cover it, and then transporting the 'guest' outside.


If you have a bug catcher, consider using that device instead of the plastic container and cardboard sheet.
If you don't want to return the scorpion to the wild, humanely kill it quickly by a swift crush with the boot. Use a fly swatter to collect the squashed body. However, consider returning the scorpion to its natural habitat rather than killing it because it is a beneficial predator.;
, Caulk around all holes and other entrance possibilities where your pipes and other plumbing enters rooms in your home. Start from the basement upward, and seal all the areas around pipes, drains, fittings, walls, vents, etc., where a scorpion might gain access to the house. This includes ceiling fixtures because scorpions can climb.Pour bleach down the drains of your septic system. Do this on a weekly basis if you have noticed scorpions crawling up the drain to gain access to your home. Use 2 tablespoons weekly to deter the crawling in.
Look outside too. Check the mesh over the dryer vent and any holes around it. Check everywhere that cables, wires, and pipes enter the house, as well as for any holes in the walls, doors, and windows. Your heating and air-conditioning outlets should also be checked.
Install weather-stripping around loose-fitting windows and doors. Be sure that all window and door screens are in good conditions, free of holes or tears.
Fix leaky faucets, pipes, and any other dripping sources of water.

, Allow non-harmful pest-catching spiders to reside in your home. They may well try to kill scorpions that come near them. However, be sure to remove insect sources of food such as crickets, cockroaches, cicadas, and ants., The fresh plants seem to have a better effect than oils or dried plants though. It's quite easy to grow and maintain, and smells wonderful.



Citrus is also considered to be another deterrent. You could grow citrus in pots near your entrance areas and use citrus oil cleaners in bathroom and other wet zones of the house.

, Move woodpiles out of, and away from, your home. Another natural method is to get rid of scorpion hiding places. They love piles of firewood, rocks, and lumber, and can also be found in compost heaps. If it is an option, move these scorpion havens further away from your home, you should have less intruders.


Keep the lawn mowed at all times, and prune bushes and overhanging branches to keep these away from your house, garage, and shed walls.
Rest garbage containers and compost containers on bricks or other items that push them up above ground level. Add mesh to the base of the compost bin; this will also keep out rodents.

, Cats have been known to catch and kill scorpions around the home, and some dogs will as well. You may think it as cruel, but it is a very natural method to rid your home of creepy-crawlies. However, not everyone likes this method for fear of harm to the pet, so don't allow this to happen if the scorpion is really venomous and could harm your pet (most scorpions in the USA are not highly dangerous, see ""Tips"" for dangerous zones); usually it's okay provided the pet is naturally fast and predatory.Never force a pet to catch a scorpion. Only some pets will innately and willingly go for a scorpion, and will have the courage to do what is needed.
Set your chickens onto eating up the bugs that scorpions consider to be food. Chickens aren't fussy – they'll also munch up a scorpion that crosses their path., If you're willing to manually shift scorpions from your yard, this can be done at night. Scorpions fluoresce under ultra-violet light, so use a black light or an ultra-violet light to look for them. Also, wear sturdy boots and use long barbecue tongs to collect the scorpions into a container for removal from your yard. Release them into the local desert, forest, grasslands, or wherever their natural habitat is rather than killing them because they are beneficial to the ecosystem.

Take out the trash.,
Move fruit to the refrigerator.,
Seal off your home.",How to Use Home Remedies to Get Rid of Gnats1,"


Eggs are usually laid in damp, over-watered plants, and gnat larvae need to develop in moist organic material. Eggs and larvae will dry out and die if exposed to dry conditions.
The infested plant may show early signs of withering, but this is unavoidable. The soil needs to be at least this dry in order to stop adult gnats from breeding.
You can allow existing adult gnats to die off on their own, or you can kill them with fly swatters, rolled up magazines, or other home remedies.;
, If letting the soil dry out does not get rid of the gnats, you may need to completely remove the plant from its current pot and into a fresh, clean pot with new soil.


Carefully remove the plant from its current pot. Use your fingers or a soft brush to remove as much of the soil as possible.
Using fresh soil is essential since the gnats may have laid eggs in the old soil.
Check the plant itself for signs of decay. Gnats are attracted to fungus and decaying plant matter, so if the bulb or roots appear to be decaying, the plant might be beyond saving. Try to remove as much of the dead plant matter as possible, and if there is still enough of the plant left for it to live, proceed with the re-potting.
Transfer the plant into a pot of similar size and material. Make sure that the pot is filled with fresh soil.
Clean out the old pot with hot water and soap. To sanitize it further, you can use a stronger solution made from one part bleach and four to five parts water.

, Throw away rotting fruit and other decayed organic material. Remove the trash from your garbage and set it outside on the curb.


Gnats are attracted to decaying organic material. As a result, rotting fruit and old, tossed out food are highly appealing to them. Removing these food sources will deter the gnats from hanging around that area.

, Fresh fruit should be stored in sealed containers or in the refrigerator.


Gnats can be attracted to fruit left in the open even before it begins visibly decaying. Keeping fruit in an area that gnats cannot get to will also deter them from coming around.

, Make sure that there are no holes in your window screens and that your windows and doors seal tightly.


Gnats are tiny and can take advantage of even small holes in a screen. Similarly, even small gaps at the bottom of the door can invite gnats in from the outdoors.

Use rotten fruit.,
Sacrifice some wine.,
Try apple cider vinegar.,
Make a dish soap trap.,
Make a beer trap.,
Use a bottle of soda.,
Try using yeast.,
Hang up some fly strips.",How to Kill Fruit Flies1," Your fruit fly problem probably didn’t start until you realized you left out some fruit that eventually rotted. Use the method that gathered the flies in the first place to capture them again, but, this time, lead them to a more morbid end. Place a piece of rotting fruit in a bowl, and stretch clear plastic over the top. Cut several small holes into the plastic using a toothpick, and leave it near the site of the flies. They will be attracted to the scent, but unable to get out.;
, Humans aren’t the only ones attracted to wine. Fruit flies flock to this alcohol as well. Thankfully the perfect fly-catcher is ready made anytime you crack open a bottle. Empty the bottle so that there is an inch or less of wine at the bottom. Leave this out near where the flies are gathering; they will fly in, but the funnel-effect of the bottleneck will keep them trapped.

, Apple cider vinegar is a great household product to have around, as it works in many ways around your home. Included in its abilities is the capacity to kill fruit flies after an outbreak. Pour some of the vinegar into a cup, and add a plastic or paper funnel to the top. The funnel will block off most of the entrance, allowing a space large enough for the flies to enter but too small for the less-than-intelligent flies to exit. For an extra measure, add a bit of dish soap to the vinegar to create a fly poison., When added to a sweet solution, dish soap cannot be detected by fruit flies. The chemicals present in the soap will act as a poison and kill the unwary flies. Fill a jar with a mixture of vinegar (any kind) with sugar - it doesn’t matter in what proportion. Add in a squirt of dish soap and mix the solution well. The flies should be attracted to the sweet and sour scent, but will die when they consume the soapy poison.

, Turns out fruit flies have a thing for lots of alcohol, not just wine. Grab a mason jar and fill it halfway with any kind of beer. Use a hammer and nail to puncture the metal lid several times, creating 3-5 holes. Screw the cap back on and leave the trap where the flies congregate. The beer can be dumped out every few days and replaced to catch more flies., If you already drink soda, then you’re in luck. Grab a bottle of soda (any kind, although colas tend to work well) and hammer a hole through the plastic lid. Empty the soda so that there is only an inch or less remaining in the bottom of the bottle. Replace the lid, and watch the flies swarm!

, This one may sound strange, but a concoction of yeast may do the trick in capturing and killing fruit flies. Fill a glass halfway with warm water and 1 teaspoon of sugar, and pour in some active dry yeast. Mix the solution (prepare for it to bubble!) and then cover the entire glass with plastic wrap. Poke holes in the top to let the flies in, but make sure they are small enough so that the flies can’t get back out., Undoubtedly the least attractive of the trapping methods, fly strips work wonders on capturing fruit flies. These ultra-sticky strips will attract flies and trap them the instant they set foot on the tape. Try hanging your strips in a less obtrusive setting than perhaps directly over your kitchen sink for the most appealing set-up.

Fill a jar with water and dish detergent.Add enough liquid dish soap to the jar to cover the bottom.,
Knock the stink bug into the jar.,
Flush the dead bugs.",How to Kill a Stink Bug1," Fill half of the jar with warm water and stir to mix.


Any liquid dish soap will work, regardless of how mild it is or what additional chemicals it may contain.
The right size container will depend on how many stink bugs you intend to capture. A small custard cup or ramekin is enough if you only plan on killing a few of the pests, but a larger jar or small bucket should be used if you plan on taking care of a major infestation all at once.;
, When you come across a stink bug, flick it off its post with a popsicle stick or chopstick and down into the soapy solution.









Work quickly. Some species of stink bugs can fly and may escape if you do not manage to flick it off in one fell swoop.
Stink bugs should drown within 20 to 40 seconds. The bugs breathe through pores beneath their waxy exterior shells, and when soap plugs these pores up, the bugs suffocate.
You could also wear disposable gloves and pick up the stink bugs by hand. Similarly, you could pick them up with tweezers. Picking them up directly ensures that they will not be able to escape, but they may release their odor if you do not work quickly.

, After you collect a few stink bugs in your soapy water, flush the contents of the jar down the toilet to dispose of the bugs and the dirty water.









Wait until you collect a few stink bugs instead of flushing them individually in order to save water.

Get price quotes from a few different companies.,
Check if the company and its technicians are fully licensed.,
Ask what other qualifications the company and the technicians have.,
Ask about previous experience.,
Find out the company's procedure for getting rid of pests.,
Ask what is involved in their services.,
Find out how much insurance the company carries.,
Ask about their service guarantee.",How to Choose Commercial Pest Control,"


Call around and ask companies for price quotes. You can also ask for professional references. Any company that has been in business long and has a reputable history should be able to provide you with a list of satisfied commercial clients.;
,


When inquiring with pest control companies, ask to see their license details. They should be able to show you a current license number or certificate. You can check with the licensing body named on their license or certificate to ensure that it is legitimate. Ask if they have any technicians that hold only training licenses and make sure that it is the company's policy that these technicians be supervised by fully licensed technicians. Be wary of companies that do not display or offer this information; they may not be licensed or their license may have expired.

,


Many pest controllers are required to be accredited in installation and system monitoring as well as holding a general license. In addition, some technicians may have first aid training and child safety certificates.

,


Find out how long the company has been in business. Also, check how long each technician has been licensed and working in pest control, and find out what experience they have specifically regarding commercial pest control.

,


Each company can differ in their method for exterminating pests. Ask if they treat more than 1 entry point and what kind of bait and poison they use. Find out if their chemicals are toxic and if it is safe for you and your clients after the treatment.

,


You may get quotes from different companies, but you should also compare what that price includes. They will get rid of the pests, but some companies will include extras such as regular monitoring.

,


At minimum, a pest control company should have general liability. This is to protect their customers in case something should go wrong. They should be able to present you a copy of their insurance certificate upon request.

,


Most commercial pest control companies will offer some sort of guarantee in their services. This conveys confidence that they can do the job correctly and thoroughly. They should also offer a warranty on their services and a money back guarantee in the event that their work fails.

Fill a jar with cider vinegar.,
Cover the jar with plastic wrap.,
Poke holes in the plastic.,
Position these traps around the house.",How to Use Home Remedies to Get Rid of Gnats2," The jar should be filled at least halfway with vinegar.


White vinegar can also be used, but apple cider vinegar tends to work better at attracting gnats due to the mild apple aroma.
Similarly, you can prepare a mixture made from 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cider vinegar, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) sugar, a couple drops of dish soap, and 1 quart (1 liter) of water. This can be used instead of straight vinegar.
You can use any container with a wide mouth. A jar is generally a good choice, but a cup, bowl, or similar container would also work.

, Make sure that the plastic wrap is securely fixed onto the top of the jar.


If necessary, wrap a rubber band around the mouth of the jar and over the ends of the plastic wrap to hold the wrap in place.
The plastic wrap should be taut across the mouth of the jar.

, Use a fork or toothpick to create several small holes in the plastic wrap.


The smell of the vinegar will attract the gnats, causing them to fly into the jar. Once inside, the gnats will be trapped.

, Place one of these jars in every area where gnats swarm.


Add more vinegar to the jar every two to four days. The smell of fresh vinegar attracts gnats better than that of vinegar sitting out for several days.
Empty out the jars as necessary. As the jars fill up with dead gnats, you may need to dump the contents, wash, and refill.

Cover a yellow index card with honey.,
Attach a chopstick to the card.,
Place the card in the soil of an infested plant.",How to Use Home Remedies to Get Rid of Gnats3," Smear the front of a yellow index card with a thin layer of honey.


In theory, the color yellow attracts gnats. If you do not have yellow index cards, you could also try another bright color, or you could paste yellow construction paper onto a white index card.
Instead of the honey, you could also use another sticky substance, like petroleum jelly or a paste made from equal parts petroleum jelly and liquid dish soap. The honey smells sweet, which will help attract gnats, but other sticky substances may still work.

, Tape a stick to the back of the card so that at least half of the stick extends below the bottom edge of the card.


A popsicle stick or straw would also work.
Do not attach the stick to the honey-covered side of the card.

, Fix the stick into the soil so that the honey-coated side of the card faces out.


Fix one of these cards into the soil of each problematic plant.
Replace the card once it fills up with dead gnats.

Create a soap solution.,
Soak the plant with this solution.,
Rinse the leaves.",How to Use Home Remedies to Get Rid of Gnats4," Mix 2 Tbsp (30 ml) lemon-scented liquid dish soap with 1 gallon (4 liters) of water in a spray bottle.


Alternatively, you could just add a few drops of dish soap to the water you use to water your plants.
If you do not have lemon-scented dish soap, just about any other type will also work. Avoid dish soaps with too many harsh chemicals, however, since these may damage the plant.

, Spray soil, leaves, and stems of infested plants with the soapy water.


The soap should kill the gnats, rather than merely driving them away.

, After an hour or so passes, mist the leaves and stem of the plant with clean water to rinse the soap off.


If you do not perform this step, the soap could gradually cause harm to the plant.

"
"
Prepare an alcohol solution.,
Test the solution on your plants.,
Spray infested plants with the solution.",How to Use Home Remedies to Get Rid of Gnats5," Mix a little rubbing alcohol or drinking alcohol with water inside a large spray bottle.


Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) vodka with 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of water.
As another option, you can mix 1 cup (250 ml) rubbing alcohol with 1 quart (1 liter) of water.
As a third option, you can mix 1 Tbsp (15 ml) apple cider vinegar with 1 tsp (5 ml) wine and 1 cup (250 ml) water.

, Spray one leaf with the solution and let it sit for several days. If it does not burn the leaf, it should be safe for the plant.


If the solution does burn the leaf, you can try diluting the alcohol further by using more water.

, Gently mist the leaves, flowers, stems, and soil of gnat-ridden plants with the alcohol solution.


Repeat this treatment every three days for two weeks, or until the gnat problem dies down.
Alternatively, place this solution in a bowl near your plants. If you are unable to make the solution mild enough for your plants, you can place it in a small dish near the infested plant. Some gnats will drown in the mixture after being drawn in, while others will be driven away.

Pour a little vegetable oil into your drain.If you have flies coming from your garbage disposal or another drain, pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of vegetable oil into the drain.,
Tape the drain closed.,
Remove the tape the following day.",How to Use Home Remedies to Get Rid of Gnats6,"


Apply the vegetable oil around the edge of the drain so that it glides down into the pipe, clinging to the sides.

, Place several strips of clear tape over the drain, sticky-side down, sealing it off completely.


Allow the tape to remain on the drain for roughly 24 hours.

, Peel off each strip of tape the next day. Gnats should be stuck on the bottom.


If you do not catch any gnats this way, you can try again, this time leaving a small gap of open space in the layer of tape. Sometimes, insects will not fly upward unless they feel a draft of air coming from the opening.
Repeat this procedure as often as necessary until you no longer spot any gnats coming out of your drain.

Remove appealing breeding grounds.,
Kill their eggs.,
Grow some fresh basil indoors.,
Use cedar wood.,
Spritz some essential oils.",How to Kill Fruit Flies2," Fruit flies are, pretty obviously, attracted to fruit. However, they will flock to any generally dirty area and most rotten foods. Try to throw out bad foods immediately, and keep your trashcan area and drains clean and old-food-free. This will lower the temptation of turning your house into a breeding ground.

, If your flies have gotten to the point where they are noticeable, its likely that they have already laid eggs somewhere in your house. Fruit flies like moist areas, so the culprit locations are typically kitchen and bathroom sink and shower drains. Pour a bacterial digester down your drain to kill off any eggs that may be there. If you don’t have any on hand, bleach can work as a substitute, but being so thin and runny it may not stick well enough to the eggs to kill them., Strangely enough, fruit flies don’t like basil. If you want to use your green thumb to keep this herb fresh and on hand, you will also manage to keep fruit flies out. Grow basil in a small pot and keep it in your house where the flies seem to congregate. Kept near a bowl of fruit, the flies will be less likely to appear in the future.

, Another strange natural remedy, fruit flies are repelled by the scent of cedar wood. Find a way to keep some in your home, either as decoration or for use in a fire, and your fruit fly population should diminish. Keep pieces of it stashed around your kitchen and near breeding grounds to scare the flies away.

, Improve the aroma of your house and ward off flies and other insects by spraying your home regularly with certain essential oils. The scent of lemongrass oil and lavender are repulsive to fruit flies and many other bugs, and cause them to avoid congregating in the area. Mix 10 drops of one of the oils with 2 ounces of hot water, and mist all the rooms of your house with it."

Make a sticky swatter.,
Use a blow dryer.,
Burn a little incense.,
Use a vacuum cleaner.",How to Kill Fruit Flies3," Like most people, your first response to seeing a lot of fruit flies is to want to swat them. Unfortunately for us, their small size makes them incredibly difficult to swat. To fix this problem, make a homemade sticky swatter. Grab a styrofoam plate, and coat it with a thick layer of cooking spray. As you swat the tiny flies, they will get caught in the oil and stick to the plate, eventually dying.

, If you want to exact your revenge on those annoying little flies, pull out your hair dryer and get at them! Turn your blow dryer on so that the air is blowing away from the fans. The suction from the other side will suck up the flies, where they will be burned in the inner heater. A bit gruesome, sure. But your flies should disappear pretty quickly.

, The very small respiratory systems of fruit flies are delicate, and require a constant supply of clean air. This means that inhaled irritants, such as smoke, can kill them quickly. Although you can’t set a fire in your house, you can burn incense. The smoke and perfume put off by these sticks will lead your flies into a slow death.

, Use a cleaner that has a flexible cylinder (and the better the suction, the more effective the solution will be). It should also have a wide nozzle.

Set one of the fruit traps out. When the fruit flies congregate, slowly move in.
If the flies have been sitting for a while, they don't fly away quickly as opposed to when they just landed. Suck them up quickly, then dispose of the contents outside.
The main thing is: for example, if the bag is full, the suction won't be strong and it will be almost useless to make the effort.

Fill a spray bottle with soapy water.Combine 32 oz (1 liter) of warm water with 3/4 cup (180 ml) liquid dish detergent.,
Spray the solution on bugs and along cracks.",How to Kill a Stink Bug2,"









As before, any liquid dish detergent will work regardless of potency or added chemicals.
Shake the bottle well to make sure that the soap and water are combined.

, Douse any bugs you cannot knock down with the spray and apply the solution along any area you suspect the stink bugs might come in through.









Even though this does not work as quickly as drowning the insects does, the soap with react with the waxy coating on the exterior of the stink bug, breaking that coating down and ultimately dehydrating the pest.
Stink bugs usually sneak in through cracks, windows, doors, and vents. Spray a heavy coating of this solution around those areas so that invading stink bugs will walk through it and eventually die.

"
"
Be aware of the risks.While traditional insecticides may kill stink bugs, there are health risks and other potentially negative consequences involved.,
Spray the stink bug as you see it.,
Apply residual insecticides.Following label instructions, sprinkle or spray the product in any area you suspect the stink bugs to be hiding in.,
Use a perimeter insecticide outdoors.,
Use a nicotine solution.",How to Kill a Stink Bug3,"









Insecticides are poisonous to humans and pets as well as stink bugs. Keep them out of reach of small children and pets, and strictly follow the application instructions on the label.
Residual dust treatments can kill many stink bugs, but the bugs may die in hard-to-reach places as a result of the delayed effect. Carpet beetles and other pests may invade your home to feed on the dead bugs afterward.
Aerosol foggers will kill stink bugs, but the effect only lasts for a limited amount of time, and any stink bugs that enter the area after the room is aired out will not be killed.
Only use insecticides that are labeled to kill stink bugs. Otherwise, you run the risk of choosing a chemical that is not effective against these particular pests.

, Use a ""kills on contact"" aerosol insecticide to attack stink bugs as you see them.









Understand that ""on contact"" is not necessarily as instantaneous as the term would imply. These chemicals usually begin to attack the stink bug's nervous system after they dry, but it could take several hours after initial contact before the bug dies.

,









Residual sprays tend to work best when sprayed along window sills, doorways, and baseboards.
Residual dusts tend to work better when dusting the attic, crawl spaces, or interior wall space.

, Spray an outdoor residual pesticide along the ground around your home's foundation.









Stink bugs always invade from the outdoors, so any stink bug entering your home for the first time will be affected and killed.

, Soak a pack of shredded cigarettes in 1 gallon (4 liters) of warm water. Strain the solution and mix in 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of dish detergent.









Fill a spray bottle with this solution and thoroughly coat the stink bug with it.
The liquid dish detergent allows the solution to stick to the insect more effectively, and the nicotine poisons the stink bug.
Wear disposable gloves as you work with the nicotine solution to avoid accidentally absorbing the poison through your skin.

Paralyze stink bugs with hairspray.Attack each stink bug with hairspray as you see it to stop the pest from moving around.,
Kill the bugs with rubbing alcohol, bleach, or ammonia.,
Kill the bug with wart remover.,
Spray the stink bug with hot sauce.,
Drop candle wax remover on the stink bug.,
Use white vinegar.",How to Kill a Stink Bug4,"









The hairspray alone will not kill the stink bug, but it will immobilize it, preventing the bug from roaming about freely and making it easier to apply a chemical that will kill the bug.
Make sure to use the stickiest hairspray possible. Thankfully, cheap brands are usually stickier than expensive brands.

, Fill a glass jar halfway with one of these chemicals and knock or drop the stink bugs into the jar as you come across them.









Do not mix these chemicals for any reason. Combining these chemicals can produce fumes that are deadly to humans.
Knock the stink bugs into the solution using a popsicle stick or gloved hand, or pick the bugs up with tweezers.
You could also dilute one part rubbing alcohol with three parts water inside a spray bottle. Attack stink bugs with this solution as you see them. The alcohol will wear away at the exterior of the insect, drying it out and eventually destroying it.

, Buy a can of freeze away wart remover and spray it directly on the stink bug. The bug will freeze instantly and all you need to do is flush them down the toilet.








, Fill a spray bottle with hot sauce or liquified hot peppers. Squirt each stink bug with the spicy insecticide as you see it.









Hot peppers are capable of burning human skin and eyes if handled improperly. Similarly, the peppers can burn away the waxy exterior of the stink bug, ultimately destroying it.
Wash your hands after handling hot peppers and hot sauce to avoid accidentally irritating your eyes.

, Place a single drop of candle wax remover on the back of an individual stink bug. The insect should die within one or two minutes.









You might be able to apply the candle wax remover to the stink bug without capturing it, but be aware that accidentally getting the remover onto carpet or other surfaces may create a stain. For best results, immobilize the insect with hair spray or trap it inside a glass jar before applying the remover.
The candle wax remover strips away the waxy coating on the outside of the stink bug's shell, thereby breaking down interior membranes.

, Place a tablespoonful / teaspoonful of white vinegar in a container; use a container that is not too large.









Capture the stink bug using tweezers, an empty medicine container with cap, and/or use gloves.
Put the bug or bugs into the vinegar. They die immediately without releasing their bomb.
Flush the critters down the toilet.

Vacuum the stink bug up.When you see one or more stink bugs, suck them up using an upright vacuum with a bag.,
Set up an insect electrocution system.,
Lay out glue traps.,
Freeze the insects to death.Trap the stink bugs in a resealable plastic freezer bag or airtight, freezer-safe container.,
Put a glass over the bug and leave it till it kills itself on it's own toxic emissions.",How to Kill a Stink Bug5,"


The stink bugs will release their odor inside the vacuum, causing the machine to stink for several weeks. Sprinkle the interior of the vacuum with a strong deodorizer to minimize this effect.
Avoid using bagless vacuum cleaners. Use vacuums with bags and dispose of the bag after you finish sucking up the bugs.
Alternatively, wrap a knee-high stocking around the outside of the vacuum tube and secure it in place with a rubber band. Stuff the rest of the stocking into the tube and suck the stink bugs up as usual. This will prevent the bugs from passing through the vacuum filter.

, Place a bug zapper in a dark attic or closet.


Like most insects, stink bugs are drawn to sources of light. By placing the device in a dark room, the light of the electrocution system becomes more appealing to the stink bugs. As they approach the light, they are instantly electrocuted and die before they have the chance to release their stink.
Make sure that you sweep up or vacuum up the dead stink bugs after several days pass.

, Spread flypaper or other sticky traps near windows, doorways, vents, and cracks.


The stink bugs will get caught on the traps as they pass over them. Without being able to search out food, the insects will starve to death.
Throw out the glue trap after you have gathered several stink bugs.
Be aware of the fact that stink bugs may release their odor upon becoming stuck to the trap.

, Place the container in a freezer for several days to kill them.


Make sure that the container or bag has a tight seal. Otherwise, you run the risk of contaminating the contents of your freezer.

, Quickly pick up the glass. Sweep the dead bug into the garbage.

Make sure you do this outside because the chemical will build up and you can actually see the brown fumes.

Remove debris from around your home.",How to Keep Spiders and Scorpions Out of Your House Using Natural Products," Essential oils, while quite pleasant smelling to humans, have been proven very useful in repelling spiders and scorpions. The smells can be overwhelming to their sensitive senses and keep them from infiltrating the area.Some of the most effective essential oils in combating spiders and scorpions include peppermint, tea tree, neem, and citrus.
Some recommend lavender for use in repelling spiders and scorpions, but results are mixed. It’s probably best to focus your essential oil purchases on peppermint, citrus, neem, or tea tree.;
, Create your own spider and scorpion repellant by making a spray to use around your home. In a clean spray bottle, combine 5-7 drops of essential oils (you can use peppermint, lavender, tea tree, or citrus) with some warm water.Spray the mixture around your home, focusing specifically on areas that spiders and scorpions prefer like under furniture, in corners, around mounted light fixtures, and other out-of-the-way spaces.
You can also add a teaspoon of white vinegar or eco-friendly dish soap to make the mixture additionally effective.

, Diatomaceous earth is an inexpensive powder composed of the fossilized remains of diatoms, a kind of algae. It works as a repellant for spiders and scorpions (and other bugs) by absorbing all of the moisture out of its surroundings, including the unwanted pests infesting your home. This causes the spiders and scorpions to dehydrate and die.Simply sprinkle the diatomaceous earth around areas where you notice the pests – under furniture, in the cellar, and around windowsills.
Make sure you purchase the food-grade diatomaceous earth to ensure that it is safe for use in your home.

, Place a few drops of eco-friendly dish soap on a paper towel or sponge and wipe down some of the surfaces in your home. Pay special attention to difficult to reach places like the tops of cabinets, ceiling fans, and the backs of mantles or shelves.Alternatively, you can use a few drops of vinegar or essential oils to wipe down the surfaces in your home to repel spiders and scorpions.

, Dish soap has long been used in the fight against scorpion and spider home invasions. Keeping your counters wiped down with eco-friendly dish soap will go a long way in protecting your home from spider and scorpion invaders.While regular dish soap may include some unsavory chemicals that you don’t want to go smearing all over your house, most eco-friendly versions are readily available and contain more natural ingredients.
When choosing eco-friendly dish soaps, make sure you steer clear of harsh, potentially toxic preservatives. Instead check the label for paraben-free preservatives like methylisothiazolinone, benzisothiazolinone, or phenoxyethanol.

, The strong smell of vinegar works very effectively at repelling scorpions and spiders. The acidic makeup of the vinegar makes these pests want to avoid coming anywhere near it. Pour a few drops of vinegar on a paper towel or sponge and wipe down your counters and other surfaces in your home.You should use white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or malt vinegar for best results.

, When using the spray or wipe down method, be sure to focus on any regions that could provide access to your home from the outdoors. Spray or wipe down baseboards, windowsills, and the casings of all doors that lead outside.These areas are the places where spiders and scorpions enter your home. So if you make them unappealing to the pests, they may retreat and stay away from your house.

, Scorpions and spiders thrive in dusty corners and unused spaces that accumulate dirt. One of the easiest ways to keep your home free of these invaders is to dust the surfaces of your home regularly. Try to thoroughly dust your home once every week or so, with extra in-depth dusting once per month.You can use one of those long-handled feather dusters for the hard-to-reach areas of your home.
Make sure to get the tops of cabinets, ceiling fan blades, baseboards, and remove any cobwebs that might have appeared around the ceiling and air vents.

, Use your vacuum once every week or so to vacuum your entire house. This will help eliminate the creation of dirty floor areas for spiders and scorpions to hide in. Vacuum the floors thoroughly, making sure to cover the entire space – even the corners of rooms and on the stairs.If you don’t have carpet, you can consider sweeping or mopping to clean the floors instead.
Remember to move furniture so that you can vacuum under it. Spiders and scorpions love the dusty areas under couches and coffee tables.

, Spiders and scorpions love to hide in undisturbed, out-of-the-way parts of your home. Some of the most common places to find these little pests are in spaces that you use for storage – like the top shelf of your bathroom cabinet, the bottom of your closet, or that drawer in the kitchen you use for all of your miscellaneous junk. Try organizing these spaces so that there is less clutter, giving spiders and scorpions fewer hidey holes to get comfy in.Use plastic storage bins with sealable lids to store and organize various items in your closet.
Throw away things you don’t use – such as old bottles of perfume and lotion in the bathroom, old makeup supplies, or old kitchen utensils – to minimize the clutter and create more usable, open space.

, In order to keep spiders and scorpions out of your home, you’ll need to minimize their access to the interior of your house. This means sealing up any exposed cracks that could offer them entry to your home. Use caulk and a caulk gun to fill in any cracks you see in your walls – inside or outside.You can purchase caulk at any home improvement store.
Make sure you get the caulking material fully inside the entire crack.
Let it dry completely before touching it. This usually takes about 24 hours.

, Scorpions are naturally repelled by the scent of cedar oil. So a great way to keep them out of your yard and away from your home is by spreading cedar chips around your yard.You should be able to purchase cedar chips at any home improvement or garden store.
Simply sprinkle the cedar chips around your yard – in flowerbeds, around the base of your house, along sidewalks, around the perimeter of your fence, etc.

, Another major thing that attracts spiders and scorpions is a messy yard with lots of places to hide. Once the pests are in your yard, it won’t be long before they start infiltrating your home. Maintaining your outdoor space will help prevent spiders and scorpions from getting inside your house.Rake up leaves quickly, remove tall grasses and weeds, and keep necessary outdoor storage (sheds, stacks of firewood, etc.) as far from your actual house as possible.

Use neem oil.",How to Get Rid of Stink Bugs Naturally1," Spread this chalky powder both outside and inside, focusing on entryways like windows and doors along with other areas where stink bugs seem to gather.


Diatomaceous Earth is a natural sedimentary rock. It contains silica, alumina, and iron oxide.
The powder is used as a pesticide against a variety of insects, including stink bugs. It works by breaking down the waxy protective layer on an insect's exoskeleton, essentially causing the insect to dehydrate.
Look for Diatomaceous Earth that has not been heat-treated, since it tends to lose effectiveness as a pesticide when it is treated.
You can also dust any stink bugs you see with the powder directly, in addition to spreading the powder out in areas where stink bugs gather.;
, Mix 2 cups (500 ml) water with 4 tsp (20 ml) garlic powder in a spray bottle. Spray this solution onto plant leaves, windowsills, and other areas stink bugs frequent.


Stink bugs do not like the potent odor of garlic and generally stay away when garlic is nearby. It only repels the insects instead of killing them.
You can also chops several cloves of garlic and spread the pieces around stink bug hide-outs.

, Mix 2 cups (500 ml) of water with 10 drops of mint oil in a spray bottle. Spray the solution around possible entryways and hide-outs.


Like garlic, mint only acts as a repellent rather than a poison. The strong odor is often successful in keeping stink bugs away, though.
Instead of mint oil, you could use 2 tsp (10 ml) ground mint leaves.

, Sprinkle catnip powder around your garden and home, focusing on areas that are prone to stink bug infestation.


Catnip is another repellent that scares stink bugs away rather than killing them.
Catnip is an herbal plant, and you can grow it in your garden instead of buying it if you have the time and are interested in having a long-term defense against stink bugs.

, Spray this solution directly onto stink bugs or in areas where stink bugs gather.


Soap kills stink bugs by breaking down their protective exterior and dehydrating them.
Antibacterial soap can be used, but it contains more chemicals than non-antibacterial soap. Mild dish detergent is generally considered the safest, most natural option.

, Combine 32 oz (1000 ml) warm water with 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) neem oil in a spray bottle. Coat leaves, windowsills, and other potential entryways or hiding spots with this solution.


You may need apply a week's worth of neem oil before you notice any changes. Neem oil works by disrupting the eating and mating instinct of insects. As a result, adult stink bugs that are exposed to it will gradually starve themselves and will not lay any eggs.

Throw away infested food.,
Vacuum out the pantry.Use a vacuum cleaner with a hose and an angular nozzle attachment to clean the walls, baseboard, and corners of the pantry or cupboard.,
Scrub the pantry with soap and hot water.,
Wiping cabinetry down with a rag or paper towel soaked in bleach before scrubbing cabinetry with hot soapy water increases the effectiveness of this method.,

Place bay leaves in your pantry.Scatter bay leaves throughout the pantry and inside susceptible food containers.,
Set glue traps.,
Apply crack and crevice spray.",How to Get Rid of Pantry Moths," Adult moths are generally gray with hints of either red or white coloring, and they measure roughly 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) long. Larvae are about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) long and look like worms with five pairs of legs.


The easiest way to spot a pantry moth problem is to actually see an adult moth flying around your pantry. This usually happens at night rather than during the day.
If you suspect that you may have a pantry moth infestation, check all the dry food in your pantry. Moths hide out in flour, cereal, rice, and other grains most often, but you should also check pet food, dried fruit, or any other dry food products. In short, check everything.
Examine the corners and edges of the cupboards and pantry, as well.;
, Look in the corners and along the inside edges for clumps of stringy or grainy material.


Webbing does not often appear in food, but if you spot something that you suspect to be webbing while examining your food, it's best to treat it as such.
Inspect the lips of all your cans and jars. Pantry moths are plenty capable of spinning webs in these lips.

, In order to clean the pantry thoroughly, it needs to be empty.

, Any food that shows clear signs of contamination should be discarded.


If an open bag of grains or dry food does not appear to be infested, but you still have concerns, you can either discard the food or place it in the freezer for a week. The cold temperatures will kill any moth eggs that you cannot detect with the naked eye. Note, however, that you should not do this if you can spot larvae or adult pantry moths.

,


Clean under all shelving liners.Remove any old liners and vacuum beneath them. If the liners are in bad shape, you may need to replace them.
Focus on areas with webbing, larvae, or adult moths, but vacuum the entire area. This includes all hardware, wire shelves, and pin holes in the cupboard.

, Use a dish towel or sponge to wash the walls, floors, doors, and shelves of the pantry or cupboard.


Make sure that you get the door hinges and door jamb, as these spots are the most common hiding places for larvae.
You should also scrub beneath any shelving liners or interior racks.

, Be careful to have good ventilation if you choose to do this.

, If you have plastic food containers currently in your pantry, wash them in a dishwasher or use hot water and dish soap to scrub them out thoroughly.


This is an essential step if the containers were exposed directly to the pantry moths, but even if there were no pantry moths inside the container, it is still a good idea to temporarily remove the contents of the container and wash it. Doing so will also allow you to more closely examine the contents for evidence of infestation.

, Before putting everything back into the pantry, dry the inside of the pantry with clean dish towels or paper towels.


Also dry any food containers completely before putting food back in them and returning the containers to the pantry or cupboard.
Pantry moths thrive on moisture, so keeping things dry is an important part of getting rid of the pests.

, The vacuum bag and any trash bags containing infested food should be immediately removed from the kitchen and taken outside.


If possible, place the bags on the curb or in an area that does not share a wall with your house.

, A safe way to sanitize the space and deter the moths from returning is to wipe down all the surfaces of the pantry with white vinegar.


If you do not want to wipe down the entire pantry or cabinet, you should at least scrub any area that was infested with moths or larvae.
Scrub any infested food containers with white vinegar, as well.
Certain essential oils, including peppermint, citronella, eucalyptus, and tea tree oils, can strengthen the effect. Add a few drops of oil to a spray bottle filled with vinegar and spritz the surfaces before scrubbing them.

,


Place bay leaves in the corners of your pantry or cupboard. You can also tape them to the walls or the undersides of your shelves.
Add a bay leaf directly to your canister of flour, rice, or other dry food. It should not affect the quality of the food, but if you would rather not chance it, you could tape the bay leaf to the inside of the lid and still achieve the desired effect.
Note that there is no definitive scientific evidence to support this practice, but there is no definitive proof to discredit it, either. It may only be a ""folk remedy,"" but it is one that many seem to agree on.

, Traps are available that have a pheromone scent that attracts pantry moths.Use double-stick tape to attach the non-adhesive side of a glue trap to the inside wall of the pantry or cabinet.


Heavy infestations may require more than one glue trap.
The glue inside the traps contains pheromones that attract moths and other insects. Male moths gravitate toward the glue, get stuck, and die. As a result, reproduction is greatly reduced.
Remove the release paper on the trap to expose the sticky side. If you do not want to use double-stick tape, you can form the trap into a box or ring by wrapping it around and sticking the ends together. This box can then be hung by a hook.
Glue traps can work for four to six weeks, but you may need to change them out if they get covered with dead moths before that time period expires.

, Before you place food back into your pantry, apply a ""crack and crevice"" insecticide around the inside perimeter of the space.


These insecticides usually have an injector tip. Place this tip into all cracks or crevices in which pantry moths may hide. Spray the insecticide for roughly one second at each location and repeat as needed.
If this insecticide leaves behind a white residue, simply remove it with a wet dish towel or sponge.

Figure out where they're lurking.,
Set out homemade glass silverfish traps.,
Try newspaper traps.,
Use store-bought traps.,
Sprinkle diatomaceous earth in cabinets and other dark areas.,
Try boric acid.,
Buy a chemical spray containing liquid pyrethrin.,
Sprinkle cedar shavings where they live.,
Use spice sachets in your kitchen cabinets.,
Use a citrus or lavender spray.,
Dehumidify your home.,
Caulk all cracks and crevices where they could lay eggs.,
Remove food sources from your house.,
Vacuum your house often.",How to Get Rid of Silverfish," Since silverfish are nocturnal, you may not see them during the day. Rather, you'll probably become aware of their presence because of what they leave behind. Look for damp, dark areas with small spots of excrement that look like black pepper. Small holes and yellowish stains on clothing, wallpaper, cereal boxes, and other cardboard or fabric materials also indicate they're nearby. Finally, silverfish shed their skin, so you can look around for tiny skin casts in your bathroom, basement and other areas where you suspect they live., Take a quart-sized mason jar or another glass container. Wrap the outside of the container with a piece of masking tape. Place a piece of bread at the bottom of the glass. Set the glass in an area where you suspect silverfish reside. Make sure to wrap tape all the way to the top. The silverfish will climb into the glass to eat the bread, but they'll be unable to get back out, since the glass is too slippery.


Use the traps at night, when silverfish come out to feed.

, Roll up a newspaper, band the ends with elastic, and moisten it. Set it out where you often see silverfish leavings before you go to bed. In the morning, silverfish will have eaten their way into the newspaper, since you've provided them with both food and a cozy environment. Throw the newspapers away (without unrolling them) or burn them. Repeat every night until you don't see any more signs of silverfish.Make as many traps as necessary to trap the silverfish in your home. Depending on the severity of your infestation, you may need to set them out several nights in a row.

, If you don't want silverfish touching your glassware, you can buy traps designed to catch them from a hardware store. Any type of sticky traps will work. Buy some ""roach motels"" or smaller traps you can set around to catch the silverfish. You can bait them with small pieces of bread or another starch.

, This powdery substance is actually food-grade, and it's used to kill anything that crawls. It's made out of ground-up fossilized material, and the sharp edges of each individual grain of dust puncture insects' exoskeletons and cause them to die without causing any harm to humans or pets.


Sprinkle the substance in your cabinets, along baseboards, and anywhere else you'd like before you go to bed. In the morning, vacuum up the powder (and along with it, the silverfish).
Wear a mask when you're sprinkling the powder, since it can irritate your lungs.

, This is another natural substance that kills both silverfish and their eggs. Sprinkle it along baseboards, under the bathtub, and in other areas where you see silverfish signs. Be careful not to inhale boric acid when you apply it, since it's toxic to the lungs. Avoid using it where your household pets might get into it, too.

, This chemical kills silverfish when you spray it along baseboards and into cracks, as well as other places where silverfish lurk. Do not apply this in your kitchen cabinets or near food sources, and don't apply it where children and pets hang out, since it's toxic.

, Silverfish are repelled by the smell of cedar, so you can keep them away by sprinkling it around areas where they live. Since cedar shavings can make a bit of a mess, use them in outdoor areas, basements, and other places where you don't mind having wood shavings lying around. Vacuum them up and replace them every week or so.

, Silverfish don't like the smell of spices, so making up little sachets of cloves, cinnamon, and other strong-smelling spices and placing them in your kitchen cabinets is a great, safe way to keep them away from your food.

, Both of these scents are also effective in repelling silverfish, and they're completely nontoxic to humans, of course. Get some lemon or lavender essential oil from a health food store. Dilute with water and shake the solution up in a spray bottle and spray liberally in all areas where you don't want silverfish. These sprays are great for closets, drawers, and other bedroom areas.

, Since silverfish love damp places, reducing the humidity in your home is a sure way to keep them out. Buy a dehumidifier and try to reduce the humidity in your home. If you don't want to use a dehumidifier, run the air conditioner or at least keep the fans on.

, If your house is full of dark, damp cracks and crevices, filling these is a good way to keep silverfish out. Buy some caulk and apply it along baseboards, inside cracks, and in holes in your wall or floor. This is particularly important to do in your kitchen, bathroom and basement.

, Keeping your floor clear of silverfish food may help keep their population down. Don't leave a pile of books on the floor, and clean up your dirty laundry before it sits there too long. In addition to these primary food sources, consider the following sources that may be a factor:


Cardboard boxes. Store your boxes on shelves instead of the floor, where they're more likely to get damp.
Food containers. Keep your food in sealed plastic containers instead of boxes.
Wallpaper. If you've got old wallpaper, consider replacing it with paint or new wallpaper.
Old clothing. If you store your out-of-season clothing in your basement or a dark closet, consider placing it in plastic bags to keep the silverfish out.

, Vacuuming helps to keep their food sources down and sucks eggs out of the carpet and baseboards. Vacuum at least once a week. When necessary, you can dry out your carpets by sprinkling them with baking soda, leaving it for a few hours, then vacuuming it up. This dries out the eggs so you can suck them up.

Vacuum the bugs up.Suck the stink bugs up using an industrial vacuum or a vacuum cleaner with a bag.,
Knock them into a container of soapy water.,
Use an insect electrocution system.,
Spread fly tape along entryways.,
Flick them into an empty water bottle.",How to Get Rid of Stink Bugs Naturally2," Remove and discard the bag immediately.


After vacuuming up the stink bugs, your vacuum is likely to smell foul for several weeks or months. For this reason, you should not use a bagless vacuum that you use at home.
Empty the bag's contents into a large garbage bag and seal the bag tightly.
Alternatively, you can wrap a knee-high stocking around the vacuum tube. Secure the stocking with a rubber band and push it inside the tube. As long as the stocking remains secure, the stink bugs should be caught inside it instead of entering the vacuum filter. You can remove the stocking, holding the end closed, and dispose of the stink bugs from there.

, Fill a 1-gallon (4-liter) bucket 1/4 full with water. Mix in 1 tsp (5 ml) dish detergent or liquid soap. Position the bucket beneath climbing stink bugs and flick them down into the solution using a gloved hand.


The soap will make it difficult for the insects to move, and they will ultimately drown in the water.
As far as stink bug elimination methods go, this is probably the closest to a “stink free” option since the bugs are killed relatively quickly.

, Set this up in an attic or other dark space according to manufacturer's instructions. Turn it on at night and sweep up or vacuum any dead bugs in the morning.


Insect electrocution systems, also known as ""bug zappers,"" attract stink bugs and other insects by drawing them in toward a bright light. As the insect approaches, it gets a sudden shock that is strong enough to kill it instantaneously.

, Place sticky fly tape along windowsills, doorways, cracks, vents, and any other notable entryways into your home. Check the tape every day, discarding it as it fills up and replacing it as necessary.


Since this is not a quick death, trapped stink bugs may give off their trademark odor after being caught.
If you do not have fly tape, you can also use double-sided tape.

, Take an empty water bottle and place the open bottle close to the stink bug.


Use the bottle to collect the stink bug or bugs.
Cap the bottle very tightly.
Freeze the bottle with its offensive inhabitants in a freezer (preferably not one in which you store food). Overnight should be enough time to do them in.
Once the stink bugs are frozen to death empty the bottle into the garbage or outside and use again.
Alternately, add a small amount of dish soap to the empty water bottle and reuse the bottle to catch as many stink bugs as you can. Catching the stink bugs on a vertical surface is easily accomplished by placing the water bottle opening over the stink bug. Once the stink bugs come in contact with the soap, they will suffocate.

Seal your doors and windows.Seal any cracks or gaps in your window and door trims with caulk.,
Place protective screens over air vents.,
Patch up any holes.Holes that are larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter should be patched up.,
Rub window screens with dryer sheets.,
Collect the bugs on a damp towel outside.,
Kill a few bugs outside.,
Control your weeds.,
Attract stink bug predators.",How to Get Rid of Stink Bugs Naturally3,"


The most common entryways for stink bugs include windows, doors, baseboards, and ceiling lights. Filling gaps or correcting loose seals should significantly decrease the number of stink bugs roaming through your home.

, Use mesh fence screening to cover dryer vents, air vents, chimneys, and other open areas connecting the outside of your home with the inside.

,


Instant adhesive and epoxy should be enough to patch small holes in screens. Specially designed patch kits come with the tools you need as well as instructions on how to complete the task.

, Take an ordinary dryer sheet and rub it against any window and door screens on a daily basis until the stink bug problem is fixed.


Dryer sheets with an especially strong odor may work better than those with no perfumes or mild scents. The point is to deter stink bugs from entering the home by assaulting their sense of smell with a potent odor.
This is thought to reduce the stink bug population by up to 80 percent within a week or two.

, Hang a wet towel over a lawn chair outside at dusk. In the morning, a large number of stink bugs from your yard should be gathered on the towel.


You can drape the towel over a deck railing, empty planter, tree branch, or any other surface in your yard. It is better for the towel to drape vertically than to be spread out horizontally, though.
Exterminate the stink bugs on the towel by quickly dunking the entire towel, bugs and all, into a large bucket of soapy water.

, Squash a few bugs with an old pair of shoes or a stone.


Prepare for a stench. Once killed, stink bugs will give off a very strong odor.
The odor given off upon a stink bug's death sends a warning to others in the area, telling them to leave.
You should only kill stink bugs outside since it will be easier to air the smell out afterward than it would be inside.

, Remove or thin heavily weeded areas in your garden.


Stink bugs tend to be attracted to weeds. Reducing the amount of weeds present in your yard or flowerbeds will make the area seem less appealing to stink bugs, so fewer will come. Fewer stink bugs in your garden also means fewer in your home.

, Natural predators include parasitic flies, wasps, birds, toads, spiders, and praying mantises.


Grow wildflowers and herbs. These attract parasitic flies and wasps.
Attract birds, toads, spiders, and praying mantises with perennial herb and flowers.
You can also buy praying mantises in garden supply catalogs. Minute pirate bugs, which eat stink bug eggs, can also be bought from garden supply catalogs.

Regularly sweep the floor.,
Clean up spills immediately.",How to Clean Laminate Floors1," Sweep a dry dust mop across the surface of the floor every few days to remove everyday dirt.Even though laminate flooring is fairly scratch-resistant, excess dirt, hair, and debris can cause scratches to develop if allowed to build up over time. Regular sweeping prevents such scratches from forming.
Instead of using a dry dust mop, you could also use a vacuum with a soft brush attachment.
Do not use a standard floor brush. The stiff, straw-like bristles on the brush could damage the surface.
Sweep in the direction that the laminate floor tiles were laid. Doing so allows you to pick up any debris that falls in between the grooves of the laminate flooring pieces.;
, Use a cloth or sponge to immediately clean up any liquid spills.









Do not allow any liquid, even water, to sit on the floor for prolonged periods. Liquid can stain or damage the protective wear layer of the laminate flooring.
Soak up excess liquid with a dry cloth.
Dampen the cloth or sponge before spot-cleaning the location of the spill to remove any remaining residue.
Dry the spot with a dry, soft cloth. Do not allow the area to remain wet.

Wipe up any liquid residue immediately.",How to Clean Engineered Hardwood Floors," Loose pieces of dirt and small stones may be tracked into your house on a daily basis. Use a soft-bristled broom to sweep up all of the dirt in your house. Pay special attention to areas that are more likely to have collected dirt or rocks, such as the entryway. Sweep the dirt and dust into a dustpan, and dispose of it outside.If left on the engineered hardwood floor, these will be ground into its surface and can scuff or damage the top layer of hardwood. If left on the floor, dirt and rocks can also scratch the veneer on top of the hardwood flooring.
To keep your engineered hardwood in good shape, clean them frequently. To maximize the floor’s durability, aim to sweep or vacuum the floors daily.;
, If you’d prefer not to use a broom—or want to make doubly sure that you’ve cleaned up all dirt from the hardwood—you can use a vacuum cleaner on the floor. Make sure to set the cleaner on the “hard floor” mode. This will disable the rotating bristle bar. If left engaged, the rotating bristle bar will scratch and scuff the veneer surface of your floor.If you scratch your engineered hardwood floor with a bristle bar, the damage may be irreversible.

, Use a microfiber mop to clean the floor and ensure that you’ve cleaned up all dust that’s been tracked or blown into your house. A dry microfiber mop head will effectively pick up any dirt and debris on the floor—including some that your broom may have missed—and you won’t risk damaging your floor with water. Mop your hardwood flooring at least once a week. Plan to only mop your engineered hardwood with a microfiber mop. This material will be less abrasive on the veneer and top layer of your hardwood floor than the head of a regular mop would be, and you won’t need to use any water.

, You may not have, or prefer not to use, a microfiber mop. In this case, you can use a traditional yarn mop to clean your floor. Wring out water from your mop thoroughly before you apply the mop to the hardwood. Make sure that your mop is slightly damp; you don’t need much liquid to effectively clean a hardwood floor. If excess water remains on the hardwood flooring after you’ve mopped, clean this up with a towel.A slightly damp yarn mop can also remove any light stains from liquids that may have spilled on the floor.

, You can save yourself some work sweeping and mopping your hardwood floors if you protect the entrances to your house—especially the front and back doors—with a rug. A rug will catch much of the dirt, dust, and grime that would otherwise be tracked on your hardwood flooring.


Try placing one rug outside each entrance, for visitors to wipe any dirt or mud off of their feet. Then, another rug placed inside the doorway will let visitors wipe their feet again, this time removing finer dirt or dust.
Shake your rug outside weekly, to prevent dust from the rug itself being tracked through the rest of the house.

, Engineered hardwood floors should only be cleaned with a liquid cleaner that has been manufactured by the company that made the floor. Different types of engineered hardwood require different cleaners, and using the wrong type or brand of liquid cleaner could result in serious damage to your hardwood. If you’re not sure which type of cleaner to use, contact the manufacturer by phone or email to request a liquid-cleaner recommendation.You can purchase liquid cleaning products designed for engineered hardwood floors at your local hardware store.
If a local hardware store does not have them, check the “Cleaning” or “Flooring” section or a larger some supply store, such as Lowe’s or Home Depot.

, If a section of flooring is particularly dirty, or if it has been stained or had liquid spilled on it, you can clean up with the liquid cleaner. Apply a small amount of liquid cleaner directly to the surface of the hardwood, and clean with a sponge mop or a clean cloth. Wipe the hardwood surface until the stain has been removed, adding more cleaner as needed.Don’t leave excess liquid cleaner on the floor after you’ve cleaned a stain. Wipe it up immediately with a clean paper towel or cloth. It’s not necessary to rinse the cleaner off using water.
To clean small spaces that a mop cannot reach, or to wipe up hard-to-reach stains, you may need to scrub by hand. Pour a small amount of liquid cleaner onto a clean cotton cloth, and dab or wipe gently at the dirty area of your floor.

, Although the cleaning products themselves may look the same and may even be located next to one another on the shelves at a hardware store, the products are not interchangeable. Liquids that clean tile or vinyl may permanently damage engineered hardwood.Cleaning products for tile or vinyl will also not fully clean your engineered hardwood floor. If you have questions about substituting cleaning products, contact the floor manufacturer and ask which liquid cleaning products may be safely used on their floors.

, Accidents happen, but if you’ve spilled water—or any other type of liquid—on your engineered hardwood floor, it should be cleaned up immediately. If you allow a liquid spill to sit on hardwood for any length of time, it could soak in and damage the hardwood or the veneer. This could also cause a permanent stain.When you’re cleaning up spills, blot gently at the spills to wipe them up. Do not scrub at the spills, or use forceful pressure to clean the area. If you do, you’ll risk warping the hardwood veneer or pressing liquid down into the wood and causing damage.

, While these abrasive liquids will clean certain surfaces, they will likely damage your engineered hardwood floor. Ammonia and vinegar could erode or mar the veneer surface on top of the upper layer of hardwood., While a steam cleaner can be a useful tool for cleaning a carpet floor, it should never be used on engineered hardwood. The steam can damage the wood surface by forcing water into the veneer and the top layer of hardwood.A steam cleaner can potentially cause more damage to the hardwood than other forms of cleaning that use excess water (such as an overly wet mop). Since a steam cleaner will force moisture down into the wood, it may damage lower layers of plywood or fiberboard.

, Tough, abrasive cleaning products—such as steel wool or a wire-bristle cleaning brush—should never be used on a hardwood floor. These products will almost certainly scratch or otherwise damage the veneer on top of the hardwood., Although engineered hardwood floors are more resistant to liquids than traditional hardwood floors, you should still never leave water or any liquid cleaner standing on your floor. Dry the floor with a towel if excess liquid cleaner remains after you’ve finished cleaning the floor.


Similarly, if you use a mop that is dripping wet, you’ll risk damaging the top layer of hardwood. If the wood absorbs a substantial amount of water, it may warp or distort. Dry up all water after you’ve mopped the floor."

Create a vinegar solution.,
Mix together a tea-based cleaner.,
Use baby shampoo.,
Remove stains with a baking soda paste.,
Remove tough stains with rubbing alcohol.,
Mix everything with distilled water.",How to Clean Laminate Wood Floors Without Streaking1," Mix together a 50-50 white vinegar and distilled water mixture inside a spray bottle. Shake the bottle a bit before using. If you dislike the smell of vinegar, add in a few drops of an essential oil, such as lemon. This solution can be stored for a number of weeks without losing its cleaning power.It is possible to use apple cider vinegar in the solution, but this does not have the same sanitizing effect as distilled white vinegar.
Natural cleaners have a tendency to leave less residue and create fewer streaks than their commercial counterparts. Although, be aware that premixed cleaning solutions for laminate are available at most home stores.;
, Boil a cup of black tea using one tea bag and a single cup of water. Wait until the tea cools down and then pour it into a spray bottle for application. Shake the mixture a bit before spraying and use it immediately. Do not store this solution., Fill your spray bottle up with warm or room temperature distilled water. Add in one tablespoon of baby shampoo. Shake the bottle until it fills up with bubbles. Spray this solution lightly onto the surface of your floor. Baby shampoo is gentle and safe for most surfaces, including laminate., Before you do a general cleaning, make sure to address any specific stains or their residue can cause streaking across your finished floor. For a food-based stain, spoon a paste made from baking soda and distilled water over the affected area. Let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it away with a cloth dampened with water., Applying a bit of rubbing alcohol directly to a stain, using a cotton ball, can also help to remove it. But, don’t let the alcohol sit for too long or it can cause your protective coating to peel up, which can give the appearance of dullness and streaking., Using tap water is the easier option, but it can add deposits on top of your floor. This, in turn, can make your floor appear dirty or dull. Instead, go with warm or room temperature distilled water in all of your floor cleaning solutions. Using distilled water also makes it possible to store your solution up to a few weeks."

Determine your kind of hardwood finish.,
Sweep the floor with a soft-bristled broom.,
Stick to sweeping and mopping each week, only deep cleaning the floor as needed.,
Immediately wipe up any wet spills on hardwood floors.",How to Clean Hardwood Floors1," Prefinished floors are the easiest to spot, as every board has beveled (slightly raised) edges. If the surface isn’t glossy, you have a stained or unfinished floor. Shiny floors are the most difficult to tell apart. To test your floor for wax, moisten extra-fine steel wool and rub it on an inconspicuous area; if a light gray smudge appears on the wool, you have a wax finish. To test whether you have an old or a modern surface seal, place a few drops of water on the most worn area of floor; if it remains beaded after several minutes, you probably have a modern seal, but if it seems to soak or darken the wood, you either have an older seal or a poorly-finished one that needs to be handled gently.









Most new floors are surface-sealed with polyurethane, urethane, or a polyacrylic coating, all of which are water- and stain-resistant and therefore easy to clean.
Older floors that haven’t been refinished usually have a shellac, lacquer, or varnish finish, and while these are technically also “surface-seals,” they aren’t nearly as durable as the more modern finishes; for the purposes of this article, they will, therefore, be placed under the “other” category alongside unfinished and waxed floors.
Although prefinished floors are coated with a durable surface seal, the fact that each board is coated separately (as opposed to pressed up against one another on-site) means that the unsealed cracks between the boards are prone to water damage; for this reason, pre-finished floors also belong in the “other” category.

When in doubt, choose the gentler method; a hardwood floor isn’t something you want to take chances with.;
, This will remove large particles like sand or grit that may scratch the floor if caught beneath a mop. Alternatively, you can vacuum the floor, provided that the bristles are extended to prevent scratching and there is only dust on the floor.









Also use the ""bare floor"" setting on your vacuum to prevent scratching the floor. Most vacuums have attached bristles to kick up dust, but these can ruin hardwood floors.

, While you should sweep and/or vacuum regularly to keep the floor free of dust and scratching agents, you should only clean your hardwood when it really needs it. This will prolong the life of your floor.









Hardwood floors are generally easy to keep clean, as there is nothing to trap dirt or dust. A simple sweep or vacuum should cover most messes.

, No matter what your finish, you should never leave moisture to sit around on hardwood floors. It can damage the seal and the wood permanently if you're not careful. Wipe it up with a damp cloth, then dry the surface completely."

, Make sure you are working with a mop that has been cleaned before the last cleaning. The last thing you want is to use a dirty or soiled mop because it will transfer the odor to the newly cleaned floors.

, Or you can simply clean these floors with warm water depending on the dirt level of the floors.

, Be sure you rinse the mop after every few strokes and then return mop to the bucket to get more warm water or water and vinegar.

Fill a bucket with hot water.,
Soak and wring out a mop.,
Give the flooring a thorough mopping.Cover the entire floor, starting from the center and working your way out.,
Dry the flooring.",How to Clean Laminate Floors2," The water does not need to be steaming hot, but it should be more than simply lukewarm.


A thorough, wet wash should be performed every few months or after a wide area of the floor has gotten muddy or notably dirty.
Hot water is often considered one of the best ways to clean laminate flooring because, when done correctly, it will not leave streaks. It is also the least likely to damage the protective coating of the laminate, since water is the mildest cleanser possible.

, Soak a sponge mop in the hot water and wring it out so that it is only mildly damp.









You could use a traditional-style mop, but it is easier to control the saturation level of sponge mops.
The mop should be wrung out well before using it. Even water can stain or warp the laminate floor if it is allowed to sit on the floor in puddles. That being the case, the mop should only be mildly damp before you use it on the laminate.

,









You could also work from one side of the room to the other. The only method you should avoid is working from the exterior of the room to the center, since you will need to walk across the newly-cleaned floor as it dries in order to leave the room.
Since the mop is only barely damp, you may need to re-soak and re-wring it a few times during the cleaning process.

, If the laminate is barely moist, you can let it air dry. Otherwise, wipe it dry with a clean, dry, microfiber cloth.









Do not use an abrasive cloth, since this may scratch the flooring.
Do not let puddles of water sit on the laminate for long periods of time.

Create a solution of vinegar and water.,
Spray the solution onto the laminate a little a time.,
Wipe the solution up with a damp mop or cloth.,
Dry the laminate.",How to Clean Laminate Floors3," Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) white vinegar into a 30 to 32 oz (940 to 1000 ml) spray bottle. Fill the rest of the bottle with plain water and shake well to combine.Diluted vinegar is especially useful when your laminate floor has caked on mud or other stains that have caused it to become faded or dull.
Vinegar is too abrasive to be used in its pure form, so you must combine it with water.
You could also create a similar vinegar-based solution by combining 1/3 cup (80 ml) vinegar with 3 squirts of liquid dish detergent and 1 gallon (4 liters) of warm water.

, Spray the vinegar onto the floor in areas no larger than small 1-foot (30.5 cm) squares.









Do not spray the entire floor with the vinegar at once. You need to wipe the solution off the floor almost immediately, and spraying the entire floor at the same time will prevent you from cleaning off the vinegar before it starts to wear away at the protective coating of the laminate.

, Immediately after spraying the vinegar solution on the floor, wipe it off with a damp terry or sponge mop.









You could also use a soft microfiber cloth. Do not use any mops or cloths that are abrasive, however.
Make sure to wring out the mop or cloth before using it. Do not soak the floor with water, since letting moisture sit on it for too long could cause the floor to warp.

, If a large amount of water has been left behind, soak it up and off the floor with a dry microfiber cloth.









If only a small amount of water has been left behind, you may allow it to air dry without fearing damage to your laminate.

Fill a bucket with hot water.,
Add a mild detergent or baby shampoo.,
Soak and wring out a mop.,
Wipe the floor from one side to the other.,
Dry the laminate.",How to Clean Laminate Floors4," Add roughly 1 gallon (4 liters) of warm to hot water to a large bucket.


The water does not need to be steaming hot, but it should be significantly more than merely lukewarm.

, Stir 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of baby shampoo or mild liquid dish detergent into the hot water.








Do not use a scented or dyed dish detergent, since these are more likely to create streaks or cause damage to the laminate.
Baby shampoo is gentle enough to use on laminate floors, but do not use standard adult shampoos.
Mix the soap and water with your hand until the soap dissolves and bubbles begin to form.
Do not use abrasive cleaners, like bleach or other strong cleaning chemicals.

, Soak a terry or sponge mop in the soapy solution. Wring it out thoroughly so that it is only mildly damp.









Soapy water is a good choice when cleaning floors that have been exposed to mud, salt-covered snow boots, or other major forms of contamination.
You could also use a microfiber cloth, but mops are preferable since you will be cleaning the entire floor at one time instead of working on small patches.
Excess water can cause laminate flooring to become distorted. As a result, it is important that you wring out the mop until it is only mildly moist rather than soggy.

, Start from one side of the room and work your way to the other side, covering the entire floor.









You can also start in the center and work your way to the outside perimeter of the room. The only thing you should avoid doing is working your way from the outside into the center of the room, since you will have to cross over your newly cleaned floor to leave the room.
Re-soak and re-wring the mop as necessary to make your way across the entire floor.

, If you used a small amount of water, the flooring should air dry quickly. If it does not show any signs of air drying by the time you reach the other side of the room, dry it by hand using a dry microfiber cloth.









Do not allow puddles of water to sit on the laminate for prolonged periods of time.

Dampen the cloth with mineral spirits for best results.
Do not use a metal knife, since it is too rough and more likely to scratch the floor.

, These stains can usually be removed simply with a mildly damp microfiber cloth.









You may need to apply mineral spirits to the cloth in order to remove waxy crayon marks.
For stubborn ink stains, you may need to add a little detergent or ink remover to the cloth in order to completely remove the stain. Make sure to re-clean the area with a cloth soaked in warm, clean water afterward.

, Add a little nail polish remover to a microfiber cloth and scrub the stain until it comes up.









Wipe over the area with a microfiber cloth soaked in clean water afterward.

, Simply rub the eraser over these marks until they lift off the laminate.

, Apply an ice pack or a package of frozen vegetables to the spot until the grease hardens. Scrape the frozen grease off using a plastic kitchen knife.









Do not scrape the grease away with a metal utensil.

Apply a bit of your cleaning solution to this space and observe what happens. Look to see if the floor appears dull or otherwise impacted by the solution. If not, proceed as planned. If so, consider using an alternate solution or calling in professional cleaners., Select the bare floor setting on your vacuum, making sure that the bender bar underneath does not sit directly on the floor’s surface. Follow the grain of your floor and do a few vacuuming passes over the room. Use your vacuum attachment for any corners or crevices. Vacuuming beforehand helps to minimize the movement of dirt and grime on your floor, which can cause streaking., Stand with your spray bottle or microfiber mop against one of the walls with your back facing the rest of the room. This means that you will spray in front of you when walking backwards. This will keep you from stepping on top of the fresh cleaning solution and leaving footprints or other marks.

, Spray a bit of the cleaning solution onto one of your microfiber mop pads. Or, hold your spray bottle above the floor and lightly mist the surface. Either way, keep an eye on your floor and make sure that it is damp, not soaking wet. Excessive liquid on your floor may cause streaking and warping., After you’ve applied the cleaning solution, run your mop over the wet areas, making straight strokes. Keep the amount of pressure that you use even and controlled, or you could end up causing streaking by scrubbing some areas too much and others not enough. Every few minutes, stop and look over the floor to make sure that you are not missing any wet spaces.

, As soon as you finish applying the cleaning solution, go back to where you began and begin the drying process. Walk backward and use a microfiber cloth or mop pad to pick up the moisture from the floor. Moving this way means that you will minimize your footprints, but make sure to buff them out as you go, leaving a pristine surface behind., If you choose to use a microfiber mop, make sure to use a clean pad for the drying stage. Otherwise, you will just apply another layer of dirt onto the clean surface. To keep your pads clean, place them in your washer on a “delicate” cycle or run them under some warm water.Avoid using a laundry sheet when drying your cleaning cloths or pads, as the chemicals from the sheet can lead to streaking when you use the pads or clothes again."

Grab a towel or washcloth and place it on top of the sitting liquid. Replace as needed until the area is no longer damp. Do a final wipe down of the area with a damp cloth., It is possible to clean your floors too much, which can damage the protective coating. It is also possible to clean your floor not often enough, which can lead to the accumulation of dirt and streaking when you do try to clean. Try to mop down your floors every other week or so. Vacuum more frequently to remove any surface debris., Start by wearing socks in your own home and asking that guests take off their shoes when entering as well. This will lessen the amount of deep grime present on your floors and it will make it easier to clean them without creating streaks or spots., Locate a floor cleaning professional in your area and then go online to read any reviews that are available. Pay particular attention to the comments regarding the quality of the finished work. If you are concerned about streaking, tell the cleaner about your concerns when you make the appointment.

Buff the floor dry with terry cloth (optional).",How to Clean Hardwood Floors2," For general cleaning, choose a pH-neutral ,water-based cleaner, like those designed for vinyl floors or hardwood-specific cleaners. To dissolve grease and dirt, choose an alkaline, water-based cleaner: soaps, detergents, or a bit of baking soda dissolved in water will do, though should be used sparingly. To dissolve hard water or mineral deposits, choose an acidic water-based cleaner; white vinegar or lemon juice in water would make a good rinsing agent to this effect.








Specific hardwood floor cleaners, of course, are your safest bet.
Don’t use bleach, ammonia, abrasive cleaners, or anything that will leave a residue (ex. oil, furniture spray, wax). Not only will they damage the hardwood, but a few will even void the warranty on your floor.

, To avoid hard-water streaking, you may want to buy distilled water, which can be purchased cheaply at your local supermarket. However, a quick wipe down with a lemon juice and water mixture after cleaning will also prevent streaks, if hand dried afterwards.







, Dip a mop into a bucket of your cleaning agent diluted in water. Run it over the floor along with the grain of the wood, starting in the farthest corner and working towards a door so you never have to step on wet floors. Refill the bucket if the solution gets too dirty.









Remove your shoes. This will prevent you from marking or dirtying the floor while it’s wet.

, Dip the cloth in the cleaning solution and scrub it over stains with your hands to apply a more directed pressure.








, Replace the dirty water with fresh, clean water. Rinse and squeegee out the mop so that it is damp, and use it to pick up the dirty water left on the floor. Squeegee it into your clean bucket and repeat.









Wring the mop dry, rub it over the wet floor until it’s saturated, and repeat until the floor is fairly dry. Do not postpone this step: though modern surface seals are water-resistant, they will not tolerate being wet for long periods. When you're done, rinse the mop and refill the bucket with plain water.

, This will remove any streaky or dulling traces of your cleaning solution.








, You can also use the wrung-mop method to dry the floor. This will prevent streaking and protect the life of your floor.

, Dip a mop into a bucket of water, wring it out completely and run it over the floor with the grain of the wood. As long as you can still wring water from the mop with your hands, it’s too damp to use. Wash the mop often during cleaning and refill the bucket if the water gets too dirty.








, Though they are too strong for regular use, mineral spirits can be a great way to remove stains like white water spots.









Be sure to spot-test the mineral spirits on an inconspicuous area first. To do so, rub a small dot into the floor in an inconspicuous area (like under a couch). Return after 5-10 minutes to see if there is any damage to the floor., Though this will give it a nice sheen, there should be almost no moisture on the floor, meaning you can also let it evaporate on its own.

Determine the composition of your vents.,
Turn off your heat, air conditioning, or vent fan.,
Clear loose dust and grime from the vent.,
Remove your floor vents.,
Insert the vents and start your dishwasher.,
Replace your vents after washing.",How to Clean Floor Vents1," In most cases, vents made of metal can be cleaned in your dishwasher. Avoid washing vents with paint, as the heat from your dishwasher can cause it to peel. You should not use your dishwasher to clean:Wooden vents, which are especially susceptible to intense heat. Never clean wooden floor vents in a dishwasher, unless otherwise indicated by the product's care instructions.
Plastic vents, because the heat of the dishwasher can cause these to deform, ruining them. Manually cleaning these instead is safest.;
, If you leave your home ventilation system on while cleaning vents, the blower might turn on and kick dust and grime into the air. This will only cause the dirtiness on your vents to spread around your home.Dust and grime that have become airborne can irritate your eyes and lungs when cleaning.
If you have sensitive eyes or lungs, or if you suffer from allergies, you may want to wear protective eye wear and a dust mask.

, Clearing loose dust and grime will prevent it from falling on your floor when transporting your vents to the dishwasher. This can be done easily with a vacuum equipped with a crevice tool, or by wiping down vents with a clean, water damp rag.


You don't have to be especially thorough when cleaning loose dirt on your vents. A few passes with a vacuum or water damp rag should be sufficient., Most floor vents are fastened in place with standard screws. Use a standard screwdriver to loosen the screws and remove the vents you'd like to clean. Have a vacuum or water damp rag handy, as additional dirt and grime may be built up behind the vent.


You'll likely find more loose dust and dirt behind your vents. In most cases, a quick pass with the crevice tool of your vacuum will clean this away.
You may want to lay something, like a drop cloth newspaper, under wall floor vents or next to vents positioned flat in the floor. This way, you'll catch extra dirtiness and have a place to set removed vents., Arrange your vents in your dishwasher without stacking them on top of each other. Avoid using dishwasher detergents. These are formulated for dishware and cutlery, and aren't suitable for your vents.The shortest cycle of your dishwasher should be enough to completely clean your floor vents, and will be less harsh on them.

, Be careful when removing your vents from the dishwasher. Immediately after the dishwasher cycle, they may be hot. Inspect your vents to ensure they are clean, and if they are, use a screwdriver to fasten each back in place.


If your vents are not yet clean, you may want to run them through the dishwasher on another short cycle, or target trouble spots with a cotton swab and dish soap.

This will result in the dirtiness from your vents being spread around your home.Even with your ventilation system off, the natural airflow of your home and your cleaning efforts might cause dust to permeate the air. For this reason, you may want to wear protective eye wear and a dust mask.

, When vacuuming, a crevice tool can help you remove dirt from the nooks and crannies of your vent. If you notice clumps that appear loose but won't vacuum up, take a water dampened, clean rag and wipe these up.


If your vents aren't too dirty, this surface cleaning may be enough to restore your vents to like-new condition.
You don't have to be too thorough with this surface cleaning. Especially dirty vents will need a deep cleaning with soap and water. When vacuuming and wiping, the goal is to remove loose dust.

, To prevent dirt behind your vent from spreading or getting on your floor, lay out something, like a tarp or newspaper, to catch dust. Most frequently, vents are installed using standard screws. Take a standard screwdriver, loosen the screws, and remove the vents.


Dirt and dust often accumulate and clump behind vents. Use the crevice tool of your vacuum to clean away any of this kind of undesirable buildup.
As you finish removing each vent, place it on your ground covering. This will help contain any dirt remaining on the vents., Use a dish cleaning tool, like a scrub brush or sponge, to clean the slats of the vent and other narrow crevices. Wet your tool with water, apply soap to it, and clean each vent. Afterwards, metal or plastic vents can air dry or be wiped dry with a clean, dry rag or paper towel.


If the dirt on your vents is resistant to your soapy scrubbing treatment, you may need to soak them first in warm, soapy water for a few hours or overnight.
Wood vents are easily deformed by excess water or prolonged soaking. Use a water dampened, clean rag to wipe it free of grime, then dry the wood quickly and completely., Now that everything is clean and dry, your vents are ready to return to their associated holes. Fit each vent into place one at a time, then use your screwdriver to reattach all of the vents."

A broom and duster (or a vacuum)
A nylon-bristled brush for scrubbing stains
Dish soap and water to remove stains
Trisodium phosphate, laundry bleach, and detergent to remove mildew
Kitty litter or cornstarch to remove grease stains
Degreaser to remove tire marks
Bleach, ammonia, or hydrogen peroxide for stubborn stains;
, Remove any furniture, decorations, rugs or mats, shoes, and anything else that’s on the floor. Move everything out of the room so you’re not cleaning around furniture or constantly having to move furniture around to clean.

, Get up all large dirt and debris with the broom, and then go over the surface again with a duster to remove fine particles and dust. Dusting should be done daily, and sweeping or vacuuming on a weekly basis.


Use a vacuum if you have a good one available, as this will be faster and more efficient, and prevent dust and dirt particles from being spread around.

, For regular food and beverage stains, scrub the area with hot, soapy water.Use one to two tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of a mild dish soap or Castile soap, diluted into a half-gallon (1.9 liters) of water. For oil or oil-based stains, wet the area with water and cover the stain with dish soap. Dip a brush in warm water and scrub the area to work up a lather. Blot the suds with a rag or towel and rinse it down with clean water.To remove mildew, mix one ounce (28.3 grams) each of laundry detergent and trisodium phosphate with one quart (946.4 ml) laundry bleach and three quarts (2.8 liters) of water. Scrub the area with a soft brush and rinse with clean water.To remove tire marks (in a garage), spray the area with water and apply a degreaser. Let sit for three to four hours, scrub with a brush, and rinse.To remove grease, spread kitty litter or cornstarch over the area and let it sit for about three days. After you’ve let it sit, vacuum or sweep up the kitty litter and dispose of it in accordance with the type of grease it was (such as in the garbage or through a proper recycling facility)., If your concrete floor is plain and you don’t have to worry about damaging a finish, you can use harsher cleaners like bleach, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide to clean stubborn stains.Dilute one part cleaner in three parts water and spray on the affected area. Let it sit for about 20 minutes, and then scrub with a brush. Rinse the area with clean water.


Always wear gloves and proper protective gear when using harsh cleaners, and make sure the room is well-ventilated.

, You will need a mop and large bucket, warm water, and a mild, pH neutral cleaner.Do not use ammonia, bleach, or any other highly acidic or alkaline cleaner, as it may damage the concrete finish.Good neutral cleaners to use include:


Mild dish soaps
Castile soap
Neutral stone cleaner
pH neutral floor cleaners or detergents

, Use about one gallon (3.8 liters) of warm water. Stir in one-eighth to one-quarter cup (30 to 60 ml) of mild soap or pH neutral cleaner (or the amount recommended by the manufacturer).

, Once it’s saturated, wring it out thoroughly. The mop should be only slightly damp for cleaning the floor: you want the water to dry quickly, and don’t want excess water sitting on the concrete.

, Start in a corner farthest from the door and make your way toward the door, cleaning small areas at a time. As you mop, frequently re-dip the mop in the water and wring it out thoroughly. Consider having an oscillating fan blow air into the room to help the floor dry quicker.

, When you have cleaned the entire floor, dump out your cleaning water, rinse the mop and bucket, and refill the bucket with clean, warm water. Mop the floor again in the same way with the clean water, dunking and thoroughly wringing out the mop often.Start at the farthest corner and work toward the door again, working in small sections.

, You will need a power washer, a push broom with stiff, nylon bristles, and a cleaning product, such as trisodium phosphate or other concrete cleaner. You can use a regular garden hose if you don’t have a pressure washer. Use the hose on full power with a high-powered nozzle.


A pressure washer is recommended for this kind of concrete cleaning as it will do a better job. Pressure washers can be rented from home and garden or building stores.
Use a regular scrubbing brush with nylon bristles if you don’t have a push broom.

, Pull them up with your hands and then sweep, hose down, or pressure wash the surface to remove dirt and debris., Open your garage door if applicable. Start at the end closest to the house and work your way toward the garage door or lawn. Use the pressure washer or hose and spray the floor in broad, sweeping strokes to remove dirt and debris. Be sure to spray corners, cracks, and crevices as well.

, Place your broom at one end of the garage or patio, and begin sprinkling cleaner on the floor starting at the other end, working your way toward the broom. Make sure the floor is still wet when you do this., Use your broom or brush to work the cleaner into the entire floor surface and lift out any dirt, grime, and debris., Starting at the inside and working your way toward the open door or lawn, power wash away any excess cleaner and debris. Leave the door open and allow the floor to dry.

, This will stop people from slipping on the floor and prevent staining.Wipe up spills with a clean rag or towel as soon as they occur.

, A high-quality sealant will last a few years, so you should re-seal your floor every three to four years.Sealing your concrete floor will protect it from scuffs and stains.


Choose a sealant that’s right for your concrete surface.
Use water-based sealants for indoor flooring.

, Not only will a wax finish protect the floor from dirt build-up, stains, and abrasion, but it will also protect the sealant underneath so it lasts longer.Apply floor wax in a thin layer and spread it out with a rayon or microfiber mop. Re-apply every year or so."

Depending on how heavily you use the area, repeat 2–7 times a week, or whenever you notice it getting dusty. If you wait too long, grit and dirt may gouge and scratch your cork floor.


Never vacuum without a soft brush attachment, as this can scratch the floor permanently.;
, Fill a bucket with warm water and white vinegar, using ¼ cup (60 mL) vinegar for each gallon (3.8 liters) water. Dip a sponge mop or microfiber cloth in the bucket and ring out thoroughly. Wipe leaving a damp sheen, not standing puddles, which can harm the floor., Monthly or whenever your floor looks dirty, mop with a stronger solution. Instead of vinegar, use mild cork-floor or wood-floor detergent, diluted according to label instructions.


You may use another mild, pH-neutral cleaner, but test it underneath furniture first to see if it leaves a mark. Go easy if using dish soap or another sudsy cleaner, as too much of it can leave a soapy film on the floor., Use an absorbent towel or soft cloth to wipe up spills on your cork floor as soon as they happen. Never allow moisture to remain on your cork floor. Although cork is durable and moisture-resistant, cork is a type of wood flooring, and will eventually absorb moisture if it isn't removed.


If the spill has caused a stain, use the vinegar or detergent solution described above. Repeat with a more concentrated solution if necessary, or look for a specialized cork floor cleaning product.

, For an extremely dirty floor that hasn't been properly maintained, use one of the following treatments:If the floor has a polyurethane finish, rent a floor machine and 00 grade wool disks. Reapply the finish after cleaning.
If the floor has a wax finish, clean with liquid solvent wax. If this doesn't do the trick, use a buffer (low speed floor machine) with 00 steel wool disks, followed by lamb's wool disks and another application of wax.

, Protect cork floors from bright sunlight, which will fade the colors of the floor. Use curtains, drapes, window tint, blinds, or other window treatments to block strong light., To allow for easy movement and distribute weight, place felt pads under all heavy pieces of furniture. Put a protective mat under office chairs and other wheeled furniture., Use breathable mats made of natural fibers, to collect moisture and dirt. Avoid mats with rubber or other non-porous backings, which may trap moisture and cause discoloration. Wipe your feet each time you enter to avoid tracking grit and dirt onto your cork flooring.

, Place a drainage saucer under potted plants to catch drips and overflow., Cork tiles come pre-treated with sealant, but this will wear down eventually. Ideally, reapply using a sealant recommended by the manufacturer, or at least one that specifically mentions cork on the label. This is usually a water-based polyurethane finish. You may use curable oil or hard wax oil, but these are more work to apply and last for a shorter time.Typically, to apply polyurethane, gently abrade the floor and roll on the finish using a foam roller. Leave it untouched for 24–48 hours. Follow the instructions on your finish label if it gives contradictory advice.
Floor-stripping chemicals may harm the cork. To avoid having to use them, stick with the same type of finish each time.
A typical home may get 5–10 years of use out of a polyurethane finish, or 1.5–2 years from wax.Cork floors in busy public buildings or businesses may need sealing every few months.

This removes dirt and dust gently, which prevents scratches and protects your floor.For floors with an anti-slip aggregate coating--such as aluminum oxide--a soft bristle push broom may be more effective than a standard dust mop.;
, If you have visible construction joints or saw cuts, you should use a vacuum to clean these out. For best results, use your vacuum attachment hose with a crevice tool. Vacuum these joints about once per month.If you do not have a vacuum, you can try to clean any joints/cuts with a stiff bristle broom.

, Oil, chemicals, or even just water left to sit for too long can damage your epoxy floors. Clean any spills as soon as you see them using a soft towel or cloth. You can use a gentle cleanser--such as Windex--if a spill is sticky or leaves a film."

Try water first.,
Use a cleaning solution.,
Pour baking soda to absorb the liquid.,
Vacuum immediately after treating the stain.",How to Clean Berber Carpet1," The simplest and easiest way to remove a tough stain is to apply cold water to the tainted area. Blot the stain with a dry towel first first to avoid rubbing the stain deeper into the carpet. Dampen a clean white towel and gently work the towel into the stain and then blot the stain with a clean, dry cloth. Repeat these steps until the stain is gone.Never scrub your Berber carpet. You will damage the fibers and cause fuzziness and snags.
Blot from the outer edge of the stain toward the center of the stain. This prevents you from spreading the stain and making it larger.;
, If water is not working, try a cleaning solution. You can purchase a cleaning solution that is formulated for cleaning carpets or you can make your own using vinegar and water. Mix white vinegar and water using a ratio of 1 parts vinegar to 5 parts water. For example, mix 1 tablespoon of vinegar with 5 tablespoons of water.Test whatever cleaner you use in a small area before you apply it to the rest of the carpet. Try it out in an area that is not visible such as under a piece of furniture or a rug. If it causes damage to your carpet, you can cover it up.
Do not use any cleaners that contain detergent or soap. This will result in soapy residue that you will not be able to remove from the carpet. This residue may also attract dirt.
Follow the same steps you used when treating the stain with water only.

, Baking soda can be used to get rid of the moisture you created while removing the stain. If the liquid has not penetrated your carpet and caused a stain, you can skip the previous steps and only use baking soda to clean up the spill. Cover the spill with baking soda. The baking soda should ball up as it absorbs the liquid. Wait for at least 20 seconds and then vacuum up the baking soda. Repeat this process until the baking soda no longer balls up.You can also blot the area with a clean dry towel.
Berber is tightly woven and retains more moisture than other types of carpet so it will take it longer to dry., Follow-up any stain treatment with a good dry vacuuming. Vacuuming will remove any excess dampness. Berber carpet's varying depth and intricacies make it easy for water to settle and possibly lead to unhealthy mold accumulating in your carpet. Vacuuming up any dampness is a sure way to prevent this from happening.


Vacuuming will also speed up the drying time.
Use slow, steady movements as you vacuum the carpet. Rough vacuuming may damage the carpet fibers.
If you notice that the stain has reappeared after you vacuum, treat the stain again with water or cleaning solution.

Perform a deep cleaning every three months.,
Choose a cleaning solution.,
Mop the floor with a hard foam mop.,
Rinse the floor.",How to Clean Epoxy Floors2," In addition to general cleaning, you can keep your epoxy floors in good shape by doing a deep cleaning about once every few months. In order to accomplish this, you may need to move some vehicles, tools, or other items out of your way., You have two good options to choose from: the first is a non-toxic, biodegradable cleanser (like Simple Green), and the second is ammonia. When prepared with the right amount of water, both of these cleansers are safe and effective for epoxy floors.Mix 1/2 cup (118 ml) of Simple Green with one gallon of hot water.
Mix 1/2 cup (118 ml) of ammonia with one gallon of hot water.

, Create a bucket of cleansing solution, as well as a bucket of plain hot water. Submerge your hard foam mop into your cleaning solution, ring it out, and them move it over your floor., Fill a bucket with clean warm water. Using your hard foam mop, go back over the floor with water in order to rinse off any detergent. When you're finished, dry the floor with a soft towel."

Scrub stubborn spots with a stiff nylon brush.,
Clean rust stains or salt film with a lactic acid-based cleanser.,
Remove tire marks with a concrete de-greaser.",How to Clean Epoxy Floors3," For stubborn spots and stains, spray the area with a stronger ratio of cleansing solution (either ammonia or Simple Green) and scrub with a stiff nylon brush. Repeat this action until all stains are gone. When you are done scrubbing, rinse the area with a bit of water and dry with a towel., The best way to remove rust stains or to clear away film from road salt is to clean your floor with a lactic acid-based cleanser (such as CLR). Create a solution that is 1 part lactic acid cleanser to 1 part warm water, and apply it directly to the area you want to clean. Scrub with a regular scrub brush and rinse with cold water.Do not let the cleanser sit for more than 1-2 minutes on your epoxy floor.

, The best way to remove tire marks from epoxy floors is to saturate the area with a concrete degreasing product, and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Then use a stiff bristle nylon brush to vigorously scrub tire marks away. Once the tire marks have been removed, rinse the area with a bit of water and dry with a towel."

Steam clean your carpet.,
Dry clean your carpet.,
Hire a professional cleaner.",How to Clean Berber Carpet2," Steam cleaning uses hot water to deep clean your carpet and extract deeply embedded particles.You can purchase a steam cleaner and do this yourself. Before you steam clean, you need to vacuum and spot treat the stains on your carpet. Follow the manufacturer instructions for using your steam cleaner.


Pull the machine slowly as you go over your carpet. Only go over the area one time to limit the amount of water that you apply to the carpet.
It is extremely important that you dry your carpet thoroughly. Not extracting all of the water can result in mold, mildew and odor. Open windows and use fans to speed up the drying process.
If you do not want to purchase a steam cleaner, you can rent one from a local hardware store or carpet store.

, Dry cleaning involves applying a dry powder to your carpet, working the powder into the carpet, and then vacuuming up the dry powder. The dry powder helps pull the dirt and soil out of the carpet. Vacuum your carpet before you apply the powder. Follow the instructions on the cleaner to determine how much you should use on your carpet.The instructions may recommend that you use a mechanical brush to work the powder into the carpet. However, the brushes should not be used on Berber as it may cause snags. Instead, work the powder gently in with your hands.
Always read the label to determine how long to leave the powder on. Some powders require 20 to 30 minutes while other compounds may be vacuumed up immediately.
This type of cleaning is recommended for Berber because there is not a risk of over-wetting the carpet and causing mold and mildew.

, If your carpet is deeply stained or you are not comfortable using these methods on your own, hire a professional cleaner. A professional cleaner will assess the type of Berber you have and the condition of your carpet. The cleaner can then choose an appropriate cleaning method.


Use carpet cleaner that has experience working with Berber carpet.

Vacuum your carpet regularly.,
Prevent damage in the first place.,
Clean up spills as soon as possible.",How to Clean Berber Carpet3," Weekly vacuuming prevents dirt from building up. Use a high suction vacuum that does not have a brush. Berber is a looped carpet and a brush will snag and damage your carpet.If your vacuum has a brush, turn the brush off when vacuuming. Vacuums with a beater bar should also be avoided.
Vacuum up dirt as soon as you see it. If dirt sits on top of your carpet, it will eventually work itself into the loops of the carpet and it will be difficult to remove it., Simple things like removing your shoes when you enter your house or placing mats around doors and other high-traffic areas will go a long way in keeping your Berber carpet looking sharp. Do not allow eating and drinking in rooms that have Berber carpet.


Children and pets make keeping your Berber carpet more difficult as they are more likely to cause stains and snag the carpet. If possible, limit their time in the areas that have Berber carpet.You can also cover areas with large rugs or place blankets on the carpet when your children are playing on the floor.
If you have pets, keep their claws trimmed to avoid snagging your carpet., Berber is more stain resistant than other types of carpet. If you spill something on your carpet, you have an opportunity to take care of it before the substance penetrates the fibers of your carpet. Oils are much harder to remove from Berber carpet than other types of spillsbecause oil is easily absorbed by Berber.Time is the most important factor for preventing stains. If you can absorb the spill, you are much less likely to have a stain.
It is best to call a professional cleaner for an oil spill."

Sweep your ceramic tile regularly.,
Mop the floor weekly.,
Use a doormat.,
Clean spills promptly after they occur.,
Clean your grout.,
Use the least abrasive means possible to clean.",How to Clean Ceramic Tile1," Use a broom and dustpan to sweep your floor at least once each week. This will remove dust, dirt, and other grime from the tile.Alternately, you could vacuum your ceramic tiles to remove dust, dirt, and crumbs., After sweeping the floor, mop it at least once each week. There’s no need to use soap (though it doesn’t hurt). This will keep your ceramic tile looking shiny and new.








Once you’ve mopped the floor, wring the mop out immediately and dry the floor with it to prevent any new dirt from settling in wet areas, and to protect you from slipping.
If you use soap, use a nontoxic dish detergent.

, If you’re trying to protect ceramic tile located directly inside the foyer, place a doormat outside the door of your residence. Additionally, place a rug or another mat right inside the house. Encourage family members and visitors to wipe their feet on both mats, and to remove their shoes when they enter the home.Use of doormats is especially important during rainy and snowy seasons.

, If a spill happens on your ceramic tile floor, clean it up as soon as possible. The longer a stain sits on your ceramic tile, the harder it will be to remove. Use mops on large spills and absorbent cloths on smaller spills.







, The grout is the sunken area bordering each ceramic tile. Over time, it can become discolored and gross. To keep it clean, mix baking soda and water in equal amounts. Coat the grout with the paste. Allow it to sit for several hours (or even overnight). Scrub the grout vigorously with an old toothbrush or a stiff-bristled brush. Wipe the paste scum away with a sponge soaked in warm water.








For an extra boost of cleaning power, fill a spray bottle with vinegar and spray the paste after you apply it.
The frequency with which you clean your grout is up to you. Clean your grout as often as you like, or when it begins to show discoloration. Floors that are used more heavily will require more frequent cleaning. If you have children, pets, and/or walk about your home with shoes on, you’ll need to clean your grout more often.

, When cleaning ceramic tiles, always start with just water. Test any commercial cleaning solution on a small and out-of-sight portion of your ceramic tile before you apply it to a larger or more visible area of your tile. This will help you ensure that the solution does not discolor or otherwise damage your tile. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or creams containing gritty ingredients like silicate."

Vacuum regularly.,
Protect heavily-traveled areas of the carpet.,
Clean up spills right away.,
Know the right technique for removing older stains.",How to Clean Carpets1," Invest in a good vacuum that sucks up dirt from deep within the carpet fibers, especially if you have a shaggy carpet or you live with cats and dogs. Vacuuming regularly keeps your carpet looking and smelling fresh.


Vacuum several times a week. If you have pets, you may need to vacuum every day.
Don't rush the vacuuming process. Even high-powered vacuums need a moment to grab dust, dirt and fur from the base of the carpet fibers. Run the vacuum over the carpet more than once to ensure it is completely clean.;
, If your carpeting reaches your front door, kitchen, or other areas of your home that tend to get a lot of traffic, consider protecting those areas with throw rugs or plastic carpet protector mats. That way you won't be struggling to clean up clots of dirt and bits of grass with the vacuum cleaner every day.


Plastic carpet protector mats have the added bonus of allowing the carpet to be visible through the clear plastic. They are an inconspicuous way to protect your carpet from dirt.
Use carpet runners in hallways, which tend to get a lot of foot traffic.

, Letting spills soak into your carpet and dry makes it much harder to remove the residue. If you can get to a spill right after the accident, you'll save a lot of time later.


Use a clean cloth or paper towels to absorb the spill, then pour baking powder over the area and let it sit for 15 minutes. When the spill is completely dry, vacuum it up.
If wine or another colorful liquid is spilled, add a little club soda before sprinkling on the baking soda.

, Sometimes its impossible to get to a stain right away. If you're faced with an old wine or coffee stain, don't panic; many carpets are pre-treated with stain resistant chemicals, so stains aren't usually difficult to remove. Use a spray bottle full of vinegar to lightly spray the area, then wipe it with a cloth. For deeper stains, saturate the area with vinegar or carpet cleaner, sprinkle with baking soda, and vacuum the area once the baking soda has dried.


Don't attempt to scrub stains away from carpets. Scrubbing damages the fibers and makes the area look worse.
Don't douse the area with too much vinegar, water, or any other liquid. If it seeps too deeply into the carpet to dry, it could lead to mold growth.
Lighter carpets can be effectively cleaned by applying a mixture of lemon and salt. Do a spot treatment in a discreet area to make sure it doesn't stain your carpet a different color.

Place absorbent material on top of the spill.,
Cover the absorbent material with paper towels.,
Let the material rest for a few hours.,
Wipe up the absorbent material.,
Spread soap over the area.,
Scrub the area and rinse with clean water.,
Dry the wet spot.",How to Clean Anti Freeze Off a Garage Floor1," Kitty litter, sand, or baking soda all work and should be used to cover the spill as soon as it happens. These absorbent materials pick up the antifreeze before it settles., Paper towels or newspaper protect the material from being scattered and aid in absorption. Layer them over the kitty litter or other material. Add more layers if you wish to ensure that all of the spill will be absorbed.

, Come back after at least one hour in order to give the material time to absorb the spill. Limit your time away to about three hours maximum so you can check the antifreeze again before it sets into the floor.

, Use dry paper towels to pick up the absorbent material and wipe up any leftover fluid. While small skin exposure to antifreeze isn’t much of a threat, wash your hands with soap and water or wear gloves to be safe.

, A simple laundry or dish detergent will work for cleaning the floor. Powdered detergent is useful for setting stains, but if there is no stain yet, liquid soap can be used on the area. Let it set in for a minute., Spread water from a hose over the area. Use a nylon brush to scrub the spot. Rinse the suds away completely., Open the garage door and allow the area to dry in open air. This may take a few hours depending on the size of the spill, but will help remove the smell. If you cannot do this, layer newspaper over it. Newspaper will pick up the moisture when left for at least an hour. Paper towels can also be used to wipe off any leftover moisture.

, Place some ice cubes in a resealable plastic bag. Place the bag over the sticky stain marring your ceramic tile. After five to ten minutes, check the consistency of the stain. It should be frozen. Scrape away as much as possible, and wipe the rest off with paint thinner.







, If you’re trying to remove a stain of oil or grease, wet a dish rag with club soda. Rub the stain using a gentle circular motion.








If you don’t have club soda, you could simply use a nonabrasive floor cleaner.

, Ink or dye stains require treatment with bleach. Soak a clean dish cloth with bleach. Lay the cloth over the stain. Check it every 60 seconds or so until the stain disappears.








Don’t leave the bleach-soaked cloth on the ceramic tile too long. The alkali in the bleach can cause whitish water-soluble salts to collect on the tile.

, Small spots of nail polish can be removed with the applicator attached to the lid of your bottle of nail polish remover. If the stain refuses to come off the ceramic tile, mix a solution with proportions 1:99 bleach to water. Dab a dish cloth in the mixture. Use the dish cloth to clean the nail polish. Alternately, dip a dish cloth in hydrogen peroxide and scrub the nail polish away.








If using bleach, a mixture of 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) (2/3 tablespoon) bleach and one liter (one quart) of water is typically appropriate.

, Before you try to lift a paint stain from your ceramic tile, mop or wipe down the tile and allow it to dry. Apply the commercial paint remover according to manufacturer directions. Typically, this means applying a coat of paint remover with a paint brush just as you would when painting. After about 30 minutes, the paint should be ready to wipe away with a damp paper towel.








Open the windows of the area you’re working in to reduce inhalation of the toxic fumes paint removers give off.

, Mix a few tablespoons of ammonia with an equal amount of water. Dampen a dish cloth with the solution. Scrub the iodine stain from your ceramic tile by pressing it and scrubbing in a back-and-forth method.

Mop the floor with vinegar.,
Scour the stain.,
Use steam cleaning.,
Use diluted muriatic acid.",How to Clean Ceramic Tile3," Mix ½ cup (117 milliliters) white distilled vinegar or a specialized cleaning vinegar with one gallon (3.7 liters) of warm water. Fill your mop bucket with this solution and mop the floor with it.








If you don’t have vinegar, you can substitute rubbing alcohol.

, If mopping has not adequately cleaned your ceramic tile, mix warm water with an equal amount of scouring powder. Scouring powder is a cleaning agent designed to help you clean hard surfaces like ceramic tile. Smear the mixture onto the stain using a dish cloth. Let the mixture sit on the stain for five to 10 minutes. Remove the dish cloth and use a soft brush to scrub the tile. Finally, rinse the area with a damp dish cloth.








Repeat the process if the stain remains after one scouring session.

, If the ceramic tile you wish to clean is on your floor, you could use a steam cleaner to remove serious stains. A steam cleaner works much like a vacuum cleaner does. Simply fill the water tank and turn the machine on. Roll the steam cleaner over the portion of ceramic tile you wish to clean.You can rent steam cleaners from many hardware or home repair stores.

, Muriatic acid is a corrosive mineral acid. Mix the muriatic acid in a solution with one part acid and five parts water. For instance, you might mix one tablespoon acid with five tablespoons water. Apply the solution to ceramic tile you wish to clean. Scrub the area vigorously with a soft bristled brush or old toothbrush. Wet a paper towel and use it to wipe the area after scrubbing.








Dry the area with a dry paper towel or dish cloth.
When using muriatic acid, wear a face mask and thick rubber gloves. Take care not to get it on your skin.

, Carpets can be effectively cleaning using products you probably already have in your cabinets. Mix the following ingredients in a bowl you don't plan to use again for cooking:


1 cup borax (available at hardware stores)
2 cups cornmeal
1/2 cup baking soda

, Fill a spray bottle with a solution of half vinegar, half water and spray the areas that need the most help. Be sure not to completely douse them with liquid, since you don't want unevaporated moisture to lead to mold growth.

, Spread it evenly around the carpet, focusing on the areas that tend to get dirtiest or smell the most. Leave the room and let the mixture sit on the carpet for an hour.


Keep children and pets out of the room while the mixture sits on the carpet.
Don't use more powder than your vacuum can handle. A light sprinkling should be enough to remove odors and light stains.

, Run the vacuum several times over the carpet to clean up the cornmeal mixture. When you're finished, discard the vacuum bag.

Carpet-cleaning machines can be rented from home and garden stores, Walmart, and specialty vacuuming or carpet stores.
Carpet-cleaning machine rentals come with cleaning solution and stain removal treatment. It's important to know what kind of carpet you have before renting a machine, so you can ensure that you use the proper cleaning solution for your carpet.
You may also wish to hire a professional to come to your house and use the cleaner to clean your carpet for you.

, Make sure it is completely free of all loose dust and dirt before you start the deep cleaning treatment. Sweep the dirtiest parts of the carpet to kick up dirt before vacuuming.

, Most carpet-cleaning rentals come with a solution that is meant to be applied to stained areas before the deep cleaning is conducted. If you don't have a stain remover solution, spray stained areas with vinegar instead.

, Follow the directions that came with your machine to add the appropriate amounts of hot water and carpet cleaner.


In some cases the water and solution are each held in their own tank; as instructed, remove the tanks and fill them with water or cleaner.
Make sure the tanks are properly fitted on the machine before proceeding.

, Run the machine slowly over the carpet, making sure to cover every inch. You may overlap areas that have already been cleaned to be sure you don't miss a spot. On some machine models you will see dirty water splash into a receptacle when the machine is working properly.


If the machine runs out of water or cleaning solution, turn it off and unplug it. Discard the dirty solution, rinse the tanks, and fill them with clean hot water and cleaning solution.
Dirty solution may be poured into the toilet.

Place newspaper over the detergent.,
Wet the newspaper.,
Leave the newspaper to dry for three hours.,
Scrub the stain.,
Rinse the area.,
Blot the stain with newspaper.",How to Clean Anti Freeze Off a Garage Floor2," Fortunately, antifreeze dissolves in water. Use a hose, bucket, or spray bottle to soak the area. Keep it wet until you’re ready to add detergent. The moisture helps loosen the antifreeze from concrete., Choose a powdered laundry detergent or dish soap. The powdered variety is most useful because you can easily see when it covers the entire stain and it is absorbent enough to draw up the antifreeze., Stack the newspaper in several layers over the area. Press down so that it protects the soap and helps the absorption process.

, Apply water from a bucket or a hose, being careful not to disturb the paper. The water needs to soak all the way through the newspaper, leaving the newspaper thoroughly soaked in order to draw the antifreeze upwards.

, Wait three hours, leaving the area undisturbed. Come back and the newspaper will have dried significantly, leaving the stain ready to be scrubbed.

, Pick up and throw away the newspaper. Dip a nylon, stiff-bristled brush in clean water. Use the brush to scrub the area with the wet laundry detergent. You’ll notice the detergent turn into suds.Rinse the brush when finished to remove any antifreeze on it.

, Spray the area with a hose until the suds are gone. If using a bucket, spread the water over the area and use paper towels or the cleaned brush to pick up the suds and extra moisture. A pressure or power washer can also be used., Newspaper is very absorbent and will pick up the excess moisture. Use your hand to rub the newspaper over wet spots. The washed spot can then be left to dry in open air.


In case the stain is not removed, repeat cleanings are necessary.

You can of course just clean the baseboards, instead of the whole room, anytime.
Baseboards don't need to be cleaned too often, so it may be easier to just do one room at a time each day/week you clean.;
, Get the basic dust and kick up anything under the sofa now, not after you've cleaned. Give yourself ample room to work by sliding the furniture back -- you'll need to get low to the baseboards., Get into the groove between the baseboards and the wall and knock off the dust lodged there.

,, Clean 6-8"" out in front of the baseboard with the brush attachment. Then run quickly over the edge where the baseboards meet the wall., That's right -- a normal writing eraser. You could also use a Magic Eraser or similar cleaning product, but a normal pink eraser is actually very effective at attacking scuff marks., Vinegar is a key, powerful cleaning agent that is all-natural to boot. Dilute it with water to make it easier to use and less harsh on the nose.


You can also use a few drops of mild dish soap in lieu of vinegar.

, Don't try and do the whole thing at once -- water left on wood generally doesn't do good things.

, Once you have an area clean to your liking, immediately dry it. While forgetting once or twice won't likely cause any damage, it can cause issues for sensitive woods or finishes.

, Get into the dustiest, dirtiest spots with a wet cotton swap. You may need a couple, but they're great for the harder to reach areas., Paint acts a sealant, protecting the wood partially from moisture or stripping. Most paint is also easy to accidentally strip away, as well. When in doubt, use this following method to clean your baseboards to protect the wood and the paint.

Always remember that aluminum dust is both toxic and combustible.,
Use a wood-cutting saw with carbide tipped blades to cut most aluminum.,
Apply cutting lubricants on your blades or bits.,
Reduce the diameter of cutting blade for better results.,
Use a jigsaw if circular cuts need to be made in the aluminum.,
Use clamps to secure your aluminum piece(s) and ensure your fingers are never too close to the saw blades.,
Feed the aluminum through the blade (or the blade through the aluminum) slowly.",How to Cut Aluminum," This is rarely an issue with the proper safety measures, but this is why those same safety measures are so important. For big projects, you should have a respirator or potentially a full-face shield. You should have, at minimum:


Respirator
Safety Goggles
Gloves;
, If possible, choose saw blades that create narrow kerfs. This is possible because aluminum does not tend to close up as you cut it.


If you're unsure about what lubricant will suit your job best, consult with other experienced craftsmen or people that work at your local hardware store.

, This can range from standard oil to saw wax. Because you'll be cutting metal on metal, you want to lubricate it to prevent some sparks and slippage.








, The cutting speed used for wood is generally going to be too fast to safely cut aluminum. Using a 10 inch (25.4 cm) table saw, for example, you can reduce the blade to 7 1/4 inch (18.4 cm). This will subsequently slow your cutting speed.









If it's not possible to alter blade sizes, consider purchasing equipment with a variable speed router. The equipment will be more expensive, but it will be easy and intuitive to lower the speed to something more appropriate to aluminum.

, You should still remember to lubricate the blade, and cut slowly. There is no rush with aluminum.








, As an additional safety measure, use a push stick, which allows you to move the aluminum safely without getting near the blades.








, Again, you want to work more slowly than you would with wood. Steady, even pressure is the safest way to go.









Remain clear from the kickback zone when cutting. This is usually directly behind the saw. Kickback is when recently cut pieces are thrown clear by the power of the saw used.
Alternately, you can use a bridge to secure your saw and reduce kickback.
Adjust the blade depth so the blade doesn't protrude any more than 1/4 inch (.62 cm) through the metal if you're having issues. The closer the cut, the better."

If your sheet metal is too thick, you may need special machinery, like a brake or a torch, to bend your sheet into the desired shape.

, The bending you will be doing will warp your sheet metal so that it is physically bigger. To calculate the expansion that will take place on the outside of your bend angle, you will need to know your bend allowance. You can find your bend allowance with the following formula: (π/180) x B x (IR + K x MT) = bend allowance (BA), where B is the angle complementary to your desired bend angle (1 to 180 degrees), MT is the thickness of the material, IR is the inside radius, and K is the K-factor.To ascertain your K-Factor, inside radius, and material thickness (expressed as a decimal), you should use an Bend Allowance Chart.
As an example, if you want to bend 24 gauge sheet metal at a 90° angle, the calculation would be: 0.017453 x 90 x (0.020 + 0.33 x 0.024) = 0.0438558984 inch bend allowance
Keep in mind that some metals are more brittle than others. Bending a brittle metal beyond its limits could cause the metal to snap and break., Now that you know your bend allowance, take your protractor and draw a clear line with your marker across the point at which you will bend your sheet metal. Then use your bend allowance to draw your second bend line, the intervening distance between your bend lines (bend radius). The space between your bend lines will expand with the application of your bend., You should leave a little trim to your sheet, approximately ¼"" is recommended. Be sure you file and smooth your sheet, as nicks and rough edges can cause cracks to form in your metal., Your forms will have an edge that should match the angle of your desired bend. Situate your forms in the vise with the form block guide angle facing upwards out of your vise.One edge of your form will typically be rounded to the degree of your bend radius, thus helping you achieve your desired bend., Now that your forms are placed, you should clamp your sheet between your form blocks very firmly. Take care to keep your bend line even with the guide angle of your forms.

, If you have sheet metal hanging a considerable distance outside of your form blocks, you will need to support this segment so that it does not bounce too wildly and negatively impact your bend.Consider having a friend or a colleague stabilize this piece with their hand. Be sure to wear gloves to prevent any accidental cuts.

, To prevent damage or unsightly dents, it's best to use a rubber, plastic, or rawhide mallet to gently tap the metal. Do this until it bends toward the form block and achieves your desired angle gradually and evenly.Your tapping should start at one end of the evolving bend. Slowly work back and forth between your bend lines until the sheet metal is bent to the desired angle.

, This particular value is deceptively named. Contrary to first impression, this number must be expressed as decimal for your calculation to be correct, and is based off of standard gauge thickness., If your bend allowance calculation seems off, a likely place you have made a mistake is with your bend angle. If you are attempting to bend at an angle less or greater than 90°, it is necessary that you take the complementary angle to that of your desired bend.


For example: if your desire bend is 45°, you will subtract this number from 180°, which will give you a bend angle of 135°., The pressure you will be applying to bend your sheet metal will be significant. If you do not have a vise up to the challenge, or if you have not secured your vise sufficiently, your forms may slip, or you may bend your sheet metal in a way you hadn't intended.

, This should be done with extreme caution and care. In the event that you are bending a thick piece of sheet metal, you can apply heat from a blowtorch along the seam of your bend line to facilitate your bend.


Keep in mind that many kinds of fabricated metal have extremely high melting points, and applying your torch injudiciously could cause damage or do harm to your sheet metal or equipment.

Know how many strands of wire you'll be braiding.,
Separate the strands of wire.,
Pull the wire strands correctly.,
Secure loose ends.",How to Braid Wire Rope,"


The complexity of the braiding process will depend on the number of strands of the wire. The number of strands to be used will also depend on the nature of the application in question. Generally, wires with more strands which have been braided together will be stronger and thick in diameter.
Before you begin this process put on your gloves and separate the strands of wires you would wish to braid. Clamp one end of the wire strands and ensure that they have been secured properly in preparation for the braiding process. Attach a clamp to the top of all the strands and use a screwdriver to tighten the screws in the clamp. This is to ensure that all the strands are secured firmly. The strands of wires will be attached together to one end point. To braid wire rope, you will begin from that end where all the wire strands diverge from.;
,


With all the strands of wires separated and the hands fully protected with the gloves you can begin to braid the wire rope.
Three strands of wires; assuming that you have started with the left strand, place it in between the other two strands of wires such that the strand of wire which was initially on the left becomes the strand at the middle. Then, place the right strand in between the other two strands such that it becomes the middle strand of wire. Then, pull and return the old middle stand, which will now be on the left side over again to be the middle strand again. Continue with this process as you tighten them each time to make a tight braid.
Five strands of wires; this is a more advanced technique of the braiding process. To braid wire rope with five strands, you must be well conversant with the process involved in braiding the three and the four wire strands first. As the number of strands increase, the process becomes more and more complicated.  First, you have to separate all the five stands of wires. Take the three middle strands of wires and do only one stitch of a three strand braid. That is, assuming you start with the one on the left; place it to the center to become the middle strand, take the one on the right and put it to the center to be the middle strand and finally, the one which was initially the middle strand and now the left strand should be taken back to be the middle strand.

,


With the two outside strands of the previous step’s braid; pull the strand which was on the left and pull it over the outside strand on the left. Again, pull the one which was on the right and pull the strand over one outermost strand on the right side.  This process may seem complicated as the number of wire strands increase. As a rule of thumb; begin with the three strands since it is easier to follow before proceeding to the next level. You can begin by practicing with thread which is softer to turn and twist before opting for wires.
Similarly, it is advisable to begin the process by doing it for wires with smaller diameters before going for wires with slightly thicker diameters. It is such a simple process though if you master the basic concepts. During this process, other equipment such as pliers also become essential since you use it to tighten the braid by pulling the strands each time.

,


After you have reached the desired length of the wire rope, you must secure the loose ends. Generally, this is a simple DIY procedure. The process in industrial set up is not different from the DIY procedure. The only difference comes in the kind of machines which are used to accomplish the process. Most braiding machines have been automated with the advancement in technology. The DIY procedure is really tiresome if you have to braid a very long peace of wire.
Moreover, different metals have different strength which may make it cumbersome when it comes to braiding stronger wire ropes. In fact, the DIY process is not just suitable for most wires with thicker diameters.

Use plain hot water in a steam cleaner.,
Clean with liquid soap and water.,
Purchase a natural carpet cleaning product.",How to Clean Carpet Naturally1," Many carpet cleaning machines say that you should use their highly concentrated cleaner when steam cleaning your carpets. However, using plain water in these machines will get a large amount of dirt and grime out of the carpet, and it won't leave any residue or chemicals behind.This method will not work on hard to clean stains. However, it is a good way to give your carpet a general, all over cleaning.;
, A natural soap, such as liquid castile soap, can be a great product for cleaning carpets. It has stain and dirt removing properties but it is not toxic or dangerous to use in your home. Combine a few drops of this type of soap with warm water and scrub your carpet with it.Carry along a dry towel with you as you clean, so that you can soak most of the water and soap out of the carpet as you go along.
If you have your own carpet cleaning machine, you can also use a few drops of this type of soap in it instead of more traditional carpet cleaning solutions.

, There are more and more commercial cleaning products available that are natural and non-toxic. Look for this type of product at your local natural food store or online through natural product distributors.


When considering using a commercial cleaner, look at both the ingredients and the rest of the label for safety information. With a truly natural and non-toxic cleaner, you are likely to find labels that certify it as a ""green"" product.
To find a non-toxic, natural carpet cleaner, you can look for product safety lists from organizations concerned with providing information about natural products, such as the Environmental Working Group."

Clean the metal.",How to Blue Steel1," If there is any finish left on the metal, it will interfere with the bluing process. This will result in an uneven and ineffective bluing. Grind and sand the piece until you have removed any and all finishes. You should see only bare metal., If there are any pits in the metal, this is the time to deal with them. Use your sander or grinder to take the metal down around the pit. This will smooth the metal and give you a better finish., Gloves will not only protect your hands, but they will also protect the metal from your hands. Your hands will leave oils on the metal that interfere with the bluing process. Wear nitrile or latex gloves to keep this oil from reaching the metal., Clean the metal with an alcohol wipe. You should then follow by cleaning it with a wax and grease remover (an organic solvent). Finally, use a soft cloth to dry the metal."

Use baking soda to deodorize your carpet.,
Deodorize with white vinegar.,
Use lemon to deodorize.",How to Clean Carpet Naturally2," If your carpet needs deodorizing, look no further than your kitchen pantry. Baking soda works great for deodorizing because it absorbs odors very effectively. Sprinkle a layer of baking soda all over your carpet, let it sit on the carpet for several hours, and then vacuum it up. The baking soda should absorb a wide variety of odors from your carpet.


Some commercial carpet deodorizers have scents in them that are released when you vacuum up the deodorizer. To mimic this with natural home products, simple mix a few drops of a clear essential oil, such as lavender oil, with a cup of baking soda and then sprinkle it on your carpet. When you vacuum the baking soda up, the smell of the essential oil should be released., Vinegar, like baking soda, can be a great product for deodorizing your carpet because it both absorbs odors and kills odor-causing bacteria. Simply pour some into a spray bottle and then spray a fine mist over your carpet. When the vinegar smell goes away, which may take several hours, you will be left with a deodorized, scent free carpet.If you cannot deal with the scent of vinegar, this may not be the right method for you.

, If you have a small area or spot that needs to be deodorized, consider using lemon. Mix the juice of one lemon with a few tablespoons of water and then dab it on the offending area. The acidity of the lemon should remove even the most unpleasant odors.Once you have dabbed the lemon juice mixture on, rinse the area with soapy water and then dry the area with a cloth.

Pre-treat stains with baking soda.,
Apply vinegar and water to stains.,
Use hydrogen peroxide on blood stains.,
Apply club soda to acidic stains.",How to Clean Carpet Naturally3," If you have a spill on your carpet that is liquid, you should try to soak up as much of it as you can right away. Whether it's a beverage, urine, food, or other type of liquid, baking soda does a great job of absorbing all kinds of liquid and pulling them out of your carpet.Sprinkle baking soda over the stain, making sure that you put enough down to absorb all of the liquid. Give it a few minutes to soak it up.

, If you have a simple water-soluble spill, you can use a mixture of vinegar and water to clean it up. Mix a 1/4 teaspoon of white vinegar with 32 ounces of water in a spray bottle. Spray it on simple spills and then blot the area to remove all the residue. Some spills that this will work on include:Beer
Cola
Milk
Dirt

, Blood stains can be particularly hard to get out of fabrics, including carpets. Hydrogen peroxide can be helpful with removing blood, as it is a natural oxidizer and so it can break blood up. Put some hydrogen peroxide on a clean cloth and dab the area repeatedly. It can take awhile to get the blood out, so take your time and be patient while the hydrogen peroxide does its magic.Be sure to test that the hydrogen peroxide will not damage the carpet fibers on an area of carpet that is not seen before using it in a visible area.

, Club soda will remove many acidic stains, such as coffee, wine, or juice. Simply blot the area with a cloth covered in club soda. Keep adding more club soda to the cloth as it is absorbed into the stained area until the area is relatively saturated.As the stain is removed, and gets onto the cleaning cloth you are using, use a different area of the cloth to blot, so that the stain is not reapplied to the carpet.
Once the stain is gone, make sure to keep dabbing the area with a dry cloth until the area is dry.

If you are bluing a larger piece, use a rag or brush to apply the solution., Once you have covered the piece with bluing solution, wipe it dry. Use a soft cloth, and make sure not to leave any solution in cracks or crevices. This will help ensure an even finish., Use a fine grit sandpaper (for example 800 grit) to sand the finish. Sand slowly and carefully so that you do not go through the finish. This will smooth out your finish and make it shine., Continue applying and polishing coats. When you have reached the desired color, you can polish one final time and then stop. Protect your finish by covering it in a protective oil (e.g. gun oil)."

Scrub the piece in cold water.,
Immerse the piece in salt solution.,
Rinse the piece in cold water.,
Rinse the piece in boiling water.,
Apply water displacing oil.",How to Blue Steel3," Submerge the piece in cold water and scrub with steel wool or a scuff pad. This will create small scratches for the bluing solution to adhere to. This should be done after any finish has been removed and the metal has been cleaned., A bluing solution is made of potassium nitrite and sodium hydroxide dissolved into water. The solution is heated to approximately 275 °F (135 °C). You should leave the part immersed for 15-30 minutes., When you remove the piece from the mixture, put it immediately into cold water. This will cause the metal to contract and lock in the finish. Do not scrub the metal again., Boil plain water (with no salts). Dip the metal piece into the boiling water. This is the last step in the bluing process., Removing the water from the metal is important. Put some water displacing oil onto a soft cloth and rub it into the metal. It will also leave a protective layer over the metal."

Rust blue antique parts.,
Fume blue for an even finish.,
Try niter bluing.,
Contact a bluing expert.",How to Blue Steel4," Rust bluing is the process of coating the metal in acid. Most commonly, nitric acid or hydrochloric acid is used. This allows the part to rust uniformly. Then, you scrub the rust off and repeat the process until the desired color is achieved. You can do this in a large container or vat that is tolerant to acid., Fume bluing is similar to rust bluing, but it creates a more uniform rusting. The part is placed in an airtight chamber and either nitric acid or hydrochloric acid (gas) is pumped into the chamber. The gas causes a uniform bluing. Any airtight container will work, as long as it cannot be corroded by the acid., Niter bluing is the hottest form of bluing. In this case, you take a mixture of potassium nitrate salt and sodium hydroxide salt and melt them (700 °F (371 °C). The part will achieve a nice bluing when dipped into the solution for., There are many types of bluing professionals. If you are not up to trying it yourself, you can reach out to a bluer to learn their specialty. Ask what kinds of bluing they do and what pieces they are willing to treat (e.g. large or small)."

Get your rugs professionally cleaned.",How to Clean and Maintain Area Rugs," This prevents dirt from building up. Vacuuming your area rug regularly helps to keep your home clean and allergy free. To get the maximum amount of dirt out turn your rug upside down first and vacuum the back of the rug. This looses deep down dirt to the top of the fibers. To avoid getting frayed edges and worn fringes do not vacuum over the edges of your area rug. It is best to use suction only on Wool area rugs, using a rotating brush/beater bar sucks up the little fibers of wool.;
, For wet spills, lay towel on the spill and stand on the towel, as the towel gets wet move it to always have a dry area over spill. When blotting up a spot rub in straight lines, NEVER go in circles, this causes damage to the rug.

, For most spills a damp white towel works best, for fresh pet urine a mixture of 1 part vinegar and 2 parts water and blotting is best, for red wine an equal mixture of Dawn dish soap and 10% hydrogen peroxide and blotting is effective. Always do a test spot first to make sure the colors of your rug do not bleed/run.

, Vacuuming regularly and wiping up spills and spots keeps your rug looking clean, but getting it professionally cleaned once every year or two keeps your rug and home air healthy. When looking for a professional area rug cleaner make sure that they are a Wool Safe Approved company even if your rug isn't wool.

Understand the structural issues possible with manually-bent rebar and know how to avoid them.,
Look into a manual bender for a cheap, portable rebar bending solution.,
Consider getting a power bender to make perfect hooks and bends on the go.,
Recoat any galvanized or epoxy coated rebar after bending.",How to Bend Rebar1," When you bend metal, you naturally weaken it. When done correctly, however, you can minimize damage and still get the shape you need to complete the project. Keep the following in mind as you work:Always note the grade and size of the bar you're bending, checking against the equipment you're using to ensure it works.
Check with your project engineer to ensure your bends meet the minimal internal bend diameter. If you don't know what this is for your project, wait until you do.
Never re-bend rebar. Once you've bent it, it's finished. Continually working it will significantly lower its strength.;
, These devices usually clamp the rebar down, allowing you to pull down on the free end to bend it. The bar is set on a cast-iron die, allowing you to easily bend it to your desired curve. However, they are slow, only bending one piece at once, and they usually only bend in 90-degree increments, meaning you must guess to get other angles. However, they are also relatively cheap.Cost from $200-500.
Can only handle lower-grade steel and sizes.

, These electric or gasoline-powered motors are essential if you need a lot of bends quickly, all to a standardized length. Many come with cutters, too, allowing you to sheer overly long bars. Though expensive, and heavy, they are essential for big construction crews who need precise, frequent rebar adjustments. To use it, simply turn it on, set your desired angle and length, and feed in the rebar.


Cost from $3,000-5,000.
Can handle any grade steel, or any size., The process of molding or shaping the rebar often causes coatings to chip and flake off. As long as your remember to check and touch up the areas that you've bent, however, you should not have much of an issue."

Wear personal, protective equipment.,
Choose a piece of rebar that can be reasonably bent by hand.,
Do not heat rebar in order to bend.,
Put the rebar into a vise, lining up your future bend with the end of the jaws.,
Place a steel pipe around the free end of the rebar.,
Put slow, even pressure on the bar to bend it.,
Never hit or smack a piece of rebar to bend it.",How to Bend Rebar2," One of the first steps for trying to bend rebar is to use appropriate safety gear. You must have eye goggles and glove, at the bare minimum. It may also help to wear long sleeves and pants, protecting your arms and legs. Work in an open, free space where there are not a lot of people.Cut rebar can be jagged. Any exposed ends should be covered by OSHA-approved rebar caps., Some experts suggest choosing thinner rebar, such as a 1/4-inch design, for smaller projects where users will need to bend this steel into different kinds of shapes. If you need anything larger, however, you should consider trying professional and mechanical methods, as bending by hand will be difficult and dangerous.The type of rebar needed is not purely up to choice -- there are important structural codes that you need to follow when constructing.

, The issue of whether heating rebar can help individuals to bend it is under a significant amount of debate. Some experts and experienced steelworkers maintain that heating rebar is appropriate, and can help individuals to bend it effectively. Others point out dangers and consequences of heating the steel, saying that this is not a good general practice for changing the shape of a piece of rebar. At the end of the day, follow this simple guideline: if it is ""non-weldable rebar,"" then don't heat it up at all. If is isn't, go ahead if you think it will help., In order to bend rebar, you will need to hold one side of it in place, then pull down on the opposite end to bend it. As the vise holds the rebar in place, it bends right where the vise stops and the ""free"" section of the bar begins.


Make sure your vice is well-anchored to your work bench.
Your bend should be right at the end of the vise jaws., This makes it easier to hold and bend. The longer this pipe, as well, the more leverage you can get on the rebar, making it easier to bend. The longer your lever, or the free area outside of the vice, the less power you need to make your bend., Slowly and carefully press down on the steel pipe covering your rebar until you get your desired bend.


For precise bends, you'll likely need a mold. You can cut and carve wood blocks, for example, and bend them the rebar around that. For even more precise bends or thicker rebar, you will need to move on to professional equipment, however. These machines come with dies that you bend the bar on top of to get the perfect angle.

, The sudden impact of a sledgehammer, for example, leaves you little control over the final shape. What's more, over bending damages the steel surface and can cause the bar to break of fail down the line."

Use the sponge to clean sections of the wall.,
Dry the wall with a soft towel.",How to Clean Plaster Walls1," Attach the dust brush to the end of your vacuum and run the vacuum over the wall. This is the least abrasive way to clean walls and should always be your first step. If you find that your walls are sufficiently clean after using the vacuum, you should stop after performing this step.Do not put pressure on the wall as you vacuum it. Lightly rub the vacuum over it and allow the suction to pick up dirt.Pick a section of the wall. Start at the top and move the vacuum from side to side, then down, until you reach the floor. When you reach the floor, move on to the next section. Use a ladder if you cannot reach the ceiling.
Empty the vacuum cleaner before beginning this process.;
, Keep the pail of water near you while you clean so you do not need to make constant trips to the sink. As you clean, regularly squeeze dirty water out of the sponge and wet it again in the bucket of clean water., A small amount of detergent can also be thrown into the water, just enough to create a few bubbles. However, this creates the danger of damage to your paint job. Consider starting without detergent. Add detergent if warm water does not seem to be sufficient for cleaning the wall. You should begin the cleaning process with the least abrasive cleaner available and then work up to more abrasive cleaners only if necessary., A sponge is the least abrasive cleaner that you can use. Dunk the sponge in the water. Squeeze it to remove excess moisture. A soft towel can also work if you do not have a sponge available., To prevent water from dripping on the floor, place something on the floor to absorb moisture.

For a tough homemade cleaning solution, try mixing 1 cup ammonia, ½ cup vinegar, and ¼ baking soda in a gallon of water., Before you expose large parts of the wall to the solution, test it on a less noticeable part of the wall. Rub it in and then dry it off. If there is no mark on the wall or discoloration, then you can use the solution on more conspicuous parts of the wall. If the solution has damaged the wall, consider other options for fixing the wall. You can, for example, repaint it or hire professional cleaners.

Glossy enamel paints tend to hold up best to abrasive cleaners. Flat, satin, and eggshell latex paints are sensitive to washing., Dunk a gentle sponge in the water. Squeeze it to remove excess moisture. A soft towel can also be used, if necessary., Rub the spot gently, moving the sponge in a circular motion. Clean the area with a heavy stain. Refrain from using your solution on unstained parts of the wall.This should be enough to clean most stains from beverages, like coffee or wine.
If you believe that your whole wall needs a heavy cleaning, then you could use the solution throughout the room. Generally though, a light cleaning without heavy solutions should suffice for anything but a heavy stain. The risk of damage to your paint job outweighs the benefits of using a cleaning solution on the entire wall.

, If your solution was not strong enough to clean the spot, try using a more abrasive solution. Consider a baking soda paste or commercial cleaner. Once again, test this solution on a less noticeable part of the wall before using it.

For a baking soda paste, mix ½ cup of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water. Mix thoroughly and then apply it to the sponge.
A degreaser can be particularly useful when cleaning grease splatters.

You may need to repeat this step several times to remove the stain.

, If none of the previous steps have worked, try using toothpaste. Cover the stain in toothpaste and let it sit for ten minutes. After ten minutes, wipe the surface clean with a soft cloth."

Place a drop cloth on the ground.,
Scrape the paint away with a putty knife.,
Rub the surface with fine-grit sandpaper.,
Use a chemical stripper.,
Wash the wall with a wet towel.",How to Clean Plaster Walls5," Removing paint will create a huge mess on the floor. You should place something like a drop cloth on the ground. Then, when you are done, you can fold up the drop cloth, pick it up, and toss the excess paint into the trash., If parts of the paint are already loose or falling off, get a putty knife underneath the paint and simply begin scraping the paint away. Use the flat edge of the scrapper so as not to damage the plaster.If you do damage the plaster, fill in the area with joint compound.

, For small chunks that you cannot pick up by scraping, use sandpaper. Rub the sandpaper over the surface to pick up the paint., Chemical strippers can discolor your wall if left on too long. However, if the paint on your wall is not sufficiently loose to scrape up on its own, you might need to use a stripper. Dip a paintbrush in the stripper and then rub the paintbrush over a section of the wall. Let the stripper sit for five minutes. Then, use a putty knife to scrape away with paint.Repeat this process until you have cleaned the wall. Ideally, once you have scrapped off a portion of the paint, you will be able to use the putty knife to remove the rest, without using a chemical stripper.

, After you have removed the paint, rub the entire wall down with sponge soaked in cool, clean water. This is step is especially important if you have used chemical stripper. If it stays on the wall, it can do damage to the surface."

Choose the right bending tools for your needs.",How to Bend Pipe1," There are 6 main bending methods. Each is best suited to a particular type of pipe.


Ram style bending, also called incremental bending, is usually used for putting large bends in light-gauge metal, such as electrical conduit. In this method, the pipe is held down at 2 external points and the ram pushes on the pipe at its central axis to bend it. Bends tend to deform into an oval shape at both the inside and outside of the bend.
Rotary draw bending is used to bend pipe for use as handrails or ornamental iron, as well as car chassis, roll cages, and trailer frames, as well as heavier conduit. Rotary draw bending uses 2 dies: a stationary counter-bending die and a fixed radius die to form the bend. It is used when the pipe needs to have a good finish and constant diameter throughout its length.
Mandrel bending is used to make stock and custom exhaust pipes, dairy tubing, and heat exchanger tubing. In addition to the dies used in rotary draw bending, mandrel bending uses a flexible support that bends with the pipe or tubing to make sure the pipe interior isn't deformed.
Induction bending heats the area to be bent with an electric coil, and then the pipe or tube is bent with dies similar to those used in rotary draw bending. The metal is immediately cooled with water to temper it. It produces tighter bends than straight rotary draw bending.
Roll bending, also called cold bending, is used whenever large bends are necessary in the pipe or tubing, such as in awning supports, barbecue grill frames, or drum rolls, as well as in most construction work. Roll benders use 3 rolls on individual shafts to roll the pipe through as the top roller pushes down to bend the pipe. (Because the rolls are arranged in a triangle, this method is sometimes called pyramid bending.)
Hot bending, in contrast, is used considerably in repair work. The metal is heated at the place where it is to be bent to soften it.;
"
"
Bend a test pipe at a 90-degree angle.,
Find the place where the bend in the pipe starts.,
Mark the ends of the bend with a permanent marker.,
Lay the pipe against the square again to find the length of the pipe in the bend.,
Find the place on your bending die where the bend begins.",How to Bend Pipe2," Not only will this familiarize you with how much force you need to apply to operate your bender, but this pipe will serve as a reference for future bends.


To check the angle of your pipe, lay it against a carpenter's square with the outer bend facing the corner of the square. Both ends of the pipe should just touch the square's sides and run parallel to them.

, You should see or feel a small flat spot or distortion at the place where the bend starts and where it ends.

, Draw the line completely around the pipe.

, Note the place on each side of the square where the pipe's markings touch. These should be the same distance from the inside corner of the square. Add these lengths together.


If the markings on each end of the pipe bend touch the square at 6 inches (15 cm) from the inside corner of the square, the total length of the bent section of the pipe is 12 inches (30 cm).

, Place the bent tube back in your bender with the die used to bend it and note where on the die the mark on the pipe lines up. Mark this place with a dot of paint or by notching the metal with a file.


If you have more than one die (for different diameters of pipe), make a test bend for each die, as each diameter will require a different amount of metal to make a 90-degree bend.
Once you know how much pipe is needed to form the bend, you can calculate how long a piece of pipe you need by adding this figure (called the bend deduction) to the vertical and horizontal lengths of the pipe.

Clean glasses by hand.,
Air dry the glasses.,
Using a dishwasher.",How to Clean Drinking Glasses1," Fill your kitchen sink approximately one third to halfway full with warm water and add a few drops of dish washing liquid. Using a clean sponge, gently wash your classes inside and out. Rinse thoroughly.Avoid using more than a few drops of dish soap, as excess soap can lead to streaks and residue.;
, Place clean glasses on a dish mat or clean towel to dry. Position glasses downwards, with the rim on the bottom. Avoid drying your glasses with a cloth, as this can leave residue. , Using a dishwasher is a less effective way to get glasses clean and cloud-free than hand washing. If you prefer using a dishwasher anyway, there are ways to improve the results. For more fragile glasses (e.g. wine glasses), choose a delicate cycle. Leave as much room as possible between glasses to prevent clinking or scraping.To prevent residue that sometimes remains on glasses after being run through the dishwasher, add one quarter cup of white vinegar to the machine’s rinse cup."
"
Measure out the space your bent pipe will occupy.,
Divide the rectangle with a centerline.,
Measure in from the top corners of the rectangle to where the horizontal portion of the bent pipe begins.,
Measure from the bottom corners to where the lower bend begins.,
Connect the markings where the bends will be made, using a straightedge or ruler.,
Lay your 90-degree bend pipe inside the top line of your frame.,
Slide the pipe until it touches the diagonal you drew.

,
Mark the place where the bend mark intersects the frame line.

,
Rotate the pipe so the other bend mark intersects the diagonal.,
Repeat the last 4 steps for the other upper corner.

,
Calculate the total length of pipe needed.,
Cut the pipe.,
Find and mark the center of the pipe.,
Lay the pipe against the top line of your layout frame, aligning the pipe's center with the center line.,
Make each of the upper bends with your bending tool.,
Make each of the lower bends with your bending tool.,
Cut off any excess from the ends of the bent pipe.

",How to Bend Pipe3," If you're making a roll bar for a dune buggy that will occupy a space 60 inches (150 cm) wide by 50 inches (125 cm) high, make a rectangle with these dimensions on a clean space of concrete floor with a piece of chalk.

, The centerline should bisect the longer (width) sides of the rectangle.

, If the top of the roll bar should run only 40 inches (100 cm), subtract this length from the width for the bottom, then measure half the distance in from each of the upper corners. This works out to a difference of 20 inches (50 cm), half of which is 10 inches (25 cm), which is the distance to measure in. Mark this distance in from each of the top corners.

, If the distance from the bottom of the roll bar to the first bend is to be 40 inches (100 cm), measure and mark this distance up from each side of the bottom corners.

, You can measure the connecting lines with a ruler.


In this example, the diagonal line connecting the marks on the horizontal and vertical lines is about 14 inches (70 cm) long.

, Lay it so that the horizontal straight end touches the inside of the upper horizontal line.

,,, Mark this place on the diagonal.

,, Add together the measurements from the bottom corners to the first marks, the lengths of pipe between the lower bend, and the length between the upper bend.


In the above example, the vertical portions of the roll bar will each be 40 inches (100 cm) long, the diagonal portions will each be 14 inches (70 cm) long, and the horizontal portion will be 40 inches long. The total minimum length of pipe will be 40 + 14 + 40 + 14 + 40 inches (100 + 70 + 100 + 70 + 100 cm), or 144 inches (440 cm) long.

, Although the minimum length of pipe needed is 144 inches, it's a good idea to allow for error, add at least 4 inches (10 cm), making the total length 148 inches (450 cm).

, You'll work from this point outward.

, Mark on the pipe where the upper bends are to start and finish using the marks on the frame.


You may also want to mark the direction of your bends by putting arrows on the pipe pointing outward.

, Be sure the pipe's seam is to the inside when you bend; this prevents twisting or kinking during the bending process.


To ensure your bender is set to the correct angle, you can prepare a reference tool of 2 flat pieces of metal whose ends are attached to a pivot. Bend this tool to the angle indicated on your frame, and then match the bending angle of your bending tool to this angle.
After making each bend, lay the pipe against your frame to check that the angle of the bend is correct.

, Follow the same procedures as outlined in the previous step.

Make a vinegar solution.,
Wipe down the glasses.,
Rinse the glasses.,
Soak glasses.",How to Clean Drinking Glasses2," If your glasses are cloudy or have white streaks, clean them with vinegar. Fill a medium-sized bowl with white vinegar and warm water. Use two tablespoons of vinegar for every cup of water., Dip a clean cloth into the vinegar solution. Gently wipe down the glasses with the cloth, both inside and out. Re-moisten the cloth as needed to ensure that your glasses get clean., While the smell of vinegar is strong, it will eventually dissipate after drying. To speed up the process, rinse the glasses in cold water to wash away the vinegar solution. Rinsing the glasses, or washing them as you normally would with dish soap, will ensure that the vinegar smell disappears faster., If you have numerous glasses to clean, or if the cloudy deposits on your glasses are difficult to remove, soak them in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Fill a basin with the vinegar and water, place your glasses in the basin, and let them sit for twenty minutes. After soaking, rinse the glasses with cold water and let them air dry."
"
Make a bleach soak.,
Soak your glasses.,
Scrub glasses with baking soda.,
Use toothpaste.",How to Clean Drinking Glasses3," If your drinking glasses have dark stains (e.g. coffee, lipstick), soak them in a bleach solution. Add one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to a gallon of warm water. Use rubber gloves and protect your clothing from contact with the bleach while cleaning., Gently place your drinking glasses in the bleach solution. Allow them to soak for approximately thirty minutes. Remove and rinse the glasses in cold water., If any stains remove after soaking, sprinkle the glasses with baking soda. Wet a clean sponge and gently scrub the glasses. Rinse them thoroughly and let them air dry., As an alternative method of removing dark stains, use basic white toothpaste (i.e. toothpaste that dos not contain gels, breath freshening ingredients, or other additives). Use a clean, soft-bristle toothbrush to gently spread the toothpaste all over the inside and outside of the glasses. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and air dry."

Look for any signs of water damage.,
Address any potential electrical issues.,
Ensure bathrooms are properly ventilated.,
Replace exterior wood that has begun to rot.,
Make sure the home’s plumbing is up to par.,
Close any potentially unsealed parts of the home’s exterior.,
Check for mold.,
Remediate any radon presence in the home.,
Check on your basement and crawl spaces.,
Fill out a disclosure form regarding any unaddressed issues.,
Get a seller’s inspection.",How to Prepare for a Home Inspection1," Signs of water damage is a concern to a home inspector — not to mention your potential buyer. One that is of great concern is ceiling stains. This is because ceiling stains usually indicate that water has gotten somewhere it shouldn’t have. Even if the stain came from something insignificant, home inspectors will be concerned about a more serious issue.Keep a home inspector from suspecting faulty plumbing or a poor exterior seal by repairing water-damaged portions of the ceiling, ensuring that there is not a recurring cause of water damage.;
, Often, electrical issues arise when someone who occupied the house did their own electrical maintenance, or because of changes in the electrical code after work was done. Essentially, anything that has not been done according to code will lead to poor inspection results. Make sure all outlets and your panel boxes are up to code. Consider hiring an electrical contractor to look at anything you’re uncertain about.Make sure that all outlets in bathrooms and near the kitchen sink— or anywhere near a water source — are Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets. These are designed to prevent accidents from happening if appliances being used are exposed to water.
Make sure breakers in the electrical panel only have one wire on each lug. Double-tapped breakers are safety hazards.
Check to make sure that all outlets in the home are grounded.

, Especially if the home you’re hoping to sell is older and there are any bathrooms without windows, there’s a good chance its ventilation will not meet current construction standards.Specifically, if you have an interior bathroom, insure that any bathroom exhaust fans vent to the exterior of the home.

, Even if the rotting is minimal and seemingly inconsequential, replace it. Rotting indicates a lack of maintenance, especially regular exterior painting. Check exterior trim, window casings, and areas around decks.While checking exterior wood, touch up any spots where the paint has begun to deteriorate.

, You should also know that many homes have at least one or two minor plumbing issues that should be addressed before an inspection. In particular, replace or adjust leaky faucets, loose toilets, and slow drains.Be aware that a home inspector will also inspect the valves of boilers and water heaters. If these are found to be faulty, they can likely be easily replaced by a plumber.

, Windows and chimneys often have poor seals or cracks. One common sign of a poor window seal is fogging of the glass. Chimneys, on the other hand, are especially exposed to the weather, and commonly develop cracks or loose mortar over time. If one is not present, install a metal cap to help protect the chimney.If cracks exist near the top of the chimney, they can easily be repaired by a mason — the sooner the better; however, if a large crack is present near the base of the chimney, consult a professional about whether the chimney poses a potential structural risk.
Check the roof venting to ensure that it is metal and not plastic. Plastic venting has a short life span and it can cause a lot of damage when it cracks.
Inspect the flashing around the chimney to ensure that it had been correctly installed. If not, the paint may be peeling.

, Even if you think there’s no chance you have mold in the home, double check. Mold in the attic, which can grow when moisture is trapped, is one of the most common things discovered by a home inspector, and homeowners are often unaware that it is there.Have a professional test for mold throughout the home.
Cloudy black patches on walls, ceilings, and shower curtains are signs that there is mold present; a professional can help you determine the extent of the problem.

, Using a test kit purchased at a home improvement store or online, test for the presence of radon in your home. Along with mold, radon is another significant issue that homeowners are often unaware of preceding an inspection. Radon is a naturally occurring gas beneath the surface of the Earth that sometimes enters homes through cracks in the home’s foundation.Radon is a commonly known carcinogen, and home inspectors may test for it if testing is required by law where you live or if you have paid extra for it.
Radon in the air can be remediated relatively easily, and should be addressed as quickly as possible. Radon in your home’s water supply is a much more significant issue.
The benchmark frequently used to determine the level that requires remediation in water is any presence of Radon above 4.0 pCi/L (picocuries per liter).
You can also install a radon detector.

, Ensure basement walls are free of any substantial cracks, and reseal any minor cracks that are present. Make sure below-ground crawl spaces have vapor barriers or have them installed. Further, if your basement or crawl space has windows below ground level, make sure each has a clean, intact window well and cover.Though easy to overlook, there are a few things that should never be stored in basements or crawl spaces — including paints, solvents, and other flammable liquids. Remove them if they are present in these areas.

, Address any issues with your home to the greatest extent possible. If you do not have the funds or time to fix substantial issues, fill out a seller disclosure form in detail, listing all of the defects you are aware of.Disclosure forms are required in many states, and are recommended even when not required.
Your negotiations may be detrimentally affected by defects in the home that are identified by a home inspection ordered by a potential buyer. Be upfront about any known defects.

, Consider ordering a home inspection of your own before you put your house on the market. While prospective buyers will usually be the ones hiring a home inspector for an unbiased assessment of the home, it may be worth hiring one of your own to make sure you are aware of any issues that need to be addressed.


Further, have a home inspection already completed so you can show favorable assessments to prospective buyers or share information about any issues you’ve already addressed.
Attending the inspection may help your inspector point out specific issues that need to be addressed.

Wipe any spills with paper towels.,
Use a kitchen pad or brush with hot water.,
Attend to the toughest spills with a vinegar solution.",How to Clean an Epoxy Floor1," If you notice any fluid leaks or marks, wipe them up with a paper towel. This should suffice for all but the greasiest stains. The sooner you clean a spill, the easier it will be to remove.Alternatively, you can wipe these spills away with a soft cloth.;
, These brushes are designed to clean greasy, tenacious stains, with some elbow grease required. Hot water should be sufficient to clean up many of the spills you’ll find on an epoxy floor., Mix one cup (237ml) of vinegar with two gallons of hot water. Use a kitchen sponge to rub the solution into more tenacious stains.You can keep this solution stored to handle any future spills.

Keep boxes and other possessions out of the way.,
Have utilities turned on and operable.,
Double check that an inspector will be able to enter the home.,
Get rid of snow and ice.,
Check the lights.,
Do not attempt to hide any issues with the home.",How to Prepare for a Home Inspection2," Plan to not be present for a potential buyer’s inspection, but leave a note outlining where the inspector can find the things they need to look at. In particular, oddly located water heaters or furnace systems may be hard to find, and the inspector will appreciate your pointing them out. Identify hidden entries to beneath homes with pier and beam foundations.Provide proof that the septic system is in working order. The inspector will not conduct an inspection of your septic tank. It is up to you to provide proof of a recent professional inspection that states the condition of the septic tank.
Don’t leave a loose pet at home, as you do not want the inspector to be startled or otherwise have to deal with an animal.

, Keep and provide a file of any documentation regarding maintenance and repairs of the home. These should include, at the very least, evidence of finance inspections, receipts for any repairs, and any insurance claims you’ve made on the home.Be able to prove, with paperwork, that you’ve addressed any issues that have previously arisen in regards to the home.
Depending on the area you live in, any remodeling would have required permits that also need to be included.

, Many home inspectors will arrive at a home quite early. Some prefer to do a quick run-through before a Realtor or potential buyer arrives if they are also attending the inspection. , Remove any clutter from areas that may need to be inspected. The cabinets beneath any sinks will need to be clear, and access to built-in fixtures such as water heaters must be entirely accessible. It’s also best to get basements or attics as clear as possible, as underground walls and attics will need to be thoroughly inspected.Even in storage rooms — in particular attic storage areas — you will need to pull boxes into the center of the space so that structural components such as trusses and exterior wall conditions can be readily assessed.

, A home inspector will not personally ignite a pilot light, flip electrical breakers, or turn a home’s water on. Make sure everything is turned on and in working order before the inspector arrives so this does not impede the inspection.If the home has been empty for some time, run faucets and other water sources to make sure water is flowing and does not contain unsightly sediment from sitting in pipes for a while.

, It seems obvious, but this is an important step, as there are several things that may obstruct an inspector. Make sure any gates are unlocked, and keys are left in lock boxes. Let the inspector know beforehand about preferred methods of entry to the home.Check to see that any sheds or garages are also accessible.

, If it’s winter, make sure snow or ice will not obstruct entrance to the home nor cover anything that will need to be inspected. In addition to making sure the driveway is safely accessible, remove snow from any windows and clear any built up snow from the foundation of the building. Finally, remove any icicles that have formed on the home or other structures on the property., Though you don’t necessarily want to simply leave all the lights on in your home, making sure lights are easily found and have working bulbs is important. Lights with broken or absent bulbs will force the inspector to determine whether the fixture itself is inoperable, a time-consuming and potentially frustrating task.Consider leaving lights on in small spaces — such as crawl spaces, attics, and furnace rooms — that are hard to see into or don’t have light sources with easily accessible switches.

, Avoid shoddy fixes or minimal adjustments — they may be noticed by a home inspector and will indicate that you have not put meaningful care into the home. Additionally, you should notify potential buyers of recent things you’ve done to the home, including repairs, replacements, or plans to do so in preparation for a sale."

Clear the area of obstructions.,
Sweep the floor with a dust mop.,
Mix a solution of ammonia cleaner and hot water.,
Spray the solution onto your floor and mop.,
Hose down the floor.",How to Clean an Epoxy Floor2," Before trying to clean the entirety of the floor, you should remove any obstructions. Parked vehicles should be pulled out and kept away until you’ve finished. Any tools, furniture or other objects should be cleared as well.

, The best size mop for this purpose is between 24 and 36 inches (61cm and 91cm) long. All home improvement stores should carry these mops. Sweep from one end of the floor to the other; this should get rid of anything not stuck to the floor, such as dirt, dust and leaves., Ammonia will allow you to clean the floors of any tenacious marks or spills. Mix four ounces (118ml) of ammonia to a gallon of hot water. Pour the solution into a spray bottle once properly mixed., Make sure to cover the entirety of the floor evenly. Don’t look to soak the floor, simply cover it with a fine mist of the solution. Once the floor is covered, use a hard foam mop to thoroughly scrub the floor. You should see most marks come off as you scrub.


Avoid using string mops for this step. They don’t clean as effectively as hard foam mops, don’t lend themselves to scrubbing and may leave streaks on your floor.Particularly difficult spots can be scrubbed with a brush.

, The treatment of epoxy floors makes them resistant to water. This allows for simple removal of any leftover cleaning solution. If you have a garden hose, simply spray water over the whole floor, washing the cleaning solution away.


If you don’t have a garden hose, you can use a bucket of water, lightly splashing your floors.
You can use a squeegee to rid your floor of water, sending it away from your floor.
If the epoxy floor is in an area that doesn’t lead to an exit, you can use a hard foam mop to soak up the water and wring it in a bucket."
"
Keep a walk-off mat near the entrance.,
Put cardboard under the tires of parked vehicles.,
Place a mouse pad under a motorcycle’s kickstand.",How to Clean an Epoxy Floor3," Depending on where you live, the changing of the seasons can bring about its own host of messes. Keeping a walk-off, or welcome mat, near the door will allow for the scrubbing off of boots and shoes before stepping on the floor. This will keep snow, water and mud off of the floor, meaning cleaning isn’t needed as often., Vehicles that are kept parked for long periods of time, such as over the winter, can leave tire marks on your epoxy floors. Before parking vehicles for too much time, place cardboard of enough length to completely cover the tire. That way you won’t have an unfortunate surprise come spring., If you keep a motorcycle on your epoxy floors, know that the kickstand could scratch and scuff it. Keep a mousepad in your garage and your motorcycle parked next to it. The kickstand should never come into contact with the floor; the spongy mousepad will keep it protected."

Clean all appliances.,
Test all of the smoke detectors in the home.,
Touch up exterior caulk jobs.,
Attend to the home's air system.,
Keep the exterior of the home free of debris.",How to Prepare for a Home Inspection3," To some degree, this is common sense — but it’s worth double checking. Make sure washing machines and dryers are clean and empty. Further, clean the home’s oven and stove top. Both of these things will need to be tested, and the presentation of any dirtiness in the home reflects poorly on an inspector's assumptions on the home’s upkeep.There are plenty of low-cost, quick tidy-up tasks that can be done to improve an inspector’s perspective of a home. Cleaning everything is a great place to start.

, This is surprisingly easy to forget, and though easily remedied, worth being addressed prior to an inspection. Replace batteries and get new or additional detectors wherever necessary.In newer homes, there needs to be a working smoke detector in almost every room, aside from bathrooms and closets, but including hallways.


Keep in mind that older homes (those built before the year 2000) do not have to have a smoke detector in every room, just one on each floor.
All properties also have to have a working carbon monoxide detector on every floor. It is best to put the carbon monoxide detector close to the floor and near the bedrooms.

, Look over everywhere there is caulk on the exterior of the building. This will be caulk around almost anything, not just the windows. Check around doors, connections to exterior appliances, trim, and portions of the home that extend out of a previous level and have a seam along the roof.Similarly, touch up the mortar on the foundation or anywhere on a brick home.

, In particular, replace the air filters if the home has an HVAC system. Further, clean the air returns, vents, and other accessible parts of the system. Have any service tags or notes clearly visible., Keep mulch or other yard material at least six inches from the start of a home’s siding. Trim any plants that are touching any part of the building so that nothing is touching the home’s foundation, roof, siding, or chimney. Finally, clear the roof itself and the gutters of any collected debris. If you keep stacks of firewood, make sure no firewood is stacked against the exterior of the home.
Do not place garbage cans next to the house because they can attract pests and cause cracks in the siding.
Make sure any downspouts or drains are pointed and slope away from the home. Also, check the areas where outside drains connect to the interior of the house. They may be hidden and leak without being noticed.

Use less detergent.,
Give your towels ""room to breathe"" in the washer.,
Use a hot wash (and a cold rinse).,
Reduce the amount of tumble-drying you do.,
Try adding towels to the washer after the detergent has dissolved.,
Fold and hang towels for maximum fluffiness.",How to Get Fluffy Towels1," There are multiple reasons why a fluffy towel can become stiff. However, one of the most commonly-cited reasons is the use of excessive detergent. Over time, the chemicals in detergents can build up in the fibers of the towel, making them stiffer and less absorbent. To avoid this, use a little less detergent than you're directed to use for each load. This makes it slightly easier for your machine to wash the soapy residue away with each rinse cycle.Don't be afraid to cut back on your detergent use. Odds are, you won't be left with dirty clothes — studies have shown that most Americans use more detergent than is necessary to get their clothes clean.An added benefit of reducing your detergent use is that you will also save money!;
, If you're looking for fluffy towels, resist the temptation to stuff all of your laundry into a single load. To get the best results, you'll want to leave plenty of space in the washer for them so they can be properly rinsed and agitated. This means:


Using medium-small, manageable loads. Your machine should be about 1/2 full of loosely packed clothes. This goes for your dryer as well as your washer.Washing your towels on their own (without other clothes in the load). In addition to crowding the washer, clothes with things like zippers and buttons can wear the fabric of the towels.

, If your washing machine gives you the option to set different wash and rinse temperatures, use a hot wash followed by a cold rinse cycle. Many online sources recommend this. Hot water loosens the fibers of the towel and helps remove dirt, grime, and soap residue that can cause stiffness. Cold rinse water makes the fibers of the towel contract, making it less likely that they will ""clump"" together.


Check the care label on colored towels before washing. Most whites will be safe for hot wash cycles, but hot water can make colored fabrics fade., Tumble dryers can be a double-edged sword. While they make towels fluffier in the short term, repeated tumble-drying can wear down towel fabric, leading to towels that are less fluffy in the long-term. Luckily, there are several ways to avoid this problem:Use gentler settings in your dryer — lower heats and slower speeds
Alternate between line-drying and tumble-drying.
Line-dry towels, then ""freshen them up"" with a short cycle in the tumble dryer.

, Some online sources stress the importance of knowing when to wash your towels — not just how to wash them. If you have a top-loading laundry machine, try adding a small amount of detergent, letting the chamber fill with water, and then adding your towels.Avoiding direct contact between the detergent and the towels will help reduce the amount of soapy buildup and preserve the towels' fluffiness.

, Don't forget that the process of doing laundry doesn't end when the towels come out of the dryer. The way you fold and store your towels can also have some effect on their texture. Try using the tricks below to help keep your towels fluffy.


Use loose folds to prevent stiff creases in the towel's fabric. Alternatively, loosely roll your towels. One good folding method is as follows:



Hold your towel lengthwise (so that the short edge is pointing to the floor). Fold the towel in half to make a long, skinny strip.
Loosely fold the towel into thirds. Fold one edge toward the center, then fold the other edge over the top and line up the edges so they form a tidy bundle.
Fold the bundle in half once more and store the towel.




Store folded towels side-by-side (like books) rather than in stacks. This helps prevent the bottom towels from being flattened by the ones above.
If you're hanging towels from a rack, don't hang multiple towels on top of each other — this, too, can make the bottom towel stiffer.

Brush the surface of the sofa.,
Vacuum the sofa with the upholstery attachment.,
Continue to brush and vacuum your sofa on a weekly basis.",How to Clean a Chenille Sofa1," Use a soft bristled upholstery brush or baby's hairbrush and go over the entire sofa in small circular motions to loosen up any impacted dirt. Go over especially soiled areas in a back and forth motion until the area is clean.The soft bristles on your brush should not damage the fabric.;
, Set the vacuum to the lowest setting and attach the upholstery brush to it. Use the attachment to lightly go over the surface of your couch and suck up the dirt that you loosened with brushing., Vacuuming regularly prevents dirt from becoming embedded into your sofa's fibers. You can brush your sofa more often, or whenever you notice that there's been a buildup of dirt and dust.


The more often that you vacuum and brush your sofa, the less often you'll have to get it professionally cleaned.

Try using balls in your dryer.,
Try adding vinegar to the wash cycle.,
Baking soda.,
Try borax or water-softening tablets.,
Physically remove hard water from towels before drying.,
Reduce your reliance on fabric softeners and dryer sheets.",How to Get Fluffy Towels2," If you have towels that are already somewhat stiff, one way to soften them up is to throw a dryer-safe ball or two in the dryer with them. The repetitive action of the ball circulating with the towels will gradually ""work out"" any stiff spots, leaving you with softer towels. Commercial dryer balls can be found online or at many major department stores for reasonable prices — usually no more than about $5 per ball.


If you want to save money, try throwing a few tennis balls in the dryer with your towels instead. These generally work just as well.

, Ordinary household white vinegar can help you get softer towels. If you want to do this, add about 1/2 cup during the first rinse cycle (using more for large loads and less for small loads). This helps pull the soapy chemical buildup and hard water deposits out of the towel's fibers. You should notice softer towels after just a few cycles.


Only use white vinegar for this task. Other vinegars, like apple cider and especially balsamic vinegar, can stain your laundry.

, Another good additive for getting your towels soft and fluffy is baking soda. Like vinegar, it will pull the grime and chemical buildup from the towel's fibers. As an added benefit, baking soda will also help remove odor from older towels.Note, however, that baking soda can fade bright colors.


Many online sources recommend against using baking soda and vinegar at the same time. These chemicals will react with and neutralize each other (just like in the famous ""papier-mâché volcano"" science fair project).

, ""Hard water"" is water that contains a high amount of dissolved minerals.When hard water is used to wash laundry, these minerals can build up and lead to stiffer fibers in the fabric of your towel. However, some ""water-softening"" products can reverse this effect. For instance, borax (sodium borate) is a safe, affordable laundry additive that can help reduce the mineral content in hard water and leave you with softer towels.Borax is available online and in the ""laundry"" section of most major department stores for cheap — rarely more than $5 for a small box.

, Don't have any borax handy? Try removing the hard water from your towels yourself. Gently wring the water from your towels over a sink or go outside and snap the towels to fling off excess water. The less hard water in your towels when they go into the dryer, the less mineral buildup you'll experience.

, While fabric softening products may seem like a no-brainer, many sources actually recommend not using them for towels. While they can give soft, fluffy results in the short term, over time, the chemicals in these products can build up in the dense, interwoven fabrics of most towels (just like many detergents). Over time, these will make the towels stiffer and less-fluffy. This problem is worsened by using too-large loads and using too much product.

Blot spills immediately with a cotton towel.,
Brush the fabric with a hairbrush.,
Put fabric cleaner on the stain.,
Dab the stain softly with a clean rag.",How to Clean a Chenille Sofa2," Blotting stains as soon as they occur, will prevent the stain from sinking deeper into the fabric of your sofa. Do not rub the stain. Rubbing the stain will cause the stain to spread.If you let the stain dry, it will be much harder to remove.

, Use a soft brush to comb towards the nap of the fabric. This should help lift up any of the material that is on the outer surface of the couch., Use a small amount of solvent-based fabric cleaner. Typically these come as a foam or a spray and don't contain water, which can cause chenille to shrink. Do not saturate your chenille sofa, you just want to cover the area that has the stain.You can purchase solvent based upholstery cleaners at major department stores or online.
Check the label to see if the cleaner is solvent based.
Look for upholstery cleaner that is made specifically for chenille fabrics.

, Put a dab of fabric cleaner on the stain. Do not rub. Continue to dab the stain with a clean rag until it's dry and you've removed all the fabric cleaner from the sofa. Repeat the steps until the stain is removed from your couch.

"
"
Turn and rotate your cushions.,
Never machine wash your chenille upholstery.,
Keep dyes and corrosives away from your sofa.,
Read the tag on your couch's cushions.,
See a professional for deep cleaning.",How to Clean a Chenille Sofa3," Turning and rotating your cushions will prevent uneven wear and potential sun damage from occurring. Do this one time a week to extend the longevity of your sofa., If you have removable chenille upholstery, you should never machine wash it. Water can cause shrinkage to chenille, which can prevent you from fitting the upholstery over the pillows once you're done cleaning it., The dye in newspapers, inks, nail polish, or paint could permanently and irreparably stain the surface of your sofa. Keep these products away from the sofa when you are using them., If there are tags on your chenille furniture, it will give you a better idea of how to clean them. Since chenille is prone to shrinkage, the tag will most likely read S, which means that you should only use a dry solvent, or an X, which means that it should only be professionally cleaned or vacuumed.Do not try to spot clean your sofa yourself if there is an X tag on it.

, Because chenille fabric is so sensitive to different products and cleaners, it's important that you never try to deep clean the couch yourself. While you can perform spot cleaning and regular maintenance, any deep cleaning issues should be handled by a professional.

Get a sturdy piece of string or rope.,

Remove decor.,
Start with a mild mixture.,
Test-clean a select spot on your wall.,
Add more vinegar if necessary.,
Add baking soda if needed.,
Fill a second bucket with clean water.,
Soak and wring your cleaning sponge.,
Work from the top down.,
Wipe in soft circles.,
Work on one small section at a time.,
Rinse and dry each section immediately.",How to Clean Walls with Vinegar," Lay a dropcloth or towels along the baseboard where you intend to start. Ideally, your sponges shouldn’t be dripping wet when you use them, so feel free to skip that part if you’re confident in your ability to catch the occasional drip that may run down the wall. However:Do keep some towels around just in case your bucket suffers a major spill. Play it extra safe and lay one out to set your bucket on while you work.;
, Depending on how strong your solution is, you may find the smell of vinegar a little overwhelming. If so, open windows and/or set up some fans to improve air circulation. Vinegar fumes aren’t dangerous, but they may tempt you to rush through the job. Avoid doing so, since a rushed job may lead to drips and other water marks that will remain visible after the walls have dried., Unplug power cords from outlets. If you intend on cleaning outlet covers and/or where they cover the wall, switch off the fuses for those outlets before doing so. Do the same for light switches, telephone cords, and any other fixtures with an electric current., If you're cleaning the entire wall as opposed to spot-cleaning, take down anything that's mounted to them. Ensure a thorough cleaning without any obstructions that might be hiding dirt. This can include any:


Photos, posters, or other artwork.
Shelves, coat hooks, or other functional items.
Electronics, like wall-mounted TVs or speakers.

, Expect a relatively small amount of vinegar mixed with warm water to be sufficient for the job a lot of the time. Simply combine 2 to 3 tablespoons of white distilled vinegar with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a bucket or similar container. However:Keep in mind that you’ll be carrying that bucket around the room with you. Depending on the size of your bucket, adjust the amounts as needed to keep it only halfway filled to avoid spills.

, Pick an area that is blocked from view by furniture or otherwise hidden. Wet a sponge in your mixture and squeeze it until the excess water has been wrung out. Wipe the area in a circle, using minimal pressure. Repeat with a second sponge and clean water to rinse. Then pat dry with a soft cloth or towel.Use soft sponges (as opposed to a more abrasive kind meant for scrubbing burnt food), especially if your walls are painted. Using tougher sponges could ruin your paint’s surface.

, Compare the test-spot with the rest of the wall. If your mixture did the trick, use it as is. If the test-spot still seems dirty, increase the ratio of vinegar to water and repeat. Start by adding ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar to your gallon of water. If that still seems weak, keep adding ½ cup of vinegar at a time.Extremely dirty walls may require a ratio of 2 parts vinegar to 3 parts water., If the dirt on your walls has crusted over and/or built up, you may need something a bit more abrasive than just vinegar and water. Start by adding a ¼ cup (55 g) of baking soda to your solution and test-clean again.If necessary, keep doing so up to 2 to 3 cups (442 to 662 g). However, bear in mind:If your walls are painted, abrasive agents like baking soda may damage the paint, especially if it’s latex-based. If your solution starts ruining your paint job, you may need to apply a fresh coat rather than clean.

, Again, only fill it halfway so the water doesn’t slosh over the sides as you carry it. Use this for rinsing. Depending on how strong your solution is, and/or how much surface you have to wash, refresh the bucket with clean water periodically, as needed.Additionally, you should use a second sponge for rinsing. As with the rinsing water, replace as needed if it becomes too foul as you move along.

, Again, only use a soft sponge for this to avoid causing permanent streak marks. Soak it in your solution. Then squeeze it dry over your bucket until no more water drips from it., First, break your wall up into columns in your head, each about a foot or two (30 to 60 cm) wide. Start cleaning each column where the wall meets the ceiling, and go down from there before proceeding to the next one over. This way you're more likely to catch any accidental drips of water that may run downward., Remember: if your walls are painted, vigorous scrubbing can damage the coat. Use as little pressure as needed. Wipe in a circle, reversing directions occasionally, to further reduce the risk of damage., Ideally, you will be using as little liquid as possible to avoid water stains and marks. Still, if left to air-dry, the liquid you did use may cause permanent eyesores, so don’t try to clean the whole column at once. Instead, only wash a couple square feet (60 cm) at a time.If you’re working on a ladder, you may want to work on even smaller sections since you may be going up and down in between the washing, rinsing, and drying.

, As soon as you’re done washing with your solution, switch sponges. Repeat the same process with fresh water. Pat the area dry with a soft cloth or towel, replenishing them as needed."

Know which items are safe to dry clean at home.,
Examine how heavily soiled the items in question are.,
Use a stain remover to remove stains.,
Place your items of clothing inside the dry cleaning bag.,
Completely unfold the dry cleaning sheet and place it inside the dry cleaning bag.,
Put the dry cleaning bag inside the dryer.,
Remove the clothes from the dry cleaning bag.,
Examine your clothing for stains.,
Iron your clothing.,
Use a clothing steamer.,
Store your dry-cleaned items separately.",How to Dry Clean," Start by checking the tag on the clothing item in question. Clothes made from wool, rayon and silk are often marked ""dry clean only,"" and you should have no trouble cleaning them yourself.


Clothes that are technically machine washable, but that you would prefer to treat gently, are good candidates for home dry cleaning. Try dry cleaning delicate linens and cottons, and clothing with intricate embroidery or other decorations. Dry cleaning instead of washing will make delicate items last longer and look new longer.
Clothes made from leather, suede and fur should not be dry cleaned at home. These items require special techniques to clean and are best left to professional cleaners.;
, Home dry cleaning works best on items that are only lightly soiled. A stain or two is ok, but if the item is covered in mud or another substance, it's probably better to have it professionally cleaned.

, Dry cleaning kits come with small bottles or pens filled with stain remover. Treat oil or water based stains with the stain remover to prepare your clothing for dry cleaning. Instructions that come with the dry cleaning kit indicate to use only the stain remover provider. They also provide details on avoiding the spot spreading and how to avoid a visible ring after treatment.


Test the stain remover on a discreet spot on the fabric you're cleaning before using it to remove prominent stains. Make sure it doesn't cause damage or discoloration before proceeding.
Since you're presumably working with delicate fabric, don't scrub the fabric too much, or you could damage it.
Use the stain remover only on the stain. If you soak the entire garment in stain remover, you could damage its shape and fibers.
Don't use stain remover on suede, leather, or fur. These materials cannot be dry cleaned at home anyway, so aren't part of these instructions.

, Every kit comes with a bag that fits three or four pieces of clothing. Make sure they are similar colors, to prevent the chance of bleeding dye ruining an article of clothing. When you load the bag, also pay attention to the weight and bulk of the items. The bag should not be more than halfway full. The key is that the items need to have room to rotate inside the bag. If you are cleaning a throw, for example, you may not be able to add three additional items.


Don't overcrowd the bag. If you're dry cleaning dresses, place only two dresses inside a large bag. You should be able to fit up to four tops inside a large dry cleaning bag. Again, only fill the bag halfway full to allow adequate rotation of the garments inside the bag.

, Zip the bag closed.


The dry cleaning sheet contains a small amount of water, an emulsifier to keep it dispersed, and a perfume to freshen the smell of your clothes.
As the dryer heats the sheet, it will create steam that infuses your clothes with fragrance and straightens out wrinkles.

, Make sure the lint filter is clean. Set the dryer on medium heat for 30 minutes. Use the timed setting, not the automatic setting. If your dryer does not have a medium setting, err on the side of caution and use low heat. If you are using a laundromat dryer, make sure the heat setting is adjustable and use low heat. As soon as the timer goes off, retrieve the clothes from the dryer.


The longer you allow the clothes to sit in the dryer, the more wrinkled they will be when you remove them from the bag.

, Hang them on hangers and allow the wrinkles to fall out. If the clothes look satisfactory to you, store them in your closet or wear them immediately.

, You may find that the stain remover didn't quite do the job before you dry-cleaned your clothes. If you still see traces of a stain, use the remover again.

, The articles of clothing won't look stiff and pressed like they do when they come back from professional dry cleaners. Professionals use chemicals to give them that starched look, but at home, running an iron over the clothes is sufficient.


Make sure the iron is set to the appropriate heat level for the article you are ironing.
Don't spray the item with water, and use steam sparingly.

, Clothing steamers can be costly, but if you have a lot of delicate items it may be worth investing in one. They use steam rather than the direct heat of an iron to remove wrinkles. The finished look is crease-free and professional.

, Keep them on hangers in a special place in your closet, making sure there is room for air to circulate around them. This way the clothes will stay fresh longer, and you won't have to dry clean them as often.

Thankfully, these chores are quick enough to squeeze in even if you work a job outside of the home or have a houseful of kids to attend to.


To reduce your stress as much as possible, plan on accomplishing each of these daily chores during a certain time of the day. Organizing your time may help you relieve some of the anxiety you feel about getting everything done.
Daily tasks you'll need to make time for include making the bed, sorting the mail, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor.Other daily tasks should be performed as you go along. These include putting things away (to prevent clutter from developing), cleaning up as you cook, and wiping up fresh spills.;
, Some chores only need to be done once or twice a week. Instead of rushing around to get these chores done all at once, plan on doing a little each day and set aside certain days for certain tasks. You'll likely feel more relaxed about getting things done, which means you'll do a better, more thorough job.


Clean the bathrooms once a week. Make sure that you wash all bath linens and scrub all toilets, tubs, and sinks. Empty the trash, clean the mirrors, dust the lights, and wipe up the floor.The bedrooms in your home also need a thorough weekly cleaning. Put away anything that has been sitting out on a desk or side table. Clean all sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. Empty the trash, dust all the surfaces, and vacuum the floor.
You may need to vacuum your living room, kitchen, and dining room every day or two, but other chores, like dusting, washing rugs/mats, and wiping mirrors, can be done once a week.

, Moreover, different types of cleaners may work better on different areas of your home. If there is some part of your usual cleaning routine that leaves a lot to be desired, figure out why your current cleaner is not doing the job right and research which options might be better.


Compare chemical and organic products. Nowadays, many people prefer cleaning products made from natural ingredients instead of chemical cleaners. Natural cleaners have their own pros and cons, just as chemical cleaners have, but it doesn't hurt to include a few organic products among those you plan on testing out.
Ask your friends for suggestions or do some research online about your different options. Test a few different products out on a trial basis.
Pay close attention to which products work best with different materials—wood, glass, ceramic, plastic, and so on.

, The modern domestic goddess needs to know a bit more about the handy side of home care than earlier counterparts did. You don't need to know how to maintain all the systems and utilities in your home, but learning how to take care of a few basic projects is a wise move.


At minimum, your home tool kit should contain a hammer and a few different screwdrivers. These tools will allow you to do simple tasks like hanging pictures and making small repairs to things like toys, cabinets, and drawers.

, Clutter is the natural enemy of any domestic goddess. If you want to maintain a living space that any mortal would be envious of, you need to keep things orderly and in their place. Brush up on space-saving techniques and similar skills to keep your belongings in check.


This is especially important if you're dealing with limited space.
Get rid of any unnecessary junk first, then organize everything that has a purpose in a way that makes sense based on your needs.

, Laundry is one chore that you will never be able to avoid if you want to be a domestic goddess. Your current laundry skills might be adequate, but you should still continue to watch out for aspects of your laundry routine that could stand to use improvement.


Consider assigning different laundry tasks to different days, as well. For instance, you can clean bathroom towels on Tuesday, bed sheets and pillowcases on Wednesday, and any other miscellaneous towels or blankets on Thursday. Clothing will need to be cleaned throughout the week, though.
Read the labels before you wash something and follow the laundering instructions provided.If you aren't sure whether or not an item will bleed color in the washing machine, test it by soaking a small spot and blotting that spot with a white cloth.
Wash colors and whites separately. Also separate heavily soiled items and wash those on their own.
Pretreat stains and presoak heavily soiled garments in a sink or bucket of water for 30 minutes before washing them.
Use the recommended amount of detergent and select the best washer cycle for each individual load.
Base water temperature and dryer settings on color and fabric type. Materials that can shrink should be washed in warm or cold water and air dried, for instance. Cold water is best for bright colors, while hot water works well for whites.

, Once you've mastered the basics, keep an eye out for various tips and tricks that can take your home skills from “great” to “amazing.” Some tricks work better than others, though, so you should test them out before bragging to your friends about your newfound knowledge.


For instance, cover dirty stroller wheels and wagon wheels with plastic shower caps before bringing the item inside.Wrap pipe cleaners around the neck of condiment bottles to catch drips and prevent crusty build-up.
Stuff holes in the wall and cabinets with steel wool to keep mice and other pests out.

, If you currently have some cooking and baking knowledge, then you're off to a good start already. If not, start small by making simple meals and following easy recipes. You can gradually build up your kitchen skills as you get more comfortable, but trying too much all at once is a good way to fail and get discouraged.


Look for books specifically aimed at beginners or search for easy recipes online. Instructions that provide step-by-step pictures are often the easiest to follow along.

, Look for free and cheap cooking classes in your area. Focus on developing skills that you're specifically interested in developing, and skip any class that will teach you something you already know or will teach you something you have no desire to learn.


Local craft stores often offer classes on baking and food decorating.
Small markets may have classes on cooking essentials.
Check out cooking schools in your area. Even if you don't want to spend time and money on a cooking program, some of these schools offer one-time cooking courses at a discounted price.

, Not every domestic goddess needs to love cooking, but learning to enjoy it can motivate you into improving your skills. Try to find something about cooking or baking that you can feel passionate—or at least interested—about. Build up your cooking skills in general, but involve your point of interest as much as possible while doing so.


Your passion might be something simple, like baking cookies or mastering stovetop cooking.
On the other hand, you might find your attention grabbed by something a little more unique, like gluten-free baking or canning.

, You might have a full set of cooking and baking skills when all is said and done, but that doesn't mean you will be able to show them all off each and every day. Know when to make a simple meal and when to whip up something more impressive. Learning how to use your cooking to improve and please those you're cooking for is another skill you will need to master.


For example, if you're cooking for picky kids, focus on choosing kid-friendly meals instead of trying to impress them with an elaborate meal they won't even eat.
When you're cooking for guests, find out about any food allergies or special diets ahead of time and plan your menu accordingly.

, Once you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen, start using the skills and knowledge you have gained to experiment with your own recipes and tasty creations. Some experiments might be a success while others will likely be a failure. The important thing is simply to keep working at it until your successes vastly outnumber your failures.

, Sewing is the queen of lost skills, so if you don't know even the most basic stitches, you really aren't alone. At minimum, though, you should know how to sew hems, repair small rips and tears, and attach buttons.


Learn a variety of basic stitches, including the straight stitch, the back stitch, the zigzag stitch, and the basting stitch.
Invest in a sewing machine. As your sewing skills improve, consider buying a sewing machine of your own. You will probably be glad that you did. Fixing garments and creating projects from scratch will both be much easier if you learn to machine sew as well as hand sew.

, Sewing is not the only lost skill worth learning, of course. There is a wide range of other crafts and domestic abilities you can explore. You do not need to master all of them, but picking one or two you'd like to become great at can improve your standing as a domestic goddess.


Potential areas of interest could include gardening, crocheting, or knitting.
You could also check out community craft websites, like Pinterest, to get more ideas.

, You can learn a lot by teaching yourself, but sometimes, the best way to learn a new skill or to advance an old one is to take an actual class on it. Look for cheap classes in your area or sign up for a class online.

Finished.

",How to Be a Good Housekeeper," Start by walking around the main areas- the entryways, living room, dining room and kitchen - first and picking up all the trash. Take dirty dishes to the sink to be washed later. Make sure to look under the tables and under the edges of other furniture to make sure no trash is left.;
, An attractive basket is one way to organize these until you have time to file. But be sure to take a few minutes each day to deal with your 'hotspots'!

, You'll come back later to do the floor!

, Start with the counters. Clear everything off the counters and place it on the dining table or in their respective cabinets or drawers. If your hands are sensitive, find a pair of rubber gloves. Then clean off the dust and any debris that are on the counters with a damp sponge. If there are any stains from food products, use the Magic Erasers to help with this. If you use your counter as a cutting board (which is never recommended) the magic eraser will clean in the little cut marks on the counter to remove germs and food build up. Just look at the magic eraser when you're done, you'll see how filthy it is. (see warnings section for proper use of the magic erasers, and the ""Tips"" section for alternatives to it.) Make yourself a note, if you don't have a cutting board, to get an inexpensive one the next time you're at the store. Never cut directly on your counters! Waxing the counters makes them look new and shiny but is probably over-the-top for most people. (Mrs. Meyer's Countertop spray is easy to use and leaves them shiny and smelling nice.)

, (See: How to Clean an Oven and How to Clean the Stove Top)

, This can be an extra step and can be saved for another time. However, most people don't clean their refrigerators regularly. This can result in stuck on food bits that are hard to clean, crumbs in the back of the fridge and under the drawers, and if left unkempt for too long, will attract bugs. Clean old food out of the fridge, check expiry dates, clean off the shelves with the magic eraser, pull out the drawers and clean the bits out from under them. You will notice a big difference each time you open your fridge. (See:How to clean a refrigerator)

, Put most of it away in a convenient place until really needed, put the rest back on the shiny counters, and put a nice tablecloth on the table, with maybe even a decorative bowl of fruit or a plant if you have one.

, Do the fronts of the cabinets some other time but if they're looking grungy around the handles or knobs, at least give those a swipe now.

, We're not looking for perfection here!

, This is also good for disinfecting kitchen and bathroom counters. You don't need to buy the expensive premade stuff in the spray bottles at the grocery store. For 1/20th the cost you can make it yourself!

, A clean bathroom makes people feel much more comfortable in your home, while a dirty one has a huge 'ICK!' factor. First clean off the bathroom counters. Put things away that you do not constantly use. Find a way to attractively display those that you do. Bathrooms are so small, even a little bit of clutter is unattractive. A rag or paper towel with some glass cleaner will clean the mirror, other surfaces and fixtures as well. This makes a nice impression with guests. Finally, fluff and refold the towels and wipe up the floor with the rag, and toss it in the laundry basket. See also How to Clean a toilet and How to Clean a Bathtub

, Dust off any tables, shelves and items on them. This gives people a better impression of your home and helps prevent allergies. If the items are washable (such as glass decorations) set aside some time later to wash them and allow them to dry completely before replacing them. If you're expecting company in the next few days and there's time, polishing the wood and glass is a nice touch (but never use the same kind of polish for glass and wood! Lemon oil is best for wood, glass cleaners, such as Sparkle, for glass. If the smell of store-bought cleaners is bothersome, you can inexpensively make your own. There are many kinds of products that are also non-toxic and quite effective such as Mrs. Meyer's.)

There will be an image which looks like a side view of a bucket with water in it. If a number is written, this indicates the temperature (in Celsius) that should be used. If a hand is there instead of a number, this means it should be hand washed. An X means it should not be washed.
The triangle indicates bleaching. A white triangle means the item can be bleached, a black triangle or X means it should not be.
A box with a circle inside indicates how to use the dryer. One dot means low temperature, two dots means normal, and an X means a dryer should not be used.
A plain box means the item should be dried on a line (if a parenthesis is at the top), flat (if a solid stroke is through the middle), or drip-dried (if three vertical lines are in the box).
The image of the iron indicates the temperature used to iron the item. The more dots, the higher the temperature. An X means an iron should not be used.;

Set the washer to the highest temperature possible.,
Add the usual amount of detergent.,
Fill the bleach dispenser in your machine.,
Add your laundry and allow the cycle to run.",How to Disinfect Laundry1," When you’re disinfecting your laundry with bleach, you want to wash at the highest temperature possible. Check your items’ care labels to determine how hot the water you wash them in can be, and use that setting on your washing machine.Hot water, measuring 140 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 90 degrees Celsius) is typically only used for white items.
Colored items should be washed in cooler water, typically measuring between 86 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (30 to 40 degrees Celsius).
Delicate items usually should be hand washed or washed in a strictly cold water cycle.;
, Once you’ve set the proper temperature for the water, fill the cap from your detergent with the recommended amount for the size of your load. Pour the detergent directly into the washer’s drum or into the detergent drawer.If you’re not sure where the detergent goes in your washing machine, consult the operating instructions.
Front-loading washers usually have a detergent drawer, while top-loading washers usually call for pouring the detergent directly into the washer’s drum.

, Consult the instructions on the bottle of bleach to determine how much you should add for the size of your load. Next, pour the bleach into the bleach dispenser.If your washer doesn’t have a bleach dispenser, you can add the bleach directly to the drum. However, you should start the cycle first so water starts to fill the drum before pouring the bleach in. Don’t put laundry in a washer with bleach that hasn’t been diluted first.
Pay attention to the type of bleach that you’re using. Chlorine bleach is best for white items, while all-fabric bleach should be used on colored items.

, Once you’ve added the detergent and bleach, place your laundry items in the washer’s drum. Close the lid, and allow the cycle to run through as it normally would. When your items are finished washing, dry them according to their care instructions."

,
Check the lint tray before drying.,
Choose which drying level you want, whether for colors or whites.








,
Take your clothes from the laundry room, fold items, and place them on shelf of cart.",How to Do Laundry2," Your detergent bottle should have a chart that tells what amount should be used for your wash load. When using a High Efficiency or front loading washing machine with soft water, use the minimum recommended amount of detergent into the washing machine. If you need to add bleach (which is used to whiten clothes), put it in appropriate dispenser. Always handle bleach carefully as it can cause harm to skin, eyes and clothing if it splashes.








, Colors are washed in cold water. Whites, under most circumstances, can be washed in warm water without problem. To kill mites, bed linens (especially pillow-cases) need hot water.


When in doubt, go with cold water, as hot water can shrink clothes.

, Add clothes to the washer but do not over stuff the washer as the clothes won't be cleaned well if there is too much laundry in it.








,, Place your pile in the dryer. Make sure the lint tray is emptied, as a full tray can cause fires or make it impossible to dry the clothes. Tap tray gently upside down against garbage can to empty it.








,, Iron items and hang on coat hangers immediately after drying to prevent wrinkles.

Combine cold water and bleach.,
Soak the items in the bleach solution for at least 15 minutes.,
Rinse the items with hot water and wash them in your washer.",How to Disinfect Laundry2," To create a bleach solution to soak your laundry, you need to dilute the bleach with cold water. The amount of bleach that you need depends on how large a load you’re soaking. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of bleach for every 1 gallon (3.8 l) of cold water up to 5 gallons (19 l).Make sure to choose the right bleach for your laundry. Only use chlorine bleach for white items. Use an all-fabric bleach for colored items.
Make sure that your laundry has already been washed before soaking it in the bleach.

, Once you’ve created the bleach solution, place your laundry in the water. Allow the items to soak in the water for at least 15 minutes.If you’re soaking laundry that is especially prone to germs, such as cloth diapers or an ill person’s bedding, you should let it soak for at least 30 minutes.
Never leave the laundry in the bleach solution for more than 45 minutes.

, After your laundry has soaked for the appropriate amount of time, use hot water to rinse them thoroughly. Next, put them in your washer and wash as you normally would with hot water to completely remove the bleach.Be sure to read the care labels on your laundry to verify that they can be washed in hot water.

Wash or soak your laundry in hydrogen peroxide and borax.,
Soak items in a grapefruit seed extract solution.,
Add tea tree or lavender essential oil to your washing machine cycle.",How to Disinfect Laundry3," If you don’t want to use bleach to disinfect your laundry, a combination of hydrogen peroxide and borax can also do the trick. You can create a solution to add to a load of laundry or soak your items in it to sanitize them.To wash your laundry with a disinfecting hydrogen peroxide and borax solution, mix 4 cups (960 ml) of hydrogen peroxide and 1 cup (409 g) of borax along with your usual detergent. Make sure to add the mixture to your washer after there’s some water in it, though.
To soak your laundry in a disinfecting hydrogen peroxide and borax solution, mix 4 cups (960 ml) of hydrogen peroxide and 1 cup (409 g) of borax into a bathtub that’s half full with water. Allow the items to soak for 15 to 30 minutes, rinse in hot water, and then run through a cycle in the washer with hot water.
Be careful when using hydrogen peroxide on darker colors. Test it on an area of the fabric that won't be visible before using it.

, Grapefruit seed extract is believed to be a natural disinfectant. Create a solution using 5 to 10 drops of grapefruit seed extract for every gallon of water. Let your items soak for 15 to 30 minutes, and rinse with warm water. Next, run the laundry through a regular cycle in your washer.Don’t allow your laundry to soak in the grapefruit seed extract for more than an hour.

, Like grapefruit seed extract, tea tree oil and lavender essential oil are believed to have natural antifungal, antibacterial, and antimicrobial properties. While you’re doing a regular load in your washing machine add 2 to 3 drops of tea tree essential oil or 1 to 2 drops of lavender essential oil along with your detergent. Allow the cycle to run as normal, and dry the clothes according to the care label when you’re finished washing them.Because tea tree oil and lavender essential oil have fragrances, it’s best to use them with unscented detergent.

Spray the carpet with warm water.,
Go over the spot with clean rags.,
Use a steam cleaner.,
Wipe up detergent using clean rags.,
Run a mop over the area to remove any leftover soap.,
Thoroughly dry the area with a rag or towel.,
Remove excess soap with a scoop.,
Vacuum up remaining powdered laundry detergent.,
Look around for forgotten soap.,
Store the laundry detergent in a better location.,
Rethink your storage space.,
Switch to a clear or white detergent to prevent major stains.",How to Clean Up Spilled Laundry Detergent," Yes, the spill will be plenty wet with soap, but you will need to wet it with water to fully clean up the spill. Warm water is the best way to separate the detergent from the carpet fibers. Fill up a spray bottle with very warm water (heated in the microwave or on the stove) and completely cover the spill with water.While vinegar may be a good all-purpose cleaner for the rest of your home, keep it away from the detergent spill. Start with clean water and no cleanser to remove the soap.;
, After a few minutes have passed, take a clean rag to the carpet and try your best to remove as much soap as possible. You’ll really need some elbow grease for this part.

Even when it seems like you’ve removed all the soap, there will still be some leftover. The carpet may feel hard once it dries. That’s ok, because you’re not done yet.

, After you’ve gotten up a lot of the soap with towels and your own manpower, it’s time to break out the steam cleaner. Run it over the carpet until there are no suds and the carpet feels like the right texture.You can rent a steam cleaner from your local home improvement store. It may seem like a lot of effort, but it’s worth it to prevent the soap from lingering in the carpet.
Follow the instructions on the steam cleaner carefully. Use the solution it comes with and be sure not to overfill the container.If you don't want to rent a steam cleaner, you can do the job by hand. Apply water, scrub, and repeat until the soap is completely gone. Use a fan to speed up drying.

, Liquid soap will leave a slippery and sticky residue on the floor if it’s not completely wiped up. This residue will also act as a dust and fluff magnet, so remove it as quickly as possible using paper towels or rags.


Don't wait to clean up the spill. Liquid soap will make the floor slippery, and infants and pets might be tempted to eat it., Find a mop and dip it in warm, clean water. If there’s soap leftover that you can’t see, the water will make suds. Continue to mop until there is no soap remaining.

The mop will remove any mess made while cleaning.

, After you’ve wiped up the soap and mopped up any residue, rub a clean rag over the area until it’s completely dry. Doing so prevents slips and keeps the floor from getting dirty if someone walks over it., You don’t want to run a vacuum cleaner or broom over a big pile of powdered detergent. First, get as much of it up as you can with a scoop or dustbin. Just make sure you avoid grinding the soap into the carpet. Lightly scoop from the top of the pile, instead., Using a regular vacuum is the fastest and most effective method for cleaning up powdered detergent. Remember that you may have to move the washing machine or use a narrow nozzle to reach under it.


Keep water away from the soap at all costs to avoid an even bigger mess.
If you don’t have a vacuum cleaner, a broom will work, but it will take more time to fully remove the powder.

, It's likely that some powdered detergent fell somewhere else. To get a thorough clean, check under and around the machine for tell-tale evidence of the spill.

, If you keep spilling your laundry detergent, it could be time to reevaluate your storage methods. Placing detergent where it’s easy to reach and away from places it’s likely to get bumped or kicked will help.


Beware leaving it on top of a front loader or dryer. The machine's movements can cause the detergent to ""jump"" and fall.
Detergent that is stored on the ground is likely to be kicked over.

, There is a range of suitable laundry detergent containers on Amazon.com or at your local home goods store that can hide the less pretty boxes and make your laundry neater and safer. Adding shelves can help you make the most of your space, too.If you use boxed powder detergent, transferring the powder into a sealable container can help to prevent future spills.
Make sure you tightly seal liquid or powdered detergent after each use.

, There’s no way to completely prevent laundry detergent spills, but switching to a clear or white detergent will ensure that if some does land on your carpet or floor, you’ll only have to deal with the suds -- not the dyes."

Check your gloves’ care tags.,
Work the nap up.,
Use a suede eraser to remove stains and marks.",How to Clean Suede Gloves1," Before you begin cleaning your suede gloves, check the care tags. There are a lot of different types of suede and suede finishes, and each type has different care needs. The tags should tell you the best process for cleaning your type of suede.For example, you should not use water on very fine suede, since the water will likely stain it. Other types of suede should only ever be cleaned with a suede eraser or brush and never any type of liquid.;
, The nap in suede is what makes it look smooth, but you need to work it up in order to clean it properly. Run a suede brush or bath towel against the grain of your suede gloves. Start at the wrist of your glove and use short strokes, moving up the length of the glove., Rub your suede eraser back and forth over stains and marks on your gloves. Start by rubbing gently. If you notice that the stains or marks aren't coming up, slowly begin to apply more pressure as you rub the eraser back and forth. The suede eraser should bring up most of the marks and stains on your gloves.If you don’t have a suede eraser, you can use a small pencil eraser for this step.
You might notice that some eraser material comes off on the suede. This is normal, and you should be able to brush it right off of your gloves."

Catch up the laundry.,
Clear the clutter.,

If you store cleaning supplies in the laundry room, dispose safely of any hopelessly outdated stuff, especially if you don't use it anymore or the container appears to be in danger of spilling its contents.,
Organize what remains.,
Dust the walls and cabinets.,
Wipe off the outsides of your washer and dryer.,
Clean any counter tops and wipe out the laundry sink, if you have one.,

Clean out your dryer vent about once a year.,
Sweep and mop the floor, and shake or hose out any scatter rugs or mats.
,
If you have hard water, try running a wash load with vinegar in it periodically.",How to Clean Your Laundry Room," Get all the clean clothes put away. Wash dirty clothes that are in the laundry room and put those away, too. After that, if the laundry room itself is your target, bring in only one load at a time from other rooms.
, This is a particular problem if your laundry room doubles as a work area, mud room, pet food area, or storage area., If you need to dispose of household chemicals, contact your municipality about proper disposal., Place it in shelves, cabinets, or bins so that the items you use most are close at hand. If possible, clear the tops of the washer and dryer and any work surfaces., Lint buildup in a laundry room can make for a lot of dust on the walls. A long-handled duster or dust mop will make this a quicker job., Use a mild, diluted spray cleaner and a rag., Laundry sinks often end up getting the messy jobs, like cleaning paint brushes or muddy shoes, so yours might not ever gleam. Just clean the worst of it and move on., While it's not a visible mess, it does pose a fire hazard and reduce the efficiency of your dryer. A clogged vent can also contribute to dust in your home.,, The acid will help to dissolve the minerals. You can even add it to the rinse cycle with your clothes, and no, your clothes will not reek of vinegar when they are dry."
"
Add baking soda to your laundry to neutralize odors.,
Mix white vinegar into the wash cycle.,
Make a vodka dilution.,
Make a fabric refresher with essential oils.",How to Deodorize Clothing1," Baking soda has long been used to deodorize clothing and to pre-treat stains. Adding one cup of baking soda to a load of laundry can help remove unwanted smells.


Sometimes simply adding baking soda to your wash cycle isn’t enough. For hard-to-remove odors, add ½ cup baking soda per gallon of water in a large bucket or sink. Be sure to swirl the clothes around to ensure they are fully submerged and to distribute the baking soda evenly throughout the mixture.
If you don’t have time to wash sweaty, smelly clothes immediately, sprinkle some baking soda on them before putting them into your laundry bin to control odors and absorb moisture.;
, Add about ¼ cup of white vinegar during the final rinse cycle to help remove odors from sweat, smoke, and bacteria., Use 1 part vodka to 1 part water and store the solution in a jug (don’t worry about long-term storage, your solution will last for a very long time). Next, pour some solution into a spray bottle and spray onto smelly clothes.


Do a spot-test first in a small, unnoticeable area to make sure this solution won't damage your clothes. This way to deodorize your clothes may not be ideal for certain fabrics, like leather or silk.
If you don’t have a spray bottle, they can usually be found at restaurant supply stores or anywhere commercial cleaning products are sold.
Although vodka is an effective deodorizer, it doesn’t clean your clothes or remove stains, so don't expect your solution to produce results in these areas.

, Use 1 cup of vinegar, 1 cup of water, and ½ teaspoon of your favorite essential oil. Tea tree, lavender, lemon, and grapefruit are all popular options. Pour your mixture into a spray bottle and spritz your clothes between wash cycles. "

Search pockets.,
Examine the clothes.,
Read the care labels on the clothes.,
Sort your clothes.,
Treat any spots you may have identified.,
Wash your clothes using appropriate temperature water.,
Dry your clothes.,
Remove smell.,
Replace material that is falling apart.,
Store your clothes appropriately.",How to Clean Thrift Store Clothes," One of the first steps you need to take when cleaning thrift store clothes is to search the pockets. This is important, as previous owners may have left items in the pockets. Such items, if left in the pockets, could damage your new clothing when you go to wash it.


Remove any items like pens, money, hair ties, or anything else.
Turn the pockets inside out so you know whether you’ve searched that article of clothing already.;
, After searching pockets, you should take a minute to examine the clothes really carefully. Examining your clothes is important, as depending on their age and condition, you might need to take specific steps to safeguard them. There are a number of things you’ll need to look for when examining your thrift store clothes:


Stains that should be treated.
Rips or tears that need to be repaired.
Worn out fabric that should be patched or replaced.
Delicate fabric that needs to be handled with care., Before taking any action to clean the clothes, you need to read the care tags carefully. Care tags are included on almost all mass produced clothes and will provide instructions for how to clean and care for the clothing.


Care tags are often located on the back collar of shirts and blouses, or on the middle of the back waist on pants.
Homemade and boutique clothes may not have care tags. In this case, use your best judgement to determine the fabric and how to care for it. If you’re not sure, you should probably just dry clean the item.
When looking at care tags, identify instructions about the temperature of water you need to use when washing your clothes, instructions for drying your clothes, instructions for bleaching your thrift store clothes, and instructions about how to iron your clothes., Based on the care labels and other factors, you need to sort your clothes and create several piles. By sorting your clothes, you’ll make sure that clothes are washed and dried appropriately.


Sort by colors. While thrift store clothes have probably been laundered and may not run, you should still sort by colors. This will make sure you preserve lighter colored fabrics.
Sort by fabric. Different fabrics, like cottons, should be washed together.
Make a pile for special needs fabrics like silk, wool, or velvet. These will very often need to be dry cleaned. Consult the care tag if you have any doubt.
Create a pile for delicate or vintage fabrics. These fabrics may need to be dry cleaned, or at the very least washed by themselves., The first step in cleaning your clothes will be to treat any spots you've found. This is important, as washing the clothes before treating spots may make those spots set. If you do this, spots will be a lot harder to get out.


Use “Spot Shot” or another stain removing product on spots you think can be removed.
Consult a dry cleaner. Dry cleaners may have an idea of whether you should treat a specific spot.
Think about using bleach on soiled or dirty white fabrics., Depending on the age and fabric of your clothes, you‘ll have to use an appropriate water temperature to wash them. If you don’t, you might shrink the clothes or damage the material.


Wash cottons in cold, as hot water may shrink them.
Wash colored fabrics in cold water, as hot water may make them run.
Consider washing pre-shrunk or synthetic fabrics in warm water.

, After washing your clothes, you’ll need to dry them. Drying your clothes appropriately is also important in making sure you properly clean and preserve your new threads. Ultimately, if you dry your clothes improperly, you could damage them.


Always make sure to dry clothes appropriately and follow the care tag on your new clothes.
There are a number of materials you should never put in the dryer, including: bathing suits, bras, and certain embellishments like sequins.
Hang dry any clothes or materials you have a doubt about., Finally, after you’ve washed your clothes, you might need to take extra steps to clean or remove smells from your thrift store clothes. This is important, as some scents may persist through a normal wash. There are a number of ways to remove the smell from thrift store clothes:


Use activated charcoal or kitty litter. Place your cloths in a plastic bag and place the bag in air tight plasticware for a couple of days with activated charcoal or kitty litter. The charcoal or kitty litter will remove scents from your clothes. Remember, though, don't let the kitty litter or charcoal come into direct contact with your clothing.
Steam your thrift store clothes. Steaming your clothes might help remove old smells or bad scents.
Dab your clothes with white vinegar. In many cases, acidic white vinegar will help remove smells from old clothes. This works best with newer white clothing, but may be too abrasive for delicate darks., Another important element of cleaning thrift store clothes is replacing parts of your new clothing that are faulty or falling apart. By replacing problematic parts, you’ll help restore your clothes, make sure they’re clean and new looking, and you’ll prolong the life of them.


Remove any buttons or ribbons that are stained or torn.
Patch or sew shut any rips or tears in your new clothing.

Mend torn seams and any other parts that need to be repaired.

, Finally, the last part of making sure your thrift store clothes are clean is to store them properly. By storing them properly, you’ll keep them clean and prevent them from developing new smells.


Hang your clothes in your closet. By hanging your clothes, you’ll make sure that they can air out and don’t get musty in a drawer.
Place a deodorizer in your closet.
Make sure your closet is cool and has low humidity. Having a cool closet with low humidity will prevent the growth of mold and mildew, and slow the deterioration of your clothes."

Fill the machine with hot water.,
Add a quart of bleach for stain removal.,
Clean the rubber seal on the door.,
Clean the dispensers.",How to Clean the Inside of a Washing Machine1," Newer models of front-loading machines often have self cleaning cycles, so if this is the case with yours, fill it with hot water on this setting. If you don't have a self-cleaning cycle, just fill it with hot water.;
, If the inside of your washer is stained, bleach will do the trick. Add it through the dispenser so that it mixes with hot water, then let the machine finish the rest of the washing cycle.

, This area is prone to mold growth, since water can get trapped between the seal and the machine. Use an all-purpose cleaner and a sponge or paper towel to clean under and around the seal.

, Make sure the the powder and liquid detergent dispensers are free of hair and other debris. Use an all-purpose cleaner or a vinegar and water solution and a sponge to remove traces of detergent, dirt and anything else that could clog your dispenser.

Avoid doing laundry when your family is home.,
Organize your laundry in advance.,
Prioritize.,
Make laundry a fun activity.",How to Do Laundry Quickly," Never start your laundry during the day when children are home and needing your time and attention. Instead, use the time to focus on your family and do the laundry when you're alone.;
, Always organize your laundry before you do it. Use that time to separate the laundry (colors, whites, delicates), load the machine, put the detergent in, and leave it there, and have it ready for later. Then, you can just press the start button when you're ready.

, Wash the clothes that you need the most first. Focus on taking care of everyday clothes that you're very likely to use before you start washing things such as dress clothes or bedsheets.

, Laundry doesn't always have to be a solitary activity––you can invite children, a spouse, or even a friend to help out. They can help separate the clothes and place the clothes in their places. This will also be a good time to get some social time with others while still being productive. Plus, if you have kids, it can increase their sense of responsibility.

Wash it with detergent and warm water.,
Use a sponge or soft brush.,
Use a washing machine set on the delicate cycle.,
Dry nylon on the low heat setting.",How to Clean Nylon1," For basic cleaning, dampen a clean cloth with soapy water. Make sure the soap is gentle and doesn’t contain bleach. Wipe down the soiled area. Make sure not to saturate the area. Remove excess moisture with a dry cloth., For caked on dirt or unpleasant smells, try using a sponge or brush. Dip the brush or sponge in soapy warm water. Then scrub the nylon with the brush or sponge.Rinse the detergent with a damp clean cloth. Use a dry cloth to remove the water.

, Nylon is a machine-washable material. Use cool water and the delicate cycle.Read the label on nylon clothes for any washing and care instructions.


If you are washing delicate items like lingerie, you should place them in a mesh bag before washing. This can help protect them.

, Nylon won’t shrink, but it will wrinkle in the dryer. After machine washing normally, dry the nylon on a low heat setting."
"
Rewet the stain.,
Blot up the water.,
Let the gloves air dry completely.",How to Clean Suede Gloves2," If your suede gloves are work or gardening gloves, they probably have old water stains on them. To get rid of those stains, start by rewetting your gloves completely. The best way to do this is to run your gloves under a faucet. This ensures an even application of water, which can prevent water stains after this process is over., Use paper towel to blot up the water by pressing down on your gloves. Don’t push down too hard, as this can actually force stains further into the suede. Use only slightly more pressure than you would get from resting your hand on top of your gloves., Once you’ve blotted up the water, let your gloves air dry completely. Don’t put them in the dryer, as this will cause your gloves to shrink. You might need to use a suede brush or paper towel to fluff up the suede once they are dry.

Dampen a cotton cloth with vinegar.,
Press the cloth onto the stain.,
Gently rub the cloth across the stains.,
Let the gloves dry.,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Clean Suede Gloves3," Dip a clean cotton cloth into white distilled vinegar. Don’t use apple cider vinegar as this will stain the suede., Using gentle pressure, press the cloth onto the stain(s) you’re trying to remove. Don’t press too hard as this will push the stain into the suede., After you’ve pressed down on the stain, wipe the cloth gently across the stain and against the grain. This gets the nap up and allows the vinegar to work into the stain itself., After you’ve pressed and wiped the gloves with vinegar, let them dry completely. Until the gloves are dry, you won’t be able to tell if the stains have been completely removed., Depending on the stain, you might need to repeat this step more than once. The gloves must dry completely in between each step."
"
Soak your clothes in a Borax solution.,
Use a sport wash.,
Make your own specialty detergent.",How to Deodorize Clothing2," Add ½ cup of Borax for every half gallon of water you use and soak your clothes for at least 30 minutes in a large sink or tub.Borax is very effective in removing odors due to certain aspects of its chemical makeup that inhibit the metabolic processes of many odor-causing bacteria.


Be sure to wash your clothes after using Borax. Another useful property of Borax is that it actually increases the effectiveness of other laundry detergents. After you’re done soaking your clothes, run them through the washing machine as you normally would and allow the unique chemical properties of Borax to work their magic!

, Specialty detergents like Nathan’s Sport Wash or Sport Suds are specifically designed for removing body odor and bacteria from workout clothing, but their deodorizing properties usually do the trick for other unwanted smells. Simply add the recommended amount to your washing machine and wash as normal.Some sport washes, like Sport Suds, are reportedly powerful enough to dissolve gunk on the inside of your washing machine. It’s recommended to give your washing machine a deep clean before laundering your clothes with detergents like these.

, Homemade specialty detergents can be just as effective as commercial products, if not more. Most recipes for homemade detergents call for a mix of natural and chemical ingredients. One popular recipe calls for 3 tablespoons Borax, 3 tablespoons baking soda, and 2 tablespoons Dawn dishwashing liquid. Add these to 2 cups hot water in a gallon jug and shake until well mixed. Then, add cold water until the jug is full.Making your own specialty detergent is also remarkably cost effective. You could reduce your cost per load of laundry from $.50 to $.03!

Fill the machine with hot water.,
Add a quart of chlorine bleach.,
Finish the washing cycle.,
Clean the dispensers.",How to Clean the Inside of a Washing Machine2," The easiest way to do this is to turn on the hot wash cycle and interrupt it after the water has been filled. You could also heat up water in the kitchen and transfer it to the machine.

, Turn the washing cycle on for a few seconds to let so that the agitation function mixes the bleach and the water, then turn it back off and let the chlorine mixture sit for at least an hour. This will start lifting the grime, mildew and other substances inside your washing machine.


If you'd prefer not to use bleach, you can use a special machine cleaner instead. These are available for purchase at grocery stores in the detergent aisle.
For a natural alternative, add a quart of white vinegar instead of bleach or cleaner.

, After an hour, let the machine complete the washing cycle. At this point the inside of the machine is sanitized.


If the machine smells like bleach once the cycle is complete, fill it with hot water and pour in a quart of vinegar. Let it sit for an hour, then run the washing cycle once more.

, Use a vinegar water solution and a scrubber to clean the places where you insert powdered or liquid detergent. Dirt, hair, and other debris tends to pile up there, so cleaning these areas is an important part of keeping the inside clean, too.

Remove wet clothes promptly.,
Leave it open after washing.,
Make sure the machine parts stay dry.,
Deep clean once a month.",How to Clean the Inside of a Washing Machine3," Leaving wet clothes in the machine, even for a few hours, can lead to mold and mildew growth, which affects the smell of your clothes and the functionality of your machine. Transfer wet clothes to the dryer or clothesline immediately after the cycle is complete.

, Closing the door of your washing machine after a cycle is complete traps in the moisture, creating the perfect environment for mold and mildew growth. To prevent this from happening, simply leave the door open so the remaining water can evaporate.

, If your machine has a soap or softener drawer that gets wet during the washing process, take it out to dry when the cycle is complete. Only replace it in the washer when you're sure that it's thoroughly dry.

, Everyday maintenance helps prevent the washing machine from getting too mildewy, but it's still necessary to give it a deep cleaning about once a month. Use one of the methods outline above to keep your machine smelling fresh and working efficiently for years to come.

Wipe up the spillage immediately.,
Blot at the wet spot with a cloth rag.,
Press on the stain with a damp rag.,
Try a stain cleaning mixture.",How to Clean Nylon2," Whenever you spill anything liquid on nylon, wipe it up as soon as you can. This prevents the liquid from seeping into the material and making it more difficult to remove later. Use a cloth or paper towel to wipe away the excess., Press a clean cloth rag against the wet spot. Continue blotting at the stain to dry up as much of the stain as possible., For some stains that have just occurred, you can get them off nylon by blotting them with a damp rag. Wet a clean white rag with lukewarm water and squeeze out the water until it is damp. Then, press on the stain. Continue doing this until the stain is removed., Though nylon is stain resistant, you may not be able to remove all of the stain-causing substance. Even if you wipe and dab at the soiled area, the residue might leave a stain. Try making a mixture with either vinegar and water or lemon juice and club soda to remove stains.

Add warm or cool water, meaning roughly 65℉-80℉ or 18℃-27℃ or less. This is essentially room temperature water.Never use hot water, which is roughly above 90℉ or 32℃. Hot water will shrink the wool fibers.
Set the hat into the bowl or basin before you add water to make sure it will fit in the container once the water is added.;
, Choose a wool-specific detergent like Woolite or Persil Silk & Wool to make sure it is mild enough for the hat. Measure out a small amount and pour it into the water. When using powder detergent, agitate the water to make sure the particles dissolve completely.If you can’t find a wool-specific detergent, make sure you use a mild detergent. Baby detergent, such as Dreft, or detergent for sensitive skin, like All Free Clear, are good alternatives.

, Set the hat in the water and gently press it down so it is completely submerged. Hold it there until the entire hat soaks up water. This may take a minute depending how thick the weave of the hat is. Flip it over a couple of times so all sides get wet.

, Gently squeeze the hat and rub the fibers to let the water and detergent permeate completely into it. If possible, turn the hat inside out to make sure the inside gets clean as well.For stubborn stains, use a soft toothbrush to lightly scrub the hat. The fibers are damaged easily, so never scrub wool with a harsh brush or with hard strokes.
Be sure not to stretch the hat out while you wash it, as it may not return to the proper shape.

, After a good wash, let the hat soak in the water for a while to loosen any remaining stains or bad smells.

Scrub the laces.,
Dry the shoes and laces.",How to Clean Canvas1," Untie and unthread the laces from the lace holes in the shoe. Removing the laces will allow you to thoroughly scrub the tongue area of the shoe while cleaning.


You could also clean the shoelaces later on, or just replace them.;
, Smack the shoes together over a garbage can to knock off dirt and dust from the bottoms of the shoes. Then use a soft bristled brush to brush off any loose dirt particles and impurities on the canvas areas of the shoes.


An old toothbrush works great for removing dirt, especially for reaching into tiny crevices.

, Any mild detergent mixed with water will work as a cleaning solution. Gentle body soap, dishwashing soap, or a small amount of laundry detergent, are all viable options. For about a cup of water, consider using about ½ a teaspoon of mild detergent. Use your old toothbrush to mix up the water and soap until some bubbles start to form.


You could also use a small amount of bleach if your shoes are white, but be aware that bleach can potentially yellow the canvas fabric. A mild detergent is the safer bet.

, If you’re planning on cleaning the laces rather than replacing them, drop the laces into the the cleaning solution. Allow them to soak in the solution for about 15 minutes.


While you wait for the laces to soak, you can clean the actual shoe.

, Dip your old toothbrush into the soapy water mixture, and start scrubbing at the dirty areas of the shoe. Move the toothbrush in circles to thoroughly loosen the dirt and remove the stains.Continue dipping the toothbrush into the soapy water mixtures as you focus on other areas of the shoe.
It's okay to saturate the canvas with the soapy water solution, but try your best to keep from getting the foot bedding of the shoe wet. If you get the foot bedding wet, it won’t ruin your shoe, but it could cause damage after repeated saturation.

, You can rinse the canvas of the shoe by running it under a small stream of cool water from a faucet.


A small stream will ensure you gently rinse off the soapy solution from the shoe without getting water into the inside of the shoe.

, After the laces have had time to soak, remove them from the soapy water solution. Use your old toothbrush to scrub away at the stains. Once you have scrubbed all the stained areas of the laces, rinse them in cool water.


It may help to hold down the laces with your fingers on one hand, and focus on scrubbing a stained area with your other hand.

, Once the shoes and laces are cleaned, dab them dry with a paper towel to soak up any remaining water. Then allow the shoes and laces to dry naturally, outside in the sun.


Drying shoes in the dryer can damage the adhesive on the shoe and shrink the canvas material.

Only wash stocking cap style hats in the washer. Hats with a bill, brim, or other structural pieces should only be washed by hand.

, Basic laundry detergent can damage the fibers of a wool hat, so don’t use standard detergent. Use either wool-specific detergent, such as Woolite, or another mild detergent for delicate fabrics.Never pour the detergent directly onto the wool hat, as too much detergent on the hat could damage the fibers. Either put the detergent in after water has been added or pour it away from the wool hat.

, Excessively hot water can shrink wool and damage the fibers, so never put a washing machine on a hot cycle with your wool hat. Make sure that the soak, wash, and rinse cycles are all either warm or cold.Water temperature on the warm setting should be 80℉ (27℃) or below. If you don’t know the temperature of the warm setting, it’s best to stick with cold water.

, Since wool is not as tough as some other materials, do not use the normal wash settings. Choose “Delicates,” or even “Wool cycle,” if it is an option. Whichever setting provides the gentlest wash is the best setting for your hat.If the washer you want to use does not offer a gentle setting, it is best to wash your wool hat by hand.

For a typical cotton dress shirt, a wash and press is in many ways your better option. The cleaner will wash your shirt in a typical washing machine, then place it in a clothing press which removes the water and irons the shirt., Of course, dry cleaning is still an option. Unfortunately, dry cleaning will not remove water-based stains (such as sweat), but it will eradicate oil stains. If you have gotten something oily on your shirt, dry cleaning is the way to go., Bring your shirt to the cleaner of your choice and explain which service you'd like to have done. The cleaner will tell you when to return to pick up your shirt. In most cases, you will pay when you retrieve the shirt, but some locations may ask you to pay before service are rendered."

Repeat until all of the excess water has been squeezed from the pants.You will probably need to roll up and squeeze the pants in the towel four or five times.

, Lay the pants out on a flat surface. Make sure the flat surface is clean and nothing will be laid on top of the pants. Wait until they are completely dry to pick up and iron or store away., It is best to have a professional iron your pants if they are pleated. If not, you can iron them on your own. Turn them inside out and iron the pockets. Then, turn them back out and iron the rest of the pants. Set a crease in the front by aligning the inseams. Hold the iron a few inches away as you steam along the edge of the inseams., Make sure to hang up your pants after every cleaning. If your pants have pleats, fold them along the pleat and hang them across the hanger. If they are not pleated, simply fold them in half on the hanger and hang them up.Folding the pants on the hanger helps to prevent wrinkles.

Brush off the dirt.,
Apply saddle soap to the gloves.,
Rinse your gloves.,
Lay the gloves flat to dry.,
Treat the gloves with oil.",How to Clean Garden Gloves2," Leather and suede gloves can become extremely stiff and hard to work with when they’re dirty. Start the cleaning process by brushing off any dry, loose, or caked on dirt and debris from the material. It’s usually best to use your fingers to brush away the dirt, so you don’t damage the leather.If you’re having trouble brushing away the dirt by hand, you can also use a soft-bristled cleaning brush. Just be sure to use gentle strokes.

, Place a small amount of the soap on a damp paper towel or soft rag and rub it back and forth to create a lather. Put on one of the gloves. Use the paper towel or rag to work the soap into the leather, paying particular attention to the dirtiest areas.Spend several minutes working the saddle soap into the leather so it really has a chance to penetrate and lift out the dirt.

, Once you’ve worked the saddle soap completely into the glove, take a clean dampened piece of paper towel or soft rag and gently rinse the suds away from the the leather. Don’t allow the paper towel or rag to become too saturated with water, though, or you may damage the leather.If you notice that there is still dirt and grime on the glove while you’re rinsing, you may want to repeat the cleansing process to get the leather completely clean.
Once you’re satisfied that the glove is clean, complete the same process with the other glove.

, To prevent cracking, shrinkage, and other damage to your leather gloves, it’s best to allow them to air dry. Set out a clean, soft towel on a table, countertop, or other flat surface, and allow the gloves to dry completely.Don’t place your gloves near a heater, radiator, fire, or other open flame. The leather may crack.
While your gloves are drying, it’s a good idea to periodically put them on and stretch them. That will help stretch them so they maintain their shape.

, Leather can become stiff over time, and the cleaning process itself doesn’t always help with that. Once your gloves are completely dry, you should apply an oil to the leather to condition it so it becomes softer and the gloves are more comfortable to wear. Use clean, soft cloth to carefully spread linseed oil onto the gloves. Let it sit for several minutes, and then use a clean area of the cloth to rub it in.If you don’t have linseed oil, mink oil is an effective alternative. You can also use a treatment product specifically for leather, which usually contains a blend of oils and other ingredients.

Rinse with water.,
Use dish detergent to remove dirt.,
Allow the gloves to air dry.",How to Clean Garden Gloves3," After you’ve used your gloves, you’ll want to rinse them as quickly as possible to prevent dirt and debris from getting caked on the rubber. If you’re still outside, just run them under the garden hose. Otherwise, rinse them in your sink with cold water.It’s usually easiest to rinse your gloves when you’re still wearing them, which is why it’s convenient to use the garden hose after you’ve finished your work.

, Even after rinsing your gloves, the rubber may still be dirty. To remove any lingering soil and debris, use a basic dish washing liquid to clean them. Apply the detergent to the palm of the glove and carefully work it all over the rubber to get it clean. Use cold water again to rinse.If your rubber gardening gloves have stubborn stains or dirty spots, use a cleaning brush to scrub at those areas.

, It’s important to ensure that your rubber gloves dry completely because they can grow mildew easily. However, you can’t place rubber in a dryer, so you’ll need to leave them to air dry. You can hang them with clothespins to dry, or set them on out on a table or counter to dry flat.Even after cleaning, make sure to store your rubber gardening gloves in a dry location so they don’t mildew.

Brush off any surface dirt.,
Look at the canvas covering labels.,
Create your cleaning mixture.,
Clean the canvas surface.,
Rinse the canvas.,
Consider applying a fabric protectant.",How to Clean Canvas2," Tiny leaves and little bits of dirt can get caught in canvas furniture. Wipe off the canvas furniture with a bristled brush to remove any surface dirt.


You could even hit canvas pillows with your hands to loosen dust from the fabric.

, If the labels on your canvas furniture covers say they are machine washable, go ahead and wash them in a washing machine.Use a mild detergent on a mild washing setting to wash the canvas coverings; Canvas fabric can be delicate.


If your canvas coverings are not machine washable, you will have to clean them by hand like the rest of your furniture pieces.

, Fill a bucket with 2 gallons of clean water. Add approximately ½ a capful of a mild detergent like dishwashing soap, or detergent specifically made for washing items by hand.You can swirl your bristled brush around in the bucket to make the water sudsy.

, Use a rag or sponge dipped in the cleaning solution to initially wipe down the canvas surfaces. Then use a bristled brush dipped in the cleaning solution to go over the canvas again, and scrub the soiled areas.


You don’t have to apply too much pressure while scrubbing the canvas surfaces. Rough scrubbing can end up damaging the fabric.

, Lightly spray the canvas furniture with clean water to rinse off any soap residue. Water from a hose will work just fine. Once all furniture pieces are rinsed, allow the furniture to dry naturally in the sun.


If the canvas is colored, be aware that allowing the furniture to dry in the sun may weaken its coloring..

, To protect the canvas from further damage, apply a protective spray that will help the canvas repel dirt and water. Apply this spray only when the canvas is completely dried. Spray the canvas surfaces from approximately 3 feet away, being sure to spray in a thorough, even, widespread fashion.Be sure to follow the instructions on the protective spray bottle.
If you don’t know which kind of protective spray to use on your canvas, consult an employee at your local home department store.

Rinse the fabric.,
Air dry the canvas.,
Consider retreating the fabric.",How to Clean Canvas3," Use a stiff bristled brush, and wipe off any loose dirt from the surface of the canvas covering.


Some items that may be stuck to the canvas surface include leaves, dust, dirt, bird droppings, and algae growths.

, Gently hose the canvas covering to dampen the surface. Then, use a spray bottle or a cloth dipped in water to moisten the seams of the canvas, since the seams can accumulate and house a lot of dirt.


Saturating the canvas surface with water will help the cleaning agent adhere, and soak into the grimy nooks and crannies of the canvas., The cleaning solution should be mild and diluted with water. A mild detergent such as dishwashing soap or a detergent specific for washing fabrics by hand is a good option, but you could also use bleach. A good cleaning mixture ratio is about 1 cup of bleach to 5 gallons of warm water.If you are going to use a mild detergent, consider using about ¼ cup of detergent to per gallon of warm water., Use a stiff bristled brush to work the cleaning solution into the canvas fabric. You can move the brush in circles or scrub back and forth.


However, don’t apply a great amount of pressure while scrubbing; you could damage the canvas fabric.
Again, remember to focus on scrubbing the seams of the canvas, because that’s where a lot of filth collects.

, Leave the soapy cleaning solution on the canvas fabric for a about 30-60 minutes. This will allow the cleaning solution to soak into the fabric and release the dirt and impurities.

, Rinse the fabric with clean water to remove the soapy solution. Hosing down the fabric will work just fine.


You may have to repeat this process a few times if your boat canvas is particularly dirty.

, Allow the canvas covering to dry naturally by the sun and wind outside. Your canvas covering should be completely dry with one full day sitting in the sun.

, You may want to consider applying a water proofing spray to the surface of the fabric. Some fabric treatments made especially for boats can even contain solutions to prevent wear and tear from sun rays. Simply follow the instructions on the fabric protectant spray bottle.


Normally, 2 thin coats of protectant spray are recommended for the best results. Allow the first coat to completely dry before adding on the second coat.If you are unsure about what kind of fabric treatment to use, consult a worker at your local boat shop.

Lay the hat flat on a clean surface.,
Hang the hat from a clothesline or a hanger.,
Wear the hat until it is dry.,
Reshape the hat before it dries completely.",How to Clean a Wool Hat3," Take a clean, dark towel and roll the hat up in it to remove most of the water. Do this more than once if necessary until the hat is only slightly damp. This works best for wool sock hats because hats with a bill or structure will crush if you roll them., Never dry a wool hat in a dryer, as the hat will shrink significantly and may be completely ruined. Lay the hat out on a clean surface and let it air dry. Flip the hat over at some point so the bottom or inside can dry. Flip sock hats inside out for awhile, too.Place a fan near the hat to keep air flowing on. This will help the hat dry faster without the damaging effects of a dryer.

, Another drying option is to hang the hat up rather than drying it lying flat. Use a clothespin or a hook to hang the hat from a clothesline. Indoor clotheslines may be better because leaving the hat in direct sunlight for too long can damage it. #*Also, try hanging the hat from a hanger on a doorknob.

, As a wool hat dries, it may not dry in the right shape. If you wear the hat long enough for it to dry on your head, it will form to your head and end up shaped exactly the way you need it to be.Another option is to place the hat on an upside down bowl, a coffee canister, or something else that is round to help the hat retain its shape.

, If you left the hang lying or hanging to dry, pick it up when it is mostly dry and fluff it back into the shape you want. If it dries completely while it’s flat, it may not reshape the way you want it to.This mainly applies to floppy sock hats because baseball hats or other wool hats with structure to them will stay in shape.

, Wash down all surfaces in rooms where the odor is noticeable. Use bleach or a disinfectant to clean the surfaces and to mop the floor. If the smell is very strong, wash the walls., Launder all items made of fabric from the rooms where the smell is noticeable. This includes table cloths, curtains, and slip covers. Use bleach if that won’t ruin the fabrics. If the smell permeated any cardboard boxes in the kitchen, move the contents of the boxes to plastic baggies and recycle the boxes.

Make lemon water.,
Put out bowls of onion water.,
Soak bread with vinegar.,
Combine water and baking soda.",How to Remove the Smell of Burnt Food from Your Home2," Put a pot of water to boil on the stove. Cut a lemon into multiple slices. Put the lemon slices into the boiling water and let sit for 10-30 minutes to freshen up the house.


As an alternative, steep a handful of hot cloves in the water instead of lemon slices.

, Cut up an onion. Put the onion slices into a bowl of water and place the bowl of onion water in the middle of the kitchen. If your entire house smells bad, consider placing bowls of onion water in different locations of the house. Let the bowls sit overnight to absorb the odors.

, Use bread and vinegar to absorb the smell. Fill a saucepan with water and add 2 cups of vinegar. Bring the vinegar water to a boil, then allow to simmer for 15 minutes. Take some bread and dip it in the vinegar water. Put the bread on a plate and let it absorb the odors.You can simply put out bowls of vinegar to absorb the odors. Heat the vinegar to make it more effective.

, Baking soda is a powerful odor absorbent, especially for kitchen smells. To clear the burned smell, put about four ounces (118.29 mL) of baking soda into bowls. Distribute the bowls around your kitchen and other areas of your home to absorb the smell."

Create a fresh baking smell.,
Spray lemon water.,
Make an air freshener with essential oils.,
Bring out some aerosols.",How to Remove the Smell of Burnt Food from Your Home3," Preheat the oven to 200°F (93°C). Put aluminum foil on a cookie sheet. Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the cookie sheet along with a one tablespoon (14.78 mL) butter. Turn off the oven and let the cookie sheet sit in the oven for 2-4 hours. This will make the house smell like you've just baked something tasty., Pour equal parts lemon juice and water into a spritzer bottle. Spray it around your home as needed. It will absorb the odors and leave a natural, chemical-free lemon scent.

, Combine ¾ cup (177.44 mL) of water and two tablespoons (29.57 mL) of vodka, rubbing alcohol, or real vanilla extract with 15-20 drops of any combination of essential oils that you enjoy smelling. Put these in an eight ounce (236.58 mL) spray bottle. Shake well and spray as needed., If you can tolerate them, spray a commercial air freshener like Lysol, Febreeze, Glade, etc. Use these carefully, because they can be overwhelming. They will mask odors more than the homemade methods.

Clean the area of any dirt or debris.,
Select an enzymatic cleaning solution.,
Use your nose or a UV flashlight to find the urine.",How to Remove Urine Odor from Concrete1," If there is residue stuck to the floor, such as old carpet adhesive, remove it with a scraper.Starting off with a clean floor means you won't create a muddy mess when you start adding the cleaning chemicals, nor will you drive any of the grime down into the porous surface of the concrete.


Remove any furniture that might get in the way or could be harmed by the harsh chemicals you will be using.;
, Urine contains uric acid crystals, which are insoluble and bond tightly with the surface--in this case, the hard, porous concrete. Regular cleaning agents like soap and water won't bind to the uric acid, so no matter how many times you clean the area, those crystals stay put.An enzymatic cleaner will break down the uric acid and finally release it from the concrete.


Even if you think the smell is gone after using conventional cleaning products, it will only take a little bit of moisture (even just a humid day) to revive the smell of urine. The presence of water causes the uric acid to release a gas, which creates a strong, foul odor.Look for enzymatic cleaners made especially for the removal of pet urine (you can even get one specifically for dogs or cats).

, A UV or blacklight can sometimes reveal the site of an old stain, which can be helpful if you've already washed the floor several times and there's no visual sign of the urine. Turn off the lights in the room and hold the UV light one to three feet from the floor. The stain may show up as a yellow, blue, or green mark. Use a piece of chalk to mark the spot if you only plan to spot-treat the floor.If the UV light doesn't work, you can also try smelling out the spot. Air the room out and then simply sniff the room until you've zeroed in on the area.Though you probably want to pay extra attention to these spots, possibly treating them more than once, it is recommended you treat the entire floor so you don't miss any spots that didn't show up under the UV light.Treating the entire floor will also keep your floor from appearing spotty--if the treatment causes the concrete to lighten and appear cleaner, it will look better if the entire floor is a clean and uniform shade."
"
Place a pot of kitty litter in the space where the odor is.,
Use herbal sachets to cover up the odor.,
Use whole cloves.,
Use the sunshine.",How to Remove the Odor of Mothballs," Leave for a few days. Remove and test for odor. If it remains, put the kitty litter back for a bit longer.;
, These can be made at home using dried herbs. A good one will include cedar chips, lavender, bay leaf, rosemary, and patchouli.

, These can be inserted into the pockets of clothing and bags or can be placed into sachets and hung from coat hangers.

, For items such as books and clothing that have been stored in a chest with mothballs, try leaving in the sunshine and fresh air for a few days to improve the odor. Be careful of fading, however, and don't use direct sunlight if this is a possibility.

Purchase a heavy duty-cleaner like trisodium phosphate (TSP).,
Pour the TSP mixture onto the floor and use a broom to lightly scrub the area.,
Pour hot water over the treated area and use a wet/dry vacuum or shop vac to vacuum up all the liquid.",How to Remove Urine Odor from Concrete2," A heavy-duty cleaner will ensure that all the all the other elements of the urine (like the bacteria) are completely removed and the enzymatic cleaner can work faster to dissolve the uric crystals.Make sure you wear protective goggles and rubber gloves, as TSP can damage your skin.


Mix TSP in a bucket of very hot water at a ratio of 1/2 cup for every 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.If you don't want to use a heavy-duty chemical like TSP, try cleaning with a water and vinegar mixture (2 parts vinegar to 1 part water) instead., Work in small increments (about 3x3 feet). It is important you do not allow the TSP to dry out too quickly. It should sit wet on the surface of the concrete for at least 5 minutes.If the mixture dries before 5 minutes have passed, add more TSP mixture or water to the area. The longer it remains wet, the deeper the mixture can penetrate the concrete.


You will probably notice the urine smell grows very strong as you pre-treat the floor. This is a normal reaction of the uric acid crystals and the water.

, This will remove much of the spent TSP solution. Then rinse the floor with hot water twice more and allow the floor to dry naturally overnight.Don't use fans to speed the process along--your goal is still to saturate the concrete and loosen up as much of the urine residue as possible.
If you find your vacuum smells like urine after sucking up the TSP mixture, spray the hose with the enzymatic cleaner (diluted to 1 part concentrate to 30 parts water) while the machine is running. Then turn the machine off and spray the inside of the dirty water tank.If you use a carpet cleaner, add water to the tank instead of pouring water on the ground and run it in a rinse/removal cycle."
"
Prepare the enzymatic concentrate according to the instructions.,
Saturate the area with the enzymatic cleaner.,
Allow the floor to dry overnight once you have finished your treatment.,
Consider sealing your concrete floor once the smell has truly been eliminated.",How to Remove Urine Odor from Concrete3," Some cleaners must be mixed with a carpet cleaning solution, while others just require the addition of water. Follow all instructions carefully, and be sure you don't dilute the concentrate by adding too much water.


Make sure the floor is entirely dry from the pre-cleansing the day before before you begin applying the enzymatic cleaner.

, You want to work in small sections of about 3x3 feet. Use enough of the solution that there is standing water on the area for at least 10 minutes. Add more solution if the area begins to dry out--again, it is essential the liquid permeate every layer and ever pore of the cement so it can break down the uric crystals.For easier application, use a clean deck or household sprayer. Using a dirty sprayer will cause whatever residue (like mildew or dirt) to be sprayed into the absorbent concrete and may result in another bad smell.Be especially aggressive in areas where you noted the urine stain with the UV light. You may want to get a scrub brush and use that to really work the enzymatic cleaner into those areas.The most heavily marked areas may bubble. Take note of these areas, as you may need to treat them again if the smell persists.Repeat the process until you have treated the entire floor.

, To prolong this process and give the enzymatic solution more time to work, you can cover the floor with a plastic tarp. This will slow the evaporation rate of the solution.If the smell persists, treat any of the heavily soiled areas with another round of enzymatic cleaner.

, This will make your floors much easier to clean in the future and usually looks more attractive.

Check for a gas leak.,
Keep good housekeeping practices.,
Use air fresheners.,
Clean up your kitchen area.,
Take out your garbage.,
Clean up your critters.,
Do your laundry!,
Clean your carpets.,
Remove mold and mildew.,
De-clutter.,
Improve air quality.,
Remove smoke odors.",How to Rid Your House of Odors," Is it a strong (especially sudden) ""rotten eggs"" smell? Heating and cooking gases such as propane and natural gas contain a noxious scent, in order to indicate a possible leak. This is a potentially dangerous situation. If this is a possibility:


Have all people exit the living quarters immediately.
Open windows and doors to ventilate.
Check for any obvious sources, such as a gas burner that is not but is not lit.
If possible, turn off propane or natural gas sources.
Call the gas company, your landlord, or repairman as soon as feasible.
Sewer gasses can smell similar, although not identical to natural gas. This may happen due to an issue with a toilet or other plumbing issues.;
, More typically, bad odors arise from simply not cleaning. Regular cleaning tends to keep these at low or undetectable levels. Clean, spotless houses usually smell pretty good, too -- although even good housekeepers can end up with unfortunate, smelly situations.

, Air fresheners are a ""band-aid"" rather than a cure for bad odors. However, that may still be desirable. This is best for temporary situations, such as someone leaving bad odors in your bathroom after using the toilet.


Covering up a stink with an air freshener may not eliminate the stink. You could end up with the smell of flowers and ripe dirty socks, which may not really be an improvement!
If possible, choose an odor neutralizing air freshener like Febreze rather than one that only perfumes the air.
Air fresheners (such as Lysol) that kill bacteria do not actually clean the air. They still essentially act as a cover-up odor.
Asthmatics and those with chemical sensitivities often react very strongly to air fresheners.
Natural air fresheners can help freshen without resorting to harsh chemicals. Try a bouquet of fragrant flowers, some essential oils, or a simmering pot of cinnamon sticks and orange peels on the stove.

, Rotting food is a huge source of nasty smells. These may arise from:


Refrigerator: spoiled food will cause bad odors.
Counter tops: especially if food or beverages are left out.
Sinks: If dirty dishes are left out, they tend to smell over time. Also, if in-sink disposals are not tended to, they tend to get bad smells.

, If your house smells like garbage, chances are good that it is your kitchen trashcan. Ideally, take out the garbage every day. In hot and humid weather, garbage will start to smell bad quicker than in cool and dry conditions.


You may have to clean or replace your garbage can. Over time, the receptacle may get rather filthy and smell as bad as the stuff in the bag.
Garbage bags have been developed with odor reducing material, and even scents. While these can be helpful, they do not eliminate odor.

, Pets are often a large source of odors. They do not tend to be distressed by their own odors--often the opposite!--but humans will usually readily pick up on animal odors. These sources tend to be:


Feces & urine: Whether from a young puppy or elderly dog, clean up any messes. Any messes on carpets or upholstery may call for a deep cleaning. Litter boxes should be cleaned daily, no matter how good the kitty litter.
Cages: Caged animals, such as hamsters, mice, or birds require regular cleaning. Just cleaning the litter may not be enough; the cage may need sanitizing weekly to cut down on animal smells.
Tanks: Fish, frogs, and other aquatic creatures require very clean environments. If your tank has a distinct odor, your filtration system or cleaning regimen may not be up to snuff. Also, consider the ventilation in your house. The humidity from your aquarium, for example, may be causing a mildew problem in your basement apartment.
Furry animals need grooming. Regular brushing, trimming, washing, and otherwise tending to your animal's cleanliness will help your home smell less like animals.
Vacuum carpet surfaces regularly. Your pet may not like the vacuum, but regularly cleaning carpets clean up fur, dander, and other pet odors. Using baking soda or carpet powders in moderation can also help.
Neuter your pet. Animals who do not experience heat cycles or elevated hormone levels also tend to smell less strongly.

, Fabrics tend to hold onto odors more than hard surfaces. Therefore, if your house is smelling bad, an easy step is to clean the washable fabrics in your house. A small scoop of baking soda in the detergent may be a good idea. Fabrics to be washed include:


Clothing: piles of unwashed socks, underwear, workout clothes, and so forth will smell especially bad. Athletic gear in particular needs to be washed promptly.
Bedding: Sheets, blankets, pillowcases and so forth will start to take on body odors after a while. You may well not notice them, but it is there.
Curtains: Smoke and mildew odors tend to linger in curtains.
Towels: Wet towels that are not dried promptly will start to reek in a few days. Wet towels should always be hung up to dry. Do not leave wet towels on the floor, or even worse, a bed. If a towel needs laundering, and it will not be done within a day or so, it should be dried and NOT put in a laundry basket.
Shoes: These are in the category of fabric, even though they are often made of leather or other non-fabric material. Whatever they are made of, shoes are often a major cause of stinky odors. Wash your shoes, if possible. Use odor-controlling insoles, powders, or devices. If your shoes become wet, be sure they dry completely...not left in your gym bag!

, Carpets and rugs are usually fabric, although most cannot be simply thrown in the washing machine.


Clean up messes promptly, with a carpet spot cleaner. If your puppy messes on the carpet, or you stepsister spills her juice on the carpet, do not let it sit there for any length of time.
Vacuum regularly. Vacuums clean up particles that lead to bad smells.
Use baking soda and vacuum powders with caution. These do an excellent job reducing odors. However, they work because they leave a portion behind. In time, your carpet may become filled with a white ""dandruff"" that while it smells good, is actually filthy.
Shampoo your carpets. Once or twice a year, or as necessary, shampoo your carpets. In many areas stores offer reasonable rates on rental units, if you do not want to buy your own. A deep cleaning of carpets is the best assurance that your carpets do not smell.
Replace carpets when it is time. A good quality carpet today can last 25 years or more. But if your carpet is old and hopelessly stained, it can become a source of odors as well as a health risk, especially for asthmatics.

, High moisture areas--especially with poor ventilation--run the risk of developing mold. Mold is usually black, and often has a musty smell. Although bathrooms and damp basements are the most common areas mold develops, it can happen anywhere that is damp.


A bleach solution is mildew's worst enemy. Most mold cleaners use bleach to attack mildew. You can make your own bleach solution, although sometimes a scouring cleaner or one bought at a store is preferable. Use as directed, with plenty of ventilation.
Ventilate the area as much as possible; mold requires a wet environment. Use the bathroom fan and open the window when possible.
Serious cases of ""black mold"" can be a bio-hazard that may require professional removal. Most larger home improvement stores offer test kits to determine if that stain is simply mildew or a potentially more serious issue.

, Clutter, by itself, does not cause odors. However, when homes are full of boxes, totes, piles of stuff, and so on, it becomes increasingly difficult to clean. When cleaning becomes unnecessarily frustrating, it tends to happen less and less often. But it is also not unusual for smells to occur because:


Cluttered rooms offer vermin places to hide and thrive. Mice, cockroaches, rats, and so on love having quiet areas with plenty of places to hide. Also, if the kitchen offers plenty of food to get into, it becomes the ideal situation for pests. Vermin defecate, and occasionally die in houses, causing horrible odors.
Clutter can also harbor mold. A humid summer may cause water to be trapped in your piles of stuff. That can cause mold to grow, and potentially smell.

, Fresh, clean air in your home is important in controlling odors. Look into:


Open the windows. If possible, get fresh air inside by opening the windows on fair weather days.
Use a dehumidifier. Dehumidifiers remove moisture from the air, reducing smells and help prevent mold growth.
Use air conditioning. Your home air conditioning unit also removes moisture from the air, and can help cut down on smells.
Check your ventilation. Inadequate or broken ventilation systems in your home can cause excess moisture, and therefore, smells.
Use dehumidifying crystals for small areas. These are basically giant-sized versions of desiccant packets. They often come in tubs or other containers. These items remove moisture from the area in small places with limited ventilation, such as a closet, under a sink, or in a RV. In America, Damp Rid is commonly available in home improvement stores.

, Whether you smoke, or you had a small fire, smoke is a pungent and hard to remove smell. In general, you will follow much as the same advice as above:


Wash and clean fabrics.
Vacuum carpets.
Air out the space as much as possible.
Try an air purifier to remove smoke particles from air.
Wash your walls. A multipurpose cleaner, used as directed, can greatly help smoke odors. A cleaner such as TSP does an even better job, and is available in most home improvement and hardware stores in America.
Repaint your walls. A fresh coat of latex paint will often remove a lot of smoke odor from home interiors.

The acidity in lime will help to break down the essential oils that cause the lingering curry smell. Finish by washing with soap and water as usual.Be sure to avoid open cuts or wounds on the skin as this can cause painful stinging or burning.
Avoid putting on any of the same clothing articles that were used while cooking, for instance a heat or sweater.;
, You can try using air diffusers, air deodorizing sprays, plug-ins, or scented candles. Also of great use are air fresheners that allow you to spray on fabrics. Spray all items that are in the cooking vicinity until damp, such as the carpet, upholstery, drapes or walls.A combination of many products will work well.
Be sure to carefully read instructions on the packaging label to ensure proper use.

, Put two cups of water in a pot on the stove and bring it to a boil. Add fragrant materials such as Kewra (Screwpine) leaves or vanilla beans/extract, and turn the heat down to a simmer.

Microbial agents have live bacteria that eat odor-causing microorganisms and claim to remove harsh odors from your home., Whether using vinegar or a microbial solution, spray everything including walls, cabinets, the carpet, the ceiling, grease traps, and draperies. Pay especially close attention to areas of built-up grease where the odor tends to permeate.Before spraying, test for color fastness, or make sure a fabric will retain its color. Spray a small amount of mixture on an inconspicuous area of fabric. Wait a few minutes and blot with a napkin. Note any changes to the fabric, or any color rubbing off onto the napkin.Avoid spraying around electronics and electrical outlets.
Check your filter’s instructions to see if they are washable. They may be able to be washed in the solution while others will need to be washed in soap and water. Still, others may need to be replaced and can be purchased at your local hardware store.

, Drain vents can often clog, causing odors to continue to saturate your residence. The microbial agents will help to clear the plumbing and eliminate odors.Follow instructions on the bottle’s label regarding how much to pour and how often.

, If the smell doesn’t go away immediately spray your solution and air out your home once a week. This allows the microbes to remain alive and to continue to break down the odor-trapping grease.


If the smell still remains after 4 cycles, try combining with other odor-removal methods."

Try steam cleaning your carpet and upholstery.,
Opt for an ozone generator to destroy molecules.,
Opt for a photocatalytic air purifying process.,
Repaint your walls.",How to Remove a Lingering Curry Odor3," There are professional carpet cleaners who will come to your home and steam clean carpet and upholstery, or you can purchase or rent steam cleaning machines to do the job yourself. Stores offer cleaning solutions that are specifically formulated for odor removal, or you can try other solutions such as Oxyclean, vinegar or bleach.Do not steam clean for at least a month if you are using a microbial solution. Use the solution for 4 cycles before steam cleaning.
Avoid using regular vacuums and cleaners such as baking soda or carpet shampoos because it doesn’t clean down to the carpet pads where odors could be trapped.
Professional carpet cleaning costs vary greatly because it depends on the size of the home and how many rooms you will be cleaning. Overall, you can expect to pay an average of $51 per room. Some companies may also charge by the square foot.Steam cleaner rentals usually have an hourly minimum for rental, but also allow you to rent per day. You can find the cleaner and products at your local hardware store., Ozone (O3) is a reactive particle which chemically attracts and reacts with molecules in the air and on surfaces. The oxygen in ozone chemically changes the structure of the molecule to eliminate the odor.You can purchase ozone generators online or at your local hardware store for anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars.Instructions usually suggest to let the generator run for an hour in a closed room, but you can allow it to run for 3-4 hours.Ozone is effective in removing odors because as a gas, it is able to penetrate anywhere that air can go: walls, ceilings, vents, carpets, upholstery fibers and more.
You can read online consumer reviews that discuss various features of ozone generators such as cost, size, noise, durability, and effectiveness.Ozone generators are typically purchased for places where ozone is needed, such as places where there is gaseous pollution (like the smell of curry). They should not be used to remove allergens, as they have been known to cause greater health issues., Contact a company that has machines that use an Advanced Photocatalytic Oxidation (APO) process. This process utilizes air and water to create vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and reactive hydroxyl particles. This process cleans both air and surfaces in a home. Not only does it clean, but it breaks down compounds which hold odors.Most homes can be completed in 12 hours or less and clients, furniture, clothing, and rugs can remain in the home.
You can also purchase photocatalytic air purifiers that use the same technology to zap odor-causing particles.Purifiers and filters can be found online for about $200., Use turpentine to break down grease from kitchen surfaces. Then, strip the current paint off your walls by grinding, applying heat, or using chemicals. Next, apply an odor blocking and sealing primer which will both keep current odors from seeping out, and keep new odors from penetrating the paint.Lastly, choose your paint and mix in additives that have been known to block odors such as vanilla or chemical additives.


To remove grease, mix equal parts turpentine, linseed oil, and white vinegar, and use a light cloth to wipe the grease off kitchen surfaces. There is no need to rinse when done. Simply allow to dry and buff with a cloth.Turpentine can often have a noxious smell so be sure to use in a well-ventilated area, and use rubber gloves and a mask to protect yourself, and line your work area with cloth or cardboard.
When mixing additives to your paint, add two tablespoons of vanilla extract to every gallon of paint.Or, you can mix in odorless additives (found at your local hardware or paint store) that actually remove odors, as opposed to just blocking them."

Use this method for the best results.,
If the dog's eyes are red, flush them with cool water.,
Purchase an enzyme cleaner for skunk odor removal.,
Apply the product according to instructions.",How to Remove Skunk Odor from Dogs1," Home cleaning remedies can be excellent, cheap solutions to many problems. Skunk spray, however, is one of the strongest and most stubborn smells you are likely to encounter. Spending money on a specialized cleaning product is recommended for permanent odor removal, without without any undesirable side effects.


If you are not able to make a trip to the drugstore immediately, trying a different method first may be worth it, since the odor will be easiest to remove if you try as soon as possible. Light, indirect skunk sprays may also be removable with cheaper home remedies.;
, If the dog has red, irritated eyes, it may be suffering from painful skunk spray in the face.Apply cool, clean water to the eyes by pouring from a cup, squirting with a turkey baster, or pouring from a gentle hose without any attachments to the end.

, Be sure to purchase a pet-safe ""enzyme based"" or ""enzymatic"" cleaning product for skunk odor removal. Unlike other commercial odor removal products, enzyme cleaners actually break down and permanently remove the odor-causing substances, instead of just masking the smell under a stronger one.


Do not use a skunk odor removal product that does not specifically state it is safe for use on pets.

, Many of these products can be applied as a spray directly on the dog's fur, but check the packaging instructions first. There is usually no need to use water or soap, as the enzymes will remain on the fur while dry and break down the odor over the course of a couple hours.


Avoid spraying the dog's eyes or nose. If the smell is strong in the face, wet a cloth with the cleaning product and gently wipe the cheeks, forehead, and chin.
If the dog has long fur and received a direct hit from the skunk spray, the odor may be trapped deeper in the coat. Use a cloth soaked in the cleaning solution to rub the dog's fur right down to the skin.

Be aware of the risks.,
Put on old clothes and gloves.,
Flush irritated eyes with cool water.,
Mix a homemade odor removal mix.,

Use an old sponge to apply to the face (if necessary).,
Rinse thoroughly within a couple minutes.,
Repeat until odor is removed (if necessary).",How to Remove Skunk Odor from Dogs2," This is probably the most effective home remedy, but there are significant downsides. Hydrogen peroxide can dry out your dog's skin and fur, burn your dog's eyes, or even bleach the dog's fur to a slightly lighter color. These risks are minimal if the solution is applied correctly, but you may wish to use a safer method on an uncooperative dog that will take a long time to wash.


Some people find this method quite effective, especially when applied multiple times. However, for a direct skunk spray or a thick-coated dog, you may need a commercial cleaning product to remove the last vestiges of the smell.

, Skunk odor can easily rub off onto clothing. Put on disposable gloves and some old clothing before you begin treating your dog.


You can often remove skunk odor from clothing in the laundry, by mixing ½ cup (120 mL) of baking soda mixed with ordinary laundry detergent.Using clothes you don't mind throwing away if necessary is still recommended, just in case. Do not mix ""skunked"" clothing with an ordinary load of laundry.

, Pour clean, cool water over the dog's eyes if they are red and irritated from skunk spray. A turkey baster or garden hose without attachments may be helpful if the dog is shying away from the water., Mix together ¼ cup (60 mL) baking soda, 2 tsp (10 mL) dish washing soap, and 4 cups (960 mL) 3% hydrogen peroxide.If you do not have these materials, you may find them at a drugstore, or baking soda at a grocery store. This needs to be mixed directly before use, as it will quickly break down if left alone.


Double this recipe for a large dog.
If you only have more concentrated hydrogen peroxide, dilute it with additional water before adding to the other ingredients. For example, mix one part 9% hydrogen peroxide with two parts water to get 3% hydrogen peroxide. Stir thoroughly, then use 4 cups (960 mL) of this mixture in the above recipe.

, If weather and space permit, tie the dog up outside in a washtub. Skunk odor can easily spread to furniture, but if you need to wash the dog inside, lay down old towels or newspaper around the tub to make cleanup easier in case the dog struggles or jumps out.

, Wearing your disposable gloves, pour a little of the mix at a time on the dog, and massage it into the dog's fur, as though you were shampooing it. Start at the collar and work back to the tail. Keep the dog dry, as the hydrogen peroxide is less effective when wet., If the face smells of skunk, tilt the dog's chin upward, so the liquid will run back to his neck, not forward into his eyes. Apply the peroxide with an old sponge, carefully, to the dog's chin, cheeks, forehead, and ears, but do not apply near eyes and nose.Optionally, you can protect the dog's ears by gently putting a cotton ball in each ear.Do not push them in far or jam them in hard. Some dogs (and people) dislike the feeling of liquid in their ears, so this may cause the dog to struggle less.

, Hydrogen peroxide may bleach your dog's fur slightly if left on too long, but it needs to be given some time to break down the skunk odor. Although this mixture is dilute, it should not be left on for longer than four minutes to reduce the chance of this happening.Hopefully, you will notice the smell lessen during this time.

, If you notice the smell has considerably decreased, but is not completely gone, let the dog dry out and apply the same mixture again. If the odor is not significantly reduced, however, you may be better off trying a commercial pet-safe skunk odor remover, or another home remedy.

"
Use vinegar instead of hydrogen peroxide.,
Use a scented pet shampoo to temporarily hide the scent.,
Trim long fur to remove trapped scent.",How to Remove Skunk Odor from Dogs3," White vinegar or apple cider vinegar can be mixed with baking soda and dishwashing soap, instead of hydrogen peroxide. This may be less effective, but does not have the risk of bleaching your dog's fur. Follow the instructions for hydrogen peroxide above, except where noted below:


Vinegar will fizz immediately when mixed with baking soda, and quickly break apart. You may wish to rub the baking soda into the dog's fur, then pour on the vinegar.

, Massaging with scented pet shampoo will not remove the skunk oil permanently, but it may hide it temporarily. It is only useful as a short-term solution, unless you are willing to reapply it regularly. Skunk odor can take weeks to dissipate naturally, and may rub off onto clothing and furniture, so this is not recommended as a long-term solution.


Tomato juice is not significantly more effective than scented shampoo, makes a mess, and can even stain your dog's fur slightly.Despite its popularity as a home remedy, it is not a good solution to skunk odor.

From there, let your nose guide you to where the smell is strongest.You may have to do some investigating if the animal didn’t perish out in plain sight. Check in places like:Behind walls (you may have to cut a few holes)
Under floor boards
Under or behind insulation
Under piles of debris
Near warm air vents or heat sources
Close to plumbing or water sources;
, What you do with the body will depend on the local bylaws in your municipality, but your options include burying, burning, and throwing the body in the trash. Don’t touch the animal directly: either wear gloves or use a shovel to move the carcass around.


If you can bury the animal, place it in a compostable bag and then into a small box. Consult area maps or your local zoning office to be sure you aren't going to hit any pipes or water lines. Dig a hole three to four feet deep, place the box at the bottom, and fill the hole back in.Your municipality might allow burning, in which case you can burn the body on a bonfire.
To dispose of the body in the garbage, wrap the body in newspaper, then double bag it in sealable plastic bags before throwing it in the trash.
You may also be able to call an animal control service to pick up the body, or you may be able to drop the carcass off for them to dispose of.

, With gloves on, use a rag or paper towels to pick up any leftover fur, juices, or anything else left behind by the animal. Spray the area with an enzymatic cleaner, which will break down the organic materials and eliminate diseases and odors.Let the solution sit for 10 to 15 minutes before wiping the area with a clean rag and disposing of the rags and waste.Enzymatic cleaners include:


Ultrazyme
Multi-zyme
EmPower Foam
Nature’s Miracle
Fizzion

, Any fabrics that were contaminated by the dead animal—such as curtains, clothes, linens, or other materials—should be sanitized and cleaned as well. The best way to do this is with your washing machine. Be sure to use hot water, and to your regular cycle add one cup (240 ml) of either:Hydrogen peroxide
Vinegar
Pine-Sol

, Sometimes, animals die in areas that are difficult to clean, such as on top of insulation. If this is the case, remove the material that cannot be properly cleaned and replace it.

, If the animal died in an inaccessible place—such as inside a wall—you may not be able to remove the body to get rid of the odor. The time it takes for decomposition and the smell to dissipate will depend on the size of the animal, the temperature, and the humidity, but it could take several weeks or even months.


Locate the general vicinity of the source of the smell.
If necessary and possible, drill a few holes to open up the area where the animal is (such as under floorboards or behind a wall) so that you can treat the area with a disinfectant or odor eliminator.
Use a strong odor eliminator or disinfectant in the area. You can do this by spraying a product like Bac-Azap into the holes or hanging Earth Care Odor Remover Bags or Smelleze around.Replace the bags as necessary or continue spraying the eliminating spray until the decomposition has finished.
Plug up the holes once the smell is gone.

, Whether you’ve removed the source of the smell or you're waiting it out, ventilation is key to freshening the air and helping eliminate bad odors.


Open as many windows as possible in the area to get the air moving.
Set up a few fans to blow air from inside the house out the windows. This is especially important if you can't remove the animal., There are many deodorizing products you can use to help neutralize and eliminate the smell that’s lingering in your home.

Store-bought aerosol sprays or mists, such as Lysol or Febreze
Scented candles
Essential oils in a diffuser, on cotton balls, or mixed with water or alcohol and poured into a mister or spray bottle
Incense
Hanging air fresheners
Cloth pouches filled with potent fresh herbs, such as rosemary and lavender.

, Animals can get in to your house through holes, cracks, vents, and other openings, and the best way to prevent them from getting inside and dying in your home is to cover these entry points. Be sure to cover holes larger than one half-inch (1.25 cm) in diameter, vents, chimneys, crawl spaces, gaps, and cracks.Use materials such as concrete, metal wire, and mortar, otherwise animals will chew through the materials to gain entry into your home.

, Animals will be more likely to come into your home if they are attracted to something outside it, such as food or water. To remove these attractants, you should:


Remove standing water from around your home
Clean up birdseed and pet food
Store garbage and compost in rodent-proof containersPick up fallen fruits and vegetables from the garden
Pick up pet droppings

, Piles of wood, trash, overgrown bushes, and overhanging branches can all be used by animals as either shelter or ways to access otherwise inaccessible parts of your home. Be sure to clean up debris from around your home and keep plants, trees, and grasses cut back and maintained.


For instance, a thicket of overgrown bushes might make a great place for a rodent to make a nest.
Branches hanging over your house might allow animals to access your home from the roof.
Similarly, debris, garbage, and organic matter piled up against your home could give animals access to higher entry points they wouldn’t be able to reach.

Benzene is a compound produced from paints, solvents, detergents, and some plastics. Good plants for filtering benzene include English ivy, Chinese evergreen, and snake plants.
Formaldehyde is a harmful chemical emitted from many building materials, including foam insulation and engineered wood products like plywood. Good houseplants for filtering formaldehyde include azalea, philodendron, pothos, and chrysanthemum.
Trichloroethylene is another harmful compound emitted from paints, varnishes, and solvents. It can be filtered effectively by Gerbera daisy, chrysanthemum, and Dracaena marginata.
Some plants filter the whole range of harmful chemicals, including ammonia and xylene as well as the above-mentioned compounds. These species include peace lily, florist's chrysanthemum, and snake plants.

Lay the futon out properly.,
Fold your futon when not in use.,
Air your futon whenever possible.,
Keep the floor clean.,
Wash the blankets and sheets as needed.",How to Maintain a Japanese Futon," Japanese futons usually come in sets that may include a foam pad (matto), a futon (shikibuton), sheets (shiitsu), blankets (mofu), a duvet (kakebuton) and a pillow (makura). The foam pad should be laid out first. Put the bottom sheet on the futon and lay this on the pad, followed by the sheet and any blankets you may want. If you use a duvet, use the cover that comes with it. One side will be made of mesh; this goes up.;
, Leaving your futon out during the day may allow mold or mites to grow underneath. The futon and pad should be folded in thirds (take care to make sure that only the underside of the futon touches the floor as you fold) and stacked neatly in a cupboard or the corner of the room. The blankets are folded in four and placed on top of the folded futon and pad, and then the pillow goes on top of everything.

, Hang it in the sunlight outdoors during a time of day when the air is relatively dry. This is said to kill anything that may be growing inside, such as fungus or mould, especially during humid times of the year. The fresh air also keeps it from smelling stale. Many people also use a beater (similar to what you would use on a carpet) to beat out dust and other material while airing.

, Futons are usually used on tatami flooring, which is slightly springy and quite a bit softer than hard floors. If possible, sleep in a room with tatami mat flooring or carpet. However, make sure not to walk in this room with your shoes on, and vacuum frequently. Clean tatami mats regularly.

, Though the practice is unusual, the futon itself can be washed if you have access to a double-size washing machine and dried in a very big drier if necessary (e.g. spills) or by hanging to dry. You can also bring it to a dry cleaners store (but call first to make sure they'll clean futons). Washing a futon in a washing machine can be an effective means of removing cat allergens."

Preferably, you will only be scraping small amounts of wax that remain after trying the previous methods to remove the largest chunks., A wide, plastic window scraper is the most ideal tool for the job. Work slowly and try to slide the scraper under the wax rather than cutting down into it.

This method is both more efficient for peeling off larger chunks and is less likely to cut into the glass., If you don’t have a scraper or if the edge isn’t sharp enough, a razorblade is your last resort.

The risk of damaging the surface is even greater so be very careful and try to keep the blade parallel to the surface to minimize scratching.

, It is a good idea to do this before inspecting the rest of the mattress, because the valve is a common source of leaks. Doing this first can save you a lot of time rather than searching for leaks using other methods since valves are a main source of leaks. Make sure that the valve plug is completely inserted into the valve stem.
For double locking valves, make sure that the valve stem has been completely pressed against the stop behind it.
If there is a problem with the valve, it is unlikely to be able to be patched. However, if the valve plug won't seal against the valve stem you can try inserting a thin piece of plastic for a quick fix.
If the valve plug is completely inserted into the valve stem, and the valve stem is completely pressed into the stop behind it, you are ready to look for a leak in the mattress itself.

If that doesn't work, try rubbing alcohol.,
Use acetone or nail polish remover if the stain persists.,
Purchase a whiteboard cleaning solution if necessary.,
Be skeptical of other solutions.",How to Remove Permanent Pen from a Whiteboard," Choose a black dry erase marker, or the darkest color you own. Cover the permanent ink completely with the dry erase ink, which contains a solvent that may dissolve the stain. Give it a few seconds to dry, then erase with a paper towel or clean white board eraser.If the white board or eraser are not reasonably clean (apart from the permanent ink), this method may leave smudges. These can be removed with any of the steps described below.
You may repeat this method until the ink stain is fully removed. If you see no sign that the ink is coming off after two attempts, try one of the steps below.;
, Most inks are made liquid by an alcohol solution. Fill a spray bottle or dampen a cloth with a small amount of 70% isopropyl alcohol or 100% ethyl alcohol. Place the whiteboard in a location with good air flow, and apply the alcohol over the stain. Wipe the board dry with a dry, clean, non-abrasive cloth, using a circular motion to loosen the ink.Rinse the whiteboard with a slightly damp paper towel, then dry with a second towel or cloth.


Warning: pure alcohol is flammable. Keep away from heat and ignition sources.
Plenty of household products contain alcohol and can be used for this purpose. If you don't have rubbing alcohol, try using hand sanitizer, hair spray, aftershave, or perfume. Avoid products that contain coloring or feel sticky to the touch.

, If none of the above methods work, use acetone or nail polish remover, which contains mostly acetone. This is a harsh chemical that creates dangerous, flammable fumes, so always work in an area with good air flow. Apply to the stain with a cloth, rub clean, then rinse the board with water and dry. This may cause damage to whiteboards with a lacquer finish or a wooden frame, but is one of the most effective methods for removing stains.If acetone gets on your eye, immediately wash your eye under lukewarm, gently flowing water for 15 minutes. Hold your eyelid open and do not stop to remove contact lenses.Acetone on your skin should be washed off for 5 minutes, but is unlikely to cause harm beyond irritation.

, Many of these solutions are little more than rubbing alcohol, but much more expensive. If your white board won't respond to any of the above treatments, purchase a high quality cleaning product recommended by white board manufacturers, such as MB10W Whiteboard Cleaner., Some people report success with an abrasive cleaner such as baking soda, toothpaste, scouring powders, or harsher chemicals. While this may remove the stain, it could also damage the white board surface, making future dry erase ink harder to erase. Many ammonia-based household cleaning products such as Windex are suitable for daily cleaning, but not recommended for heavy application.While soapy water or white vinegar will remove light stains, they are unlikely to get rid of any marks your dry erase marker cannot."

When most of the ink has been dissolved, wash your skin off with soap and a bit of warm water and pat dry.





;
, Hand sanitizer contains a good amount of alcohol, which works to thin and erase the ink from a permanent marker stain. Squirt out some hand sanitizer onto your hand, and then rub it onto the marking on your skin using a circular motion. Doing this for 15-30 seconds should cause the marker to dissolve slowly, mixing in with the sanitizer. Rinse your skin off with warm water, and repeat the process until all the ink has been removed.







, Similar to hand sanitizer, insect repellent contains isopropyl alcohol, which dissolves permanent marker ink. Spray on a heavy amount of bug spray over the marker and use your finger or tissue to rub it into your skin. Continue spraying on the repellant and rubbing the marker stain until it dissolves completely, then wash your skin with soap and water.







, Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol is nearly guaranteed to get rid of your permanent marker stain.Simply pour some rubbing alcohol directly onto the stain or a rag, and use your fingertips or a rag to rub it onto the marker stain.

Wipe away any excess egg easily removed.,
Spray water toward the egg stain.,
Test an area first.",How to Wash Egg off a House1," Act fast. The quicker you remove the egg from the side of your house, the better off you will be. When egg dries, the stains become more stubborn, although still removable.


In particular, you want to make sure that you get rid of any pieces of shell fastened to the house. Try to get rid of any looser pieces of the egg that you can easily remove.
Due to their high moisture content, eggs remove somewhat easily when the egging is fresh. Prepare cleaning supplies as soon as you notice that your house has been egged.
You could also use a dull knife to scrape off excess egg stains. Or you could use a cloth or soft-bristled brush. Wipe away any egg that you can easily see. Be aware that some residue will likely remain.;
, Take a hose, power sprayer, or pressure washer, and direct a stream of water at the remaining egg stain.


The water pressure in the hose will help remove some of lingering egg residue. You don’t want to scratch the house while removing the egg, which is why it’s important to hose off or remove any loose shells.
Wash the egg downward. Wet the area beneath the egg before you do so, so that it doesn’t stick as it is washed downward. Avoid using hot water on the egg at any time because it could actually cook the egg enough that it will become harder to remove from the side of your house.
Put the hose on low pressure, and use warm water if possible. Try not to use a high-pressure hose, because this can move the egg to other areas of the house. You can buy or rent pressure washers at local hardware stores.

, If the remainder of the egg stain doesn’t entirely come off with the water spraying, you’re going to need to apply a cleaning solution to your house siding.


By testing a small area of the stain first, you can see if the cleaning solution is removing any of the paint.
There are times that you will need to repaint the area that was egged. However, you may be able to remove the egg without causing that issue.
Most cleaning procedures work for aluminum or vinyl siding, although more unique sidings like stucco can require a more intense cleaning process."

Soak the egg stain.,
Mix laundry detergent in water.,
Try an all-purpose household cleaner.,
Use white vinegar.",How to Wash Egg off a House2," Especially if the egg stain is old, it might be congealed and harder to remove. Soaking the egg stain makes it easier to get it off with chemicals.


If you have light siding, you could dab hydrogen peroxide on the stain first to weaken it. If your paint is a darker color, don’t use this, though, because it is a bleaching agent.
With darker stains, you should try non-bleach laundry detergent and water to loosen up the stain before you try to completely remove it.You could also soak your rag in the cleaning agent you choose, and blot the stain with it, in order to loosen it. Leave whatever chemical you apply to the stain on it for a few minutes before moving to the next step.

, This is one of the most common ways to remove egg stains from a house.


Take 1 cup of non-bleach laundry detergent, and put it in a bucket of warm water. If the egg has already dried, the stain will be more stubborn and probably require detergent. You could also try using dish soap or even shampoo. You want to choose a gentle cleaner that doesn’t have bleach in it.
Take a scrubbing brush with bristles, and dip it into the soapy water. Scrub the egg gently with the warm soapy water.
Rinse the area. Once you’ve scrubbed the egg-covered area with the soap-and-water-mixture, rinse it off with the hose or pressure washer. Repeat the process if it’s needed.

, Instead of detergent and water, you could use an all-purpose household cleaner, but make sure to choose one that is alkaline-based.Alkaline-based cleaners will get rid of the egg stains more effectively by dissolving the fats in them. Formula 409, Zep, and Simple Green are examples of household cleaners that are alkaline based.
As with the detergent, put the cleaner in warm water, and gentle scrub the stain. Then, rinse the area to get rid of the remaining cleaner and egg.
When using alkaline cleaners, take care to wear gloves and eye protection, and read the label to avoid any irritation to your skin. Use a cleaner recommended for removing organic, high protein matter like blood, grass or food., To give the cleaning solution more oomph, try adding some white vinegar into it. White vinegar is an effective, natural cleaning solution for many surfaces.Mix one cup of white vinegar into one cup of warm water. Put the mixture into a spray bottle that you’ve cleaned.
Spray the solution onto the egg stain. Make sure the stain is completely wet. Then, take a clean sponge, and soak it in hot water. Wipe the stain with the damp sponge.
You may need to remove some of the egg with a paint scraper if necessary, but be careful not to scratch or damage the paint. Consider soaking a terry cloth towel in the solution and holding it onto the egg stain for several minutes to loosen the stain."

Use a water hose, pressure washer or power sprayer. Put the pressure washer or power sprayer on a medium setting of between 2,000 and 3,000 PSI. Try using a cup of non-bleach laundry detergent in a gallon of hot water, and scrub the stain to remove it with a scrub brush, then spray with water again.
Mix a cup of non-bleach formula laundry detergent with a cup of talc, bentonite, or powdered silica into a gallon of hot water. These items are usually for sale in the local hardware or home improvement stores. Stir the concoction until it forms a thick paste known as a poultice solution.

, Once you have the poultice paste mixed, apply it liberally to the remaining egg stain.


Use a trowel to put the poultice on any remaining egg. The poultice solution should help dissolve the remaining egg stains in the stucco.
Once you are done, put plastic wrap over the poultice solution. It should completely cover it. Let it remain there for an hour.
Remove the plastic wrap. Spray the stucco with a water hose, power sprayer, or pressure washer.

, Maybe the pranksters hit your car as well as your house. Removing egg from cars is similar to removing eggs from a house.Remove the egg as quickly as you can.

Use the fabric for something else.",How to Remove Turmeric Stains," When it comes to turmeric stains, time is of the essence. Turmeric is used as a fabric dye in many parts of the world for a reason — once it sets in, it's very tricky to get out.As soon as you notice a stain on your clothing or fabric, immediately use a clean spoon to remove any excess turmeric that may be present. Then, rinse with water and dab with a towel. Treating with hand sanitizer and then rinsing may also be effective on less-porous surfaces. Resist the urge to rub or scrub, as this can spread the stain or grind it in.


Another traditional solution sometimes used to remove liquid turmeric stains is to pack absorbent powder (like flour, cornmeal, or baking soda) around the stain and allow it to sit. Within a few minutes, you should notice the powder soaking up some of the liquid, which allows it to safely be brushed away.;
, Pour a small dab of all-purpose liquid detergent directly onto the stain and scrub gently with a soft toothbrush or towel soaked with water. Scrub both sides of the fabric with detergent for several minutes (taking care not to wear a hole into the fabric), then let it sit for about 10 minutes to allow the detergent to soak in.


Don't scrub with a dry brush or towel — only use water and detergent. As noted above, rubbing with a dry tool can grind the turmeric into the fabric, making it even trickier to remove.

, Drop your garment or fabric into the washing machine and wash it on the hottest setting. Add the same type and amount of detergent as you normally would for the garment. Wash for one cycle on the hottest setting allowed on the item's care label.


If you have a load of similar clothing, you can also wash it with your stained garment to avoid wasting water.

, After your garment has finished washing, remove it and inspect the stain (serious stains may not yet have disappeared). If the weather outside is good, hang your clothing out to dry on a wire or drying rack in direct sunlight. The bleaching power of the sun is well-documented — in fact, in the past, it was one of the main ways people kept their whites white.Sun drying can help minimize turmeric stains on any color of garment. However, note that sun drying cause colored fabrics to fade slightly, so you may want to avoid using this technique for especially brightly-colored clothes.


Don't leave any sort of clothing or fabric (even whites) in the sun for days on end. This can accelerate the natural wear and tear of the fabric, leading to weakened fibers and a susceptibility to tearing.

, Turmeric stains can be remarkably persistent. While quickly pre-treating with detergent and washing your soiled garment or fabric is almost always a wise choice, it may not necessarily remove your stain on the first attempt. Be ready to repeat this cycle several times for the best results (or, as an alternative, try subbing in one of the home remedies below).

, One extra option that you have for treating white fabrics is bleach. This powerful, corrosive detergent can strip the color from fabric remarkably quickly, making it a great choice for removing turmeric from your whites. Try adding a few spoonfuls of bleach to a bucket of hot water and soaking your white clothes in this wash for about 15 minutes before sending them through the wash.


To be clear, you will probably not want to use this method for colored clothing. Exposure to bleach can cause bright colors to rapidly fade — in high doses, it can even remove the color entirely.
You will also want to avoid using bleach for silk, wool, or mohair, as it can permanently damage these fabrics. For white silks and wools, try using hydrogen peroxide, a milder alternative.

, One easy stain-removal trick uses the natural properties of everyday baking soda to beat tough turmeric stains. To try this method, scoop a few spoonfuls of baking soda into a small bowl, then add a small amount of water to make a thick, moist paste. Use a soft toothbrush or towel to scrub turmeric stains in fabric with the paste before running them through the wash. Alternatively, use the paste as a very mild abrasive to help take stains out of hard surfaces like kitchen counter tops.


Baking soda is a great cleaning agent for several reasons — it's crystal structure makes it mildly abrasive without making it damaging to most surfaces, its mild alkalinity allows it to cut through grease, and it's a natural deodorizer, which can be particularly useful even if won't remove your turmeric stain., Another easy home remedy for fighting stains (including those from turmeric) is white vinegar. Try mixing a tablespoon or two with about 1/2 cup of rubbing alcohol or 2 cups of warm water and dish soap, then soaking a rag and gently soaking a fresh turmeric stain. Blot with a dry cloth to absorb the liquid. Repeat for several minutes and allow to dry. Over several repetitions, you should notice the vinegar's natural acidity cause the stain to begin to fade.


Only use white vinegar — never red wine or balsamic. These alternatives can contain dyes that can cause their own tough-to-remove stains.

, Glycerin, also known as glycerine, is a natural chemical produced in the process of making soap and processing animal fat. It is often available at pharmacies and specialty stores for a small price. Mixed with ordinary dish soap and water, glycerin can make a powerful cleaning solution that's ideal for fighting even the worst stains. Try mixing about 1/4 cup of glycerin with 1/4 cup dish soap and 2 cups of water, then soaking a rag in this solution and gently rubbing (or, if you're dealing with fabric, dabbing) your turmeric stain to treat it.

, For surfaces like kitchen counter tops, stove tops, and floors, you don't have to be as gentle as you do with clothing and fabrics. In these cases, try accompanying any of the cleaning methods in this article with some mild abrasive action to help scour your stain away. Sponges, abrasive pads, brushes, and rags are all great tools for wiping or rubbing away turmeric stains on hard surfaces. Even abrasive pastes, like the baking soda one described above, can work well. Don't use harsh abrasives (like steel wool) or metal scrapers, however, as these can leave permanent scratches on the surface.


For extra cleaning power, try soaking the stain in a mixture of hot water and soap for five minutes before using your abrasive.
If you don't have one, you may want to try a ""magic eraser""-style cleaning sponge. These are usually available at grocery and department stores for a fairly affordable price and work with a microscopic abrasive action to effectively remove stains., Some home care experts swear by clear, bubbly, flavorless beverages like soda water or club soda when it comes to cleaning, while others claim they are no better than ordinary water. In fact, there is very little scientific evidence either way.However, because soda water is so mild, it definitely won't hurt any fabric, clothing, or surface that's stained with turmeric, so feel free to use it without worry. Try wetting a rag with soda water and using it to soak a fresh stain or pouring soda water on a stain on a hard surface, letting it soak for five minutes, then rubbing with a sponge or rag to lift the stain away.


Don't use tonic water or a clear soft drink — though they look identical to soda water, these liquids contain sugar, which can make a sticky mess when it dries.

, Sometimes, no matter how many times you soak, pre-treat, dry, wash, and repeat, you just can't remove a turmeric stain from your clothing. In this case, you don't necessarily have to throw your stained clothing out or wear it in spite of the stain. Instead, try altering it so that the stain is no longer a problem. For instance, if you've got a light-colored garment with a prominent turmeric stain, try tie-dying it. Bury the stain in a swirl of bright colors and no one will be the wiser!

, If you've got turmeric to spare, another way to hide a bright turmeric stain is simply to stain the entire garment with the same type of turmeric. Turmeric, which is sometimes purposely used as a fabric dye, is well-suited for amateur dying. This process will usually result in a final product that ranges from bright yellow to orange-red, which can make a fine addition to a summer wardrobe.


You can find a variety of instructions for using turmeric in dying projects online (like, for instance, here).

, If the stain is in a choice location, you may be able to over it simply by stitching over it. For instance, if you have a turmeric stain in the very middle of the chest of your tee shirt, stitching an elaborate, flowery logo over the stain will conceal it and give you an opportunity to make your shirt truly unique. If you're willing to go with an asymmetrical design, you can embroider virtually any part of your clothing, so be creative!

, Some stained clothing just can't seem to be rescued no matter what — not only can the stain not be removed, but it also can't be covered up or obscured with your own alterations. In these cases, think twice before you throw your clothing away! Stained clothes are a great source of perfectly good fabric that can be re-purposed in a wide variety of ways. Below are just a few possible uses for fabric from stained clothing to get you started:


Curtains
Quilts

Place clothing in the freezer.,
Freeze the gum with ice cubes.,
Pick off the hardened gum.,
Remove residue with dry-cleaning solvent or mineral spirits.,
Clean the fabric according to the care instructions.",How to Remove Gum from Fabrics1," If you've gotten gum on your favorite blouse or sweater, carefully fold the clothing so the gum is facing the outside. Clear a space in your freezer so you can set the folded clothing in it. Leave the clothing in the freezer until the gum hardens. Depending on how thick the gum is, you may need to freeze the clothing for an hour or two.Avoid covering the clothing with something that the gum may stick to. You can simply put it on a shelf of the freezer.;
, If you're trying to remove gum from a material that can get wet, place an ice cub directly on the gum. If you shouldn't get the material wet, place an ice pack or bag filled with ice over the gum. Leave the gum on the ice for 10 to 15 minutes or until the gum becomes firm.

, Once the gum has hardened from the freezer or ice cubes, use your fingers to pick away as much of the gum as you can. Then you can take a butter knife or spatula to scrape away the little bits of gum that might still be on the clothing.Avoid scraping the fabric with anything that might damage the fibers.

, Squirt a dry-cleaning solvent onto a sponge and blot the area of fabric where the gum was. Keep blotting with the sponge until the area isn't sticky anymore. If you don't have dry-cleaning solvent, you can use a sponge dipped in mineral spirits., Read the care label inside the clothing or fabric so you know how to clean it correctly. You can usually spot clean the area if there's residue or a stain left from the gum. Wash the fabric as usual, but check it before you dry it. If there's still a stain, treat the stain again.If you dry the fabric while there's still a stain, you may set the stain. This will make it harder to remove.

Soak the gum in lemon juice or hot vinegar.,
Harden the gum with hairspray.,
Use oil to soften the gum.,
Avoid using peanut butter or compressed air.",How to Remove Gum from Fabrics2," Heat a bowl of vinegar until it's hot or fill the bowl with fresh lemon juice. Place the part of the fabric with the gum in the hot vinegar or lemon juice. Leave the gum to soak. You should be able to easily scrape or brush the gum off. Wash the fabric as soon as you've removed the gum.Always test a small area of fabric before you soak the gum. This will let you know if the fabric will be damaged by the hot vinegar or lemon juice.

, If you can't freeze the gum off with a freezer or ice cube, spray it with hair spray. This should harden the gum so you can simply pop it off. You can also take a blunt tool and gently pry off the gum.Ensure that the hairspray won't damage the fabric by testing a small area of the fabric before you begin.

, Consider spreading a cooking oil or mayonnaise over the gum. You'll need to massage the oil or mayo into the gum a little. This will make it easier to scrape off. Immediately wash the fabric to prevent the oil from staining the cloth.Keep in mind that you may have trouble removing oil stains from delicate fabrics. Only use oil if you know you can wash it out of the fabric.

, While peanut butter may be great for removing gum from hair, it can leave oily residue that damages leather. You should also avoid using compressed air to freeze gum off of fabrics. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration warns that it may be hazardous.If you want to use peanut butter on fabrics, check the fabric for stains after you've removed the gum.

Pull off the bulk of the gum.,
Use tape to lift off the gum.,
Wash the area.,
Remove sticky residue with mineral spirits.,
Condition the leather.",How to Remove Gum from Fabrics3," As soon as you notice the gum on the leather, use your fingers to gently pull as much of the gum off as you can. Ensure that you don't spread the gum over the leather as you're pulling., Take a piece of clear tape and lay it over the gum. Press on the gum so it sticks to the tape. Pull the tape off and some of the gum should come off with it. Keep laying fresh pieces of tape and lifting the gum until all of the gum is removed.You may go through a whole roll of tape depending on how strong the tape is.

, The leather might be dirty once you've removed the gum. To clean the leather, you can use a commercial leather cleaning product or use a mild dish soap and warm water. Just wet a sponge in soapy water and gently rub it over the leather. Avoid pulling or scrubbing on the leather.You may be able to wash away any tiny bits of gum that are still stuck to the leather.

, Dip a clean cloth into a little dish of mineral spirits. Slowly wipe the cloth over the sticky area on the leather. Once you've removed the sticky residue, use a clean, dry cloth to wipe over the area. This should thoroughly clean the leather and remove the last of the gum.Mineral spirits are also called white spirit and mineral turpentine.
Don't throw away the cloth that you dipped in mineral spirits. Instead, place them in a container with water and take them to a local hazardous waste facility.

, Use the manufacturer's instructions for protecting the leather or use a commercial leather conditioner. This will moisturize the leather since you've probably stripped away some of the protective oils in the fabric."

Change the paper towel frequently.,
Air dry the material.,
Try a stain remover.,
Use a citrus fruit instead of alcohol.,
Try to rinse the stain out.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Cotton," If the ink is still wet, use a clean, dry cloth to gently dab the stain. This will remove the ink that hasn’t soaked into the cotton material and dried. Avoid scrubbing or wiping, as this may spread the stain., You’ll need a solvent to help break down the ink and remove it. Liquids with a high percentage of alcohol are the most effective solvent for this purpose. Fortunately, there are a handful of readily available options.Methylated spirits or rubbing alcohol are the best option. These are available at hardware stores and pharmacies.
Alcohol-based hair spray, nail polish remover, and liquid hand sanitizer that contains alcohol will also work. In a pinch, liquor may work too.

, Apply a small amount of the solvent you want to use to a hidden area of the cotton item, such as the inside seam of a piece of clothing. Most cotton items will not be affected by alcohol-based liquids, but it’s worth making sure your solvent won’t discolor the item.If your solvent discolors your cotton item, try a different solvent before proceeding.

, Place the section of the cotton material that is stained face down against a piece of dry paper towel. This will allow you to work the stain out of the cotton from the other side of the material., Pour a small amount of your solvent onto the cotton so that it seeps through the material into the stain. Allow the solvent to breakdown the stain by letting it to sit for a minute. , Dampen a cotton ball or piece of cloth with solvent and gently blot the stain from the backside. This will push the marker ink out of the cotton and into the paper towel., Continue adding alcohol to the stain in small amounts and blotting. As you do so, remove saturated paper towels from below and replace them with dry paper towels that will soak up your solvent and ink from the stain.Frequent paper towel changes are important, to prevent the cotton from re-absorbing ink that is transferred into the towel.
Continue blotting and replacing the paper towel until no more ink transfers and the stain is removed from the cotton material.

, After removing the ink stain, allow the item to air dry and ensure the stain is removed. Avoid machine-drying the material until you’re sure the stain is removed, as high-heat drying can make the stain permanent.Once you’re sure the stain has been removed, wash the item normally.

, Stain removers require less effort on your part, and may work well. Examples include Dawn Power Dissolver, Mr. Clean Multi-Surface Cleaner, and Tide Spray ‘n Wash. Follow the directions on the items container, making sure they can safely be used on cotton.Be aware that it may take several applications of a stain remover in order to fully remove a stain.
Always test a commercial stain remover on an inconspicuous part of the cotton item.

, Citrus juice is an alternative solvent option. Place the stained material face down on clean paper towel. Cut an orange or lemon in half, and dab the fruit’s flesh onto the back of the stained area.Switch the paper towel frequently and continue dabbing until the stain is removed. Allow the item to air dry and wash normally.

, You may be able to remove an ink stain without blotting. You will still need to apply a solvent, such as alcohol-based hairspray. Apply the solvent directly to the stain from both sides of the cotton material. Allow the solvent to sit for a few minutes and rinse in cool or warm water.You may need to repeat this process several times.
Try allowing the solvent to soak into the stain for a longer period of time, such as 15 minutes, between rinses.

This can be found in a brown bottle in the first aid aisle of most pharmacies or stores.


3 tablespoons (45 g) of baking soda
1 drop of liquid hand dish washing soap

, Do this when you want to actually spray the mattress -- the concoction is most potent when used immediately. Do not attempt to store the leftover solution; it will leak out of the bottle.


Add the drop of dish soap last. Let the baking soda dissolve entirely and then add the soap to make it bubbly.

, Right after you've gotten your mixture all shaken together, spray it generously over the area. You should see the stain lift and disappear within 5-10 minutes. If you leave it to dry with a fan on, your work should be done!


If a baking soda film does remain, then simply wipe or vacuum it off. It won't leave a ring.

X means you can't clean the couch with water or solvents, so you'll have to take it to a professional to clean the blood.;
, Before using any cleaner on your couch, you should always perform a spot test to ensure the cleaner won’t bleach the fabric, make the color bleed, or otherwise damage the material. Perform the spot test by applying cleaner to an inconspicuous area and letting it sit for 24 hours.Cleaners you may need to spot test for your couch are:


Rubbing alcohol
Hydrogen peroxide
Soap and water solution
Upholstery cleaner

, Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently scrub the area and loosen any dried blood that may still be on the surface of the material. This will make the stain easier to clean. After brushing, wipe the area with a dry cloth to remove flakes of dried blood., Dampen a clean cloth with cold water or rubbing alcohol. Wring out the cloth to remove excess liquid. Dab the stain with the damp white cloth to saturate the area with liquid.Use only cold water to blot the area, as hot water can set the stain.
It’s important to use white cloths to clean the couch, otherwise dye from the cloths may transfer to the couch.
Water is safe to use for couches marked with W and SW letter codes. Alcohol is safe to use on couches marked with S and SW codes.

, Use a fresh cloth to blot the area and remove excess blood and liquid from the couch. Be sure to blot rather than rub, as rubbing can push the stain deeper into the couch and make it harder to clean. Keep dabbing until the cloth comes away dry., Once the stain has been saturated, there are a few different cleaners you can use to remove the blood from the couch. Here are some of the most popular blood cleaners for couches:One part baking soda mixed with two parts water
Fresh lemon juice mixed with a pinch of salt
Hydrogen peroxide
Rubbing alcohol (safe for S-only couches)
One cup (235 ml) of cold water mixed with 2 teaspoons (10 ml) dishwashing liquid
Hairspray

, Mix your cleaning solution in a bowl. Soak a clean cloth in the solution, and wring out the excess liquid. Blot the stained area with the cloth to saturate the stain with cleaner. Don’t rub the stain, as this could push the stain deeper into the material.Don’t be alarmed if the hydrogen peroxide starts to bubble and foam. That just means it’s killing bacteria.

, Use a fresh, dry cloth to blot the area and absorb excess cleaner and moistened blood. Continue dabbing a fresh area of cloth into the couch until the cloth comes away clean and dry.

, Continue alternating between dampening the area with cleaner and blotting it dry with a fresh cloth. Keep doing this until no more blood comes off on the dry cloth, and the stain is gone., For a blood stain that doesn’t want to come out, you may have to try a commercial upholstery cleaner.Saturate a clean cloth with the cleaner and blot the stain with the cloth. Then, blot the area with a dry cloth to remove blood and cleaner.


Look for an enzyme-based cleaner that’s safe for use on couches. These types of cleaners are specifically designed to break down proteins in organic stains like blood.

, To rinse out excess cleaner from the couch, soak a clean cloth with cold water. Wring out the excess, and blot the couch to saturate the area with water. Switch to a dry cloth and blot the area to remove as much of the water and excess cleaner as possible.Let the area dry completely. To speed up drying, aim a fan at the wet spot.


If you're working with an S-code couch, skip the rinsing step to prevent damaging the couch, and just blot the area with a dry cloth.

, With food spills, use a spoon to pick up chunks of food. Dampen a clean cloth with cold water or alcohol (for S-code couches) and saturate the area. Blot with the cloth until the stain is gone, and then pat the area dry.


When you clean spills and messes right away, the stains don’t have time to dry and set, and this makes it easier to clean them., Keeping a couch looking great is easy if you stay on top of regular cleaning. To clean the couch, use a soft brush to gently scrub dirt and oil from the upholstery. Use the upholstery attachment and vacuum the couch, including the seams, cracks, and crevices.


For the best results, repeat this cleaning process every two weeks., There are commercial fabric and upholstery protectors available that you spray onto your couches and other fabric surfaces. These sprays protect the areas from stains and make cleaning easier. To apply these protectors:


Shake the can
Hold the can 6 inches (15 cm) from the couch
Spray the entire surface of the couch with a thin and even layer
Let the spray dry
Apply a second coat

, Another way to protect couches from spills, dirt, and stains is to cover them with a washable fabric cover. You can either buy a special couch protector from a home or bath store, you can make your own, or you can use an old sheet or blanket to cover your couch.


Wash the protector every one to two months to keep it clean, or anytime a spill occurs.

Soak up any excess urine.,
Remove the stuffing.,
Perform a cleanser spot test.,

Condition the leather.",How to Remove a Urine Stain from a Leather Couch," Discovering the urine while it is still wet is the ideal time to clean up the mess. Use paper towels to soak up any urine that might be pooled on the leather surface. Do not rub the paper towels over the urine; that will simply spread out the stain. Instead, blot or dab at the urine puddle.


This step may require use of a multiple paper towels.;
, If the urine stain was made on a leather couch cushion, remove the stuffing from the affected cushion. Usually there is a zipper on one of the back or bottom edges of the cushion from which the stuffing can be removed. Put the stuffing somewhere off to the side to clean later with an enzymatic cleanser.


It is important to remove the stuffing because even if you catch the stain soon after it was made, the urine could still soak into the cushion stuffing. If the urine soaks into the stuffing, it can cause the urine smell to linger on the couch even after cleaning the leather surface.
If your leather surface is unable to have the stuffing removed, you may have to consult a professional furniture company to see if they could assist you.

, It’s highly recommended to use specific leather cleaners to wipe down the surface of the urine stained leather. These cleaners can be found at pet stores, drug stores, or bigger retail chains. However, before you use the cleanser on the entire stained area, it’s a good idea to test it out on an inconspicuous part of your couch.


A successful urine stain cleanser is “Nature’s Miracle” which can be found in most pet stores.Consider testing the cleaner on small areas near the rear or bottom of your couch. If the cleanser reacts negatively on the leather, you will have saved yourself from ruining the entire visible area of the urine stain.

, Use a cloth lightly dampened with your chosen cleanser to wipe the stained area. Drag the dampened cloth over the area gently; you do not want to scrub the leather. Be sure to wipe the entire surface of the stained area from edge to edge, seam to seam.


This is because you yourself could leave a stain on the leather if you just clean a specific area. It’s better to dampen and clean the entire section of the leather cushion, rather than only treat the stained area.
If you want to make your own cleaning solution, mix together one quart of hydrogen peroxide, ¼ cup of baking soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dish soap. Gently combine these ingredients together in a bowl. Dip your cloth into the solution and wring it out.

, Since the stuffing may be saturated with urine, you need to use an enzymatic cleaner to remove the urine, and dispel the urine’s potent, chemical odor. Wash the stuffing as you would wash any kind of clothing by hand, in a large sink or tub. Apply the enzymatic cleanser to the stuffing, and use your hands to work the cleaning solution into the urine-saturated area. Squeeze the stuffing, and rinse it with clean running water. Do this many times to be sure you completely rinse out and neutralize the urine stain and odor.


Allow the stuffing to dry naturally outside. If the stuffing can dry outside in sunlight, that may help get rid of the urine smell even more.

, Insert the stuffing back into the leather cushion once the stuffing and cushion are both completely dry. Do your best to reposition the stuffing how it was in the cushion originally, and zip the cushion shut again.

, After the leather has fully dried, apply a leather conditioner to the leather surface.Apply a small amount of conditioner to a soft rag, and use the rag to wipe the entire surface of the leather. Be sure to coat all sides of the leather cushion.


A leather conditioner will ensure that your leather stays soft and supple, replenishing any of the natural oils that the cleaning solution may have removed from the surface.

Soak the glue.",How to Remove Glue from Counter Tops1," Try to remove the glue with a putty knife first.Hold the flat edge of the putty knife close to the counter top, apply gentle pressure and push the putty knife’s blade towards the glue.


Don’t apply so much pressure that you scrape your counter top, but keep the blade of the putty knife close to the counter.
Keep scraping at the glue to remove as much as you can before you try other strategies.;
, You can also use a little dish soap and a wet sponge to scrub off the glue. Use the rough side of a sponge or a plastic net sponge to scrub away the glue.


Rinse the sponge and reapply soap as needed.
Keep scrubbing the spot until the glue comes off.

, If the glue is dry or if there is a lot of it, then you might need to soften it by soaking the spot. Moisten a wash cloth or paper towel with some hot water. Then, place the wet cloth over the glue on the counter to soften it.


Leave the wet cloth on for a few hours and then try to scrub the spot again.
You can also try scraping at the glue with a putty knife again. It might be easier to remove after the glue has softened up.

Try peeling it off first .,
Soak the glue.,
Try mineral spirits.,
Use acetone.,
Try margarine.,
Use laundry detergent.,
Use salt.,
Use petroleum jelly.",How to Remove Super Glue1," Sometimes this will be sufficient to remove the glue, especially if the offending glue has only stuck to one finger instead of sticking two fingers together. Go carefully though and if you feel any pain or see skin lifting off, stop immediately.


Wait until the glue dries into a thin solid before attempting to peel it off. Do not touch it while it is still sticky.
Using clean fingernails or tweezers, grasp the dried glue at the edge and slowly peel it away from the skin. Stop if the glue resists or causes pain.;
, Warm, soapy water may be enough to loosen the glue from your hand. Fill a bowl with warm water and add about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of mild soap. Soak the glued area for 30 to 60 seconds, then attempt to peel the softened glue away.








If you cannot peel the glue away, try rolling another digit, spatula, or spoon handle over the area to help lift it up.
Note that you may need to make several attempts before having success.
You might also try using lemon juice instead of water, or a mixture made of one part lemon juice and one part water. The acid in the juice can help eat away at the glue., If you have sensitive skin, soak the affected area in mineral spirits, then try loosening the glue from your skin. Repeat if the glue doesn’t come off., This method is best for those with tougher skin types––those with sensitive skin might find this method irritating or drying. And never apply acetone to open wounds.








Soak the skin in warm soapy water as soon as possible. This will soften the glue. Adding a dash of cool vinegar may also help. Try loosening the glue from your skin. If this doesn't work, pat the skin dry and move on to the next step.
Use an acetone-based nail polish remover. It must contain acetone, because acetone softens cyanoacrylate. Rub it on the super glue. The dried glue should start peeling off. Do not use a cotton swab, as this can react very violently with cyanoacrylate (smoking or bursting into flames).Let the area dry, then use a nail emery board to remove the glue. Be careful not to remove your skin, too. If you have a lot on your hands you can scrub it on a pumice stone kept in warm water.
Let it peel off on its own. It will turn white, but it will not hurt you, and it'll eventually come off without your help.


, If you have sensitive skin, a little grease might work better. Rub a little margarine on the area repeatedly until the glue can be gently peeled away. 









If you don't have margarine, olive oil should work the same way. The grease reacts with the glue to loosen the bond., Mix liquid laundry detergent (any brand) with hot water. If you are removing the glue from a small area such as your fingers, a 1/4 cup of laundry detergent combined with the hot water in a coffee cup will be sufficient.









Rub and soak for approximately 20 minutes to loosen up the thick band of glue.


, A paste made of salt and water can be abrasive enough to scrape away the glue.Put two tablespoons (30 ml) of salt in your hands.









Put a little water in the salt to turn it into a paste.
Rub the paste in your hand for about 30 to 60 seconds.
Rinse a little off.
Keep rubbing without adding water.
Repeat until the salt has dissipated. Hopefully the glue has lifted off too.

, Wash your hands and the area which has glue on it in hot, soapy water.









Apply petroleum jelly generously on the affected area.
Rub the affected area with a nail file for about a minute. Or, rub until you notice the glue coming off.
Repeat. Then wash and dry your hands.

Never keep your acetone in a styrofoam or plastic cup. It will dissolve the cup.
If you use nail polish remover, make sure it does indeed have acetone. Some companies are trying to use other substances as acetone weakens the bonds for acrylic nails.;
, The softer the knife the better. You want a knife that will not leave marks on your flooring. A soft, plastic putty knife will work best. Laminate flooring can be easily scratched by metallic knives.


If you can’t find a plastic putty knife, you can use a butter knife but you will have to wrap it with a soft rag before using it on your laminate flooring.

, Laminate flooring is very sensitive to liquid. You’ll want plenty of dry paper towels on hand to wipe up any moisture off your floor before it can cause any discoloration.


Darker color laminate is more prone to discoloration.

, You never want to use a scouring pad on your laminate flooring or anything else that can leave scratches. You can use your soft rag to clean your floor without damaging it.


You may also need another need another rag to wrap around your butter knife if you choose to use one.

, While acetone is safe to use, overexposure to it can be bad for you. Too much inhalation of acetone can irritate your respiratory tract, cause headaches and in serious cases even make you go unconscious.Overexposure of concentrated acetone to the skin can even cause dermatitis, so be careful.
Acetone can also stain fabrics in your clothes, so roll up your sleeves.

, Find a small hidden area on your laminate flooring where guests will not normally see. Place a small dot of acetone on the spot. Wait for it to dry, then check the spot to make sure there is no discoloration. You want to make sure the acetone will not damage your flooring.


Choose a spot somewhere that is not likely to be exposed when you inevitably move your furniture around. A corner of the room may be best.

, When you’re sure the acetone is safe to use on your flooring, apply a few drops of it to the stain. Give the acetone some time to soften the glue.


Use as little acetone as possible. Start with only a few drops. If after a few minutes you find that it hasn’t softened the glue sufficiently, add a few more.

, Use your putty knife to gently scrape away the glue stain. If you’re using a steel butter knife, remember to wrap it in your clean thick rag before you use it on your floor.


Be gentle and take your time. With enough force, even a soft knife can cause damage to your flooring., It may take a few tries to get all the glue off. Keep pouring drops of acetone on the stain, letting it sit and then scraping away with your knife until your flooring is free of superglue.

, Drag a paper towel across the area where the stain was to see if you can feel any hard places where there might still be glue. Check the area around the initial stain as well. Your knife could have smeared the glue into a larger area.

, If you do find tiny remnants of superglue on your floor, rub more acetone over the spot with your rag. Once again, use only a few drops of acetone and be sure to be gentle.Never apply any liquid directly to your laminate flooring. It could discolor it. Instead, put a few drops of acetone on your rag, then apply your rag to the floor.
Make sure to apply the rag to your floor in a soft, circular motion.

, When you are confident all the superglue has been removed, use a paper towel to wipe away all the residue. Make sure that all moisture is removed from your flooring.


Dry the area carefully so that you do not scratch your floor.

, Acetone is extremely flammable and can ignite from a distance. Keep it in an area far away from any electrical outlets or anything else that could cause it to catch fire.Make sure to have a tight fitting lid on your acetone so that it is not exposed to anything that could cause it to catch fire.

, Acetone can irritate your skin, causing it to become red and dried out. Be sure to scrub it all off with soap and water after you’re done working with it. Use plenty of lotion to combat the dryness it can cause as well.

Clean the area with surface cleaner or soap scum remover.,
Determine how hard the caulk is.,
Make starter cuts.,
Soften with caulk remover if needed.",How to Remove Old Caulking1," This isn’t strictly necessary to get rid of old caulk, but you’re most likely going to be adding new caulk afterward. If so, make life easier by washing the area now with a surface cleaner, soap scum remover, or a combination of the two. You’ll still need to do a little cleanup after removal, but for now, reduce the need to deep-clean the uncaulked area with excessive amounts of liquid.This is also a good idea because any buildup of oils or other slippery liquids may cause your hand or tools to slip while removing the old caulking.;
, Pick a small area to test with a utility knife. Make a small cut with its tip. Assess the caulk's texture as you do.Water-based, latex, and PVA caulks will most likely feel brittle and hard. These are more prone to chipping during removal.
Silicone caulks should feel much more pliable, like soft rubber. These are usually the easiest to remove.

, Hold your utility knife parallel with either surrounding surface. Insert the tip of your utility blade into the caulk line and slice it open along its edge. Repeat along the other surface.Avoid making actual contact with either surface. For now, you just want to weaken the caulk’s bond and allow more access for the next step.
If your caulk is especially hard, try heating it with a heat gun to soften it up.
If the heat gun doesn’t work, skip to the next step rather than risk damaging the surrounding surfaces with nicks and scratches.

, If your starter cuts were extremely easy to make, feel free to try skipping this step, since the whole caulk line may come off just as easily without any additional treatment.Otherwise, apply a bead of caulk remover along the old caulk. Repeat as needed to cover the whole caulk line and spread it out so all of the old caulk is covered.Refer to your caulk remover’s directions to find out the minimum amount of time you should allow for it to set before moving on. Generally this is about two to three hours.The longer you let it set, the more it should soften the old caulk. So if the old caulk felt extremely hard and brittle when you made your test and starter cuts, allow more time for the caulk remover to be absorbed (as much as 24 hours for very stubborn caulk).

Get some nail polish remover that contains acetone.,
Test the nail polish remover on your countertop first.,
Apply the nail polish remover.,
Scrape off the glue and clean the area.",How to Remove Glue from Counter Tops2," Most fingernail polish removers contain acetone, which is a powerful solvent.You can use nail polish remover to get glue off of your counter tops.Read the label to make sure the fingernail polish actually has acetone in it. Some nail polish removers don’t contain it.
Be careful when working with acetone. Acetone is a volatile chemical that can dry out the skin and cause health effects if you ingest it. Always work with chemicals in a well-ventilated area., To ensure that the acetone will not discolor or damage your counters, it is a good idea to test a small area first, especially if your countertops are made from a special material, such as marble granite, or stone. Apply a small amount of acetone to an area of your counter that is not too visible and then wipe it away after a few minutes.If the nail polish remover causes discoloration, then try soap and water instead and repeat the process several times.Do not use acetone on your counters if it causes damage or discoloration.

, If the nail polish remover did not discolor or damage your counter, then it is okay to use. Apply some nail polish remover to a paper towel or cotton ball. Then, apply the nail polish remover to the glue on your countertop. The acetone in the nail polish remover should dissolve the glue right away.You can also let the nail polish remover soak in for a while to help loosen up the glue. This might be a good idea if there is a thick layer of glue on your countertops.

, After the nail polish remover has had some time to work, you can remove the glue by wiping it up or scraping at it with a putty knife. Press the putty knife against the edge of the glue and push it forward to scrape off as much glue as you can.


After you remove the glue, wipe off any excess glue scrapings and clean the entire area with some soap and water.

Professional glue removers are powerful and you can use them on non-porous surfaces. You can also use them on marble, granite, ceramic, concrete and brick, as long as the surface is sealed.


If you are not sure if your countertops are sealed, try dropping a few drops of water on the surface. If the surface is sealed, then the drops will remain. If not, then they will soak into the surface.Make sure that you pretest the glue removing product on an area that is not too visible. If it causes damage or discoloration, then do not use it., Spray or pour on the recommended amount of product and allow it to sit. For most products, you will need to wait one to three minutes before wiping or scraping the product off.Make sure that you follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.

, After you have left the product on for the suggested amount of time, then you can wipe it off. Use a paper towel or sponge to wipe off the product.It might also be helpful to try scraping at the glue with the putty knife again.

, One application may not be enough to remove all of the glue from your countertop. If you still have glue on your counter after the first application, then reapply the product and repeat the process over again."

Do not try to force open your eyes. Let time do the healing needed.

, The glue will eventually lift off the eye protein in a few hours and the tears will help to wash it out. It is okay to use warm water to wash the eyes out, as long as this doesn't distress you or the patient.








You may experience double vision. Relax somewhere safe until the glue detaches and is washed out of the eye.

, It is highly recommended that you see a doctor after super glue has been near or in your eyes.

The saliva should help moisten and soften the glue from the inside of your mouth while the warm water works from the outside.

, Wait until all sides are thoroughly moistened before attempting this, and do not pull! Doing so could cause more damage to your lips.









Work your lips from side to side while keeping them submerged in the warm water. Ideally, they should gradually peel apart from one another.

, Your saliva will eventually remove any remaining stuck adhesive but do not swallow it. Instead, discard any detached adhesive.









Don't worry about swallowing liquid adhesive since the glue should solidify once it comes into contact with your saliva.

These solutions should work for most smooth surfaces, including wood, metal, and stone. Do not use these on glass or plastic, however.
Always spot test a solution on a hidden part of the material to make sure it won't damage it, especially when working with something abrasive or corrosive, like acetone. If the spot test clears, you should be good to go.

, Add liquid dish soap to warm water, then soak a cloth in the mixture. Lay the cloth over the glue and let it sit for several hours.








You may need to cover the cloth with plastic wrap to keep it moist.
Try scraping away the glue again once it softens.

, Pulling glue off a finished wood surface risks lifting the surface with it, so some subtlety is required. The harsh acetone can also damage some stone and metal surfaces if you aren't careful.








Dip a cleaning rag into acetone or nail polish remover. You can also use a toothbrush -- just make sure no one uses the brush for their teeth afterward!
Rub the dampened part over the glue. For small areas, stick your finger behind the rag and use it to direct circular motions. For larger stains, swirl around with more of the cloth surface area coming into contact with the stain.
Use a rubber or silicone spatula to lift the glue off. Hopefully the acetone will help lift up edges of the glue and you can slide the spatula in under the edge and keep working at it till all the glue is removed.
Wash the area with soapy warm water to remove the acetone. For furniture, polish the furniture with beeswax or olive oil.

, If you don't have acetone nail polish remover or want a slightly less corrosive solution, consider using lemon juice. Apply the lemon juice to the glue in a similar fashion.









Apply a small amount of lemon juice to the glue using a scrap toothbrush dedicated to household cleaning. Using the brush, work the juice around in circles over the glue until the adhesive starts to lift.
Similarly, you may have success with rubbing alcohol.

, Provided the surface isn't painted, this might lift the glue. Dampen a cloth with the oil and rub on the glue stain until it lifts. Wash the oil off with warm soapy water and polish to complete.









This option works especially well with unpainted wood.

, In some instances, sanding the area may be the best option. Place masking tape around the glue stain, to protect the areas around it. Then sand over the glue until it lifts. Restore the sanded area with oil, varnish, or paint, whatever finish the wood originally had.

Work slowly.,
Start with a putty knife.,
Use pliers to remove broken-off bits.,
Scrape away whatever’s left.",How to Remove Old Caulking2," Before you start, take a breath, relax, and prepare to take your time with this project. Expect it to be a relatively easy task, but at the same time, avoid the temptation to rush through it. The more you rush, the more likely you’ll slip along the way and accidentally nick, scratch, or make a deeper cut in the surrounding surfaces., Select an area along the caulk line to start. Hold your putty knife parallel to the caulk line and place the blade flat against either surrounding surface. Favor whichever one is smoothest to start. Edge the corner of the blade into and under the softened caulk, then push the blade along the caulk line to separate it from the surface.Ideally, you will be able to pull this loosened strip free of the other surface. If the bond is too strong to do so, repeat this process along the second surface.

, As you push the putty knife along, the caulk should come away in strips. As it does, smaller pieces may break off and lodge in the gap between the two surfaces, so go back over your work as you remove each strip. Pull those smaller bits out with a pair of needle-nose pliers.If the gap is very small, use tweezers instead.

, Even if most of the caulk came away in nice, long strips, go back and use your putty knife to remove any lingering lines that stuck to the surfaces along the caulk line’s edges. For extremely tough pieces, switch to a steel brush, toothbrush, or the hook feature in a 5-in-1 painter’s tool. Brush or chip away at any pieces that have hardened into place.Remember to do the same with any bits that are deep within the gap.
If needed, use your heat gun again to soften any stubborn bits."

Clean up after removal.,
Get rid of mildew.,
Allow the area to dry before recaulking.",How to Remove Old Caulking3," Once you’ve removed all the caulk, clean up the mess you’ve made so it doesn’t interfere with the new caulk bonding to the surfaces. Dust the surface with dry paper towels or microfiber clothes so you don’t have to use too much liquid. Then use a light amount of cleaner and/or soap scum remover to clean the surface areas. Wipe the area dry when finished.Because the gap between the surfaces is now exposed, you want to expose it to as little moisture as possible. Spray paper towels of cloths with cleaner instead of spraying the surfaces directly.
Avoid using ammonia-based cleaners, since this creates toxic fumes when combined with bleach, which you’ll be using next.

, Kill mold by combining ⅓ cup (79 ml) of bleach with 1 gallon (3.75 L) of water. Fill a spray bottle with the solution and spray into and around the gap, or soak a paintbrush or foam brush in it and use that to reach inside the gap. Scrub with a cleaning brush, wipe up any extra debris that may have worked loose, rinse the area with dampened towels, and then wipe it dry.Alternately, you can also use a storebought mold-and-mildew killer., To make sure you’re not trapping any moisture behind the surfaces, wait until the next day before covering the gap with new caulk. Give the area behind the surfaces a chance to air-dry. Aim a fan at the gap to improve air circulation. To hurry things up, pass your heat gun up and down along the gap periodically and/or set up a space heater nearby.If you’re using silicone caulk for a new caulk line, the area must be completely dry in order for it adhere.
Water-based caulks will adhere to surfaces that are slightly damp, but doing so may increase the risk of mildew growing back.

Don’t panic if the glue bonds to your skin.,
Soak the affected area in warm, soapy water.,
Use acetone or nail polish remover, alternately.,
Wash the area with a petroleum-based solvent.,
Wash your skin thoroughly.",How to Remove E6000 Glue1," Some industrial-strength adhesives bond in seconds. E6000 takes longer to “cure” at about 24 hours, but will still be tacky within minutes. Don’t panic if you realize that you have accidentally glued your skin or two fingers together. You can try to weaken the bond with solvents or even warm water.


Don’t try to pull your fingers apart if they are glued together. You may tear the skin.
If you have accidentally applied E6000 to your lips, eyelids, eyeballs, or other sensitive body parts, seek immediate medical attention.;
, Warm water and soap will loosen the bond and is less likely to aggravate your skin than chemical solutions. Fill a basin with warm water, adding soap and working it into a lather.Soak your fingers, hands, or whatever area has bonded until the glue weakens. This may take 15 minutes or more.
Then, begin to rub the area gently back and forth. Continue rolling it until the bond breaks. Again, do not try to pull the glue bond apart.
You can also use a tool like a pencil, spatula, or spoon to jimmy the glue loose.

, Mild solvents will dissolve adhesives like E6000 and superglue and should work in case simple soap and water fail. You should be able to find acetone in common household products like nail polish remover or paint thinner.Take a Q-tip or cotton swab and dab it in a small amount of acetone. Then, wet the glue where it has bonded to your skin.
The solvent should soften the glue. Begin to work the glue back and forth once it is loose and gently peel the skin away from the glue, without pulling.
Acetone can irritate the eyes, skin, and lungs. Use it in a well-ventilated area and avoid swallowing or bringing it into contact with your eyes. Wash your hands with soap and water after you have removed the glue.Acetone will also discolor fabrics and damage finishes. Take care to keep it away from your clothing and surfaces like countertops and floors., If soap and water and acetone fail, or are not available, try a petro-based cleaning product like Goo-Gone. Goo Gone contains methyl alcohol but also the solvents toluene and acetone, so it should be able to dissolve even heavy-duty glues.


Apply the liquid solvent to the affected area with a cotton swab or blot it with a cloth.
Wait one or two minutes, and then start to work the glue back and forth. Use an exfoliating scrub if the liquid is not enough.
As always, gently peel the skin away from the glue rather than pulling. All the ingredients of Goo Gone are toxic and irritants. Use the solvent in a well-ventilated area and avoid swallowing or bringing it into contact with your eyes., Nail polish remover, paint thinner, and petroleum solvents are toxic chemicals and will irritate your skin with prolonged contact. Make sure to remove them once the glue bond is dissolved.


Flush the affected area with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.Consider applying lotion after you’ve washed, in order to moisturize and repair your skin.

Flush the clothing with warm water first.,
Use acetone on natural fabrics.Dampen a cloth, clean an old toothbrush with acetone and rub the glue stain to try to lift it up.,
Take expensive clothing to the dry cleaner.",How to Remove Super Glue5," Rub at the stain to remove as much of the glue as possible just by rubbing.








Naturally, use your common sense with respect to very delicate fabrics––rubbing or scrubbing may damage the fibers.
Add some heavy-duty liquid detergent to the water to make this solution more effective. About 2 Tbsp (30 ml) should work.

, Scrape the glue off with a blunt knife or spatula, then wash the clothing as usual. You can also pre-treat the stain if you'd normally do that before washing.









Do not use acetone on clothing that contains acetate or acetate variations––the clothing will melt.
Always trial a test spot before using on any clothing.
Note that acetone can dull the color behind the glue stain.

, If the clothing is expensive or you can't get the glue off yourself, take it to a professional. Better safe than sorry.

Try rubbing and rolling it off.,
Dampen the glue.,
Use rubbing alcohol.",How to Remove Super Glue6," Use your fingernails to try to lift up at the ends of the glue stain. Once you get a small life, keep working at the stain and then try to roll it back off the plastic object. This may take a little effort but may be the best approach.









You can also use a plastic spatula or knife to help scrape off the glue without scratching the plastic.

, Make up a solution of warm, soapy water. Use a gentle dish washing detergent.









Dip a cloth or paper towel into the soapy water and drench it. Wring so that it's just damp.
Lay the cloth or paper towel over the glue stain. Tape a layer of kitchen plastic wrap over the cloth or paper towel, to create a humid micro-environment. Leave the items there for several hours. The damp cloth or paper towel will moisten the glue, causing it to soften a lot.
Use a warm, soapy cloth to remove the glue as much as possible after a few hours. Keep dabbing until all the glue lifts up onto the cloth.

, Note that this method may damage some surfaces, so it's best to do a spot test before proceeding.









Dampen a soft cleaning cloth with rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol).
Dab the cloth on the glue stain to soften.
Pick at the lifting, softened glue to remove as much as possible.
Use a fresh cloth dipped in soapy water to remove residue.
Wash with clean warm water to finish. Let dry.

"
"
Try to remove as much glue as possible with a sharp blade.,
Saturate the stain.",How to Remove Super Glue7," A razor blade will do the trick and shouldn't harm the glass. If you manage to get the blob of glue off this way, simply wash off the residue with warm, soapy water, rinse and let dry.








, If you are unable to peel the glue away, soak it in warm water and try again.








Place the glass object in a bowl of warm soapy water. If this isn't possible, simply wet a cloth with warm soapy water and hold over the glue stain.
Attach a sheet of kitchen plastic wrap around the cloth with tape. Let sit for an hour or two to soften the glue. Then scrape off the softened glue with a blade or spatula.
Rubbing alcohol, eucalyptus oil or acetone can be used to get rid of any remaining residue. Wash the glass and polish if needed.

Use a cotton ball soaked in acetone to dissolve the glue.,
Alternatively, soak your skin in warm, soapy water and gently scrub.,
Apply warm water to lips stuck with glue.,
Wash your eyelid with warm water if it becomes stuck with glue.,
If you get glue on your eyeball, let it break down naturally.,
Consider using commercial ""de-bonder"" solutions.",How to Remove Crazy Glue1," Acetone works very well for getting crazy glue off of the skin. Wet a cotton ball or Q-tip in the acetone, then gently rub it on the dried glue. Give it a few seconds to soften the glue, then wipe with a rag and repeat. Rinse with water when finished.Using a nail polish remover that contains some percentage of acetone is probably your best bet. You can use pure, 100% acetone, but this can be somewhat harsh on the skin, causing dryness and irritation.If the glue is stuck somewhere where using acetone may get it into your body, like your mouth, your nose, your eyes, and so on, don't use acetone. Instead, scroll down for additional tips and tricks.;
, If you don't have acetone or you're worried about drying your skin out, don't worry — you can get rid of crazy glue with plain old soap and water (though it will take a little more time.) Wet the dried glue in the warm water, then gently rub with a rag, an old toothbrush, or another mild abrasive. Be patient and the glue will eventually start to peel off.


If two fingers are stuck together, one way to get them apart is to gently ease a pencil between them and start rolling it back and forth. This slowly opens a gap, freeing the fingers.
Never force apart two pieces of skin that are stuck together. This can cause painful tearing or irritation.

, When glue is stuck to part of your body where harsh chemicals like acetone shouldn't be applied, use alternative fixes. For instance, if your lips are glued together, press them into warm water to loosen the glue. At the same time, use saliva from inside your mouth as you roll your lips together. The constant heat and gentle motion should separate the lips fairly quickly.Leftover glue on the lips can be annoying, but don't worry — it will break down within a maximum of one to two days., As with the lips, acetone should not be used on or near the eyes. Instead, delicately apply warm water (minus soap, which can irritate your eye) with a gentle rag. If the eyelid does not eventually open on its own, do not force it eyelid open. Apply a gauze patch to protect the eye. The glue will break down within 1 to 4 days and your eye will be able to open.

, Crazy glue that dries directly on your eyeball can be seriously irritating, but since touching your eye can make matters worse, it's best to leave it alone. Luckily, the glue bond will release within several hours as the protein in the outer membrane disassociates from the eye.Your eye will probably water during this period and you may experience double vision or blurriness.


See a physician after the glue has broken down to ensure there is no permanent damage to your eye. Crazy glue shouldn't cause permanent damage on its own, but major eye irritation can have long-lasting effects., A special type of glue remover advertised under the name ""de-bonder"", ""super solvent"", or ""glue remover"" is sold in craft and hobby stores and online for fairly cheap — usually less than $10 for a bottle.De-bonders are often made with chemicals like nitromethane, which can be gentler on the skin than acetone. However, not all de-bonders are the same, so check the product's packaging carefully for safety information before making a purchase.

Prepare the area.,
Apply acetone nail polish remover or naphtha spirits to the glue.,
Submerge the item in petroleum, alternately.,
Try to remove the glue.",How to Remove E6000 Glue2," E6000 glues are serious adhesives. The chemicals and solvents that best dissolve them are quite harsh and need care, as well. Make sure that you set up and take all the proper precautions.


Find a well-ventilated area outdoors to work, like an open garage. A concrete floor is ideal but you can also place your bonded item on top of old newspapers.
Wear rubber gloves and a mask and protect other areas of your body by wearing goggles and a thick layer of clothes.
Acetone, naphtha spirits, and petroleum based solvents are highly flammable. Make sure that you do not use them near sparks or open flames.
Always read the manufacturer’s instructions and warning label before using a toxic product.

, Acetone and naphtha spirits are both solvents that will soften and start to dissolve E6000 bonds. Wet a rag with either of these liquids and apply it liberally to the glue.These solvents are strong enough to damage some substances. Do a small trial run before removing the glue if you are worried about the object.
Let the solvent set for 10 to 30 minutes. Since these chemicals can give off fumes, leave and return to see if the glue is removed.
Repeat the treatment if need be. Then, wash the item with dishwashing detergent and water to remove the glue and the solvent chemicals.

, For very heavy duty items, like metal car parts, you may be able to completely submerge the glue in gasoline or a similar petro-based substance. These chemicals are effective solvents but, obviously, should be used with extreme caution.Fill an appropriately sized bucket with gas. Be careful to avoid spillage when filling the bucket, as pools of fuel can pose a fire hazard.
Submerge the item in the bucket for 10 to 30 minutes while the glue loosens and dissolves.
Keep flames and fire well away from the area.

, Carefully remove the item from the bucket of gasoline. Soak the item for another 30 minutes or more if the glue is still intact.


Rinse the item using mineral spirits or other cleaning products. Then safely dispose of all water, oil and spirits, and solvents. NEVER pour these down sewers or drains and NEVER throw them in the garbage.Instead, contact your local environmental protection agency or municipal government to find out the best way to dispose of hazardous wastes.

Use acetone and an old tooth brush on fabric.,
Soften glue on hard surfaces.,
Abrade the surface.",How to Remove E6000 Glue3," Chances are that E6000 or any other industrial strength glue will ruin clothing, either because you won’t be able to remove it entirely or because the fabric will be discolored or damaged in removal. Try acetone if you want to keep the item, however.Find an old tooth brush. Then, using an applicator like a cotton swab, dab the glue with acetone.
Brush the bonded glue with the tooth brush to begin removing the adhesive. Reapply the solvent and brush several times to erode the glue.
Work on both sides of the fabric, if need be. You may not be able to entirely remove the glue.
When done, remove the acetone by washing the fabric.

, Hard surfaces like tables, countertops, and floors can take a more aggressive approach. First, choose the right solvent for your surface. You do not want to damage the surface with too powerful a chemical.


Goo Off, for example, contains mainly acetone and will dissolve plastic, laminate, and Formica surfaces.Test a small and inconspicuous area of your surface beforehand to prevent widespread damage.
Once you are sure that the solvent will not harm the surface, apply it liberally to the glue.

, Let the solvent sit for 15 to 30 minutes. Then, begin to abrade the softened glue with whatever mechanical means are at hand. Repeat this process until the glue is gone.You can use a heavy cloth or rag, a wire brush, sandpaper, or a tool like a screwdriver to abrade the glue, depending on the surface.
For especially hard surfaces, it may be possible to scrape off the glue with a utility knife or razor blade. Be careful not to cut yourself.
Unfortunately, abrasion may scratch or damage the surface while you are removing glue. A hardwood floor may need to be sanded and refinished, for example.

"

Gently scrub with acetone and a toothbrush.,
Pre-treat and launder delicate fabrics.,
When all else fails, see a professional.",How to Remove Crazy Glue2," Crazy glue can be tricky to get out of the tight, interwoven fibers of fabric or clothing. For most fabrics, acetone is your best bet. Put a drop or two of acetone on the bristles of an old toothbrush. Starting from the outside and working your way to the inside of the fabric, gently rub the glued area with the toothbrush to remove the glue. It isn't always possible to remove 100% of the glue from the fabric this way, but it should dissolve most of it.


Never use acetone on fabrics made from modacrylic, acetate, triacetate, or natural hair fibers like silk, wool and fur. Acetone can dissolve or damage these materials, causing permanent damage to the fabric.If you're not sure whether acetone is safe for your fabric, dab a tiny bit on an inconspicuous part of the fabric and wait five minutes to see if any damage occurs.

, If you're dealing with a fabric that acetone can't be used on safely, use ordinary laundry detergent to help loosen the glue. Before washing, gently rub your normal detergent into the spot with dried glue with an old toothbrush or a rag, taking care not to damage the fabric with rough scrubbing. Toss the garment into the washing machine and set the water to the hottest setting allowed on the garment's care label. Check the fabric after washing — you may need to repeat several times to get the glue out.


You don't need to launder your glue-damaged fabric by itself. To use efficient use of water and electricity, launder it with a load of similar fabrics. The glue will not affect the other items in the wash.

, Crazy glue can be notoriously difficult to get out of fabric (especially if you don't want to ruin the fabric while removing the glue.) If you have a glue stain on an especially valuable piece of fabric or you haven't been able to get it out with other methods, consider enlisting the help of a professional. Commercial dry cleaners will usually be able to get glue stains out, while larger items like rugs and pieces of furniture can be cleaned by home cleaning specialists.

Soften the glue with acetone.,
Carefully scrape with a putty knife.,
Use sandpaper to wear away at persistent glue.",How to Remove Crazy Glue3," For hard surfaces like floors, countertops, tables, and so on, acetone is once again a great first move. Apply acetone to the tip of a cotton swab and rub it onto the glued area. The acetone will soften the glue — you may even be able to rub it off with a rag afterward.


Be careful when using acetone on painted surfaces. Acetone is a common ingredient in many paint thinners and solvents, so it can dissolve paint on contact. This isn't a big deal if you're willing to re-paint, but if not, you may want to think twice.

, For glue that won't come off with simple application of acetone, you may need to use mechanical action to get the glue off. Hard, flat metal or hard plastic tools like putty knives, butter knives, and so on are your best bet. Scrape at a diagonal angle with firm pressure to chip the hardened crazy glue away.


Be careful not to scratch or gouge your surface when getting the glue off. Push your tool in the direction of the surface, not down into it.

, When all else fails, a fine-grit sandpaper can help you remove crazy glue and get your surface smooth again. Stop and check your work frequently while sanding — you don't want to accidentally sand past the dried-on glue and wear away at the surface underneath.


For big jobs, wear a dust mask to ensure you don't breathe any particles kicked up by your sanding.

Paint glass with acetone to loosen the glue.,
Alternatively, use soapy water.,
Use toothpaste as an abrasive.",How to Remove Crazy Glue4," As in the methods above, acetone will work wonderfully to dissolve glue on most glass surfaces. Soak a cotton swab in acetone and rub it directly onto the dried glue, then follow by rubbing with a rag. The glue should start to soften and come off with a few applications.


Don't use acetone on plexiglass and other glass alternatives made from plastic. Acetone will eat away at these materials over time, eventually dissolving them into a liquid (though this requires prolonged contact.)

, Another way to work crazy glue off of glass is to soak glass items in warm, soapy water. Scrub the glue gently with an old toothbrush or a gentle abrasive in the water. If you're careful not to scrape or gouge, you can even use a plastic putty knife to help chip the glue off. Be patient — over time, the glue should begin to flake away.


If two pieces of glass are stuck together, submerge both in warm soapy water. Let sit for at least 15-20 minutes. As the glue loosens, pry the glass objects apart cautiously. If you experience strong resistance, stop to avoid breaking the glass.

, While abrasives like sandpaper will leave glass so scratched and marred that it's no longer transparent, one gentle and unlikely abrasive is actually suitable for use on glass: toothpaste. To use toothpaste this way, follow the steps below:


Squeeze out toothpaste onto your finger and apply it to the glued area.
Start scrubbing with a sponge or a gentle wool cloth. Scrub for a couple of minutes until the glue softens.
Try to peel the glue of the object with your fingernail. If it's a small patch, it should start to lift off.
This method doesn't always work with really big patches of glue, but it does well when there are small spots of glue here and there.

Their cleansing and exfoliating properties make them ideal products to use when attempting to remove glue from your hands. Wash and scrub the affected area aggressively with either soap two to three times., Acetone, which is present in nail polish remover, breaks down the glue, removing it from the surface of your skin.


Retrieve a small dish and a bottle of nail polish remover. Fill the dish with acetone.
You may treat the affected area in one of two ways. If the glue is on your fingers or thumb, submerge the affected area into the acetone and let it soak for several minutes.

Put a little salt in your hands.,
Add water to make a paste.,
Rub the paste into your hand for about a minute.,
Add more salt and water as needed.,
Repeat until the salt is gone.",How to Get Super Glue off of Your Hands with Salt1," There's no ""right"" amount of salt to use here — just use more or less depending on how much glue you need to remove. Regular table salt works great, but you can try this method with sea salt, kosher salt, or another type of fine-grain salt as well. Avoid harsh, coarse salts like rock salt, which can cut up your hands.


If you're unsure how much to use, start with two tablespoons and add more as needed.;
, Adding about half as much water as you added salt should make a loose, salty paste. Stir the salt and water together in your hand (or a separate container) to get it uniform.


Warm water works best. Warmer temperatures speed up the reactions that help break down glue at a chemical level.For a particularly tough job, try adding lemon juice instead of water. The acid in the juice helps dissolve the glue., Use one hand to rub it into the glue-covered area on the other hand. If both hands have glue on them, rub them together with the paste in between. Use constant, gentle pressure to work the salt into the glue. As you rub, it will gradually cause the glue to break up and peel away.


After about a minute, rinse some of the salt off and see whether the glue seems to be coming off. If the glue has all washed away, you're already done! However, it will usually take a few more applications before you make significant progress.

, As you continue rubbing, you'll gradually lose the paste (which can make it a good idea to do this over the sink. Continue adding salt and water to keep the paste's loose but abrasive consistency. Depending on how thick the glue is, you may want to have several applications of salt measured out ahead of time.

, Keep rubbing the salt paste in, rinsing bits of glue away, and applying more salt paste. Eventually, you'll be able to remove much of the glue. You may not be able to get all of it off the first time you try, but repeated applications will definitely speed up the process.


Even if the glue doesn't come off right away, don't worry — it will eventually fall off on its own. The natural oils in your hands will loosen the glue over time and it will fall off through your normal daily actions. It's rare for super glue to stick to the skin for more than about two days."

Do not fill the container completely full.
If you have sensitive skin, consider diluting the acetone with water.;
, Completely submerge the super glued skin in the acetone. Let it soak for at least two to three minutes.







, Gently rub the skin to break the glue’s bond. Once the bond is broken, remove your hands from the acetone. Carefully peel the glue from your skin.








Avoid leaving your hands in the acetone for longer than ten minutes. Acetone can irritate your skin.
If you feel resistance when removing the glue, stop and let your hands soak longer.
Do not force the glue from your skin. This is dangerous and can cause damage.

, Thoroughly wash your hands with warm water and soap. This will help to wash away any residual glue or acetone. Pat your hands dry. Acetone can dry out your skin so it is wise to apply a moisturizer after washing your hands.

Scrape with a blunt edge.,
Rub with citrus.,
Scrub with a homemade mixture.,
Wait for a few days.",How to Get Gorilla Glue off Hands1," Use a knife-sharpening stone, pumice stone, or other gritty or rough material to scrub your skin. Use a strong but slow motion to avoid tearing your skin, and alternate by rubbing with your fingers to prevent friction burns. Attempt this for several minutes, then move on if the glue shows no sign of balling up or peeling off.


If nothing else is available, use a scrap of wood or a thick index card.;
, Rub one of the following oil-based materials onto your hands for several minutes:









Hand lotion, olive oil, sunflower oil, or baby oil are all gentle on skin. Increase the effectiveness by heating it for about 10 seconds in the microwave, and/or by mixing in a pinch of salt to add friction.
Lip gloss, lip balm, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), nonstick cooking spray, or oil-based makeup removers are additional options. Also Argan oil with raw Shea oil is a very good solvent.
Polyglycol body lotion may be extra effective., Use a blunt butter knife or your fingernails to scrape away at the edge of the glue, while it is still oily. Avoid sharp blades, which may ""succeed"" by cutting off your protective outer layer of skin.








, Some people report success when rubbing slices of lemon or lime on the glue, or rubbing with a citrus oil or skin-safe citrus-based cleaner.









This method may sting if the gorilla glue or exfoliation has caused dry, cracked, or torn skin.

, Wipe off your hand of the previous ointment, then track down the ingredients for a potentially more effective mixture. Industrial users of MDI, the bonding ingredient in Gorilla Glue, use the following mixture to clean up spills:








Washing soda / soda ash (5 to 10%)
Liquid detergent (0.2 to 2%)
Water (add to reach 100%)

, The glue will wear off along with your regular skin replacement, with the stain fading completely in about four or five days. Waiting is recommended over using harsh chemicals, which are often ineffective and may damage skin.









Keep your hands moisturized with lotion during this wait, as gorilla glue can cause dry or cracked skin.

Try using olive oil with the salt.,
Use acetone to dissolve the glue.,
Apply laundry detergent.,
Use the salt rub as an exfoliator.",How to Get Super Glue off of Your Hands with Salt2," Olive oil (and other cooking oils like canola oil, peanut oil, etc.) work just as well as water for making a salt paste. They also provide a few side benefits on top of this — for instance, they're good natural moisturizers and leave skin feeling soft and smooth. Some also find that oils give their skin a healthy, attractive ""glow.""


Note, however, that oils aren't always a wise idea. If you have naturally oily skin already, adding extra oil may cause blemishes, for instance.

, Acetone is a chemical solvent used to dissolve certain types of adhesives and plastic compounds. Using acetone in your paste instead of water will make most types of super glue dissolve much faster than normal. However, care must be taken — acetone can be harsh on dry or delicate skin, so use it in moderation and follow up with a moisturizer.


Acetone is found in most (but not all) nail polish removers. Check the ingredients label on a bottle of nail polish remover before using it — non-acetone products may not work as well.

, Laundry detergent is great for working away at dried-on super glue. However, you won't want to substitute it for the water in the method above. Instead, add a drop of detergent to a small amount of water in a bowl (no more than 1-2 tablespoons) and mix salt into this. Use the resulting soapy paste to break down the super glue.


Rinse well with water when you're done. Leftover soapy residue on your hands can make its way into your next meal if you don't wash your hands. While this is unlikely to be dangerous, it can make you sick.

, The salt rub in the method above can be a great homemade beauty product even if you don't have super glue on your hands. Rubbing clean skin gently with the rub removes the top layer of dead cells, leaving your skin looking fresh and healthy.


Best of all, since the only ingredients are salt and water (or oil), this DIY exfoliating scrub stores well. Just keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place and the paste should keep for months.

, Pour the gas slowly onto the rag to avoid soaking it through.


A small amount of gas should work. Too much may damage the exterior of your vehicle, so use sparingly.
Be careful not to completely drench the rag because it will increase skin contact with the gasoline. Prolonged contact with gas may cause skin burns, so it's important to thoroughly wash your hands after handling the rag.You can choose to wear gloves to protect your skin, but do not wear latex gloves. The hydrocarbons in petroleum products can cause latex gloves to erode, which can cause skin damage., Make circles as if you were washing the car. The glue should start to move from the car's surface in a short time.

, Although gas often evaporates on its own, it can damage car paint or finishes if left alone. This can lead to premature corrosion. Mix some warm water and car soap and cleanse the area. Use a clean rag to dry to area."

Put on gloves, goggles, and a mask.,
Wear clothes that cover your skin.,
Soak the surface in acetone.,
Aim a heat gun at the epoxy for several minutes.,
Heat small areas at a time.,
Scrape off the heated epoxy.",How to Remove Epoxy1," When heating epoxy, vapors will be produced that are not friendly to your eyes. Do not settle for wearing glasses. You need a pair of goggles that covers your eyes completely, sitting flush against your skin, with no holes or air entry points. Similarly, you should wear rubber gloves that come down at least 3 inches from your wrist. If at all possible, find ones made with elastic so that air won’t seep in. Finally, wear a simple fabric face mask to protect your lungs., Find a pair of tight pants and a tight fitting long-sleeve shirt. If the shirt is a button-up, make sure all of the buttons are secure. This is meant to protect your skin from reacting to any vapors that may arise from heating the epoxy.

, If the epoxy is attached to a wooden surface, soak the area in acetone for an hour or more before using heat to soften the epoxy. You can either place the object into acetone, or drip acetone onto the surface where the epoxy is set in. Acetone will only soak into a wooden surface.When dealing with epoxy on plastic, marble, cement, vinyl or metal, any chemical will interact with the top of the surface, but they do not penetrate down into the layers like they do with wood.

, The objective is to raise the epoxy temperature to over 200 degrees, its softening point. Work the heat gun in small strokes, rather than letting it stay at the same position for minutes at a time. If the epoxy is on a plastic or wooden surface, keep an eye on the surface so you don't warm it up too much and burn it.Rather than using a heat gun, you can use a soldering iron. After the iron is heated, apply it directly to a specific area of the epoxy bond line. This will soften the epoxy.If the epoxy you are seeking to heat is located on an object, rather than the floor tiling, you can place it on a hot plate. This will accomplish the same thing as the heat gun, and is more frequently available.

, Don’t heat the entire bond line of epoxy at once or you won’t be able to keep the epoxy hot for long enough. Instead, work on segments that are about 2-3 inches in length. After you have one segment done, work on the segment right next to the first. It will be easier to scrape off with a now open edge., Use a strong, plastic scraper to remove the epoxy from the surface. You may notice that the heat did not penetrate all the way down into all of the layers of epoxy. In this case, keep reheating the area and scrape until all the epoxy has been removed.Do not heat right after you have already heated an area. Wait a few minutes for the epoxy to cool off before you go back and reheat. Otherwise you could cause the area to catch on fire.
Do not use scrapers made of metal because they can easily cause damage.

Clean the area with soap and water.,
Use a hairdryer to warm the glue.,
Gently peel the sticker off.,
Use tree sap remover to clear any remaining glue residue.",How to Get Glue off a Car2," Be sure to remove any dirt or other grime to ensure you don’t damage the surface of the vehicle while you’re working.

, The heat makes the glue more pliable and easier to remove without damage to the paint. Using high heat for no more than a few minutes should be enough to loosen the glue or sticker residue., Use a plastic card to scrape the glue away. If the sticker starts to tear, use the card to scrape from the other side to prevent residue from sticking to the car.

, Tree sap remover helps to dissolve the remaining glue without causing damage. Follow the product’s instructions, give the remover some time to set in, and then wipe the glue away with a towel.These products are specially formatted to remove sticky substances.
Some tree sap removers you can purchase include Goo Gone, Ex-Con, and Mötsenböcker. These solutions can generally be purchased at a local home improvement store or big box retailer.

Take a clean cloth and blot the stain with the soap mixture.,
Blot the area with cool water.,
Dry the area with a clean cloth.",How to Get Glue off a Car3," If you are using glue to add trim or other detailing on the inside of your car, you may accidentally get glue on the seats. You can use a plastic card or other tool to remove the glue. This makes it easier to remove the part adhering to the car’s upholstery.


This step may only be effective if the glue hasn't fully set into the upholstery. Removing it as soon as possible is most effective, if possible.

, Use one tablespoon of liquid dish soap and two cups of cold water.Epoxy and super glue may not come out of fabric upholstery with soap and water. Acetone, such as nail polish remover, can be used to loosen the glue. Be sure to wash the spot with soap and water afterward to prevent damage to the upholstery., Use the cloth to absorb the liquid and repeat until the glue stain disappears.

, This ensures all the soap is out of the upholstery.

, Use a clean, dry cloth to soak up any remaining moisture.

Rinse the stain out from behind using cold water as soon as possible.,
Treat heavy stains with hydrogen peroxide.Pour hydrogen peroxide directly onto the blood stain.,
Try an ammonia-based window cleaner.,
Use diluted ammonia for heavy stains.,
Make and use a baking soda paste.,
Consider using salt and dish soap as a pre-laundry treatment.,
Make your own stain remover using baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and water.,
Launder your bed sheets in cold water after any stain-removal treatment.",How to Get Blood out of Sheets1," Take the bed sheet off the mattress first, then rinse the stain out using cold water. Do not use hot water, as this will set the stain. Follow this step with any of the stain-removal treatments listed below.;
, Wait 20 to 25 minutes, then lightly pat the residue with a paper towel. If you don't have any hydrogen peroxide at home, you can use club soda instead.


White vinegar will also work in a pinch.Light can turn hydrogen peroxide into water. If it is very bright in your room, cover the treated area with plastic wrap, then drape a dark towel over it. The towel will hide the area from light, and the plastic wrap will prevent the towel from soaking up the hydrogen peroxide.

, Simply spray the window cleaner onto the stain. Wait 15 minutes, then rinse it out from behind using cold water., Fill a spray bottle with 1 tablespoon of ammonia and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold water. Close the bottle and shake it to mix. Spray the mixture onto the stain and wait 30 to 60 minutes. Blot up any residue with a clean cloth, then wash the sheets in cold water.Be careful with colored sheets. Ammonia may fade or bleach colored fabrics.

, Mix one part baking soda with two parts water to form a paste. Dampen the stain with water, then rub the paste onto the stain. Let the fabric dry, ideally in the sun. Brush off any residue, and then wash in cold water.Talcum powder or cornstarch/cornflour will also work., Mix 2 tablespoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of dish soap.Dampen the stain with cold water first, then soak it with the soap mixture. Wait 15 to 30 minutes, then rinse the stain out using cold water.You can also use shampoo instead of dish soap.

, Fill a spray bottle with 1 part baking soda, 1 part hydrogen peroxide, and ½ part cold water. Close the bottle, and shake it to mix. Spray the mixture onto the stain, wait 5 minutes, then rinse it off. Repeat 2 more times, then wash the sheets in cold water.This works best on polyester-cotton blends.

, Use cold water, a mild detergent, and your usual wash cycle. Remove the wet sheets as soon as the cycle ends. Do not place them in the dryer. Instead, let them air dry either by hanging or in the sun.


Treat the blood stains again if they do not come out after the first wash cycle. You will need to continue treating and washing until the blood is no longer visible. Once you get the blood out, you can dry the sheets as you normally would.
Consider using bleach on white sheets.

Wear safety gloves, goggles, and a mask.,
Open your windows and doors.,
Shake your can of refrigerant.,
Spray your refrigerant on the epoxy.,
Chip away the brittle epoxy.",How to Remove Epoxy2," You will need a pair of goggles that sits tight on the face, not letting any air in. You will also need a large pair of rubber gloves that go down at least 3 inches from the wrist. Also wear a fabric face mask so that you don’t breathe in the vapors given off by the refrigerant. This is for your own safety, so that you do not get refrigerant in your eyes or on your skin. This is a dangerous chemical that could cause physical harm. , This allows air to move freely and carry vapors from the refrigerant outside. If you don't open them, the fumes can build up, and make it very dangerous to breathe the air. As the airflow is moving, you should place your kids and pets in a safe room with the door closed. This will prevent them from breathing in fumes.


Make sure to turn your air conditioning or heating unit off so that the fresh air doesn’t pull the vapors in.

, Refrigerant sprays can be found in multiple brands at more hardware stores. When you purchase a can, you will want to shake it before using, just like any other spray can. Then you want to hold it about 1 foot away from the epoxy you want to spray. Make sure you are holding the can upright, otherwise the liquid will leak out., The spray will quickly drop the temperature of anything it touches. The epoxy will freeze and turn brittle. Do NOT put your hands near the area you are spraying. Make sure that your gloves and goggles are secure before you begin spraying. If you have children or pets, do not let them near the area., Use a plastic putty knife or hit the epoxy with a rubber mallet or hammer. The epoxy should be cold enough that it turns to crystals and breaks off easily. You will then want to sweep the crystals up into a dustpan, and immediately dump them into the trashcan. You can use a vacuum cleaner to make sure that you get rid of all of the remaining microscopic crystals.Be careful not to damage your surface by putting too much pressure on the epoxy. If it doesn't break apart easily, try adding more spray cooler to chill the resin even more.

Spray deodorizer.",How to Clean Vomit out of Carpet," You want to cover your hands to protect them from the vomit. This not only keeps your hands away from the unpleasant substance, but also protects you from germs.;
, As soon as the vomit hits the floor, grab a scraper or other flat sided object.Scrape the thick pieces into a dustpan or plastic bag.

, Another way to clean up vomit is to pick it up in a towel. After gathering all the vomit you can into the towel, place it into the washer. You can also pick up the vomit with paper towels instead of towels and place them directly into the trash.


One thing to think about when washing vomit towels is that if it has chunks, they may get stuck in the washing machine.

, Use old cereal or soda boxes or the back of a composition notebook as a scoop. Gently slide the cardboard under the thickest sections, and then toss into the trashcan. You can make two pieces, one to push the vomit onto the other like a makeshift, disposable broom and dustpan., Turn a plastic bag inside out on your hand as a makeshift glove. Use the bag to pick up any vomit that you can. Then, turn the bag right side out and tie the handles. Drop the bag in the trashcan.


Make sure the bag doesn't have any holes in it so you don't get vomit on your hands.

, Another way you can get vomit off the carpet is to pick it up with a spatula. Slide the flat side under the vomit and lift it off the carpet. You can also use a spoon to scoop it up.


Don't use a spatula that has slits in it. The vomit will fall through if you do.
Disinfect the spoon or spatula after you clean the vomit.

, Immediately after someone vomits, cover it with sand. Allow the sand to combine and clump with the vomit, then use a broom and dustpan to sweep it up., No matter which way you get the excess vomit off your carpet, do not rub it into the carpet. Pressing down when removing the vomit can push the vomit into the carpet fibers, making it twice as difficult to remove.


Towels can result in vomit pressed into the carpet.Sliding flat objects, like spatulas, cardboard, or scrapers, under the vomit might help prevent this.

, Baking soda is a great product to use on vomit spots. It dries up the excess moisture, resulting in little clumps. Pour a liberal amount over the stain. Leave the baking soda on for 10-15 minutes, or until the clumps have started to dry. Then, vacuum the area, removing all the clumps. Repeat if necessary.


If the vomit doesn't have a lot of thick chunks to begin with, try spreading baking soda over the area and leaving overnight. The baking soda will soak into it and turn it into clumps.Use the tube to vacuum up the clumps instead of the regular vacuum head., Another way to dry up the moisture left behind is to sprinkle cornstarch over the area. Make sure to completely cover the area. Allow the cornstarch to dry for 10-15 minutes, then vacuum using the hose tube., Spray or pour warm water onto the area. Using a clean rag, start blotting out the moisture. Don't scrub because that could push any remaining debris into the carpet. When the towel gets saturated, get a clean towel and repeat.


When you blot, put some force into it to get out the water. Press down hard; just remember not to scrub.
Use white towels so you don't transfer any patterns or dyes to your carpet.
Instead of a rag, you could also use paper towels.

, Fill a spray bottle with club soda, or just pour directly onto the stain. Press a clean rag to the stain, blotting up the moisture until the stain is removed. Add more club soda and use a dry, clean rag as needed.

, Put dry cleaning solvent, such as Dryel, onto a clean rag. Blot the stain with the dry cleaning solvent soaked rag until the solvent has been absorbed., Mix equal parts vinegar and cold water in a spray bottle. Liberally spray the area with vinegar. Let the vinegar sit for 15 minutes. Then, use a dry, clean cloth to dab at the stain, soaking up the vinegar.


After you have soaked up most of the vinegar, use a stiff brush to rub at the stain until it starts to loosen. Go back over the stain with a dry cloth again.
You can also add 6 drops purification essential oil to help cover the odor, and 8 drops thieves essential oil, which is thought to kill 99% of germs.You can use white or apple cider vinegar for this.
Don't scrub with the cloth.
Don't overspray the area. You want to cover the stain, but not soak the carpet.

, Mix 1 part hydrogen peroxide with 1 part water or dish soap. Pour the mixture over the carpet and let sit for 30 minutes. Gently rub the area with a rag, causing a lather to form. Blot up the moisture with a dry towel.


Pour water over the spot afterwards to rinse the area of the soap. It's important to rinse the soap from the carpet because soap can hold dirt and dust.

, Mix together 2 cups of warm water, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1/2 cup of white vinegar, 1 tablespoon of clear dish or laundry detergent, and 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol.Use a sponge to spread the cleaner over the stain. Blot the stain with a dry, clean towel until all the moisture has been removed.


Make sure to rinse the area after the stain is removed. Cover the area in water, then blot up with a towel. Do this two or three times.

, Use a carpet stain remover. Good ones to try are enzyme-based stain removers for pets or car upholstery cleaners. Make sure to follow the directions on the bottle.

, If the stain is severe, think about using a carpet cleaning machine. If you own a wet vac, use it over the stain. If you don't own your own, many supermarkets carry carpet cleaning machines that you can rent.

, Mix 1 tablespoon of ammonia with 1 cup of water. Spray or pour the mixture over the stain. Use a sponge or towel to dab the ammonia over the stain. Then, rinse with water and blot with towels.


Don't use ammonia if you have pets. It might attract them to the spot and encourage them to urinate there., Spray the stain with a mixture containing 2 parts water and 1 part white vinegar. Place a damp white rag over the stain. With your iron on the steam setting, iron over the spot for 30 seconds, repeating multiple times if necessary.The stain should transfer from the carpet to the towel.


Don't hold the iron in one place - it could scorch or burn the towel. Instead, gently slide the iron back and forth over the area where the stain is.
Never iron carpet directly. Always put a towel between the carpet and the iron. Otherwise, you might burn or scorch your carpet.

, After you've cleaned the stain, sprinkle a liberal amount of baking soda on the area. Baking soda is an alkaline and helps stop acids, which are found in vomit. It also neutralizes odors instead of covering them up.Let the baking soda sit overnight, then vacuum the next day. It will also help absorb any left over moisture.

, Mix equal parts vinegar and water together, and spray or pour onto the smelly area. It will help get rid of, or at least lessen, the odor.The downside to vinegar is that it can leave a smell behind.

, Get an odor neutralizing spray like Febreze or Renuzit. Choose one of these neutralizing sprays instead of an air freshener. Potpourri and floral air fresheners just cover the odors, which can sometimes mix with the vomit smell and make it worse. The neutralizing sprays help eliminate the odors.

Select the right nail polish remover.,
Apply nail polish remover to the exposed skin.,
Peel off the super glue after it dissolves.",How to Get Super Glue Off Skin1," Acetone is the substance in nail polish remover that helps dissolve superglue for removal. You need an acetone-based remover in order for this method to be successful.Check the ingredients label of your nail polish remover. Acetone should be listed here, usually towards the top of the list.
If your nail polish remover does not have acetone, you can try another removal method, or you can purchase one that does contain acetone. Acetone-based nail polish remover is readily available in most department stores, or you can purchase straight acetone at your local home improvement store. Wear gloves and a mask while using the acetone.;
, It's safe to use acetone-based remover on small patches of skin, but keep it away from your eyes and mouth. Apply the remover to the affected area with a cotton swab or paper towel.








Nail polish remover can eat through the finish on tables and furniture. If you're working at a table, lay a protective covering down over the area. It's best to work over the sink.
Do not use this method to remove superglue from sensitive areas like the eyelids and lips.

, After a few minutes, you should notice the superglue is turning white and beginning to flake off the skin. You can now begin gently peeling the glue off the affected area. It should come off fairly easily at this point.








If the glue is not coming off easily, you can use a nail file to rub the glue off the skin. Be careful when working with a nail file, as you do not want to accidentally rub off a layer of skin. Stop if you start to feel pain.

, Before cleaning a blood stain from leather, you should test the cleaning agent on the leather fabric. Choose a section of the material that is not visible and place a few drops of the cleaning agent onto the fabric. For example, test the bottom of a handbag, the heel of a shoe, or the back of a sofa., You should wait approximately five minutes to see if the cleaning agent stained the fabric. If you notice any discolouration, or if the leather begins to crack, you should not proceed with cleaning the larger stain.

Fresh stains are far easier to treat than old ones.",How to Remove Yellow Armpit Stains," There are multiple ways to get out those yellow stains. Whether your choice is based on a friend’s raving review, or because you already have the product in your cabinet, decide which remedy is the best fit. Choose from the following products then look to the subsequent steps for each individual product.


Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)
OxiClean (baking soda and hydrogen peroxide)
Vodka
Dish Detergent
White Vinegar
Crushed Aspirin (kept safely away from children)
;
, Thoroughly moisten the stain by pouring the water over the fabric or sponging it on.


Stains are actually created by perspiration reacting to the aluminum found in most deodorants and antiperspirants. The combination of the protein found in your sweat combining with the aluminum creates the yellow stain. As the stain is protein based, immediate exposure to hot water sets in the stain.However, hot water is best for actually removing the stain. After submerging in cool water and treating with the remedy of your choice it is advised to wash in hot water to purge the remaining soils.

, No matter which of the previous products you have chosen, in order to activate the cleaning agents you must mix with warm water. Ratios and mixing specifications for each of the products are listed below.


OxiClean, vodka, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar and dish detergent should all be mixed in a container at a 1-1 ratio.
Baking soda should be mixed to water at a 3-1 ratio.
Aspirin pills must first be crushed. Use 3-4 pills and then mix into a bowl of warm water. See How to Remove Sweat Stains With Aspirin for more specific instructions. Keep aspirin out of reach of children, and be careful not to inhale any any of its particles as it's being crushed.


, After the ingredients have been properly combined you will discover which form your solution has taken.


Baking soda will produce a paste.
Vodka, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar and aspirin will dissolve into a liquid. You will be soaking the garment or stained area in this mixture, so be sure to have a large enough container for the task.
OxiClean and dish detergent will dissolve into water with the given 1-1 ratio. However, you can also create a paste by using more OxiClean or detergent at a 3-1 ratio. Some prefer the paste solution, believing it fights harder against tough stains. , Make sure you have completely covered the stain before proceeding.

, You may need to apply more paste as the fabric absorbs the solution. You will start to see the stain fade away.


Although the baking soda paste works well on its own, you can also try pouring vinegar over the stain while you scrub. The vinegar will immediately bubble up, so use caution.
Baking soda is a base while vinegar is an acid, so the two combined produce an explosion of sorts in the form of bubbles. This reaction’s abrasive qualities helps eliminate residue while the bubbles lift the stain out of the fabric. , This will give the cleaning agents enough time to settle in and break up the chemicals causing discoloration.


If the stains are especially bad, let the treatment sit overnight.

,


Some materials do not react well with heat, either shrinking the garment or fading the color. Check the garment’s tags for washing instructions. , Tough stains may not completely fade after the first treatment. Scrub more paste into the stain, let sit and wash again until the discoloration has completely faded.


If using OxiClean or detergent paste, try soaking tough stains in the liquid form as well. This will increase the stain-fighting power. Follow the steps in the section below. ,


Mix baking soda or higher proportions of OxiClean, detergent or crushed aspirin with water in order to create a paste.
Scrub the paste into the stain with a toothbrush or nailbrush as described above. Let sit for an hour.

, You really only need to soak the stained portion, but you can submerge the entire garment if you like.


For lesser stains, soaking may not be necessary. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and apply to stained areas. Generously spray and allow the solution to soak in before washing as usual.
If you have sensitive skin you may want to wear rubber gloves for the following steps, as the cleaning agents contain strong chemicals.
Stay away from bleach products when soaking clothing, as the chemical oxidize dyes which could lead to discoloration. The items listed in this article do not contain bleach and should be fabric safe.

, Soaking time really depends on how light or dark the stain. Lighter stains may only need to sit for 15 to 30 minutes, while dark stains can sit for a few hours, possibly even overnight. Monitor your garment. If the stain fades quickly, remove from the soak. If the stain barely fades in an hour, leave overnight.
If a garment has been stained for a long period of time, it will be harder to remove. Try to treat your armpit stains as soon as they appear.

Some materials do not react well with heat, either shrinking the garment or fading the color. Check the garment’s tags for washing instructions.

,


Stains are actually created by perspiration reacting to the aluminum found in most deodorants and antiperspirants. The combination of the protein found in your sweat combining with the aluminum creates the yellow stain.
Tom’s of Maine makes an aluminum free line of deodorant.

, Caking on the deodorant or antiperspirant could lead to worse discoloration. Try to use sparingly. Excess deodorant will only cling onto your clothing and create more stains.

, Before wearing, after washing, turn the garment inside out. Sprinkle baby powder liberally over armpit areas and iron. This works best for cotton or cotton blend fabrics.

, To keep stains away from nicer dress shirts, use an undershirt as a buffer zone between your sweat and the garment. , By consistently treating the stain, you keep the garment clean and prevent it from settling into the fabric. "

Take the bed sheet off, and soak the stain in cold water for several hours to overnight.,
Try using white vinegar.,
Consider using a paste made from meat tenderizer and water.,
Use laundry detergent and water on light stains.,
Use hydrogen peroxide on stubborn stains.,
Soak extra stubborn stains in borax and water for several hours to over night.,
Launder your sheets after any stain-removal treatment.",How to Get Blood out of Sheets2," The cold water soak will help loosen any dried blood. You can also wash the bed sheets in your washing machine. Use cold water and a mild detergent. This will not necessarily remove the stain, but it will help loosen it. Follow this step with any of the stain-removal treatments listed below.


Keep in mind that the stain may be permanent, especially if it has been through the dryer. Heat sets stains, so if you put your stained bed sheets into the dryer, the blood may have been baked into the fabric.

, For a small stain, fill a bowl with vinegar first, then soak the stain in the bowl. For a larger stain, place towel or rag under stain first, then pour vinegar over the stain. Wait 30 minutes (for both small and large stains), then wash the bed sheet as usual using cold water.

, Mix 1 tablespoon of meat tenderizer and 2 teaspoons of cold water into a paste. Spread the paste onto the stain, making sure to work it into the fabric. Wait 30 to 60 minutes, then brush the paste off. Wash the sheets in cold water., In a small cup, combine 1 part laundry detergent and 5 parts water. Stir to mix, then apply the solution to the stain. Pat it in with a soft-bristled brush and wait 10 to 15 minutes. Blot the stain with a damp sponge or towel, then pat it dry with a white towel., Pour some hydrogen peroxide onto the stain, and pat it with wait a soft-bristled brush. Wait 5 to 10 minutes, then blot the stain with a damp sponge or rag. Pat the stain again with a clean, dry towel.Light turns hydrogen peroxide into water. If it is very bright in your room, cover stain with plastic wrap, then place a towel over it.
Do a spot test on colored sheets first. Hydrogen peroxide may fade or bleach colored fabrics.
Use full-strength ammonia as a last resort. Avoid it on colored bed sheets., Follow the instructions on the box of borax to create a soaking solution. Dunk the stain in the solution for several hours to overnight. Rinse it out the following day with water, then hang it up to dry., Use cold water, a mild detergent, and you usual cycle setting. Remove the wet sheets as soon as the cycle ends. Do not place them in the dryer. Instead, let them air dry either by hanging or in the sun.


The blood stains may not come out right away. If this happens, simply repeat the stain removal process.
Consider using bleach on white sheets.

Wear goggles, safety gloves, and a mask.,
Open up windows and doors.,
Choose a chemical that will soften epoxy.,
Apply the stripping agent.,
Mix a cleaning solution.,
Scrape the epoxy resin from the surface.",How to Remove Epoxy3," Using chemical agents can be very dangerous to your eyes, mouth, and skin. You will need to buy a pair of goggles that sits flat against the face, with no holes where air can get through. You will also have to purchase a thick pair of rubber gloves that comes down at least 3 inches from the wrist. Also wear a simple fabric face mask, so that you do not breathe in any dangerous vapors., This is incredibly important because you need airflow. Air will carry the harmful vapors of the chemicals towards the outside of your house. If your windows and doors remained closed, you will likely breathe in chemical agents which are hazardous to your health.Make sure to turn your air conditioning or heating unit off so that the fresh air doesn’t pull the vapors in.

, It is also critical that the chemical agent does not damage the surface on which it is stuck to. Chemicals may damage certain surfaces such as cloth, plastic or vinyl. The strong chemicals may actually eat away at surfaces before they soften the epoxy glue.Stay away from Class 3 and 4 oxidizers. These agents can cause spontaneous combustion, or can catch on fire down the road.
Try a paint thinner. The acetone in most paint thinners can soften up hardened epoxy, but be prepared to let the epoxy and object to which it is stuck to soak for at least an hour.
Use a commercial stripping agent. These are usually available at most hardware stores., You can either drip some of the agent directly onto the epoxy, or put some on a washcloth, and dab the epoxy. Either way, make sure that enough agent makes it's way onto the epoxy. After the agent has been applied, wait at least an hour before you come back to it.Work in small steps, 2-3 inches at a time. If the area is too wide, the chemical agent will likely not work as effectively.
Make sure that children and pets are not around when you are applying the chemical agent.

, After the chemical stripping agent sits for an hour, you will need to neutralize it before you scrape it off. In a medium sized bucket, mix together 2-3 tablespoons of trisodium phosphate and a gallon of hot water. You can either pull the mixture onto the stripping agent, or dab it on with a sponge. Let it sit, and neutralize the agent for at least 5 minutes., Scrape the resin off with a sharp, strong, plastic scraper. You will want to immediately place the epoxy in a paper towel, and throw it away in a trash can. The goal is to not let the chemical agents get anywhere near you. If some epoxy is still stuck to the surface, soak the remaining epoxy in the chemical for a while longer before trying to scrape it off.When you have scraped the epoxy off, wash the area down with a rag soaked in warm water and soap. You do not want the chemicals to linger around, especially with children and pets in the house.

Wash the skin in warm, soapy water.,
Use petroleum jelly.,
Try vegetable oil.,
Apply WD-40.,
Use hand lotion.",How to Get Super Glue Off Skin2," Several applications of warm, soapy water can eventually get superglue off of the skin. You can use tap water and basic bathroom soap. Immerse the affected skin in a sink full of warm, soapy water.








Try peeling the superglue off your skin after soaking it.
If it does not come off the first time, you may have to wash the area a few more times. It may take a few attempts for superglue to be removed with soap and water.

, Massaging your skin with petroleum jelly may remove superglue. It may also help prevent skin damage due to superglue exposure. If you don't have petroleum jelly in your cabinet, it can be purchased at most drugstores. Some lip balms also contain petroleum jelly. If you have lip balm on you, check to see if petroleum jelly is listed as an ingredient.








Spend a couple of minutes massaging the affected skin with petroleum jelly.
The super glue should begin to come off. Continue to massage until all the super glue flakes off.
When you're done, you can wash your hands with soap and water to remove excess glue and petroleum jelly.
You can also try scented orange jelly. The acids from the orange can help remove the glue.

, Apply vegetable oil to a cloth or a paper towel. Rub the affected skin with the cloth. Within a couple of minutes, superglue should begin to come off of your skin.








If you do not have vegetable oil, almond oil and baby oil can be used instead.

, WD-40 is a penetrating oil that can help your remove the super glue from your skin. If you have it on hand, try using it to remove the glue. Spray the oil onto a paper towel and then hold it against your skin for a few minutes. Remove the towel and see if you can peel off the super glue.

You can also try a silicone-based cleaner.

, Rub some hand lotion on your skin. Any lotion you have on hand should work. Keep rubbing until the super glue begins to peel off.








Like petroleum jelly, hand lotion can also restore moisture to your skin. This will help prevent some potential damage from super glue exposure. If you're prone to dry skin, this may be a good method for you.

Remove the grease.,
Use a stain remover.,
Agitate the stain.,
Wash the shirt.,
Take it to a professional.,
Don't let the stain set.,
Change your hygiene routine.,
Switch shampoos.,
Use white shirts.,
Make sweat strips.",How to Remove Stubborn Ring Around the Collar," The first thing you want to do is to remove the grease, so that you can reach the stain underneath. There are a number of ways to do this and which you choose should be based on preference and what is available to you. Try:


Soaking the shirt in dish detergent. Cover the collar stain in regular liquid dish soap, like Dawn. Let it soak for an hour (or more) and then rinse it out. The shirt will probably need to be wet first, to really help the soap soak in.
Using Fast Orange or similar degreasers. Use products like Fast Orange, which are designed to cut through kitchen grease. Spray them on, allow them to soak for 5 minutes, and then rinse them away. Be careful of very harsh products though, as these can irritate the skin.
Using shampoo for greasy hair. Using shampoo designed for greasy hair in a similar process as described above for Dawn can yield surprising results.
Adding to the grease. If none of the other methods work, some people swear by adding more grease to the shirt collar. In theory, the new fat molecules bond to the old ones and help drawn them out. Use products like lanolin hand cleaners, which can be found at drug stores or car shops.;
, After you've gotten the grease out, you should be left with the actual stain. It should be much easier to remove with the grease gone. Again, there are a few different approaches.


Use Shout. This is a common, basic, stain removal product available at many stores. Spray it on, let it set, and wash the shirt as normal.
Use Oxyclean. This is another common cleaning product. If you don't have Oxyclean, you can make your own: it's basically just baking soda and hydrogen peroxide mixed together. Oxyclean will need to be placed on the stain and may need to be worked around to get the lifting effect. Just rub the shirt against itself.

, Though it certainly shouldn't be your first option, you will likely get better results if you agitate the stain. Use an old toothbrush to gently scrub at the stain while it is covered in the degreaser or stain-remover. As long as you don't do this too often (rely on preventative measures), your shirt should be fine and remain unharmed.

, After you've used the degreaser and stain-remover, you can wash the shirt as normal. Do not dry the shirt, however, until you've done as much as you can to remove the stain. A dryer is a great way to set-in stains.

, If you're not having any luck, try taking the shirt to a professional dry cleaner. They may have better ways of removing the stain, and a single shirt rarely costs very much money at all.

, If you want to make the stain easier to remove in the future, do what you can to make sure it doesn't set. As soon as you notice a stain forming, treat it. Don't put the shirt in a dryer if you notice the stain hasn't been removed as much as possible. In general, do whatever you can to treat the stains before they become too dark.

, The collar stain is the result of grease and sweat mixing together in a bad way, so one way to prevent the stains from forming is to make some adjustments to your hygiene routine. Shower more often, use roll-on antiperspirant on your neck, or use baby powder on your neck to help absorb the grease and sweat.

, Some shampoos may mix badly with your unique body chemistry. If nothing you do seems to help prevent the stains, try switching to a different brand and style of shampoo.

, Lean towards using white shirts, instead of colored shirts. The stains may be more noticeable more quickly, but they're easier to treat. As long as you have a white shirt, all you have to worry about removing is some of the grease. After that, bleach can be used to remove the rest, as well as the stain.

, It is possible to purchase sweat strips, which are stickers that go on your collar to help prevent stains. You can make your own too, if you're crafty or know someone who is. Add a snap-in, button-in, or velcro strip to the collars of the worst offenders. These can be removed and washed as needed.

, Before you start, you’ll want to test the removal product that you’ve chosen on a small area of the fabric. Choose an area that is inconspicuous and isn’t noticeable. This way, you’ll know if the product will stain your fabric. Some delicate fabrics, like satin or silk, are more likely to become stained than more durable fabrics, like cotton or polyester.If the removal product does happen to stain your garment, choose another removal product. Test this new product in another inconspicuous area to make sure it doesn’t stain.

Set your iron on high and wait for it to heat up. Do not use the steam setting.You will also need paper towels for this method.

, Lay the garment on the ironing board with the sticky stain face up. Cover the stain with two layers of paper towels. The paper towels should cover the entire sticky area, so if you have a very large stain you may need a few more paper towels.


This method works well for sticky substances, like the adhesive on the back of stickers, that have been put through the wash.

, Take your iron and press down on top of the paper towel covered stain. Hold the iron on the stain for about 5 to 10 seconds. This heats the sticky goo up, making it easier to remove.

Hang to dry.",How to Remove Spots from Linen1," The longer a stain is allowed to sit on your nice tablecloth or summer dress, the harder it will be to get out. Whether a stain is from food or ink or anything else, drawing it out from linens will work best when it hasn't yet dried.


Some older stains require dry cleaning to be removed.
Dry cleaning can ruin linens so it’s imperative that you try and treat stains quickly so that you don’t have to resort to harsher methods to remove the stain.;
, Use a flat butter knife or spoon to gently lift off any residue. For example, jelly can be scooped up with a spoon so that there’s less of a mess to clean up. You want to remove as much of the substance as possible before beginning to treat the stain.Do not squeeze or press the linen or stain. Doing so may grind the stain substance into the fibers of the linen and make it harder to get out.
You can gently shake off residual liquids like wine or juice instead of wringing them out.

, Gently dab up and down with a paper towel, for example, to lift the stain from your linens to the towel. Work from the outside of the stain’s perimeter to the inside. This will prevent the pressure of blotting from spreading the stain., For best results, use a specific product for removing stains rather than regular soap. A chemical reaction is an efficient way of removing stains from your linens. Lay out your linen and place a few paper towels or rag clothes underneath to catch excess liquid.


Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and add a few drops at a time of vinegar. Blot the stain with a paper towel to soak up the moisture.
Lemon juice will help whiten any dingy materials. Squeeze some juice onto a stain or discolored linen item and let it sit until you see it begin to lighten, and then rinse it out.
You can also buy a stain treatment to apply to the stain like Tide or Oxyclean.
Don't even rub a stain. Rubbing and applying too much pressure will help a stain to set into the linen rather than get it out.

, Let the faucet run long enough to fill a sink, bathtub, or washing machine with enough water to cover the linens you’re washing. Hot water should only be used with an additive to help lift the stain. Heat makes stains settle into the fabric so make sure you’re adding another ingredient to the water., Because hot water alone is detrimental to proper stain removal, you need to pair it with another cleanser. You can either purchase a specific stain removal product or make your own with household items.


An example stain removing recipe is as follows: 1 scoop of Oxyclean, 1 cup of Biz, ¾ cup of ammonia, and a gallon of hot water.White vinegar will help to cut grease as well. Use an ⅛ to a ½ cup based on how big your load of laundry is.A mild dish detergent will work well too. Use a quarter to a full cup of detergent depending on how much you’re washing. , Make sure the fabric is completely saturated and under water. Let the material soak for at least an hour or overnight. Every once in a while, stir the water with a wooden spoon to agitate the water and make sure the solution is dispersed well., Put them on a gentle cycle in the washing machine and not in hot water so that the delicate fibers aren’t ruined. You can add more white vinegar, Oxyclean, or mild dish detergent to the load to help fight stubborn stains.

, Your dryer is another heat source that could cause a stain to set into the linen. Instead, air or line dry the fabrics so that you don’t undo your progress after soaking them. Hanging linens to dry also helps minimize wrinkles.

Place the stained silk over a paper towel.,
Spray the stain liberally with hairspray.,
Dab the stain with a clean cloth.,
Repeat spraying and dabbing until the stain has been removed.",How to Remove Pen Ink Stains from a Silk Dress1," Treating the ink stain immediately will make removing the stain much easier. If the ink stain is recent and hasn’t set into the material, blot the ink stain with a cloth or paper towel before using any cleaning method. Blotting the stain will absorb the excess ink from the dress so that the stain is easier to remove.;
, Though it is not often used as a cleaning substance, hairspray is one of the most effective ways to remove ink from a variety of materials, including silk. Before you use the hairspray to clean the ink stain, first place the stained portion of the silk dress over a paper towel or a towel.The paper towel or cloth will absorb the ink that may bleed through the dress as you try to remove it. You may need to put the paper towel or cloth inside the dress directly against the stained section so that the ink doesn’t bleed to the back of the dress.

, After you lay the stained portion of the dress over the paper towel, shake the can of hairspray, then aim it at the ink stain. Spray the hairspray on the stain until it is completely saturated.Use an alcohol-based hairspray as opposed to an alcohol-free hairspray.
Don’t let the hairspray dry.

, Once you have wet the stain with the hairspray, immediately dab at the ink stain using a clean cloth with gentle tapping motions. You should see the ink lifting from the dress and transferring to the cloth. Keep dabbing until the stain is completely removed or until the dabbing isn’t having any effect.Dab with patting motions instead of rubbing. Rubbing the stain can cause it to ingrain into the fabric, making it even harder to remove.

, If the first round of spraying the stain with hairspray and dabbing didn’t remove the ink stain, spray the stain again until the stain is soaked. Then dab the stain with a clean section of the towel to lift up more of the ink.Repeat the process of reapplying hairspray and dabbing with a cloth or paper towel until you don’t see any more ink lifting.
If you did remove the stain, wash your silk dress as usual to remove any leftover hairspray.
If using hairspray on the stain didn’t fully remove it, try another method of removing the stain.

Hang dry the linen if ironing is not needed.",How to Remove Spots from Linen2," Before going to any additional methods, try removing a stain the same way you would with a new stain. You may be able to get rid of the stain by simply soaking the fabric and then machine or hand washing it. If linen items are stored improperly or are put away with existing stains, it may be more difficult to remove the stains.


Fill up a bathtub or sink with cool water for soaking. Hot water needs an added cleanser to prevent stains from setting.
Every once in a while, check on the stain to see if it is being absorbed into the water.
To test the stain, lightly rub the material between your fingers to see if it's coming out. Be gentle so that you don't rub the stain into the fabric.

, If the stains persist through multiple soakings and washing, let the fabric sit in the sun for a few hours. Sunlight can also damage fabric and bleach too much, so it’s important to keep an eye out if your fabric begins to look too light. Remove your linens from the sun if they begin to fade beyond the original color.


You can put the linens out completely dry, or you can lightly mist them with a spray bottle filled with water, non-chlorine bleach, or any other liquid stain remover.Do not soak the fabric if you’re leaving it in the sun. It may create an unpleasant odor.

Continue patting until you don’t see any more of the ink lifting from the stained portion of the dress., Rubbing alcohol can sometimes leave a faint ring-like stain where it is applied. However, if you use a hairdryer to blow hot air on the stain directly after dabbing with the rubbing alcohol, you won’t have to worry about the ring- like stain.Use the hairdryer to blow on the stained area until it is dry. Make sure to use the hairdryer directly after dabbing so that the rubbing alcohol doesn’t have time to dry.

, If dabbing with rubbing alcohol didn’t work to fully remove the stain, repeat the process of dabbing the stain with rubbing alcohol and drying with hairspray until the stain is removed or you aren’t making any more progress in lifting the stain.If you were successful in removing the stain, launder your garment as usual.

A few drops of dish soap
A few drops of shampoo
A few drops of body wash

, Press the soap firmly onto the stain and rub it back and forth so that the soap gets embedded in the clothing fibers. If you're using dish soap, shampoo or body wash, use your finger to rub the soap into the stain.

, Use the type of cycle appropriate for the garment you're using. Don't add fabric softener this time!

Use this simple method primarily for linen and cotton.,
Turn the fabric so the stain is face-down.,
Flush the stain with cold water.,
Rub soap into the stain.,
Grip the stained area with both hands.,
Rub the stain against itself.,
Periodically replace the water and soap and continue rubbing.",How to Remove Dried Blood Stains from Fabric1," This method requires no special tools, but does take a significant amount of prolonged rubbing. It is especially suited to stains on natural fibres such as linen and cotton. Fabrics whose surfaces fragment into small round surface balls, known as ""bobbles"" or ""pills,"" require a longer period of more gentle rubbing. These fabrics include wool and most artificial fibres.;
, In this position, water can work at the stain from the back, pushing it outward and off the fabric. Rinsing in this position is more effective than running the water directly onto the stain.You may need to turn clothing inside out to achieve this.

, Even an old stain typically hasn't worked its way into the fabric completely, so start by removing the loosely attached surface portions. Run cold water over the back of the fabric, so it pushes through the stain. Hold the fabric in the running water for several minutes, and the stain should be at least slightly smaller.


Warning: never wash a blood stain in warm or hot water, which may cause it to bond permanently to the fibres of the fabric., Turn the fabric over so the stain is face-up. Rub bar soap into the stain generously, to produce a thick lather. Any soap can be used, but traditional solid block laundry soap may have a stiffer, more effective lather than milder hand soap.

, Roll or scrunch up two areas of fabric, on either side of the stain. Grip one in each hand to provide a good grip on the area, allowing you to rub it together.

, Turn the two handfuls of fabric so the stain is in two halves and facing each other. Rub the stained fabric against itself vigorously, or gently but quickly if the fabric is delicate. The friction you generate should slowly loosen the remaining particles of blood, which will remain in the lather rather than re-adhering to the fabric.


Gloves may be worn to protect the skin from abrasion or blisters. Tight-fitting latex or nitrile gloves may provide the least hindrance to grip and dexterity.

, If the fabric starts getting dry or losing its lather, flush the stain with fresh water and re-apply the soap. Continue rubbing each stained area in this way until it is gone. If you see no improvement after five to ten minutes, try rubbing more vigorously or move on to a different method.

To wet the stain, take a sponge or cotton swab and generously dab with alcohol.Rubbing alcohol, also known as isopropyl alcohol, works on removing grass stains because it dissolves the green pigment left behind in a grass stain.If you’re working on a delicate fabric, try a 50:50 solution of water and alcohol. Note that adding water means it may take longer to dry.

, Allow the stain to complete air dry before moving forward. The alcohol will evaporate out of the stain and most of the pigment should be dislodged. After the stain is dry, rinse it with cool water.Using cool water prevents the stain from setting. Use of hot water, or heat at all, will set the stain and make it more difficult to remove., Apply a small amount of detergent to the stain.

Find an enzymatic cleaner.,
Flush the fabric with cold running water to loosen some of the dried blood.,
Soak the fabric in cold water and enzymatic cleaner.,
Wash the fabric and let dry.",How to Remove Dried Blood Stains from Fabric3," Enzymatic cleaners break down proteins that form stains. Since blood stains bond to the fabric using proteins, enzymatic cleaners can be highly effective at removing them. However, wool and silk fibres are made from proteins, and may break apart if exposed to an enzyme product., If you are having trouble finding a cleaning product labeled ""enzymatic"" or ""enzyme cleaner,"" try a ""natural"" or ""earth-friendly"" laundry detergent or laundry pre-treatment, which often contain biodegradable enzymes.Nature's Miracle and Seventh Generation laundry detergent both fall in this category.

, Agitate the fabric with your fingers to help scrape off the crusted material, or scrape it off using a blunt knife.

, Dissolve about 120 mL (1/2 cup) of the cleaner in a bowl of cold water, then submerge the stained fabric. The soaking time will depend on how old the dried blood stain is, and how strong the cleaning product is. Soak at least one hour, or for as many as eight.


Optionally, scrub the cleaner into the stain with a toothbrush before submerging.

Untwist it and transfer it into a large, resealable plastic bag.

, Pour about 500 mL (2 cups) lemon juice and 120 mL (1/2 cup) salt into the plastic bag and seal it.

, With the bag closed, press the contents together to work the lemon juice into the fabric, focusing on the stained areas. Some of the salt should dissolve, and may help rub the lemon juice into the fabric, or abrade the stain itself.

, Let the bag sit for ten minutes. Take out the fabric from the bag and squeeze out the excess lemon juice.

, Hang the fabric on a clothesline or clothes horse, or spread it on a flat surface and leave it to dry. Do this in a sunny area, not just in front of a heater. It may feel stiff once dry, but this should go away once the item has been washed normally.

, If the blood stain is gone, wash the fabric with water to remove all the lemon salt solution. If the blood stain remains, moisten the fabric and let it dry under the sun again.

Understand the risks.,
Test on a corner of the item first.,
Consider using white vinegar.,
Try hydrogen peroxide.,
Test an ammonia mixture instead.",How to Remove Dried Blood Stains from Fabric5," The substances used in this section are powerful stain removers. However, due to their strength, they may bleach your fabric or cause permanent damage to the fibres. These methods are best used on white, non-delicate items, or as a last resort after other methods have failed.

, Once you've acquired one of the following solutions, use a cotton ball or paper towel to dab a small amount on a corner or hidden area of the fabric. Let it sit for five to ten minutes to see whether it stains your fabric.

, Vinegar is not typically as strong as the options below, but still has the potential to harm fabric. Soak the stained fabric in white vinegar for about thirty minutes, then rub the stain with your fingers as you rinse it in cool water.Repeat if the stain is noticeably improved but still present.

, A 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, which is the strength it is typically sold at, can be poured directly onto the stain or applied with a cotton ball. Be aware that it will likely bleach colored fabric. Keep the fabric in a dark place for 5-10 minutes, since light breaks down hydrogen peroxide, then blot with a sponge or cloth., Start with ""household ammonia"" or ""ammonia hydroxide,"" sold as a cleaning product. Dilute this with an equal amount of water, and leave it on the stain for fifteen minutes before blotting and rinsing.If your ""test corner"" showed signs of damage, you may wish to soak the fabric in a much weaker solution, such as 15 ml (1 tbsp) household ammonia, 1 L (1 quart) water, and a drop of liquid handwashing detergent.Warning: ammonia may destroy the protein fibres that form silk or wool.
Household ammonia is approximately 5—10% ammonia and 90–95% water.Stronger ammonia solutions are highly caustic, and should be diluted even more.

Let the soap and peroxide sink into the fabric for 30 minutes.,
Rinse the fabric with warm water.,
Soak the stain in hot water.,
Rinse the fabric in cold water.,
Hang dry.",How to Remove Dry Red Wine Stains from Cotton1," Neither of the ingredients work well on their own, but together, they are the most widely-touted method for removing dried red wine stains.The dish soap should be a non-bleach, non-alkali detergent product – although it's okay to use a bleach-based product if your cotton is white. Bleach might help you remove the stain, but it might also remove any other colors from the fabric!For a slightly stronger mixture, use one part dish detergent and two parts hydrogen peroxide.;
, First, pour a small amount of the soap-and-peroxide solution onto the stain. Use your fingers to massage the mix into the stained area. Work inward, from the outside of the stain towards the center; this should keep the stain from spreading.


Before you apply the soap-and-peroxide mixture, place a towel inside of the garment to keep the stain from transferring to the other side. This way, the towel will absorb the stain.
If you don't want to massage the stain with your hands, or if the fabric is particularly delicate: you can blot the stain instead. Pour the soap-and-peroxide solution onto a clean towel, then firmly dab the stain with the towel.

, Make sure that the stain is thoroughly saturated with the mixture. Leave the cotton to sit for at least 30 minutes before you try to wash out the soap.

, Fill a bowl with warm water, then let the cotton soak. Make sure that the material is thoroughly saturated with water. Try running the stain under a warm faucet.

, Transfer the fabric to hot water, then let soak for an hour. A washing machine with a soak cycle is perfect for this.


Don't add any laundry soap! The fabric should still have some soap-and-peroxide mix in it.

, Once the cotton has soaked in the hot-to-warm water for one hour, give it a cold rinse. Don't add any laundry soap. If you don't want to rinse by hand, you can run a washing machine on a cold cycle.

, Don't use a drying machine, especially if the fabric is 100% cotton! High heat can dramatically shrink wet cotton. If the red wine stain remains, feel free to repeat the process.

Pull over if you’re driving to treat spills safely.,
Soak up excess liquid with a cloth.,
Brush off any solid material.,
Apply cool water to the stain.,
Add dish soap or baking soda if you can.",How to Remove Coffee Stains from a Car Seat1," Make sure you are pulled over to a safe side of the road, a parking lot, or your final destination before treating a spill that has occurred. Never try to deal with a stain while driving.


Note that while it’s easiest to treat stains as soon as possible, by no means do you need to risk safety to address the spill while driving. It can wait till you reach your destination.;
, Use a paper towel, a napkin, or any spare fabric or rag you have on hand in the car to clean the spill when it is safe to do so. Gently blot the coffee spill to absorb as much of the moisture from the car seat fabric as you can.


Don’t rub at the stain with your napkin or cloth, as this can spread the stain further. Simply press with the cloth into the seat and lift straight up to absorb the moisture.
Repeat blotting with new napkins or cloths if you have them and the material becomes saturated. Do this until you have as much of the liquid absorbed as possible., Remove any coffee grounds that may have been present in your spilled coffee. It’s important to remove grounds so they don’t get stuck in crevices or cause further stains.


Be sure to wait till after you’ve blotted the liquid of the stain up to remove any solids. Then you can simply brush them away into your hand or a napkin to dispose.
If coffee grounds have made their way into fabric creases already and are difficult to remove, do your best to blot and brush at them, then wait till you have access to a vacuum with a thin hose attachment to suck them up.

, Put cool water on the coffee spill as soon as you can after blotting it initially. Continue blotting with a clean cloth or paper towel to pull out more of the coffee from the fabric.


Blot the water with a dry cloth or paper towel again to remove the moisture.

, If you have access to either dishwashing liquid or baking soda, use this to quickly treat a stain. Add a very small amount with cool water directly to the stain or to a cloth or napkin.Blot gently with your napkin or rag until the baking soda makes a paste or the dish soap makes a gentle lather on the surface of the stain.
Leave baking soda on the stain for up to 30 minutes if you can to allow it to work into the stain.Use a new cloth or paper towel with just cool water to rinse the car seat fabric of the soap or baking soda. Continue to use just gentle blotting motions.

Add more lemon juice.",How to Remove Dry Red Wine Stains from Cotton2," This step will moisten the dry stain so that it's more likely to come out. You don't need to take long – just enough to thoroughly wet the fabric.

, The cotton should be damp, but not dripping. Be gentle, and try not to stretch or tear the material.

, Squeeze the juice directly from a lemon, or use a pre-bottled lemon juice product. Soak the stain thoroughly, so that the acidity begins to act upon the wine.

, As the lemon soaks into the fabric, shake salt onto the area. Use your fingers to massage the salt and lemon into the stain. Work the salt in from the front and the back of the stained area for more dramatic effect.Standard table salt is fine, but any salt will do. You may even be able to use coarse sand and other gritty materials to scrub the stain.

, Rinse the back of the stain in cold water from a faucet. Wring the fabric out with your hands, and massage it, paying special attention to the stained area. Do not stretch or tear the material, but don't be afraid to vigorously rub the stain. When the stain is nearly gone, wrap the garment in a clean towel to wring out most of the moisture.


Always rinse from the back side of a stain. Wash it out of the fabric, not through it!

, Squeeze more lemon juice directly onto the stain, in a concentrated dose. Lay the cotton out in the sun. Use a flat surface, if possible, so that the fabric does not stretch as it dries. The acidic lemon and the UV rays of the sun make for a natural, fabric-safe improvised bleach.

Try rubbing white wine into the fabric.,
Use cream of tartar and water.,
Use a solvent and bar soap.,
Use commercial fabric cleaners.",How to Remove Dry Red Wine Stains from Cotton3," If your clothing is white, you can rub white wine over it.

Work the solution into the car seat stain with a stiff-bristled brush. Then allow it to sit for about 30 minutes before rinsing with water and blotting dry.You can also add club soda to your mixture for another ingredient that can help to pull the coffee stain out., Use standard unscented baby wipes or dry cleaning cloths meant for clothing to remove a coffee stain. Keep these items in your car for a quick way to clean stains on the go.


Use this method when you will be unable to do a deeper clean with soap and water, as these items can be kept on hand in your car.
Baby wipes have the added benefit of being unscented and gentle for people sensitive or allergic to the strong scent or chemicals in other cleaners., Spray a standard glass cleaner on a coffee stain that hasn’t come out even after other cleaning methods. This may help to further break up a stubborn stain for removal.


Be sure to test a glass cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area of your car upholstery to determine the effect it will have on your fabric. Don’t use it on the stained area if it appears to alter the appearance of the material.

Use only low or neutral pH detergent on leather.,
Use baking soda on vinyl.,
Finish with a protectant made for the material.",How to Remove Coffee Stains from a Car Seat3," Use a mild dish soap in cool water to blot at stains on leather. Or use a cleaner specifically intended for leather instead.


Try stirring dish soap and water together vigorously until suds is formed. Then dab just the suds onto the coffee stain to avoid over-saturating the leather, and wipe clean with a dry cloth.Don’t use a brush to work cleaner into leather fabric, as it can wear down the leather or work the cleaner into the seams and underlying cushion.

, Add water to baking soda to apply to a coffee stain on vinyl car seats. Work it in very gently with a toothbrush or a larger soft brush, then blot dry with a clean cloth.


Avoid using cleaners with an oil or mineral base on vinyl, as these can make vinyl harden and crack or feel stiff., Condition sensitive fabrics like vinyl and leather after cleaning a stain. This is necessary to prevent drying and cracking that can result from the cleaner chemicals or scrubbing action.


Find these conditioners in stores with auto supplies, or in cleaning supplies meant for upholstery.
Many solutions meant to condition leather and vinyl will also help to prevent or lessen the severity of future stains, so it’s an important step not to be skipped in the cleaning process.

Machine-wash and air-dry.,
Use a stain remover.",How to Remove a Red Wine Stain from Jeans," In the moments after a spill, grab a sponge, paper towels, or a cloth towel that you don’t mind staining. Use this to blot the affected area, working from the outside in. Be careful just to blot the wine, though, since rubbing it can spread the wine over a wider area, as well as deeper into your jeans’ denim., If you’re able to take your jeans off, do so. Grab some fresh towels or something similar. Stuff them into your jeans’ legs and/or waist, underneath the stain. Create a barrier that will stop the wine from seeping through the front of your jeans to its back, or vice versa., Blotting the wine with towels will get rid of excess liquid, but expect some of the wine to have already penetrated the fabric. To deal with that, cover the stain with salt. Use that to draw as much moisture back out of the denim before it has a chance to dry., Open a bottle of white wine. Pour it liberally over the stain. Do so in order to neutralize the red wine’s pigments and possibly lift the stain out entirely., Of course, you may not have white wine on hand, or you may not be too keen to waste any more on top of what you spilled. In that case, pour distilled white vinegar over the stain instead. This will also weaken the red and purple pigments and, like the white wine, could possibly remove the stain on its own., This may be easier to do with a partner, so ask someone for help if you can. First, boil some water. Once it’s ready, hold your jeans over the sink and pull the stained area taut between your two hands. Then have your partner pour the water onto the stain from a height of roughly 12 inches (30 cm) to wash the stain out.Wear rubber gloves while doing this so you don’t scald your hands.

, With sparkling water, don’t worry about boiling it as you would with plain water. Also, don’t worry if it’s gone flat and lost its carbonation. Simply pour it over your jeans to lift some or all of the stain out., Pouring the liquids above works best on fresher stains, so if yours has already dried into your denim (or if you spilled a lot of wine over most of your jeans), don’t worry if that didn’t get the job all the way done. Fill a container with enough vinegar, white wine, or club soda to soak the stained area, and let your jeans sit in it until the stain fades.Don’t use boiled water to soak your jeans. Warm water can actually make the stain settle in faster if your jeans are just sitting in it., Mix baking soda with just enough water to turn it into a thick paste. Spread this over the stain. Let it sit until it absorbs all, most, or some of the stain. If it didn’t lift all of the stain out, wash it off and repeat as needed., Before you use this method, be aware that hydrogen peroxide can bleach some fabrics. Be sure to test your mixture on a small, out-of-the way spot on your jeans, like behind the waistband. If it has no adverse effect, simply pour it over the stain. Let it soak in and repeat as needed until the stain fades.Because of the bleaching risk, start with a weak mixture that’s equal parts dish soap and hydrogen peroxide. If no bleaching occurs, feel free to double or triple the amount for a stronger solution., Whether the other methods seem to have totally or only partially removed the stain, follow them up by running your jeans through their regular cycle in the washer. Use cold water in case any wine is still present, since warm water can cause it to settle in further. Air-dry them afterward for the same reason, since a machine dryer will only make any lingering stain tougher to get rid of., If none of these home remedies are able to get rid of the stain entirely, buy a product that’s specifically designed to do so.

Put the clothing in the freezer.,

Finish the job.",How to Remove Caulking Stains from Clothes1," If you don't notice the stain for several days, place the garment in the freezer for a few hours. This will cause the caulk to harden. After a few days, you should be able to easily ""peel"" most of the goop off with your fingernails or a butter knife. Once the caulk is solid, carefully peel it off the article of clothing. The biggest chunk should come off in a glob.Alternately, use an ice cube. Hold an ice cube in place over the stain until it freezes. Once frozen, the caulk will loosen and can be pulled off more easily.;
, Chip away at the caulk, bit by bit – this may be easier once the stain is frozen. You can also use a butter knife, a file, or another scraping tool. Be careful not to cut yourself or the clothing!

See if the leather is finished or unfinished.,
Evaluate how old the stain is.,
Consult the instructions.,
Do a spot test.",How to Remove Red Wine Stains from Leather1," If the leather is naked or aniline, it has no protective treatment, and will need to be cleaned by a professional. Wet a paper towel, and let one drop of water fall onto the leather. If it soaks into the leather instantly, do not attempt to clean it yourself. If it remains in a bead on the surface, however, the leather can withstand home treatment., If it is a fresh, still-wet stain, you stand a good chance of being able to nip this problem in the bud. If the stain is old and well set, however, the leather will likely need to be professionally re-dyed.

, Many leather objects come with instructions or a tag that offer instructions for cleaning. This may give you an idea of what will and will not work in removing a stain.

, Apply whatever cleaning agent you plan on using to an inconspicuous part of the leather object. It should be an area rarely, if ever, visible. Let it dry, and see how the leather holds up.


Because time is of the essence with leather stains, if the stain is still wet, you may not want to wait for the spot test to fully dry before moving on to the actual stain. This is a bit of a gamble, so you need to weigh your concerns about doing further damage by cleaning against your concerns about allowing the stain to set. There is no single right answer, as the right course of action varies from leather to leather.

, Ammonia is tough stuff and is great on stubborn stains. This is easiest with a cotton swab, though a rag will also do. If you don't have any ammonia, consider a few of the everyday household items you may have:








Club soda (poured directly onto the stain)






Vinegar (poured on and blotted)






Baking soda (2 parts water, 1 part baking soda, blotted)






Saliva (works best with silk)

, Use an enzyme detergent that is made for breaking down tough stains. Products like OxyClean are also advised.








, However, heat sets stains -- so if any stain is left, do not expose it to high temperatures. If it doesn't come out after two or three attempts, you may have to throw in the towel.

, If yours can handle it, pour a bit into the cap and then right onto the stain. It'll froth and bubble -- signs it's working!









As the peroxide settles, can you still see the stain? If so, blot the previous application and pour on some more. Repeat until the stain is almost all but disappeared.
If you're concerned, dilute the hydrogen peroxide with a bit of water.

, This works it into the reaches of your fabric, getting at the stubborn spots. For large, set stains, this may be necessary.








, Actually, you only need the stain remover if any of the stain is still there. Launder it as you normally would -- but don't dry it until you're sure the stain is gone. Heat will just guarantee the stain is around for good.

, Before you apply any cleaners to the stain, see how much of the milk you can extract from the carpet or piece of furniture by blotting it.Use a cotton rag or sponge and run it under cold water before trying to blot it. Do not rub the stain or you may make it bigger.

, Use one tablespoon (14.78 mL) of liquid dishwashing detergent with two cups (480 mL) of warm water. Stir the solution until it's well mixed. This solution will help you extract any milk left over from blotting it with water.The solution should be sudsy when it's fully mixed.

, Dip your cloth into the solution and get the cloth saturated. Apply the wet cloth to the stain so that you transfer the solution onto your carpet. Continue to blot the stained area of your carpet until it's no longer visible.

, If you can't get the stain out using soap and water, you may have to use stronger chemicals. Mix two cups (480 mL) of warm water with one tablespoon (14.78 mL) of ammonia to create your solution. Get a new rag and dip it into the solution. Once the cloth is saturated, continue to dab the area that is stained.Use gloves when handling cleaning chemicals or supplies.
Never mix chlorine bleach with ammonia because it creates a dangerous chemical smoke that has harmful health effects., Use a fresh rag and dab the area with cold water. The goal is to remove any cleaners or ammonia that you used to lift the stain from the carpet. Once you've sufficiently blotted the area, no more suds or cleaner should remain on the carpet. Finish the area by using a dry rag to get any excess water that remains. Hanging your rug up will help it dry."

You should start to see the stain begin to lift. Continue to sponge the area with water and mild detergent until you lift the stain., You can use 3% hydrogen peroxide to remove stubborn chocolate milk stains. Use the dropper again to apply the hydrogen peroxide to the stain, before blotting up the area with a spare cloth. Continue to do this until you lift the stain from the piece of clothing., Once there is no visible sign of the stain, you can flush the mild detergent off of your shirt with cold water.

Try ammonia for tough stains.",How to Remove Blood Stains1," This is the easiest way to get rid of fresh blood, and it works well if you can catch it right away.If your stain is in a carpet, mattress, or heavy furniture that cannot be soaked, use a clean cloth or sponge to blot the stain. Don't use hot water - this could cause the blood to set in the fabric.






;
, This only works with wet blood. Before deciding to use hydrogen peroxide, note that it may bleach or weaken certain fabrics, and can cause stains itself. So use it cautiously and make sure to pretest the hydrogen peroxide on a small, inconspicuous spot on the stained item. Hydrogen peroxide can safely and effectively remove blood stains from porous surfaces like concrete.









Pour hydrogen peroxide on the stain. Dilute the hydrogen peroxide with 50% water if you are treating delicate fabrics. Take care not to let the foam spread outside the original stain area.
Replenish the hydrogen peroxide several times, as the chemical action slows and the foam becomes stable.
Wipe away the foam using a cloth and pour on a bit of hydrogen peroxide again until the stain is gone or extremely faint.
Wash the stained item with cold water and normally used soap or detergent.
You can also soak the entire garment in a bowl of hydrogen peroxide. Let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the stained clothing from the hydrogen peroxide and rinse it out in cold water.

, Using a paste of salt and water is a great way to get rid of blood stains from items that cannot be put in the wash like mattresses.









Rinse the stain under lots of cold water. If you have access to running water, put the stain under the tap and let the cold water run through it. You will be able to wash away a lot of the blood this way. If your stain is on a carpet or a piece of heavy furniture, mix some ice and water into a bowl or bucket and take it to your stained area and blot the stain with a dish towel or a sponge.
Rub the fabric together under the water if possible to release more of the remaining stain. If you are able to treat the stain within 10 to 15 minutes of it happening, you may be able to wash it out completely. However, if you still see signs of the blood, get some salt.
Mix a little water with salt to create a paste. You want to saturate the stain with salt, so the amount of paste you will need depends on the size of your stain.
Rub the salt and water paste onto the stained area. The abrasiveness of the salt granules and their dehydrating properties will loosen the remaining blood stain and draw it out of the fibers.
Rinse the salt away with more cold water. Check if the stain is gone.
When the stain is gone or you can't wash away any more of it, put the fabric into a normal wash cycle with laundry detergent.
If the stained item cannot be put in the wash, use as much cold water as needed to rinse away the blood and salt.

, Sometimes you don't have hydrogen peroxide or salt on hand. This method is similar to the salt method, but instead of salt, you rub soap or shampoo directly into the stain. If you are using this method on carpets, mattresses or furniture it's important not to use too much soap, since it's difficult to wash it out.









Soak the stained area in cold water.
Rub a generous amount of soap or shampoo right onto the stain.
Scrub the area hard between your fists, with your palms facing each other.
Work up a good lather. Add more water if needed.
Rinse in cold water and repeat until the stain and the lather are gone. Do not use hot water. Hot water makes the stain set in.

, Mix 1 tablespoon of ammonia with 1/2 cup of cold water and pour it on more stubborn stains. When the stain is gone, rinse with more cold water. Avoid using ammonia on linen, silk or wool.

Apply toothpaste on the blood-stained area.
Let the toothpaste dry.
Rinse the toothpaste away with cold water.
Wash the stained area with soap and rinse thoroughly with cold water. Repeat if necessary.

, Both blood and meat are organic material that can be broken down by the action of enzymes: proteases, celluloses and lipase. Commercially-made unseasoned meat tenderizers can be effective when applied liberally to dry blood stains. Dishwasher powder or capsules usually contain these enzymes as well.









This method is best used to clean sturdy fabric like jeans jeans, but not delicate fabrics. Avoid enzymes on linen, silk or wool. These products break down proteins and could damage the silk, linen and wool fabric which are made of proteins.
Fill a small bowl with 1 cup of cold water.

Then, lightly brush the powder off (with a dry paper towel, or toothbrush), and launder your jeans in the hottest temperature the garment care instructions allow.

, Due to its high level of surfactants, dish detergent is particularly successful at getting rid of grease and oil stains. Dab a drop or two onto your stain, and add a little water.

Stay away from water.,
Brush the stain off gently.,
Use shaving cream.,
Get some hair spray.,
Use dish detergent.",How to Remove a Stain from a Pair of Jeans4," Most makeup, like lip-stick or mascara, is oil-based which means that water will help the stain set, and make it harder to remove it.

, Some makeup isn't liquid, which means that it's sometimes possible to lightly brush a lip-stick or mascara stain off before it seeps into the fabric. But be very careful, as you don't want to grind the stain deeper into your jeans.

Blot the stain with a paper towel.,
Create a cleaning solution.,
Apply the solution.,
Keep pressing.,
Sponge cool water onto the area.",How to Remove Beer Stains from Fabric2," The first order of business is getting out as much beer out of the upholstery as possible. Getting the beer out will help lessen the stain. Use clean, white paper towels to blot the area, as colorful paper towels could stain the upholstery with dye.While you're blotting, make sure you've found all the stain. Look for other spots on the upholstery beyond the main spill, as beer has a tendency to splash everywhere.

, You'll need a basic cleaning solution to clear up the stain. You can make one from items you have at home, and you have more than one option when deciding what you want to use.The first solution uses rubbing alcohol and white vinegar. Measure out 2/3 a cup of rubbing alcohol. Add a tablespoon of white vinegar to it, and mix it together.
The second solution uses dishwashing detergent and water. In 2 cups of cool water, add a tablespoon of dishwashing detergent. Stir it together.
Either solution will work, so just choose one based on what you have on hand. You may want to test the solution in a discreet area to make sure it doesn't discolor the fabric, as different fabrics may react differently to the solutions.

, Dip a clean cloth into the solution. A white cloth is best so it doesn't stain the upholstery. Apply the cloth to the upholstery. Press it in to help absorb the beer from the upholstery., Continue to reapply apply the solution to the stain. As you do, the stain should begin to lift. You may need to repeat the process 3 or 4 times before you absorb all the beer from the upholstery. Make sure the stain is completely gone before moving on to the next step., Using a new clean cloth, apply cool water to the area. Blot a few times to make sure all the cleaning solution is gone.

, You'll need vinegar, dishwashing detergent, and hydrogen peroxide (3%). You'll need to make two different solutions for washing out your carpet, and you'll use both of them.For the first solution, you'll mix vinegar and water. Mix 1 part vinegar with 2 parts water. For a small amount, mix a 1/3 cup of vinegar with 2/3 cup of water.
For the second solution, first make sure your dishwashing detergent doesn't have bleach, as that could make a dangerous solution later when the peroxide is applied. If it has lanolin in it, that may make it more difficult to clean the stain, so make sure your detergent doesn't have that, either. In a quart of water, add a 1/4 teaspoon of dishwashing detergent.
You'll use the hydrogen peroxide by itself.

, Put the solution in a spray bottle to make it easier to apply. Spray the solution on the stain, essentially soaking it with the solution. Once it's on the stain, use a clean paper towel to blot up the solution., Dip a sponge or clean rag into the detergent solution. A white cloth works best so you don't stain the carpet with the cloth. Blot the stain with the solution.Keep going back and forth between the solution and stain until the stain is removed.
You'll likely need to perform this action 3 or 4 times at least.

, Now you need to take the detergent out of the carpet with clean water. The easiest way to do that is to use a spray bottle with clean water. Spray it on the carpet and blot up the detergent. Repeat the process until you've removed the detergent and you don't see any suds., Once you've made sure all the detergent is out, you can dry off the carpet. Blot it dry with paper towels. However, to make sure it's really dry, place a stack of clean paper towels on top of it, then put something heavy on top of that, such as a brick.If you don't have a brick, you can use something else heavy. Just make sure it's something you don't mind getting wet, or take the time to wrap it in plastic first.

, Once the carpet has dried, check the area again for a stain. If you still see one, you can use the hydrogen peroxide to help get the rest of it up. Apply straight hydrogen peroxide to the carpet with a clean cloth.Leave the peroxide on for an hour. If you still see a stain, blot it up, and add more peroxide, leaving it for an hour again. Keeping repeating the process until you see the stain is gone. You don't need to rinse it out.
Once it's gone, apply a brick and a stack of clean paper towels to make sure it properly dries.

Identify the stain.,
Wet the stain again.,
Dry the fabric with a blow dryer.",How to Remove Beer Stains from Fabric4," When you clean up a stain on microfiber upholstery, sometimes the water itself leaves a stain, which you then need to remove. However, when you're looking at the stain, make sure you don't see any signs of beer left. You need to make sure that stain is gone before you start working on the water stain left behind.Look for discoloring, as beer can discolor fabric slightly.
You can also smell the area to check for a beer stain. If the beer stain is still there, repeat the stain removal process for upholstery.

, Use a clean white cloth. Make sure it is soft so it will be gentle on the fabric. Dip it into clean water, and wring it out. Press the cloth gently on the area to make it damp. You don't want to make the area soaking wet. You just want it to be damp enough that you can dry the fabric more quickly this time., The reason water sometimes leaves a stain on microfiber is because it dries too slowly. A blow dryer helps speed up the process. Wave the blow dryer over the fabric until the stain dries up, leaving you without a watermark this time.The main reason you want to make sure the stain is completely gone is that when you apply heat to a stain with a blow dryer, you are setting the stain in the fabric, making it nearly impossible to remove later.

Table Salt (Best quick option!)
Club Soda
Milk
Soap and Hydrogen Peroxide
Kitty Litter
Hot Water;
, Make sure to completely cover the stain and let sit for an hour. The salt will absorb the wine and can be easily brushed off afterwards.









Salt is the preferred stain removal method, but works best when applied within two minutes of spillage. If the wine has not yet completely soaked into the fabric, the salt crystals should easily absorb the red wine. As most natural fabrics, such as cotton, denim and linen, absorb faster than synthetic materials, stains on natural fabrics should be tended to with more haste than synthetic. , Let the liquid bubble up. Continue pouring the soda over the stained area until the color fades away. Once the stain is removed, let the fabric dry. Use paper towels to clean up any spilt or excess club soda.









There is much debate over the club soda remedy, some arguing tap water would work just as well. However, the general consensus believes the soda’s carbonation to have stain lifting agents. Club soda also has a lower pH than regular water. As weak acids (those with low pH values) are known to help in stain removal, this trait could be a contributing factor.
Be advised not to use any flavored club soda when removing stains, even those clear in color. Dyes as well as sugars and additional ingredients can contribute more to the preexisting stain. , Quickly cover the stain with a thick layer of salt and pour the club soda on top. Let the stain sit for an hour before brushing off all salt into the garbage. Blot up any excess liquid.









Both agents can work on their own, but using the two together may double your chances of completely clearing the stain. The salt absorbs as much wine as it can, while the club soda will lift out the stain as you blot.

, Let it soak into the fabric, blotting the stain with a tea towel or paper towel. Do not rub, as this will settle the stain into the fabric. The stain should be gone in an hour or less. Wash as usual to remove excess liquid and odor.









Another option is to completely soak the fabric in a bowl or bucket of milk for an hour or so, depending on the size of the stain. If the stained fabric is easily movable and the stain is rather large, this is a more thorough and efficient method.
Milk works similarly to club soda, soaking up the stain. However, milk’s thick white consistency can essentially override the red color.
Milk is one of the least popular methods in red wine stain removal, though some still prefer it to the salt and club soda method.

, Pour on, sponge over or spray the solution generously onto the stain. Blot with a paper towel.









General opinion deems Dawn the best soap to react with hydrogen peroxide and get the job done. If available, using a spray bottle is suggested. The resulting bubbles should help lift the stain out of the fabric, much like the carbonation in club soda.
If your stain has only soaked through one layer of a two-sided piece of clothing, be sure to place a towel between both sides. This will prevent any leakage as you spray and blot.

, Press down the kitty litter with your hands softly to absorb the wine. Once the stain is removed, vacuum the kitty litter off the fabric.









Kitty litter contains highly absorbent chemicals that will quickly soak up liquid, much like salt, though slightly more powerful.
Timing is especially crucial with kitty litter, as it was with salt. Work quickly — preferably within two minutes of spillage.
Vacuuming is the easiest method of kitty litter removal as the litter can clog drains or add unwanted odors to standing trash cans.

, Once you have a heavy boil going, stretch the stained fabric over a pan in the sink. Stand on a chair and pour the boiling water onto the fabric from 3-4 feet (.9-1.2 meters) above. Pour the water generously over the stained area until it is removed. Dry the fabric of excess water with paper towels. 








Though hot water sets in some stains, it has proven successful with red wine stains because of its fruit based ingredients.
Avoid using water on wool or silk as water weakens these fabrics."

Bring the silk to a professional.,
Apply a silk cleaning product.,
Wash with a specialized detergent.",How to Remove Coffee Stains from Silk," Blot out as much coffee as you can with a paper towel. Do not rub the silk, as this may spread the stain.;
, Silk is already susceptible to damage from most cleaning products. Colorful dyes further restrict your options, since some chemicals will cause the dye to fade. The safest option for colored silk is a professional cleaner, who has access to specialized products for specific dyes.

, In an emergency, apply hydrogen peroxide using a cotton swab or sponge. Dab it onto a hidden area first. If there is no color change, swab a corner of the stain, then the entire stain.

, Detergent can eat away at your silk, but may be necessary if the stain is still present. Mix a little hand soap, liquid detergent, or liquid dish washing soap with some hydrogen peroxide. This helps the peroxide push through the cloth, carrying the stain with it. Hold a sponge on the other side to pick up the dirty liquid. Rinse the sponge and change the liquid frequently to avoid spreading the stain. Repeat until the stain is gone.

, Rinse the silk thoroughly. Leaving residual cleaning products on the silk can fade the color or even unravel the silk fibers.

, If the hydrogen peroxide does not work, repeat the same steps with a more powerful treatment. Always test a hidden area first to check for damage. (Alternatively, skip ahead to removing old stains for safer methods.) Here are your options, starting with relatively mild options and moving on to harsher ones:


Baking soda
Distilled white vinegar and cold water in equal amounts
Distilled white vinegar
Lemon or lime juice
As described above, you may add detergent to any of these. This makes the treatment more powerful, but also more likely to cause damage.

, Professional cleaners have access to specialized chemicals that can clean silk without damaging the fibers. This is especially important for brightly colored silks.

, If the stain has already set, it's worth taking the time to find a specialized product. A cleaning product intended to remove stains from silk should contain no acid or grease. Follow label instructions carefully to reduce risk of damage. Typically, you will apply a small amount of the product to the stain, then wash as described below.

, Normal laundry detergent can eat away at silk fibers. Find a specialized detergent for delicate materials instead, ideally one that specifically mentions silk on the label. Wash your silk garment on a delicate laundry cycle.

, Flatten the shaving cream into the fabric with the back of a spoon before washing the fabric as usual. 








Shaving cream’s thick, foamy texture combined with its cleansing components work wonders on tough stains — saturating and lifting the stain from the fabric. , Blot the stain with a cloth and continue pouring. Allow the vodka to completely soak in and watch the stain fade. Wash as usual.









Red wine contains anthocyanins, or color pigments, which can be dissolved by alcohol. Therefore vodka, gin, or any clear alcohol with a higher proof than red wine can remove the stain. , First soak the stain with white wine. Some believe white wine dilutes the color while preventing the stain from setting in (warning to follow in the bullets below).









Make a baking soda paste using a 3-1 ratio of baking soda to water. Mix together until a paste is formed. Spread a thick layer of baking soda paste over the stain and let sit for an hour. Periodically spray with water to keep the area moist, preventing the stain from settling into the fabric. After the stain is removed, wash as usual.
White wine is one of the most common discrepancies in red wine stain removal. Though many swear it dilutes the stain’s color, others say mixing fire with fire only aggravates the stain. Tap water can be used as a replacement if you are weary of this particular option.

Silk and wool are especially fragile fabrics, weakened by water and not able to withstand chlorine bleach. Alternatively, linen and synthetic materials tend to be more durable, while cotton ranges in the middle.
If there are no warnings on the label, search online to make sure your fabric can withstand the cleaning product of your choice.
Dry-clean only fabrics should be taken to the cleaners as soon as possible, preferably within the first or second day after spillage. Do not attempt to wash on your own.

,









Products such as OxiClean, Resolve and Wine Away have proven most successful in removing stains with out harming fabric. Cleaning products work almost identically to the household remedies mentioned earlier, using absorption and chemicals to lift out stains. However, cleaning products may prove more reliable as they have been specifically tested to remove stains in a efficient and consistent manner.
Cleaning products contain bleach. Avoid using any bleach products on wool, silk, mohair, leather, and spandex. , Blot the stain and lift out as much excess liquid as possible before applying the product to the stain.









Blotting makes your life easier. It absorbs as much of the stain as possible. The cleaning agent is then able to save its powers for the tougher stains that have already begun to set in.

, OxiClean and Resolve can come in different forms, such as detergent, spray and liquid formulas. For the best results, follow the label’s instructions.









Wine Away is packaged in spray bottles and should be sprayed directly onto the stain. Let sit for fifteen minutes before washing as usual.

Scrape as much of the stain off as you can.,
Check the tags on the clothing.,
Moisten a soft cloth with warm water, and blot the stained area.",How to Get Toothpaste out of Clothes1," It will be easier to remove the stain with chemicals and water if you first scrape off whatever toothpaste will loosen up.


Try using a small knife or sharp object to scrape off as much of the toothpaste as you can. If you are a child, only do this with parental supervision, however. Scrape only very gently so that you don’t end up damaging the clothing by poking holes in it. You are just trying to get the surface-level toothpaste off.Be careful not to rub the toothpaste too hard or you could embed it even more in the fabric. You could also try to use your fingers to pick some of it off if you are nervous about using a knife. The sooner you try to remove the toothpaste, the easier it will come off.
If the toothpaste sits on the clothing for very long, it could erode the color in the clothing. Whitening toothpaste that contains bleach can damage the clothing especially if it remains on it for very long.;
, Many stain removal methods involve water. You need to make sure the fabric won't be damaged if water is applied to it.


If the clothing is dry clean only, do not use water at all or it will leave a spot.
If you don't have time to take the clothing to the dry cleaner, there are dry cleaning stain removal products that can be used on these pieces, though.

, This will help loosen the stain some more. Mix a few drops of laundry detergent with a cup of water. You can use stain remover in place of the laundry detergent.


Try spot cleaning the clothing first. Dip the cloth in the sudsy water, and gently blot/scrub the toothpaste area. Once the detergent penetrates the toothpaste stain, the stain should release itself somewhat.
Wet the area and put pressure on your shirt with the water so it comes out. If it still looks tinted white, then it is not completely out. The titanium dioxide powder causes the white staining on clothing. That’s why you will likely need detergent to get it out.
Blot the area with water to rinse. Allow the spot to air dry. Don’t apply heat to it yet because heat can set the stain into the clothing.It’s possible that this is all you need to do. It depends on the nature of the stain. If the stain remains at all, you’ll have to wash the clothing more thoroughly.

Use a stain stick.",How to Clean Coffee Stains1," If the stain is still damp, blot with paper towels or tissue. Use a blotting, up-and-down lifting motion to soak up the coffee. Do not rub the paper towel from side to side because this may spread the stain. Use white paper towels because towels with patterns could leak dye onto the fabric and create even worse stains.Blotting immediately helps remove any excess liquid and some of the chemicals that cause coffee to stain.
Blotting will also make your clothes receptive to the other steps.;
, Place the stain under running water for 3 to 5 minutes. Cold tap water is the best temperature. Gently rub the stain every minute to help remove the stain. You may need to do this 2 or 3 times.Rinse the back of the cloth where the stain is located. Do not rinse the top surface of the stain directly yet because rinsing the stained surface may cause the stain to spread.

, If the stain is still there after you have rinsed with cold water, rub a small amount of liquid laundry detergent on the stain. Make sure the area is still moist before you rub it in. Let the detergent sit for 5 minutes, and then rub it gently again. Now rinse with cold water.


Spread the detergent on both surfaces of the coffee-stained material, front and back.

, If laundry detergent alone does not work, mix powdered laundry detergent and equal parts white vinegar and cold water in a small bowl to make a paste. The paste should be the same consistency as toothpaste. Make enough to cover both sides of the stain, front and back.Test a small part of the fabric that cannot be seen with the paste to make sure the paste won't discolor the fabric.
Let the paste sit for 5 minutes and then use a nail brush or toothbrush to rub both sides of the stain in a circular motion. Rinse the stain with cold water when you are finished.

, If the stain still has not come out, use a stain stick. Apply the stain stick and allow it to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Then wash the clothing according to the instructions on the tag.

Next, try oil soap.,
If the oil soap doesn't work, try a soda paste.,
As a last resort, you can try using rottenstone.,
If the stain is still there, contact a wood care professional.

",How to Remove a Red Wine Stain from a Hardwood Floor or Table," Blot up the wine rather than rubbing it in.;
, Pour undiluted bleach on the area and let it soak for at least 45 minutes before wiping it up. Use latex gloves to wipe it up, as bleach can be caustic. (NOTE: The bleach may very well take off the existing surface coat, possibly requiring you to resurface the entire table. Test where you can't see it before applying bleach to the surface of a finished table.)

, Mix oil soap and hot water, according to package directions, then dip a soft cloth into the mixture, and scrub the wood. Hopefully, the stain disappears.

If the piece can easily be placed in the washing machine and washed, that will provide the easiest and most thorough removal method.It’s usually a good idea to pretreat the stain with laundry pre-wash stain remover., Run the warm water from the back of the stain through the front. This should help pull the toothpaste out of the woof of the woven fabric.


Gently rub the stain(s) with your finger under the water. Make sure the stains are out before you dry your clothing. Drying sets the stain into fabric more, making it tougher to remove.
If the stain is still there, soak the clothing in a bucket of very hot water and some detergent for a few hours. Do not dry in the dryer; rather, air dry until you are certain that no remnants remain. If you detect remnants of toothpaste, repeat the process.

, Remove the initial toothpaste and, once you are left with the residue that is worked into the fabric of your clothes, use dish soap and really scrub at the stain.


First, scrape off as much of the toothpaste as you can. Let the soap sit for about 10 minutes, and then clean the garment as usual.

Place a weight (e.g. glass or ceramic object, paperweight) on top of the paper towels. The pad will soak up any remaining liquid.

, If the detergent does not work, mix ½ cup hydrogen peroxide with 1 teaspoon of undiluted, unscented household ammonia. Use a white paper towel or towel to apply the mixture to the stain. Place a piece of plastic wrap and a weight (e.g. glass or ceramic object, paperweight) on top of the stain and allow the mixture to sit for 2 or 3 hours.The weight should be color safe and not bleed when it gets wet.
Use the hydrogen peroxide, ammonia mixture within 22 hours of making it.
You may have to apply the mixture multiple times until the stain is gone.

, Once the stain is removed, use a white towel or paper towel to apply cold water. Blot the area and do not rub. Once you have finished blotting, leave a ½ inch pad of white paper towels on the area overnight to soak up any remaining liquid.Neutralize the stained area after using the ammonia mixture by applying undiluted, distilled white vinegar to the area.

Examine the tags.,
Treat the stain with water.,
Avoid contact with heat.,
Avoid pressure.",How to Get Stains out of Clothes1," The labels will often provide useful insight on how to remove stains from a specific article of clothing. Additionally, the information provided on the tag will ensure you do not mishandle or damage your clothing with improper washing technique.;
, Before you begin washing, always pre-soak the clothing and keep the stain wet using cold water. This will prevent the stain from drying, thereby ""setting"" and becoming far more difficult to remove.


If possible, keep the stained area completely submerged in water.
If it is impossible to submerge the stain, blot it with water. Never rub, because rubbing the stain can spread it around the fabric, creating a larger stain than you originally had.

, Heat will speed the setting of most types of stains. Therefore, avoid placing the stained material near any heat sources or in direct sunlight, and use only cold water and solvents when treating it.

, Don't vigorously press the fabric or scrub forcefully. You want to avoid grinding the stain deeper into the fabric, beyond the surface level.

Place an absorbent towel under the fabric.,
Dip a toothbrush in Murphy's oil.,
Rub out the stain.,
Remove the remaining stain with dishwashing soap.,
Rinse the clothing with clean water.,
Place the clothing in the laundry machine.",How to Get Dry Erase Marker Out of Clothing1," The towel you use will probably get stained, so choose an old towel you do not mind damaging. Place the towel underneath the fabric you're cleaning on a flat surface, like a counter. Make sure the towel is thick enough to absorb excess moisture., If you have an extra unused toothbrush, use this. You can also purchase a cheap toothbrush at a drug store. Get the toothbrush completely saturated in Murphy's oil. This method works best with a very wet toothbrush., Rub the toothbrush into the stain, adding new Murphy's oil as necessary. Move the towel underneath as needed to absorb excess liquid. Rub the stain until suds appear and then keep rubbing until the stain is mostly faded., Take a rag or sponge and douse it in some water and mild dishwashing soap. Rub the rag or sponge over the stain until it comes out completely., Take a clean sponge and saturate it with clean water. Rub the sponge into the clothing to remove the Murphy's oil and dish soap.Keep rubbing the sponge on the fabric until the water from the sponge runs clear.

Add olive oil into the soap mixture.,
Put lemon on the stain.,
Put vinegar on the stain.",How to Get Toothpaste out of Clothes3," Take a napkin and then gather some detergent, water, and olive oil. Pour the detergent and water together in a glass, and mix them.


Then, take the oil, and put it over the stain. Don’t use too much oil or it could ruin the clothing.
Pour the water mixture onto the toothpaste stain next. After a few minutes, wipe it off. You may still need to wash the clothing further in a bucket or washing machine. However, this should help remove the stain.

, Take a lemon, and cut it in half. Then, rub the pulp side on the stain for about one minute.


Wash it off with normal detergent powder. You can also mix freshly squeezed lemons with baking soda, which is a natural remedy that is great to use for cleaning.Wait for the fizzing to stop. Once done, mix it again until it becomes pasty. Then slowly rub the mix on the stained area. Use one teaspoon of baking soda and two teaspoons of lemon juice. You could also try using rubbing alcohol on the stain.

Flush with cold water.,
Wash with dishwashing liquid.,
Use bar soap.,
Try hydrogen peroxide.,
Make a salt and shampoo stain remover.,
Use baking soda on delicate fabrics.",How to Get Out Blood Stains1," The first step with any fresh blood stain is to flush the stain with cold water. If it is a minimal amount of blood, you may be able to remove the majority of the stain with just cold water. Run the fabric under a cold tap, gently rubbing the stain with the water. Soak your fabric in cold water in your sink to loosen any remaining stain. Wash the material in cold water afterward.


Make sure you do not use hot water. This will set the blood into the fabric and make the stain harder to remove.If you don't have access to a tap, you can also put cold water in a bowl or bucket and dunk the fabric in the water. Keep dunking, rubbing and rinsing until the stain is removed. Wash the fabric in cold water afterward.
This method works on all kinds of fabrics, such as denim, cotton and linen.;
, If your stain is too tough for cold water alone, try using dishwashing liquid. Pour 1 tablespoon of liquid directly onto the fabric. Make sure it saturates the fabric. Let the liquid sit on the stain for 15 to 30 minutes. The stain should loosen. Rub cold water over the stain to remove the soap. Wash in cold water.If the stain persists, you may need to repeat this method or try an alternative method.

, You can use bar soap for more concentrated stains. Rinse the fabric with cold water. Then, rub the bar of soap into the stain until the fabric lathers. Rub the fabric together to help scrub in the soap and loosen the stain. Rinse the soap and loosened blood out of the fabric. If the stain is still there, reapply the soap. Wash in cold water., You can also try hydrogen peroxide on light-colored or white fabrics. After you rinse with cold water, pour a generous amount of peroxide directly onto the fabric. Rub the peroxide into the fabric to saturate it. Let the peroxide sit on the stain for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Wash the material in cold water. If the stain persists, you can repeat the process.If the peroxide bubbles when it hits the fabric, don't be alarmed. This is a normal response. It means that the peroxide is dissolving the proteins in the blood and lifting out the stain., Instead of buying a stain remover, you can make one at home. Rinse as much blood out as you can with cold water. Next, soak the fabric in cold water for 15 minutes. Ring out the excess water from the fabric. Rub a tablespoon of table salt into the stain on the damp fabric. Pour a tablespoon of shampoo onto the salt and rub the fabric together. Once the shampoo starts to lather, add another tablespoon of salt. Rub the combination into the fabric. Rinse the fabric completely in cold water. Wash the fabric in cold water.


This works only on fabrics that do not need special care. Do not use this method on clothes that you would wash on the gentle cycle in your clothes washer.
This also works on set-in stains., If you have a blood stain on a delicate garment, you need to use a different kind of stain remover. Soak the garment in cold water for 15 to 30 minutes. Pour a small amount of baking soda onto the fabric. Rub it into the stained area with a nail brush or soft toothbrush. Wash the garment on the delicate cycle in cold water."

Freeze the clothing item.Clumps of soft crayon stuck on your clothes need to be removed before the stain can be removed, but if you try to scrape the crayon off while it is still soft, you risk spreading it to other areas of the fabric.,
Scrape off the excess crayon.,
Place the stained clothes between clean paper towels.,
Press the clothes with a warm iron.,
Pretreat the stain with pre-wash stain remover.,
Wash the clothes.",How to Get Crayon Out of Clothes1,"


Place the affected clothing in your freezer for 30 minutes, or until the crayon hardens.;
, Use a small, sharp paring knife or paint chisel to scrape the hardened crayon off the garment.


Rub the sharp side of of the utensil in between the fabric and the crayon, coming at it from a slight angle. Move the blade on one direction only, and wipe the crayon off of the blade with a clean paper towel in between each pass.
Note that a crayon stain may still remain underneath, but the solid crayon should be completely scraped off.

, Transfer the clothes to an ironing board. Sandwich the fabric in between paper towels, placing them around the location of the stain.


Use white paper towels to eliminate the risk of accidentally transferring color from the paper towels onto the fabric.







, Gently press the iron onto the top layer of paper towel for 5 to 10 seconds. Lift the iron straight up to remove it.

The heat should cause the crayon stain to lift from the clothes and onto the paper towels.






Do not drag the iron across the surface of the fabric since doing so may spread the stain instead of lifting it.






Use a low heat setting on your iron to reduce the risk of damaging your clothes.






Replace the paper towels frequently. After every one or two presses, swap out the dirtied paper towels for clean ones. Otherwise, the crayon stain may transfer back onto the clothes.







, Remove the paper towels and apply a spot stain remover to the remaining stains.


Blot the clothes with the stain remover and let dry.
At this point, the ironing technique should have caused the crayon stains to fade, but some stains will likely remain. These stains can usually be removed with normal stain removing practices, though.

, Run the stained clothing through a hot water cycle. Use standard detergent and bleach, if bleach is safe for the clothing item in question.

If you cannot use standard bleach, try an oxygen bleach, instead.






Rewash, if needed. If the stains have faded after the first wash, put the clothes through a second wash using the same type of detergent and bleach.

, Gently grip the garment, keeping your fingers to either side of the stain, and pull. The fabric should be stretched out, like the top of a drum. Don't pull so hard that you risk ripping the garment, though.

, Hold it for a few minutes until turning it over. Most of the blood should have come out.

, You can also use an old toothbrush, but be careful not to scrub too hard, or you will risk setting the stain into the fabric.

, You can use any type of soap, including liquid and bar soap. You can use basic hand soap or even a small amount of laundry detergent.

, Be sure to keep scrubbing the stain until all of the soap is gone. Most of the blood should be gone by now. The stain will likely still remain, however.

, There are many products available that can remove blood stains. Some of these products are simple household products that you may already have in your bathroom cabinet or pantry. This section will show you how to use these products.Keep in mind, however, that some stains may have permanently set into the fabric, and you may still have some slight residue.

, Simply sprinkle some salt over the stain and let it sit for a few minutes, then gently scrub it with your finger or an old toothbrush. Rinse the stain well with cold water.


If you don't have any salt on hand, but you happen to wear contacts, try using some of the saline solution you use for your contacts.

, Crumble a few aspirin pills in a small dish and mix them with just enough cold water to create a paste. Spread the paste over the stain and let it sit for 30 minutes or overnight before rinsing it off.

, Sprinkle some baking soda into a small dish and add in a few drops of cold water. Mix until you get a paste, then spread the paste over the stain. Wait 30 minutes or let it sit overnight before rinsing the garment off with cool water.

, Simply pour some hydrogen peroxide (the same kind that comes in a brown bottle and that you can find in the first aid section of a drug store) or lemon juice over the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse it out using water. Be sure to scrub the stain with you finger or an old toothbrush.


Both hydrogen peroxide and lemon juice can lighten fabric, so they are not recommended for bright or dark-colored garments.

, Simply pour some white vinegar over the stain and let it sit for five to ten minutes before rinsing it out., Simply spray or pour the stain remover onto the fabric and leave it on for the amount of time recommended by the manufacturer; this is usually around five to 20 minutes.

, These types of detergents are great at breaking down proteins, which is what blood is made out of., Try to get the stain out as soon as you see it; the longer the blood sits in cotton, the harder it will be to get out.

, The hot water will set the stain into the fabric, making it almost impossible to remove. When using cold water, try to make it as cold as you can. Turn on the tap to the coldest setting and let the water run for a few moments until it becomes really cold.

, Bleach can remove almost anything, including blood stains. Unfortunately, it can also remove color, so it is not recommended for colored garments. It is also very harsh and can eat away the fibers in fabric, creating holes and tears. Lastly, bleach does not react well with hard/well water, and it can worsen the blood stain.Avoid mixing detergents when using bleach, or you may cause a chemical reaction ad create dangerous fumes.

, Even if the garment looks clean and spotless after you have washed it, there might still be some residue, which won't show up until after everything is dry. Instead, hang the garment in a well-ventilated area, preferably in the sun. If you toss it into the dryer, you will risk setting the stain, making it nearly impossible to remove.If you are in a rush and it is gloomy outside, consider turning a fan on and pointing it at the garment.

Remove stains from wool.,
Remove stains from synthetics.,
Remove stains from silk.,
Use water.,
Use salt.,
Use hydrogen peroxide.,
Use bleach.,
Use detergent.,
Use mild acids.,
Use glycerin.,
Use mineral spirits.,
Use enzyme cleaners.",How to Get Stains out of Clothes2," The type of fabric the stain is on will determine the type of solvent needed to remove the stain. Tags on the article of clothing should usually indicate the type of fabric and the correct washing procedures, but otherwise just proceed based on the apparent fabric type.

, The best solvents for cotton are commercial detergents (i.e. Tide) and light acids (vinegar). Although bleach can safely be used on white cotton fabrics, it is very harsh and can damage the clothing., Wool can be soaked, but only when laid flat, as it is susceptible to stretching and deforming. Care must be taken to use only wool-safe detergents; any acids or bleach can ruin wool. As soon as possible, bring the wool garment to the dry cleaner for professional stain removal., Synthetics include clothing made from fibers such as acrylic, nylon, olefin, polyester, and others. To be safe, use standard laundry detergents with these fabrics, unless otherwise instructed by the label. Do not attempt home remedies, as these can dissolve and destroy the plastics used in these fabrics., Silk is a very tricky fabric to remove stains from, and must be treated with exceeding care. Soaking silk in cool water can be useful to prevent setting, but be sure to avoid spot cleaning silk. If individual water spots are left to try, these can cause permanent discoloration.

, Water is safe to use on basically every fabric, but is primarily useful just to prevent setting. It can reduce the effect of dye stains (hair dye, lipstick, etc.) a fair amount, but needs a long soaking time to have an effect on greases or oils. You will likely need to use a stronger cleaning remedy than water alone for most stain removal.

, Salt can be effective when placed on top of a stain, in order to draw the stain out. This can be effective on a variety of stains, including blood, red wine, and others., Hydrogen peroxide can be useful to reduce pigment stains, such as those from lipstick and grass. However, it does not work very well on grease., Chlorine bleach is only safe to use on white fabrics, and generally only on cotton.

, Detergent is very effective against most stains, especially on grease and oil stains, such as those from foods. Additionally, detergent is safe for use on most fabrics, but still make sure to double check the label of the stained clothing and the type of detergent you are using.

, Mild acids are great to remove glue and tape stickiness, as well as light stains from coffee, tea, and grass.

, Use glycerin on ink and dye stains. Glycerin draws stains out of fabrics, and is often in commercial ""stain sticks"".

, Mineral spirits are best for use on grease stains, such as those from tar, paint, asphalt, and machine grease. Mineral spirits should only be used on hardy fabrics.

, Enzyme cleaners are commonly found commercial cleaners, safe for use on inorganic fibers such as cotton. These cleaners are mostly used for the removal of organic stains like blood, sweat, egg yolk, urine, etc."

Do a spot test first.",How to Get Dry Erase Marker Out of Clothing3," If a garment still has a manufacturer's label in place, make sure to read this before doing laundry. You want to make sure there are no specific cleaning instructions. For example, some garments should only be washed in cold water., If the stain does not come out the first time using either method, try again. Sometimes, dry erase stains can be difficult to remove. It may take two attempts to remove the stain., Some clothing may react poorly to Murphy's oil, rubbing alcohol, or white vinegar. Test the cleaning product you're using on a small patch of the clothing and wait about an hour. If the patch of clothing does not appear discolored or damaged, it is safe to use that substance to remove the stain."

Soak with pre-treatment remover.,
Use diluted ammonia.,
Apply meat tenderizer.,
Use cornstarch and hydrogen peroxide.,
Try window cleaner.,
Use bleach.",How to Get Out Blood Stains2," If you have a stain that is dry or set-in, you need to pre-treat the fabric. Using a laundry stain remover, spray your fabric with enough liquid to saturate the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for 15 minutes. Rinse with cold water. If the stain is still there, treat the fabric again. Wash the fabric in cold water with an enzyme-based detergent, such as Arm & Hammer, Gain or Tide.If the stain is not removed when you wash the fabric, you need to treat it again before you dry it. Drying the fabric will cook in the blood stain.
You can buy stain removers in most grocery stores' laundry sections. Try Resolve Spray & Wash or OxyClean Max Force laundry stain remover.

, You don't have to rely on just pre-treatment options. After you treat a stain once with pre-treatment remover, dilute 1 tablespoon of ammonia in 1 cup of water. Dab the stain with a cotton swab or cotton ball soaked in the diluted ammonia. Keep changing the cotton swabs or balls whenever they get saturated with blood residue. You don't want to rub the stain back into the fabric. Let the ammonia solution sit on the fabric for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Wash the fabric in cold water.


You can place paper towels behind the fabric you are treating to keep the stain from running onto the fabric behind the stained portion. Paper towels also help absorb the diluted ammonia as you apply it.Do not put ammonia directly onto the fabric. It could discolor the fabric or break down the fabric's fibers.

, If a stain is persistent, you can try unseasoned meat tenderizer on the stain. First, soak your fabric in cold water for several hours. This loosens the stain and helps soften the fabric. Next, mix 1 tablespoon of unseasoned meat tenderizer, such as McCormick's, with 2 teaspoons of water to make a paste. Rub the paste into the blood stain with your fingers. Allow the paste to sit on the stain for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the excess paste and wash your item in cold water.


Before you apply the meat tenderizer, you can also run your fabric through a cold wash with light, enzyme-based detergents., If you have a stain on a surface, such as a mattress, that is not washable, you need to use different kinds of stain removers. Take 1/2 cup of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of salt and mix them with 1/4 cup of hydrogen peroxide to make a paste. Apply the paste directly to the stain with a spoon. Let the paste sit on the stain until it dries. Then, scrape off the dry paste. If the stain is still present, repeat.You should not use peroxide on dark fabrics unless you first test the peroxide on an area that is not visible. The peroxide can have the same effect as bleach. It can cause the fabric to change colors.

, This cleaner does more than keep your windows shiny. After you rinse your fabric in water, spray a generous amount of window cleaner onto the stain. Rub the liquid into the stain with a toothbrush. Wash the fabric normally. If the stain persists, repeat this method before you dry the fabric., Bleach is an alternative if you have a stubborn blood stain. Soak the fabric in cold water for 30 minutes. Wash the fabric once in cold water with your normal detergent. Next, wash your clothes with your normal detergent but add a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach mixed with one cup of water.


The type of bleach you use will depend on the color of fabric. If the fabric is white, you can use traditional bleach. If the fabric is colored, you need to use color safe bleach.
Look for color safe bleach that is safe to apply directly to the stained fabric. Rub the color safe bleach into the fabric. Wash the fabric like normal in cold water."

Place paper towels behind the stain.,
Rinse the fabric.,
Use hand soap.,
Use your saliva.",How to Get Out Blood Stains3," Using paper towels is one way to help pull out a stain when you are on the go and can't wash your clothes immediately. Find a few paper towels to place behind the stained part of the fabric. The thicker the paper towels, the better they will be at pulling out the blood and water.


You can also use a rag or cloth towel if your have one handy., Take another paper towel and soak it in cold water. Place the saturated paper towel over the stain and apply pressure. The water should pass through the fabric and soak into the paper towels placed behind the stain. Keep soaking the paper towel in water to continue removing the blood from the fabric.


If the paper towels behind the stain become saturated, switch them out for dry paper towels., The water may not pull out all the blood in the fabric. If you have access to a public restroom, use some hand soap. Take another paper towel and soak it in cold water. Rub a small amount of hand soap into the paper towel and dab at the stain. Rinse with clean cold water to remove the soap.

, If you don't have access to soap, you can use your saliva. It may sound disgusting, but your saliva is capable of breaking up blood stains because saliva contains an enzyme that will break down the proteins found in the blood stain.

, Soak the stained area of fabric with WD-40 from the back of the fabric. Let the WD-40 sit on the fabric for five minutes before pressing forward.To prevent the WD-40 from getting on anything else, do this on a work surface, like a tool table, unfinished basement floor, or garage floor.
The reason the WD-40 works is because it is a solvent. This means that it can break apart tough stains.

, Flip the garment over so that the stain is now exposed and spray the area again, this time working from the front.


You do not need to let the WD-40 soak into the stain this second time. You can press forwardly immediately after application.






Make sure that the stained portion is still positioned over the paper towels.







, Rinse the WD-40 and crayon out of the fabric thoroughly using cool, running water.


Rinse the stain from the back first to force the excess crayon away along with the WD-40. Then, rinse the front of the stain to remove excess WD-40 from that area.

, Apply a dot of dish soap directly over the stain. Use your fingers or a clean rag to rub the soap into the crayon.


Position the stained fabric back over the paper towels for a few minutes so that the paper towels can continue absorbing some of the stain.

Dip your cloth in, wring the cloth out, and then use it to spot treat the stain. After a few swipes, check the cloth. If it appears dirty, rinse it off in water.For white and beige couches, try mixing equal parts lemon juice and cream of tartar. Let the paste rest on the stain for ten minutes before wiping it off with a damp sponge., Gently rub the stained area to remove the vinegar cleaner. This should also be done during soap treatment if you notice the leather getting too damp. Limited exposure to these cleaners will wear out the leather, but won’t damage it permanently., Find leather conditioners wherever leather or general cleaning supplies are sold. Choose a product that is suitable for your type of leather and follow the directions on the bottle. The instructions will likely have you work a small amount of conditioner into the leather. You can use a dry cloth to spread it from seam to seam over the entire area you treated earlier."

Do a pre-soak if necessary.,
Start a load of laundry.,
Add 1/2 cup baking soda when the machine has filled.,
Dry the clothes outside.",How to Add Baking Soda to Laundry1," If you want to use baking soda as a deodorizer, it's a good idea to soak it in a baking soda solution overnight.

Let the wax dry.,
Scrape off as much of the wax as you can.,
Use an iron to melt the wax.,
Apply laundry prewash stain remover.,
Try a blow dryer.,
Put the clothing in boiling water.,
Try vegetable oil or carpet cleaner.,
Put the clothing in the freezer.",How to Remove Wax from Clothing," No matter which approach you use to remove wax from clothing, you will have better results if you try to remove the wax after it dries. This may go against your instinct to get rid of a stain right away, but you don't want to try to remove wax while it's hot.


If you rub at the wax when it’s hot, you could spread it to other areas of the clothing and make the situation worse. So, resist the temptation to run for the sink while the wax is still hot or to smear it with your fingers. You could let the wax dry naturally. Or you could put ice cubes on the clothing to make it dry faster or put it in the freezer.;
, Once the wax is dry, you want to scrap off the easily removable wax before applying heat. You can use a dull knife to do this.


Scrape in a direction away from the body, so you don’t hurt yourself. The reason you want to use a dull knife is that a sharper knife could easily put a hole in the clothing.
If the clothing is very delicate, such as silk, you should use a spoon instead and skim it over the wax lightly. Avoid digging into the cloth, or you might damage it. You could also try using a credit card edge instead of a dull knife. , You can remove wax – such as candle wax – from clothing if you use an iron. Keep it on low heat. You should apply the heat to the wax after you’ve scraped it with the dull knife or spoon. Then, put paper towels on top of the clothing. You could use brown paper bags instead of paper towels. You may need to replace the paper periodically as some wax comes off. You could put a thin cloth in between the iron and the paper towels, which should be pressed onto the waxy area of the clothing.
Press the warm iron to the paper or cloth. This is going to move the wax from the clothing to the paper towels or bags. The iron should not be on steam setting, or it won’t work. This procedure works well for larger wax stains. Be careful you don’t burn the clothing.
Use blotting paper instead of paper towels on fabric like fleece or wool. Otherwise, you might end up with small bits of the paper caught in the fabric.

, After you’ve tried the ironing approach, using laundry prewash stain remover on the clothing before washing it should remove any lingering hint of the wax or stain from it.


You want to wash the clothing in the hottest water you can. Use bleach on the clothing if it’s white. Otherwise, use color bleach. This step is even more important when colored wax has fallen on white or light colored clothing.
Don’t put the clothing in the dryer until you are sure the stain is gone. The heat could set the stain otherwise.
Alternately, hand-wash if you're dealing with very delicate items of clothing or get them dry cleaned. , If you don't have or don't want to use an iron, you can find other ways to deliver enough heat to the wax that you should be able to melt and remove it.


Put paper towels on both sides, use a hair dryer to blow heat on the spot for five seconds and blot it out with the paper towel. This method works well for clothing that you fear could be damaged by too hot an iron.
You may need to use the stain remover and wash the clothes if a stain remains.

, Dipping the clothing into a large kettle of boiling water can remove wax. The trick is adding baking soda to the boiling water.


Take a very large kettle. Boil water in it. Put 5-6 teaspoons of baking soda into the water. Dip the clothing with wax on it into the boiling water with a stick or rod. After about a minute, the wax should fall into the water.Dip the clothing into the water several times. It should only take a minute or so for the wax to soften and fall into the kettle. Keeping the fabric in the boiling water for too long can harm the clothing by removing its dye.
For more delicate clothing like fleece, you can place a towel over the waxed area and iron the towel. The wax will be absorbed out of the clothing and into the towel. This will avoid damaging clothing with boiling water.

, If the stains are small, you could use vegetable oil to get them off. Apply a dollop of vegetable oil to the wax. Alternatively, you should scrape away most of the wax, apply a carpet cleaner, brush it with a toothbrush, and clean your item of clothing in the washer.


Use paper towels to wipe off the excess wax. Launder the clothing.
Avoid stronger solutions like paint thinner or gasoline. However, you could try using a small amount of rubbing alcohol on the stain in addition to vegetable oil. , You just need to wait until the cold makes the wax brittle. Then, you should be able to snap most of the wax off.


You should only need to keep the clothing in the freezer for about an hour for this process to work. There might be some wax remaining. If there is, put the area of the clothing with wax on it over a large bowl and secure it to the bowl with rubber bands. Then, pour boiling water over the wax. This should melt it. Wash the clothing as usual.
If you want to freeze your wax using a different method, try some wart removal spray to freeze it quickly and safely.

Place a cloth underneath the stain.,
Blot the stain with a white cloth.,
Blot the other side of the garment.",How to Remove Ink from Clothes1," If you are working on a fresh stain, you should try to absorb as much ink as possible. Before blotting the stain, place a white cloth or rag underneath the stained portion of the garment. This will prevent the stain from spreading to the back of the garment while you attempt to remove it.








Use a white cloth to ensure that the color of the cloth doesn’t lift and further stain the garment you’re working on.;
, Take another white cloth and blot at the stain. Use gentle dabbing motions instead of rubbing the stain, as rubbing can ingrain the stain further into the fibers of the garment. Keep dabbing until no more ink is being lifted from the stain.







, Flip the garment over and place the clean cloth underneath the stained portion. Repeat the process of dabbing the stain on the other side of the garment, stopping when you don’t see any more ink being lifted.

Moisten a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol.,
Spot test the rubbing alcohol in a hidden area.,
Rub the alcohol into the stain.,
Condition the leather.",How to Clean Leather Stains3," Tip the bottle of rubbing alcohol over a little. Hold a cotton ball up to the mouth of the container or dip a cotton swab inside of it. Dampen the cotton, making sure it isn’t saturated or dripping.Rubbing alcohol and cotton balls can be found in the personal care sections of any drug or general store.

, Choose an area that isn’t normally seen, such as under couch cushions or a bag’s inside corner. Press the cotton to the leather. Allow the rubbing alcohol to sit for ten minutes, then check to see if it left a stain., Take the dampened cotton ball and place it on the ink or mold mark. Gently rub the area in a circular motion. The ink will begin to disappear, although the leather will also lose some of its moisture., Use your leather conditioner to treat and preserve your object. At the very least, spot treat the area by applying a little bit of conditioner and working it into the cleaned area. Take this opportunity if you can to apply conditioner from seam to seam on the surface you cleaned."

Wipe up as much of the spill as possible.,
Wash the stain with soap and water.,
Erase scuff marks with nail polish remover.",How to Clean Leather Stains4," As soon as you notice the spill, treat it with cloth or paper towels. Blot the outside edge of the stain first and work towards the center. This will keep the stain from spreading and setting., Most dirt and food stains will come off with a basic washing. You may try wiping up the stain with lukewarm water or a mixture of water and a squeeze of a mild soap. Make sure the sponge or cloth is damp rather than soaked, then wipe it from side to side across the leather.

A leather cleaner is a useful alternative. It will protect the leather and prevent the stain from setting.

, For stubborn marks, such as scuff marks or scratches, try acetone. Dampen a cotton ball or swab in nail polish remover. Rub the acetone into the mark with circular motions."
"
Vacuum off the leather.,
Clean along the leather’s grain.,
Wipe down the leather twice a month with a damp cloth.,
Apply leather conditioner twice a year.",How to Clean Leather Stains5," Vacuuming removes dust and debris that can cause stains. It can also prevent dirt from getting into the leather when you treat stains. Do this at least twice a month. Use a soft brush attachment to get into crevices., Look carefully at the leather. You may notice that the fibers move in a certain direction. Try to work along the direction of the grain during basic cleaning. It’ll keep your leather healthier for longer., Dampen a clean cloth in warm water. You may also use your mild hand soap, dish detergent, or leather soap. Make sure the cloth isn’t dripping or soaked. Be gentle but quick. Do this up to once a week., Conditioner protects the leather fibers, keeping them strong and resistant to stains. Get a store-bought conditioner and follow the directions on the label. Typically, you only have to do this twice a year. In areas with dry heat, you’ll have to do this three or more times a year to keep the leather from drying out. After cleaning up a stain, you should also condition the leather.

Homemade conditioner can be made out of one part white vinegar and two parts linseed or flax oil. Wipe a cloth in circular motions to work in the conditioner, then let it rest overnight.

Check the care-label.,
Assess the age.,
Use a mild bleach-free detergent.,
Test for colorfastness.,
Spot-clean the rest of the hat if it’s fragile.,
Spot-clean heavily soiled areas before washing.,
Handwash for best results.,
Soak the hat in warm water and a mild detergent.,
Scrub the hat with a toothbrush and rinse.,
Machine-wash with caution.,
Pat it dry after washing.,
Fit it onto a head-shaped form.,
Allow the hat to air-dry.",How to Clean a Black Hat," Always start by checking the manufacturer’s instructions regarding cleaning for your particular hat. Expect different hats to be made of different materials, some of which are more easily damaged by water and/or scrubbing. If the care label is missing or unreadable, contact the manufacturer if possible. Otherwise, assume that it’s made of fragile materials.Never machine-wash a hat unless the care label specifically states that it’s safe to do so.;
, Keep in mind that older hats (pre-1980s) are more likely to have cardboard in the brim and/or cap. Expect these to not stand up to water at all. If your hat appears to be that old, skip any step that involves soaking it.Do the same if your care label is missing and you think any particular part of your hat looks like it’s made of fragile materials.

, Always use a mild laundry detergent, since harsher cleaners may affect its color. Never use bleach or any detergent in which bleach is an ingredient, because bleach will definitely ruin your black hat. If it's made of wool or felt, use a detergent specifically designed for wool., Before you attempt any cleaning, make sure the hat’s colors won’t run when washing. Dampen a white or light-colored cloth with water and a drop of detergent. Rub this underneath the hat’s brim or the inside of the hat if it’s made from the same material as the outside. Check the cloth for any staining from the hat. If the cloth is stained black, don’t proceed any further. Have the hat dry-cleaned instead., If you’re unsure of your hat’s materials and/or think that part of it is particularly delicate, stick to spot-cleaning only. Repeat the previous step. This time, however, give the whole hat the same treatment., Start filling a sink or bucket with cool water and add a few drops of mild laundry detergent. Dampen a clean cloth in the soapy water, wring out the excess, and rub it over the dirty area(s). Work up a foam by scrubbing the area(s) with a toothbrush. Dampen a new cloth with plain water and wipe the area(s) until no traces of soap remain.Scrub gently around stitches. Forceful scrubbing may weaken these.Also be gentle with wool and felt hats for the same reason.

, Expect machine-washing to run a higher risk of affecting the shape and color of your hat. Hand-wash whenever you can, and never machine-wash a wool or felt hat.

, Start by soaking the hat in the soapy water for at least 20 minutes. You can leave it soaking for up to 2 hours, depending on how dirty it is., Scrub out any remaining dirt or stains with a toothbrush. Remember to be gentle around stitches. Rinse out the soap with running water, then shake out the excess water or let it drip back into the sink or onto a towel., Use a front-loading machine, not a top one, if machine-washing. Start by treating soiled areas with a stain pre-treatment and give it about ten minutes to set in. Then insert the hat into a hat form if you can find one for your specific hat. Wash the hat with like-colored garments or on its own. Use mild detergent, cold water, and the delicate cycle.Expect the central agitator in the basin of top-loading machines to damage the hat’s shape.
Refrain from using your dishwasher. These use hot water, and many dishwashing detergents have bleach, so expect dishwashers to ruin your hat’s shape, size, and color

, Whether you washed it by hand or a machine, use a towel to blot out the excess moisture immediately afterward. Absorb as much water as you can. Reduce its water-weight to help preserve its shape as it air-dries. Be gentle as you do, though. Avoid crushing, denting, or otherwise marring the hat’s shape., Ideally, use a mannequin head that’s roughly the same size as your own. Otherwise, use a similarly sized round object (like a ball or rolled-up towel) to fit your hat onto. Set this on top of a dry towel to absorb any excess water that drips.


Wool hats lose their shape very easily. For best results, wear it as it dries if possible.

, Never use a machine dryer. Expect the heat to shrink or otherwise warp the hat’s shape. Let it dry on its own instead.Place fans around it to dry it faster if desired.A hair-dryer set to a low setting and held from a safe distance (a foot or more) is safe to use to make drying even quicker.
Depending on the internal components, losing shape may not be as much of an issue for certain styles of hats. However, you still want to set it on something like a coffee can to keep the brim from resting on the wet towel.

Do not place the clothing in the dryer.,
Separate the clothing.,
Read the clothing labels.",How to Remove Coloring Washed in to Clothes1," It is important that you do not put clothing onto which color has transferred into the dryer. Doing so will set the transferred dye into the fabric. This will create a permanent transfer of color between the items, effectively ruining your clothing., Once you realize that dye from one piece of clothing has transferred on to your white clothing, separate the colored piece of clothing from the white clothing. This will prevent additional dye from transferring on to your white clothes.

, Before you attempt to remove dye that has transferred on to your clothing, you will need to carefully read the clothing labels. The labels will tell you whether it is safe to sue products like bleach, and what temperatures are safe for washing the fabric.

",How to Remove a Coffee Stain from a Cotton Shirt1," Blot the stain with the wet paper towels or cloth to remove as much of the stain as you can. Make sure that you only blot at the stain, as rubbing may cause it to spread.









Cold water is best for a fresh stain, since heat can ""set"" the stain into the fabric.;
, Washing from the side opposite the stain will help push the coffee off the shirt, instead of pressing it further in.Wring out the shirt of excess water.








, This should pick up some of the stain and mix it into a soapy residue, which is easier to remove.








You may use diluted shampoo instead, but only if it contains no fragrance, color, or conditioner.

, The coffee stain is slightly acidic, so vinegar is more effective than pure water.







, You may need to apply dishwashing liquid and vinegar up to seven times to remove stubborn stains.However, if you don't notice any change after two or three treatments, it's probably best to move on to the next step.








, If the dishwashing liquid and vinegar didn't do it, move on to a commercial product. Stain removers in bar soap form can be rubbed directly onto the stain, and left for about a minute. Liquid stain removers can be effective as well, but work best when you have time to soak the clothing in water for a longer period of time.









If you do not have a commercial laundry stain remover, apply a small amount of liquid detergent to the stain. Rub the detergent onto the stain with your fingers, and let it sit on the shirt for about 15 minutes.
You can buy stain removers specifically for coffee, but these are usually expensive for what's hopefully a one-time occurrence.

, Be sure to rinse out the stain remover thoroughly if you use bleach in your laundry, as the two products can react to dye your clothes.

Scrub the baking soda into the stain to make sure it can treat all of the fibers. This method is fine to use on denim and thick cotton.
Don't scrub the baking soda into delicate fabric. Silk, satin and other thin fabrics could warp when scrubbed.

, Run it under warm running water to rinse away the baking soda along with the stain. For more delicate fabrics, you can wipe away the baking soda using a dampened cloth., Some difficult stains require more than one treatment. Apply a second round of paste to the stain. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse it away. If the stain remains, you may need to use a chemical stain remover or take the item to be professionally cleaned.
