You can't do much about the detergent, but switching to a deodorant without antiperspirant can solve your problem. If the switch isn't worth the sweat, you'll need an acidic treatment to dissolve the aluminum bond. Read on for more guidance.


Not all antiperspirants are created equal. Neutral, unscented antiperspirant tends to leave white stains, which are harder to notice and easier to clean. However, all-natural, plant-based deodorants may leave a very yellow stain, even if unscented.;
, No single treatment is best at cleaning sweat stains, because of the vast differences between deodorant brands. Check out the stain to get a good idea of what might work:


If the stain is white, hard, and brittle, any acid will usually remove the stain. Use the most convenient option from the lists below.
If the stain is bright white and bends easily, it will require stronger acids. Try one of the strong treatments below, such as lemon juice or vinegar.
If the stain is yellow, it's hard to evaluate. Try any convenient option first. If that doesn't work, you may need to make several attempts with strong treatments.

, If you happen to have these already, you can give them a go. These tend to be weaker acids than the strong treatments below:


Clear soda or soft drinks (carbolic and phosphoric acids); avoid colored sodas
A paste of baking soda and a little water (although alkaline, this contains carbonic acid)
Crushed aspirin (acetylsalicylic)
Meat tenderizer powder (not a great option, due to variation between brands)

, If the stain is tough to remove, try these stronger treatments:


Strong white vinegar (acetic acid)

Do not use balsamic vinegar as that will further ruin the clothes


Lemon juice, or any raw citrus fruit (citric acid)
Professional cleaners may use stronger acid treatments. Request this as a last resort, due to the risk of burning holes in your clothing.

, Saturate the stain with your chosen acid. Let sit for 20 minutes to 2 hours, depending on how old and heavy the stain is. Squeeze out the wet area of the shirt before you continue.

, This is a whitening agent, which may bleach colored clothing. If used on a white shirt, this can help make the stain less noticeable. Saturate the stain and let sit another 20 minutes.


Optionally, add baking powder and salt as well to abrade the stain.

, You can add this to the rest of your clothes. If you are concerned about setting the stain further, you may want to run it through without laundry detergent — but most people do not find this necessary.


If the stain is less visible but not completely gone, run it through a second time.

, This may do the job, but it will bleach colored clothing. If nothing else works, apply stain remover over the stain and wash again with a scoop or two of bleach directly on the clothing.


Set your washer on the highest spin speed so the bleach is evenly distributed throughout your clothing.

Remove loose pollen.,
Place the garment in direct sunlight.,
Soak the stain in cold water for 30 minutes.",How to Get Rid of a Pollen Stain1," Shake the stained garment and press the adhesive side of tape to it to lift remaining pollen. Similarly, loose pollen grains can be gently vacuumed from the fabric. This will prevent you from grinding the pollen grains into the fibers of your garment any more and prevent the stain from growing larger. , Hang the garment up in direct sunlight for two to three hours. After a few hours have passed, check the stain; the sun should completely (or nearly completely) fade the pollen stain. If the stain is severe, however, this may not be enough to eliminate it.

, If sunlight alone is not enough, place the fabric in cold water and soak it. After soaking, allow the garment to dry in direct sunlight. "

Understand that damage can sometimes be permanent.",How to Remove Scorch Marks1," Like many common types of clothing stains, scorch marks are easiest to treat right after they've occurred. This article contains a few different methods for removing scorch marks from your clothing. Regardless of whether you use the method in this section or one of the other ones, you'll always want to immediately move your scorched fabric away from the offending heat source and start cleaning it as soon as you notice a scorch mark.


Don't let a scorched piece of clothing or fabric sit out while you finish your ironing — the amount of time you take to begin treating the mark can make the difference between the total removal of the stain and the lingering annoyance of a dark spot on your fabric.;
, To begin pre-treating your clothing or fabric, give it a quick rinse. This serves two purposes. First, it prepares it to absorb the laundry detergent you'll treat it with in the next step. Second, it will wash away any loose singed matter, giving you a better idea of how bad your scorch mark actually is.

, Using your fingers, gently rub your clothing's normal laundry detergent into the scorch mark. By giving the detergent a chance to ""set"" into the stain before you wash the item, you increase its stain-removing power. Don't use bleach or other specialty cleaning solutions yet — you'll have a chance to do this in the next step.


Liquid detergent works best for this because it can seep between the tightly-woven fibers of the fabric to treat the mark on a microscopic level. However, for this (and other common stain-removal tasks) you can also use powdered detergent if you mix it with a little water first to form a loose paste., If the fabric of your item is made from a material that is safe to use with bleach, you may want to pre-treat the fabric even further by letting it soak for about 15 minutes in a solution of water and bleach. Use a capful or two of bleach for about every gallon of water you use. Stir the mixture occasionally to ensure it soaks evenly.


If you're unsure of whether your item is made of a bleach-safe fabric, check its care label. As a general rule, wool, silk, mohair, and non-colorfast fabrics are generally not suitable for cleaning with bleach., When you've finished pre-treating your fabric, throw it in the washing machine and begin a normal cycle. In other words, use the wash settings recommended on the garment's care label. You may also include any other clothes that you need to wash as long as they can be safely washed with the settings and cleaning products you are using.


As above, you may also use bleach or other cleaning products here if they are normally safe for the fabric.

, Remove your item from the washer and check the scorch mark — hopefully, it will be less visible than before. You may need to repeat the wash cycle several times for ideal results. To dry your fabric, rather than using a dryer, try drying it in the sunlight if there is reasonable weather outside. The sun's rays are well-known to lighten all types of dark, unsightly stains in fabric, including scorch marks.Don't leave your item in the sun for more than a day or so. Over time, sunlight can gradually weaken fabric, making it more susceptible to damage and causing bright colors to fade.

, Unfortunately, especially bad scorch marks may not be removable even with repeated treatment. In these cases, you may need to try covering the mark, cutting it out and patching it, discarding the item, or giving it away. Alternatively, you can also try recycling your fabric for another purpose.

Find an alcohol-based hairspray.,
Spot test an inconspicuous area.,
Spray the stain with hairspray.,
Let the hairspray set.,
Blot the stain with a clean cloth.",How to Remove Ink from Clothes2," Hairspray is an unlikely but effective stain remover that you can use to remove your ink stain. Find a hairspray that is alcohol-based, as alcohol is the key element in hairspray that is effective at breaking up the stain.








If you haven’t already, lay out your garment and place a clean cloth underneath the stained portion to prepare it for cleaning.

, Before using hairspray or any other cleaning method, it’s a good idea to spot test to make sure that the cleaner doesn’t further stain the fabric. To spot test, spray a small amount of hairspray on an inconspicuous area of the garment, wait about 30 seconds, then blot it away. If the area looks a little damp but otherwise unchanged, it’s safe to use hairspray on the stain.








If the hairspray smears or alters the color of the garment, do not use it on the stain.
Hairspray works best on polyester-based fabrics. Do not use hairspray to remove a stain from leather, as alcohol-based products can damage the material.

, After you have laid out your garment, hold the hairspray about a foot from the garment and spray the stained area evenly and generously with hairspray.







, After you spray the stain with hairspray, let the hairspray set for a minute. This allows the alcohol of the hairspray to break apart the ink stain. Don’t let the hairspray sit for too long, or it will dry into the fabric., After about a minute of letting the hairspray set, begin blotting the stain with a clean white cloth or a cotton ball. You should see the ink stain being lifted. Keep dabbing at the stain until the stain is removed or until no more ink is being lifted.








If the stain is completely gone, launder the garment as usual.

"
"
Dab with rubbing alcohol.,
Use glycerin and dish detergent.,
Use baking soda and water.,
Clean the stain with white vinegar.,
Blot with dry cleaning fluid.",How to Remove Ink from Clothes3," Dip a clean white cloth or sponge in rubbing alcohol, then begin dabbing at the stain, blotting gently. If you succeeded in getting out the stain, launder the garment as you usually would.








Don’t use rubbing alcohol on acetate, silk, wool or rayon.
Rubbing alcohol is effective at getting out any kind of ink stain, whether it be from a marker or a ballpoint pen, so it’s a good cleaner to use if hairspray wasn’t powerful enough to get out the stain.

, Mix 1 tablespoon (14.78 ml) of glycerin and 1 teaspoon (4.92 ml) of liquid dish detergent in a bowl. Dip a white cloth into the glycerin mixture and dab at one side of the stain. When you don’t see any more of the stain being lifted, flip the garment over and dab the other side of the stain.








After dabbing, let the garment sit for about 5 minutes. Then use your finger to apply more glycerin to the stain. Then flush the garment with water to remove the glycerin and soap.
Glycerin is a good agent for old stains because it saturates the stain and helps to lift it, which lets the detergent clean it away. It should work on all fabrics.

, To lift up the stain with baking soda, mix together a 2 to 1 combination of baking soda and water in a small bowl to make a loose paste. Use a cotton ball to apply the paste onto the ink stain, then dab with the cotton ball. Once the stain has been removed or is no longer lifting, wipe off the paste with a clean cloth or paper towel.








Baking soda is safe to use on all materials.

, If you have not succeeded in getting out the stain, soak the entire garment in a 1 to 1 solution of white vinegar and water for 30 minutes. While the garment is soaking, gently blot the stain with a sponge or cloth every 10 minutes or so. Then launder your garment as usual.








Don’t use hot water, as hot water can set the stain.
White vinegar is safe to use on all materials.

, There are many kinds of commercial stain removers and dry cleaning fluid on the market designed to get rid of stains. Apply using the instructions on the bottle, then blot at the stain using a clean cloth.








Make sure that you read the label and aren’t using a cleaner that could damage the material of your garment.

Soak white clothing in bleach or vinegar.,
Rinse and launder.,
Try a color remover.",How to Remove Coloring Washed in to Clothes2," Place the whites in a large sink or bathtub. Add one cup (235 mL) of white vinegar. If the clothing labels state bleach is okay, you can substitute the vinegar with ¼ cup (60 mL) of non-chlorine bleach. Add one gallon (3.8 liters) of cool water. Soak for 30 minutes., After you have soaked the white clothing for 30 minutes, rinse with cool water. Then place the laundry in the washing machine. Add detergent and wash with cool water. Air dry the clothing., If soaking and washing the white clothing in vinegar or bleach does not remove the dye, you can try a color remover like Rit Color Remover or Carbona Color Remover. Mix the product with water according to package directions, and then soak, rinse, and launder the clothing.You should only use color remover on all-white clothing as this harsh product will strip all dyes from the fabric.

Try rewashing with detergent.,
Soak in color safe bleach.,
Try a color catcher.",How to Remove Coloring Washed in to Clothes3," If dye has transferred from one colored item to another, you may be able to easily remove by simply rewashing the clothing with laundry detergent. Place the items with dye transfer into the washing machine. Add detergent and wash according to clothing label., If rewashing the colored fabrics does not remove the transferred dye, you can try soaking the items in color safe bleach. First test an inconspicuous patch of the fabric for colorfastness. Then add color safe bleach to water according to package directions. Soak for at least eight hours, rinse, launder, and air dry., A color catcher is a piece of fabric that has been specially formulated to catch bleeding dye in the washing machine. Place the color catcher in the washing machine and then wash the clothes according to the instructions on the package.You can buy color catchers at your local grocery store or online.

"
Read your clothing labels.,
Sort your clothing.,
Wash problematic items separately.,
Don’t allow wet clothes to sit.",How to Remove Coloring Washed in to Clothes4," One of the easiest ways to prevent coloring from one piece of clothing transferring to another is by reading the labels on your clothing. Many items, like dark denim, will include tags that state the dye might transfer. These tags will also instruct you to wash the items separately., You can prevent color transfer between clothing items by sorting and washing the items accordingly. For example, you should sort white clothing, dark or black clothing, and brightly colored clothing into separate piles. You should then wash each pile of laundry separately to prevent color transfer., There are certain items of clothing that can be particularly problematic and result in the unwanted transfer of color. You should wash these items by themselves and according to the directions on the clothing label. For example, it is a good idea to was a new pair of dark denim jeans or a red cotton shirt by themselves.

, Forgetting to remove your wet clothes from the washing machine can result in dye transferring from one item to another. To prevent this from happening, always remove your clothes when the washing machine’s cycle ends. Do not allow them to sit unattended in a laundry basket while wet."

Treat with lemon juice.,
Apply hydrogen peroxide or color safe bleach.,
Remove the stain using baking soda.,
Blot with rubbing alcohol.,
Rub with egg yolk.,
Leave it in the sun.",How to Remove a Coffee Stain from a Cotton Shirt2," Test the lemon juice first by swabbing a little on the inside collar. If the fabric doesn't turn yellow, treat the stain with more lemon juice, let sit, and rinse off. Rinse the stain first if the coffee contained a lot of sugar, as this can react with acid to add a new, brownish-yellow stain that's tough to take out.








, You can buy hydrogen peroxide from a pharmacy, or color safe bleach from anywhere that sells household supplies. Test colored fabric first by swabbing a little onto the inside collar. If the color isn't affected, rub over the stain and let sit for a about thirty seconds before rinsing off. If stain persists, apply without rubbing and wait another thirty seconds, then rinse. Repeat as necessary.









If the coffee stain has already set, mix the hydrogen peroxide with some dishwashing liquid or liquid soap before applying.
Color safe bleach usually includes hydrogen peroxide. If one doesn't work, the other probably won't either.
You can use regular bleach instead, for white shirts.

, Sprinkle some baking soda onto a wet piece of cloth. Use the cloth to blot out the stain.







, Apply some rubbing alcohol onto the stain. Blot with a clean, wet cloth. Rinse.







, Beat an egg yolk, and add a little warm water. Rub the mixture onto the stain using a sponge or a terry cloth. Rinse.







, Soak the stain with water and lay the shirt over a towel in direct sunlight. Many stains will disappear after two or three days of hot sun, and it may make the fabric look more vivid as well.

"
"
Rinse the stain with cold water.,
Apply a pretreatment solution and let it soak for 20 minutes.,
Wash the garment in your washing machine.",How to Get Rid of a Pollen Stain2," Use cold water to flush out as much of the stain as possible. Many of the pigments in pollen are composed of fats and respond best to cold water for removal.Therefore, avoid using hot water before pretreating the stain, as it may further set it and make it more difficult to remove later., You can use an enzyme cleaner, traditional laundry spot cleaner, or a small amount of dishwashing liquid. Any of these pretreatment solutions should be adequate for stain removal. Gently work the pretreatment solution of your choice into the stain and allow it to sit for at least 20 minutes before washing.Before pretreating, test the solution on an inconspicuous area to test for color-fastness.
Enzyme cleaners work by breaking down biological substances (such as the fat in pollen pigment) and thus generally work best for this type of stain., Use your normal detergent on the hottest setting that the fabric will allow (check the tags of the garment for washing instructions). For stubborn stains, use an enzyme-based detergent and wash in warm water; this type of detergent works best with warm, but not hot, water."
"
Purchase an at-home dry cleaning kit.,
Blot the stain.,
Dry clean the garment according to the kit’s instructions.",How to Get Rid of a Pollen Stain3," This method is best if the stained garment is dry-clean only or the stain is on carpet, upholstery, or other surface that cannot be soaked. The kit should come with a reusable bag, cleaning cloths, and stain remover., Use a small amount of dry cleaning stain remover and a clean cloth to gently blot the stain; continue to blot without adding more solution until the stain is dry. If the stain remains, repeat with more stain remover and another clean cloth., Generally, you will place the garment in the provided bag along with a pre-moistened cleaning cloth and dry on a medium setting for about 30 minutes."
"
Cover the stain with a hydrogen peroxide-soaked cloth.,
Cover this with a dry cloth.,
Iron on medium-high heat.,
Replace liquids as they dry out.",How to Remove Scorch Marks2," This unconventional trick can work surprisingly well, making it a favorite of many amateur cleaners on the internet.To start, find an old rag and dampen it with hydrogen peroxide. Lay your scorched item flat on your work surface and cover the scorch with the damp rag.


Hydrogen peroxide, a cleaning solution with mild bleaching properties, is usually available at grocery stores and pharmacies for quite cheap.
If you have ammonia handy, you may also want to splash a few drops directly onto the scorch mark itself. Though ammonia and hydrogen peroxide are safe to use with each other (unlike ammonia and bleach), this isn't a mixture you'll want to ingest or rub into your face, so be sure to wash your hands when you're done.

, Next, put a clean, dry rag on top of the hydrogen peroxide-soaked rag. To be perfectly clear, you want to have three things stacked on your work surface: on the bottom, your scorched item, in the middle, your peroxide rag, and on top, your dry rag.

, Let your iron heat up to a fairly hot (but not extremely high) temperature. Start gently rubbing the top cloth. The heat will gradually permeate through the layers and into your scorched item, where it will help the hydrogen peroxide work into the scorch mark and start to remove it. Be patient — this process can take some time.

, Check on your scorch mark frequently as you iron the top cloth. For mild to moderate scorch marks, you should notice steady, gradual improvement. If, at any point, you notice that the middle cloth is starting to dry out, remove it and give it another application of hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, if you initially sprinkled your scorched item with ammonia and you notice that it has dried out, give it a few more drops. Doing this keeps the cleaning process as quick and effective as possible.


You'll also want to remove the top cloth and replace it with another if it ever becomes soaked with hydrogen peroxide from the middle cloth. This prevents rust stains on the iron."
"
Wash with freshly squeezed lemon juice.,
Rinse with white vinegar.,
Soak in ice water.,
For bad scorch marks, try scrubbing with an emery pad.",How to Remove Scorch Marks3," If the methods above haven't worked for you, don't worry yet — some sources on the internet recommend a variety of alternate remedies. Though these aren't necessarily guaranteed to work as well as the methods above, they're unlikely to hurt. For starters, try squeezing the juice from a lemon over your item to soak the scorch mark. Drop the item into a container of hot water and let it sit for about 15-30 minutes. Remove and dry as normal.


To be safe, don't try this trick with non-bleach-safe fabrics like silk, wool, and so on. Though lemon juice is very mild compared to bleach, some sources report that it can cause minor damage to these types of fabrics., Another trick for removing scorch marks from your clothes is to soak a sponge or rag in white vinegar and rub the scorch mark with it. Let the now-soaked item sit for about 10 to 15 minutes before rinsing with cool water. Dry as normal.


Only use white vinegar — never red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or other types, as these can cause new stains which can be hard to remove themselves.

, If you've just accidentally given your fabric a scorch mark, some sources recommend letting the item soak in ice-cold water before doing anything else.Keep the water cold as the item soaks either by adding ice or moving the container to a freezer. For best results, let the item soak for at least an hour.


If you do move your item into a freezer, don't forget about it — though freezing clothing or fabric won't usually damage the item, it will halt the cleaning process.

, Heavy scorch marks may not be removable with any sort of normal cleaning methods. However, in some cases, you may still be able to lessen the visible damage from a scorch mark by using a gentle abrasive like an emery pad to scrape dark burnt material away. This is not guaranteed to work, and if you rub too harshly, it's even possible to wear a new hole in the fabric. However, compared to the possibility of needing to throw the garment out, many may find this risk worth it.


For this tactic, you don't necessarily need to use an emery pad — any mild abrasive (like sandpaper, for instance) can work well.

Launder the clothing item.",How to Get Nail Polish out of Fabric1," The part of the fabric that is stained should be against the paper towels. Use this method whether the nail polish is wet or dry.


This method works effectively on cotton, linen, silk, denim, and most other fabrics.
Proceed with caution if the item in question contains acetate or triacetate since the nail polish remover melts fabrics containing these chemicals.;
, Use a cotton ball or paper towel saturated with acetone (available in drugstores in the nail polish remover section) to blot the backside of the fabric. This action transfers the stain to the paper towel.








, Take the clothing item to the sink and rinse out the stained area, then place it face down on a clean set of paper towels. Repeat the blotting action to finish transferring the stain to the paper towels.









Continue rinsing the fabric and applying more acetone until the paper towels no longer turn the color of the nail polish after blotting; this indicates the stain has been removed.
Check the stained area one final time for traces of nail polish. If you see a little color left, dip a cotton ball in acetone and gently remove it.

, Use a stain remover product on the previously stained area, and then launder the item according to the washing instructions on the tag. The stain should be completely gone and the item ready to wear once it is dry.

Place a towel or cloth underneath the stain.,
Dab at the stain.,
Dry your garment.",How to Remove Self Tanning Lotion Stains from Clothes1," Take the garment off and bring it to the sink. Hold it so that the entire stain is visible. Turn over the garment so that the back side of the stain is under the faucet. , It's essential to wet the stain right after it happens. Flush cold water over the shirt making sure that the stain gets completely wet. The pressure of the water should loosen the particles of the tanner so that they get washed away. Do not rub at the stain as you are washing it. This will only make the stain stick more to the shirt.

, If the pressure of the water has not fully removed the stain, try using club soda. Pour club soda or seltzer over a cloth or towel. You don’t want to drench the cloth, but it should be more than a few drops. If you have a very big stain, use more club soda. If you don’t have club soda or seltzer in your home, you can also use water.

, Your garment is likely wet at this point from the water, but you will want to put something under the stain. You will be pressing on the stain, so putting a towel underneath it will stop it from spreading.


If it is a garment like a scarf that you can lay flat, you do not need to put anything under the stain as long as you are sure that the stain isn’t touching any other portion of the fabric.

, Taking the cloth you poured club soda on, dab gently at the self-tanner stain. Do not rub or scrub at the stain; this will only make the stain more ingrained in the fabric. Instead, try to dab at the fabric, focusing on the heaviest area of the stain.

, If you see that the stain is removed, launder your garment as you usually do. If the stain is still visible, do not put the clothing item in the dryer. The heat from the dryer will make the stain set. Instead, wring out any excess water and hang the shirt up to dry. Make sure not to hang the piece of clothing out in the sun. The sun's heat can also make the stain set into the garment.

Make sure not to rub the stain; instead, use a light hand and dab with patting movements, starting from the center of the stain and working out.Dabbing at the stain works especially well for fresh stains, because moistening the stain prevents it from spreading and setting in the fabric. If the stain is fresh, dabbing at the stain may be enough to absorb and remove the stain.;
, If the perfume stain you are removing isn’t fresh, just dabbing at it may not be enough. To more aggressively combat the stain, create a solution that is one part glycerin, one part dishwashing detergent and 8 parts water.If you just have a small stain, use one teaspoon or tablespoon of glycerin and dishwashing detergent and 8 teaspoons or tablespoons of water.
Stir the detergent solution to mix thoroughly.

, After you have mixed together your detergent solution, pour a small amount onto the stain. Make sure to only apply the solution to the stain, not to the surrounding area., Once you have applied the detergent solution, fold up a sheet of paper towel and place it on top of the stain. Then let the detergent work on the fabric for about ten minutes.As the detergent solution works to lift up the stain, the paper towel will absorb the stain out of the fabric.

, After about ten minutes, check on the paper towel. If you see that some of the oily stain has transferred to the paper towel, swap the paper towel out for another folded sheet. Keep repeating this process until no more stain gets lifted.


If you notice that the area of the stain is drying, add more detergent solution.
If none of the stain seems to have been removed, keep the original paper towel there and keep checking until some of the stain has been absorbed.

, If you still notice stain remnant after using the detergent solution lifting process, dip a cotton ball in rubbing solution and dab the rubbing alcohol over the stain. Then dab a teaspoon or so of rubbing alcohol to a sheet of folded paper towel and place it over the stain.The rubbing alcohol and paper towel will work in a similar way as the detergent solution, they are just slightly more powerful as cleaning agents.

, Look at the paper towel after ten minutes or so. If you notice that some of the stain is lifted, change out the paper towel. If nothing has been absorbed, place the paper towel back on the rubbing alcohol and the stain and keep checking until some of the stain has been lifted.


Add rubbing alcohol if you notice that the stain is drying.
Keep repeating this process until no more of the stain is being lifted.
If the stain has been completely removed, flush the garment with water to remove any detergent solution or rubbing alcohol, then hang the garment up to dry.

, If hand-removing the stain hasn’t worked, soak the fabric in a solution of one part water and one part baking soda for 10-15 minutes. Then launder as usual in the washer and dryer."

Contact a professional.",How to Remove Nail Polish From Leather," If you have just spilled nail polish on leather, you should immediately try to treat it by scraping the nail polish off of the leather with a small spatula or dull-bladed knife. This works best if the nail polish is still wet, as it will be easier to scrape off the leather.


As you remove the nail polish, wipe it off of the knife or spatula, and continue to remove it until as much polish as possible has been removed.
Be careful when using a knife that you don't stab the leather. That is why it's important to use a dull-bladed knife, or better yet a spatula because you won't run the risk of putting a hole in your leather. Use these tools in a slight upward lifting motion.;
, Another technique to removing the nail polish stain while it is wet is to take a cotton swab or ball and gently blot the stain until all or most of it is removed. This will prevent you from smearing the stain.If you have a larger stain, use damp paper towels or a rag to dab the stain, but be careful not to smear the stain or to drip water onto your leather that will cause the stain to run.

, If you haven't discovered the nail polish stain until after it dries, you'll need to attempt to peel it off with your finger. Try using your fingernail to get under the edge of the stain so that you can peel it off.


If your stain is on a couch or car seat, push down on the surface of the leather on one side of the stain so that the opposite side of the stain is lifted up, making it easier to get underneath the stain. If your stain is on a leather garment, try folding the leather near the edge of the stain.
Peel the polish off slowly, watching the leather as you do so to make sure you don't damage it.

, Before you use any products on the leather, you will want to test each of them out to make sure the leather will not become damaged. Certain products like acetone may remove dye from the leather, so take extra caution when using these products.


Before you remove an entire stain with a product, test an inconspicuous area on the leather, then wait 24 hours to observe if the leather is damaged. If the leather seems fine, then proceed to treat the stain with the product.

, Rubbing alcohol can cause less damage to leather than acetone, but it may dry out your leather, so take caution when using it. After you have tested it on part of the leather, soak cotton swaps in rubbing alcohol and gently dab the stain. As the cotton swabs soak up the stain, change them out with fresh ones until the stain has been removed.Be careful not to oversaturate your stain with rubbing alcohol as this will more than likely damage your leather. You want to soak your swabs in alcohol, but you don't want them to be so wet that they drip the alcohol on the rest of the surface.

, If rubbing alcohol wasn't effective to remove all of the stain, it's time to move to a harsher product. Non-acetone remover shouldn't bleach your leather, but you will still want to test your product first because it may also dry out your leather. After you have checked your product on the leather, moisten a cotton swab with the nail polish remover, and carefully dab at the stain, making sure you don't touch the parts of the leather unaffected by the stain.Nail polish remover may take a few attempts, so in between each attempt to remove the stain, allow the leather to dry. Then, proceed to treat the stain until it is removed with a new cotton ball each time. The benefit of non-acetone nail polish remover is it won't bleach your leather, but it may not be powerful enough to remove the stain.
If non-acetone nail polish remover is not removing your stain, you can try acetone nail polish remover. This is a harsher product and will more than likely damage your leather, but the damage can be repaired rather easily.

, Using one part white vinegar and two parts olive oil, combine ingredients and then using a tooth brush or cleaning brush, gently scrub the stain with the mixture. This will pick apart the nail polish and it should begin to flake off. Then, clean the mixture off of the leather with a paper towel and let dry.This is the safest nail polish stain remover as it works like leather conditioner and won't dry out or stain your leather. However, it may be the least effective in removing your stain.

, After you have treated your stain, your leather may have some damage, but it is easy to remedy this damage. Begin by washing the area of the stain on the leather with a moisturizing bar of soap and water. This should remove any product left on your leather.After you have washed your leather, pat dry and let it air dry the rest of the way. You can then proceed to treat the leather.
If you used non-acetone products, your leather may not have suffered any damage due to bleaching, but many products can dry out leather, so it's important to condition leather afterwards to keep the leather from cracking, especially on furniture.

, You can purchase leather conditioner or create your own by mixing one part white vinegar with two parts linseed oil or lemon essential oil. Apply in a circular motion and let dry. It should dry in an hour or so depending on the size of the stain. This conditioner should restore the shine to your leather and remove the nail polish remover stain, but if not, proceed to the next step., If your leather was damaged by the products you used, you can repair the color of your leather by using a shoe polish. Find a shoe polish that is similar to the color of your leather, and work some of the polish into the stain. Then, let it dry and buff it out as you would a pair of leather shoes. Make sure you buff enough that it will not come off., If you have removed your nail polish stain and your leather is left damaged, you can dye your leather back to its original color if your stain is on a piece of furniture. You will want to find a match for your leather, so try contacting a leather furniture store. You can also purchase leather re-dye kits, but be cautious in doing this because you want to make sure you are dyeing your leather the right color.

, This is probably the safest step, as a professional will know best how to treat a stain and will be able to do so without creating unrepairable damage. If you are weary of removing stains on your own, then contact your local furniture store or a stain removing professional and have them treat the stain.

Lay the garment stain-down on an absorbent towel.,
Apply cleaning solution from the reverse side.,
Press down with a second absorbent towel.,
Repeat as needed, replacing towels as they become soggy.,
Finish by laundering.,
Use dish soap and water for an easy fix.,
Use a solvent like acetone.,
Use denatured alcohol.,
Use ammonia.,
Use a commercial stain remover.,
Consider a ""natural"" treatment.",How to Remove Lipstick from Clothes2," Once you notice a lipstick stain, remove the garment as early as possible. To begin treating it, lay it stained-side down on top of a paper towel or rag — something disposable or that you don't mind staining.


Make sure the material you lay it on is fairly absorbent and that the floor, table, or counter top underneath isn't vulnerable to stains — if you use a towel that's too thin or work on top of a white surface, you'll risk spreading the stain.;
, Next, grab liquid cleaning solution and apply it to the back of the fabric where the stain is. As it works its way into the fabric, it should displace the lipstick in to the towel underneath. On the other hand, scrubbing the stain from the front can actually be counter-productive and spread the lipstick across the fabric.


You have many possibilities in terms of cleaning solutions — depending on the precise nature of the stain and the fabric of your clothes, different cleaners may be appropriate at different occasions. The following cleaners are discussed in the subsection below — scroll down for more information:Dish soap and water
Acetone and other mineral solvents
Denatured (rubbing) alcohol
Ammonia
Certain commercial stain removal products
Home-made solutions like lemon juice, vinegar, etc.

, Next, grab a second towel (this one doesn't have to be quite so absorbent) and press down gently on the reverse side of the stain. This should force your cleaning solution (which has now picked up some of the lipstick) into the lower towel, where it will be soaked up.


As you do this, take care not let your garment or the towel on the bottom move around, as this can spread the stain.

, Continue soaking the stain with cleaning solution and applying pressure from the reverse side of the fabric until you notice the lipstick stain begin to noticeably lighten. As you go, replace the bottom towel with a fresh towel as soon as it starts to become saturated with liquid — if you don't, the cleaning liquid can soak through to the surface underneath or discolor other parts of your garment.

, After several cycles of the cleaning method above, you should notice visible improvement in the lipstick stain. At this point, it's a good idea to run the garment through the wash to remove excess cleaner and ""finish off"" any stain remnants.


For maximum cleaning power, consider using our instructions below for pre-treating a stained garment prior to doing a load of laundry.

, Compared to other cleaning solutions, a gentle solution of dish soap and water offers a safe ""middle ground."" It's useful for moving a variety of stains and it's not likely to damage many fabrics, making it a versatile tool. Best of all, it's cheap and readily-available at any local grocery store.

, Organic solvents (like acetone) can be a big asset when it comes to removing stains from waxier lipsticks, as they are able to break down many of the plastic compounds that can give certain lipsticks this quality (for a demonstration of this, put a chunk of styrofoam in acetone — it should dissolve immediately.) Acetone is safe for all natural fibers and most synthetics, though it can cause colors to bleed.


Note that acetone is most widely available as nail polish remover. If you want to use commercial nail polish remover as a stain remover, be sure to use the closest variety to pure acetone available that doesn't include added dyes.

, Denatured (""rubbing"") alcohol is another great cleaning solution that's cheap and safe for most fabrics. Alcohol is especially useful for microfiber fabrics because, unlike other liquids, it won't penetrate the fibers and cause a permanent stain.Note, however, that like acetone, alcohol can cause colors to bleed.


Though it's cheap, rubbing alcohol isn't always available in the ""cleaning"" aisle of grocery stores. You may need to visit a hardware store or pharmacy to find it.

, Ammonia is as famous for its cleaning power as it is for its pungent, somewhat unpleasant smell, so it can be a great choice if you're prepared to work in a well-ventilated area. However, ammonia can harm some fabrics, especially those used in carpeting and upholstery — though these are unlikely to be the same sorts of fabrics used in your clothing, it's a smart idea to ""spot test"" your garment before using ammonia. In other words, apply ammonia to a small part of the garment that can't usually be seen and let it sit for about 20 minutes, then check to see if the fabric is damaged or discolored.


In addition, it's worth noting that ammonia can damage no-wax tiles and floors, so avoid working on these surfaces.When you use ammonia, it's very important to remember that it reacts with bleach to form toxic gas.Never use ammonia to clean a garment when you intend to launder it with bleach after.

, Head to the cleaning aisle of any major grocery store and you should see a wide range of cleaning products for sale. These may contain any of the ingredients above (or completely different ingredients), so the usefulness and safety of each will vary from product to product. Be sure to check the product's label or packaging for safety warnings before using it on your garment.

, It's also possible to use natural ingredients that you may already have in your kitchen or pantry to remove a wide variety of stains, including those from lipstick. As a general rule, these natural solutions are mild and safe on nearly all fabrics. Below are just a few common suggestions:White vinegar (not balsamic or apple cider)
Lemon juice
Baking soda and water
Eucalyptus oil
Citrus peels

Wipe off wet polish immediately.,
Dab the area with acetone.,
Use a clean cloth to blot the polish.,
Rinse the area with warm water.",How to Get Nail Polish out of Fabric2," If you can catch wet nail polish before it dries on upholstery, you'll have a much easier time removing it. Use a paper towel or cloth to wipe off as much of the wet polish as you can.









Don't smear the polish so it covers, even more, surface area on the upholstery; rather, use the paper towel to wipe it off with short swipes that don't spread the polish around.
Use the most absorbent cloth or paper towels you can, so you're leaving as little polish as possible to soak into the upholstery.

, Use a cotton swap or another tool that allows the precise application to put a few drops of acetone on the stained area. Be sure to apply it only on the stained area.









You may want to do a test dab on a part of the upholstery that's usually hidden. Acetone reacts with some types of fabric, including those containing acetate or triacetate, and could make the stained area look worse if you aren't careful.
Do not pour the acetone onto the stained fabric since it's harder to control where it flows if you don't use an applicator like a cotton swab or the corner of a paper towel.

, Blot it over the stained area carefully, and then use a clean section of the towel to blot it again. Apply more acetone and continue blotting until the stain has been removed.








, Use a sponge to wash the area to remove traces of acetone or hydrogen peroxide. Let the upholstery dry completely before using.

",How to Get Nail Polish out of Fabric3," Some fabrics that don't react well with acetone may perform better if you use the same strategy with hydrogen peroxide.









Dab the area with peroxide, blot it with a clean towel and repeat until the stain is gone.
Hydrogen peroxide can act as a bleaching agent, so test it on an unnoticeable area of the upholstery before using it on the stained area.

, Spray it on the bristles of an old toothbrush, and then use a circular motion to remove the stain from the fabric.








, Some say that bug repellent, the type you spray on your body and clothes to keep mosquitoes and other bugs away, works like a charm to remove nail polish stains. Spray it on an old toothbrush, then apply the brush in a circular motion to gently scrub away the stain.

, Next, apply a small dot of your preferred laundry detergent directly to your stain. If you're working with powder detergent, mix a small amount with water to form a loose paste. Use a soft-bristled brush (like an old toothbrush) to scrub the stain and work the detergent into it.


For added results, you may also want to work the detergent into the fabric from the reverse side. This is a useful tactic because it helps works the lipstick away from the fabric, rather than into it.
Be sure to use a detergent that's safe for your fabric — check the garment's care label if you have any doubts.

, Next, give the detergent a chance to soak into the fabric and start to dislodge the stain. This shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes. While you wait, you can prepare the rest of your laundry load.

, Add your pre-treated garment with a load of other clothes to the washer. As a general rule, hot water and high-intensity wash settings are a little better at cleaning than cold water and gentle washes, so set your washer to the highest settings allowed on your garment's care label.

Put the suede in the freezer.,
Ice the gum.,
Wait for the gum to freeze.,
Pry off the gum.,
Hit the gum.,
Pick at the gum.",How to Remove Chewing Gum from Suede1," If your suede item is a piece of clothing such as a shoe or a jacket, put it in the freezer. Make sure you clear out enough space for it and that it is not near anything that would stain it any further.You may consider putting your item in a plastic bag or a garment bag to prevent staining., If your suede item is too large to fit in the freezer, you can apply ice to the gum. Take a couple of ice cubes from the freezer. Wrap them in a plastic bag or other material to prevent a mess when they melt. You can also use a frozen bag of peas or any similar frozen item in your freezer. Press the ice against the gum. If the gum is stuck on a garment like a jacket, apply ice to both sides to quicken freezing.If the bag of ice develops condensation or wetness, make sure to wipe it off with a towel. Getting suede wet damages the material. , Freezing will help the gum to harden. When gum is at room temperature, it is much stickier and is hard to remove once it gets stuck to a surface. Freezing the gum will make it to be less stretchy and sticky and easier to remove. If you are leaving the suede item in the freezer, give it at least one hour. If you are using the ice cube method, hold the ice cubes to the gum until it is hard, about 20 minutes. Depending on the temperature of your freezer, the freezing process may take less than an hour. If you don't have time to wait that long, check on the garment periodically to see if the gum is hard.
If you are using the ice cube method, you don't have to hold the ice there the whole time. Your hands will get really cold! Instead, rest the bag of ice over the gum and check periodically for condensation and to see if it is hard enough.

, Once the gum is frozen and hard, remove from freezer or take it off the ice. Take a spatula or butter knife. Position the knife or spatula where the edge of the gum and the suede surface meet. Try to get it between the gum and the suede. Then, pry the gum away by using the knife or spatula to peel it away from the surface Do not use a sharp object to pry off the gum. A sharp object could damage or scratch the suede. Always angle the knife or spatula away from you. Even a blunt instrument can hurt you if you accidentally hit yourself with it.

, If you try to pry the gum away but can't get any leverage, you can try a more aggressive measure. Chewing gum becomes brittle when frozen and is easier to break apart or dislodge. Hitting it may shatter the gum so it comes off in a lot of little pieces. Spread the suede object on a flat surface. Take a spoon or other broad blunt object and raise it a foot or so above the suede.
Give the gum a solid whack. Using a lot of force isn't necessary. Do the same kind of whacking motion you would use to kill a fly with a flyswatter. Doing this will hopefully break apart or shatter the gum.

, If you aren't having any luck with spatula or spoon, you can just use your fingers to pick at the gum. By using your fingers, you can control how much force you use. You can also use your fingernails to scrape away the gum. Do not scrape too forcefully against the suede. This can harm the material.
If you are worried about germs, you may want to wear disposable gloves to touch gum directly. Make sure the gloves are thin so you can still use your nails effectively.

Use even, soft strokes, focusing on the areas with the most gum.
You can also use a normal pencil eraser or a Pink Pearl eraser if you do not have an Artgum eraser.

The fabric may need to soak for several hours if the stain has been set in for a long period of time.Pre-treating a stained fabric as soon as possible is one of the most critical steps in stain removal.The sooner the stain can be treated with a pre-treatment, the more likely your chances are of removing the stain.
Do not use on silk or wool, since enzymes digest protein.
An alternative stain remover is Borax. If you use Borax, cover the stain completely, let it sit for 30 minutes, and continue to wash the fabric.

, Launder the fabric in the hottest water setting. Use chlorine bleach to wash the fabric if the fabric material allows.

Rinse with cold running water.,
Apply detergent or stain remover over the stain.,
Add bleach to your washing machine or tub.,
Wash white cotton in hot water, and delicate clothing in warm or cold.,
Examine the stain before continuing.",How to Remove a Mustard Stain1," Immediately press a clean, dry towel over the stain, flipping it over or moving to a new area when the current section has absorbed some of the stain. Use an absorbent towel such as terry cloth, or simply a paper towel.;
, Use a butter knife or other utensil to remove the excess mustard. Only scrape dried stains, not wet, to prevent the mustard from spreading. Shake the clothing afterward to remove flecks of dry mustard, which could cause additional stains when washed.

, Flush cold running water over the stain to remove as much as possible. Try to rinse from the back of the fabric, on the opposite side from the stain. This helps excess mustard fall away from the clothing instead of pushing through the fabric., Use a commercial stain remover if you have one, as long as it does not contain ammonia. Liquid laundry detergent is a fine alternative, as is simply rubbing the stain with bar soap. Use caution while rubbing to avoid spreading the stain further.


Ammonia reacts with turmeric, the ingredient in mustard that makes it yellow, and may make the color set further.Check the ingredients of commercial cleaning products first to help you avoid using ammonia-based products.
If you are not sure whether your clothing item can be washed, rub the detergent in an inconspicuous corner first, then rinse out. If the color or texture of the fabric is affected, you may wish to use a different method.

, If the clothing is white, use chlorine bleach, which should be quite effective in removing the stain.If the clothing is any other color, use color-safe bleach to avoid fading your clothing or covering it with white spots; this is a less powerful stain remover but may still succeed.


Bleach is typically added to a separate washing machine dispenser than your laundry detergent, which should also be added as usual. If your top-loaded machine has no dispenser, or if you are washing the clothes by hand, pour directly into machine or tub. Use 1 part bleach to 30 parts water, or about 1/2 cup (120 mL) for a typical laundry load., The hotter the water, the more effective it will be at removing stains. However, hot water may damage delicate fabrics, or cause light-colored clothing to fade and stain other items in the wash machine. Check the clothing tag to find the maximum temperature the clothing can be washed at. When in doubt, wash delicate items in cold water.


Wash as soon as you can after applying the detergent or stain remover. Letting the stain remover sit on the stain for too long may make the stain harder to remove., Do not place your item in a dryer or on a drying rack until you are sure the stain is gone. Drying the clothing may make the stain set further. If the stain is still present, continue on to the section on persistent stains before the clothing dries. If the stain is no longer visible, you may dry your clothing as normal.

Bleach the stain with hydrogen peroxide.",How to Remove a Mustard Stain3," These methods are more powerful than the basic methods described above, but they may harm the fabric or carpet as well as remove the stain. If you are concerned with possible effects these substances may have on the color or texture of your material, apply them to an unobtrusive corner of the object first. Wait 10 minutes, then blot with a towel and see if the material has been affected.

, Mix three parts liquid dish soap together with one part rubbing alcohol and let sit on the material for 10 minutes before rinsing in hot water or blotting with a wet towel.Run clothing through the laundry under normal settings. Alcohol is a powerful solvent, meaning that the oils in the mustard stain may dissolve in this alcohol-based cleaning solution.


Liquid glycerin or ""glycerol"" has similar properties to this mixture and can be used in its place.

Note: If using this method on an article of clothing, place the clothing over a towel or other absorbent material first. The alcohol mixture will likely soak right through the clothing.

, While this is not always successful, sometimes you can make a dry stain easier to remove by making it wet again with the original source of the stain. After applying the mustard, wait 5 minutes, blot thoroughly with a towel, and treat as described in the clothing or furniture sections.


Only use the same type and brand of mustard as the one that caused the stain: the oils and turmeric that caused the stain was made to dissolve in that particular mix of ingredients.Note: Take care to apply mustard only over the original stain, and not to rub it onto a larger area when blotting it out. Do not test the ""fresh mustard"" method on an unstained portion of the material.

, Mix one part white vinegar with two parts water and apply with a spray bottle or sponge.Let sit 10 minutes, then blot with a wet towel. Run clothing through the laundry. Vinegar is a less powerful stain remover than alcohol or detergent, but because it has different chemical properties, it will sometimes work on stains that the previous substances fail to remove.

, Hydrogen peroxide may cause fading or discoloration, but it is sometimes used to treat carpet stains. Apply 3% hydrogen peroxide to the stain and let stand one hour. Blot with a dry towel and repeat if necessary. Exposure to light will cause the hydrogen peroxide to deteriorate into water, so no rinsing is necessary."

Keep the bag and clothing in the freezer for several hours.,
Scrape the gum off of the clothes.,
Wash your clothes.",How to Get Chewing Gum off Clothes1," You will want to fold it so that the contaminated part is facing out, not touching any other part of the fabric. Try to peel off as much of the gum as you can with your fingers. You want to be careful not to smear the gum further into the fabric, and also careful that you do not accidentally stick it to other parts of the fabric.You could consider wearing rubber gloves during this process so that you do not have to deal with the stickiness of the gum. However, do not delay putting the garment in the freezer simply because you are looking for rubber gloves.;
, It should be a bag that you can seal. When you put your article of clothing into the bag, make sure that the gum does not touch the bag and then smear (thus contaminating the rest of the garment).


The plastic bag can be any size that you want--it doesn’t have to fit into a particular bag, it just has to be one that can fit into your freezer.

, Once the bag is sealed, but it in the freezer. While this may seem like an odd thing to do, freezing the gum will actually make it hard and it in turn will lose some of its stickiness. Freezing the gum will make it easier to get off.If you do not have access to a freezer, but happen to have some ice cubes on hand, you can rub an ice cube on the gum until it hardens from the cold. After it hardens, follow the next steps.

, The harder the gum gets, the easier it will be to remove it from your clothes. Take the bag out of the freezer once the gum is hard.

, You should do this as soon as you take the garment out of the freezer. Remove the garment out of the plastic bag and put it down onto a hard surface. Use a blunt but pointed object to peel or scrape the gum off of your clothes. You could use a paint remover, simple butter knife, or even your fingernails if yours are long and sharp enough.


It is important to remove the gum immediately after you take the clothing out of the freezer because if it is allowed to warm up, it could get sticky again which would make it a lot harder to remove.

, If there is any gum residue left on your garment, and to make sure that the gum has not stained the fabric, you should put your article of clothing in the washer machine.

Buy regular unscented Vaseline.,
Place Vaseline on the affected area.,
Wait for the gum to come off.",How to Get Gum off Skin1," You can buy Vaseline at your local pharmacy. If necessary you can choose a different off brand version of Vaseline if you’re looking to save a little money. Any type of petroleum jelly or Vaseline type substance has the same jelly that adheres to the gum and causes it to loose its stickiness. It becomes smooth and hard and will fall off your skin much more easily.


You can buy the smallest size possible if you don’t use it very often, because you won’t need very much to get the gum off your skin.;
, Rub Vaseline around where the gum is attached to your skin and on the gum itself. You probably only need a nickel sized amount of Vaseline. Feel free to use more if you think it will help, but there is no need to overdo it.

, When you put Vaseline on the gum it will naturally ball up and come off. However, you might need to wait a minute or so for this process to completely take effect.


Don’t try to pull it off immediately after you put the Vaseline on – let the Vaseline soak into the gum and your skin first.

Pour the solution over the stain until it fully covers it, but don’t oversaturate the stain as it will be more difficult to clean off. , Bleach is an effective tool to get rid of color leftover from a banana sap stain, however you need to check for colorfastness first. This term refers to the ability for fabric to retain its color with regular washing and care. Before using bleach, it’s important to take the time to test for colorfastness, and make sure the bleach won’t ruin the fabric. Check the fabric’s product information to see if it mentions colorfastness or specifies that it can’t be washed with other colors. If it needs to be washed separately, then bleach shouldn’t be used as the fabric does not retain its color easily. Add one tablespoon of bleach with ¼ cup of water. Mix well.
Using a cotton swab, dab this mixture onto an inside seam of the fabric. Let the solution rest for one minute.
Use a paper towel to dry the area, and look to see if any color was removed. If the color remains the same, then bleach can be safely used on the fabric.

, After testing for colorfastness, create a diluted 1:6 bleach solution where you use one part bleach and six parts water. Pour enough bleach solution to cover the stain, but be very careful not to add too much. Let it sit for a couple minutes.

, Using warm water, wash the stained area until the glycerin and bleach are removed. Use a clean, dry rag to remove any excess material. Put the fabric on a hanger at let it air dry until completely dry. Check to make sure the stain is removed. If not repeat the process over again until the stain has disappeared.

, This method works well for lighter banana sap stains. Check for colorfastness before using rubbing alcohol or any harsh chemicals. Pour a little bit of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton swab until it is completely saturated. Dab the stained area with the swab, ensuring every section of the stain is covered with the rubbing alcohol. , Put the stained fabric into the clothing immediately after applying the rubbing alcohol. Feel free to use your normal detergent. Don’t mix any other clothing into the wash as the rubbing alcohol could spread to other pieces of clothing. Make sure you use an amount of detergent that’s appropriate to your piece of clothing so it doesn’t retain a detergent smell. Wash it with cold water as warm water can sometimes set stains in the clothing. , Put the piece of clothing in your dryer and put it on a full, complete cycle. Put a dryer sheet with your clothing to ensure it dries while retaining freshness.

Rub dishwashing soap into the stain.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Pretreat the stain with prewash stain remover.,
Wash the stained garment in the washing machine.,
Check the stain before drying.",How to Get Butter out of Clothing1," Because dishwashing soaps are designed to deal with the fatty, greasy food products that build up on pots, pans, and plates, they’re also a good way to deal with butter when it gets on clothing.Dampen the stained area with lukewarm water.
Apply a small amount of dishwashing soap to the stain.
Rub at the stain gently with your fingers, making sure to spread the soap throughout the stained fabric.;
, Using a sink or bathtub faucet, run warm-to-hot water over the stained area until the soap had been rinsed from the fabric. Make sure you’re not just catching the soap somewhere else in the fabric of the garment; hold the fabric taut so you can see that the suds have run off and down the drain.

, If you’re dealing with something as stubborn as a butter stain, treat it with a concentrated stain fighter before running it, finally, through the washing machine. You can purchase prewash stain removers in the laundry aisle at the grocery store, or you can make your own at home.


If you wish to make your own prewash stain remover, mix the following ingredients together: 1 1/2 cups of water
1/4 cup of liquid castile soap (if you cannot find this in a store, it can be easily purchased online)
1/4 cup of vegetable glycerine (again, available for purchase online)
5-10 drops of lemon essential oil
Once the ingredients have been mixed, apply the product to the stain, rubbing it into the fabric gently with your fingers.
Let the fabric soak for at least an hour (see specific brand instructions if you purchased a product in-store) before putting the garment through the washing machine.

, The hotter the water, the higher the likelihood of the butter stain coming out, so use the hottest temperature allowable for the fabric of the stained piece of clothing. However, check the garment tag carefully to make sure that the fabric won’t be damaged by high temperatures. If so, use a lower temperature setting.

, If the stain hasn’t been removed yet, you don’t want to run it through the dryer; the heat will cause the stain to set more permanently in the fabric.If the stain has not yet been removed, repeat the process of applying dish soap, rinsing, pretreating the stain, and washing one more time before putting the garment through the dryer. After a second round of treatment, the stain should be removed.

Place a piece of cardboard on your ironing board.,
Heat the iron to a medium heat without steam.,
Run the iron over the part of the fabric with the gum on it.,
Continue to iron the garment until the gum loosens.",How to Get Chewing Gum off Clothes2," The cardboard will ensure that the gum stuck to your garment will not melt off and then get stuck on your ironing board. Place the piece of clothing down on the cardboard so that the spot with the gum stuck to it is in the middle of the piece of cardboard.


You can also use a piece of brown paper.

, Turn the dial on your iron so that it is at a medium heat. Medium heat is best because anything hotter would melt the gum. Instead, what you are going to do is try to heat the gum up so that it loosens from the fabric, rather than melting everywhere and making a mess.

, The fabric with the gum should be face-down on the cardboard so that you are ironing the backside of the garment and the fabric is making a barrier between the gum and the iron., Eventually, the gum should melt enough that it sticks to the cardboard rather than to the fabric. Pull the garment away from the cardboard. If the gum hasn’t stuck completely to the cardboard, continue to iron the spot until it does.

"
"
Use a hot liquid to remove the gum.,
Let the heated liquid work its magic.,
Scrub the gum off with a toothbrush or knife.,
Wash the clothes in a regular washing machine.",How to Get Chewing Gum off Clothes3," There are three different ways that you can do this, though all three method seem to have the same results. You can either use hot water, hot steam, or hot white vinegar.



Hot water: Boil water in a large pot. If your affected garment is a pair of pants or another large article of clothing, you may want to use a bathtub rather than a pot.

Hot steam: Put a tea kettle on high heat so that it gets very hot. The tea kettle will produce steam that is perfect for steam blasting your garment.

Hot vinegar: Heat some white vinegar. Dip a washcloth (or some other absorbent cloth) into the vinegar so that the cloth has absorbed quite a bit of the vinegar.

, Regardless of the method you chose to use, you will need to let the hot liquid do its thing. Keep in mind that you may need to do this whole process several times.



Hot water: Submerge the piece of clothing so that it is fully covered by the water. Keep the garment submerged for several minutes. During this time, the gum will be getting loosened by the heat of the water.

Hot steam: Hold the fabric with the gum on it directly in front of the mouth of the kettle (or where the most steam is being released from the kettle). The gum should absorb the steam, thus softening.

Hot vinegar: Apply the vinegar-soaked cloth directly to the area of the fabric with the gum on it. The vinegar should loosen the bond between the fibers of the clothing and the gum. The gum will become soft and pliable., Once the gum has heated up, you will need to scrape it off. Regardless of the method you used, once the gum is thoroughly soaked and heated up, take a toothbrush (that you don’t care about) or a blunt knife and gently scrape the gum off of the clothing. If the gum doesn’t come off despite your best efforts, soak it again using your method of choice.

, Once you have removed most, if not all, of the gum, place the garment in the washing machine and run it on a regular cycle to get any gum residue off of your clothing.

Find an old towel and some creamy peanut butter.,
Use a knife to wipe peanut butter on the towel.,
Rub the peanut butter into the gum until the gum starts to come off.,
Clean up.",How to Get Gum off Skin2," Creamy peanut butter will work better than chunky peanut butter because you’ll minimize the mess that you might cause. You also need to find a creamy peanut butter that has a high oil content. Look for peanut butter that has a very high fat content too.


The oil in the peanut butter is what helps to dissolve the gum and remove it from your skin or hair.
You can find peanut butter at most grocery stores. Make sure the towel isn’t one you plan to use again. It might get pretty dirty.
Avoid using a white towel. It may stain.

, You don’t need to cover the entire towel. A four-inch by four inch box on the towel will probably be enough to remove the gum. Put a generous amount of peanut butter on this four square inch box.

, Scrub it with the other side of the towel, and the gum should come right off. Use a comb to remove the gum if necessary.

, You might be a little messy after using the peanut butter to remove the gum. Wash your skin with some cold water to remove any excess peanut butter. "
"
Pour a little vegetable oil on the gum.,
Rub the oil on the gum with your hand.,
Run a brush or comb across the gum.",How to Get Gum off Skin3," Find a regular cooking oil like canola oil or olive oil and pour a small quarter sized dab of it on the part of your skin with the gum stuck to it. It might be easier to pour a little in a spoon and then pour the spoon onto the affected area of your skin to avoid a mess.


Gum is a hydrophobic material, which means it will not dissolve in water. However, using other hydrophobic materials can help reduce the stickiness and cause the gum to dissolve. Oils and fats are hydrophobic, so they are the perfect option. , The oil will release the gum and it will naturally come off without pain. Be sure to give the oil a few minutes to soak into the gum and your skin. As you rub the gum it will start to dissolve. Be patient and you won’t have to rip the gum off with your bare hands.


The reason peanut butter is so effective at removing gum is because it has peanut oil in it. Other oils, like canola or vegetable oil, are equally effective.

, Once you have started to dissolve the gum using the oil you can remove the rest of it by running a brush or comb along your skin. This works particularly well if the gum is stuck in areas where you have a lot of hair. If you feel pain, stop and apply more oil to the area. "

Treat the stain while it’s still fresh.,
Lay the garment out on a flat surface.,
Sprinkle the product onto the stain.Talcum powder and cornstarch are both incredibly absorbent.When you cover the fresh butter stain with a generous layer of either product, the powder will draw the butter out of the garment.,
Let the powder sit for at least 30 minutes.,
Scrub the stain with an old toothbrush.",How to Get Butter out of Clothing2," This method will work best if you get to the stain while it’s still wet, before it’s had a chance to really set into the fabric.

, Choose a location out of the way, where it won’t get jostled or knocked to the ground. You don’t want to make a bigger mess than you already have by getting powder all over the place!

,


Pat the powder gently down into the stain, but don’t rub it into the fabric.

, The longer you let it sit on the stain, the better your chances of the butter being completely removed. At minimum, let it sit for half an hour before moving on to the next step.

, Use the toothbrush to loosen the talcum powder or cornstarch from the surface of the stain. Brush it away with your fingers and assess how much stain has been left behind.


If the stain has not been completely removed, repeat the process until it has.

Know that you’re taking a risk.,
Apply the product to the stain.,
Scrub the stain with an old toothbrush.Don’t rub hard enough to damage the cloth, but really try to work the product into the fabric and stain.

,
Wait for at least one hour.,
Wash the garment as usual in the laundry.",How to Get Butter out of Clothing3," Although some people have found success using WD-40, hairspray, and lighter fluid on especially tough grease stains, you run a high risk of damaging your clothing — for example, lighter fluid can damage the color of dyed clothing.These products can also leave behind a terrible smell that is more difficult to mask than the original stain.


Test the product on a small, easily hidden patch of fabric on the garment before applying it to the stain.
Let it sit for half an hour, then check whether or not the cloth has been damaged in any way.
If not, proceed to the next step.

, WD-40 and hairspray come in spray bottles, so be sure to apply the product from a close range, keeping the spray area constrained to the stain. Lighter fluid tends to squirt out in big gushes, so apply it to a paper towel or dishcloth first, then rub the towel onto the stain. This will ensure you don’t drench your garment in lighter fluid and can control the area you wish to treat.

,, Give the product enough time to loosen the butter stain. Set the garment aside somewhere and forget about it for an hour.

, Again, use the hottest possible water setting allowable for the fabric you’re dealing with. The hotter the water, the better the chances of stain removal.


Check the garment to make sure the stain has been removed before running it through the dryer, as the heat will set the stain even further.

Place a gob of peanut butter on the gum.,
Leave the peanut butter on the gum and fabric for roughly 60 seconds.,
Use a butter knife to scrape the gum off of the fabric.,
Put a stain remover on the affected area of fabric.",How to Get Chewing Gum off Clothes4," You will want to make sure that the gum is entirely coated on all visible sides. Add a bit of extra peanut butter so that it forms a thick coating around the gum. Peanut butter is a good product to use because the natural oil in the peanut butter works well to loosen the gum up., You want to only leave it on for a very short period of time or else the peanut butter may stain your clothing. Leave it on for 60 seconds.

, If you don’t have a butter knife on hand, you can use any object that has a thin, sharp edge (a paint scraper, fingernail, or metal nail file should do the trick). Scrape until all of the gum and peanut butter are removed, but be careful not to scrape so hard that you damage the fabric.

, Do this as soon as you have scraped away the rest of the peanut butter and gum. Though the oils in peanut butter are what make it great for removing gum, those same oils can also stain your clothes. Luckily a stain treatment will solve that problem. Add some to the spot and then put it in the washing machine on the cycle you would normally wash it on."

Keep a box of plain white chalk in your laundry cabinet at all times.,
Consider keeping a piece of chalk in a plastic bag with you if you're an especially messy person.,
Rub the stain with the white chalk the minute grease strikes.,
Launder the material as soon as possible.,
Wash. Set the washing machine to a warm to hot temperature (if possible) to fully remove the stain.",How to Remove Grease Stains With Plain White Chalk," The best way to attack a grease stain is to get to it the minute it occurs––that way the grease doesn't have time to set.


Make sure the chalk is the old fashioned kind––the type used for writing on a blackboard. Some of the newer models contain wax, or other ingredients, that allow you to color on a variety of surfaces. Use old fashioned white chalk for best and safest results.





;
, Tend to get grease stains on your clothing at lunch? A small piece of chalk might help when your greasy lunch ends up on your suit.

, If you're being proactive and have the chalk on hand, you'll be more likely to remove the stain, leaving no evidence behind.


Blot the stain with a paper towel or napkin to remove any excess grease before applying the chalk. If you spill grease down the front of your shirt, you’ll need to first wipe up the food before tending to the grease stain. Use a clean white napkin or towel to remove the excess food, then blot the stain carefully to remove excess grease.






Cover the entire stain with chalk and even some of the surrounding areas to be on the safe side. Allow the chalk to do its magic. The powder will start absorbing and removing the stain on contact.







, If you're near the washing machine, give the chalk a few minutes to do its business, then toss the stained clothing in the washing machine.


Remove any excess chalk remaining on the item, then rub stain with a little laundry detergent. The chalk makes the stain easier to remove when you apply laundry detergent. Simply putting chalk on the stain won’t completely remove it––you have to wash the item for the best results.







, Add more laundry soap to your wash and then wash the stained clothing. You may need to repeat this step if the stain does not come out completely.

Remove excess oil immediately with a rag or paper towel.,
If working with clothes, use a cardboard insert.,
Apply talc or baking soda to the stain.,
Work grease-cutting dish soap into the stain.,
Pre-treat the stain with detergent.,
Place your clothing or fabric in the laundry.,
Repeat as needed.,
Try alternative stain-removing solutions.",How to Remove Oil Stains1," When it comes to oil stains, the more oil you can get out of the fabric before it sets, the better. As soon as you notice a stain on your clothing, try to blot out as much of the oil as you can with a rag or paper towel. This won't prevent a stain by itself, but it will make the stain as minor as possible as well as helping to make the stain easier to remove.


If the stain is caused by a thicker oil, such as butter, mayonnaise or car grease, try scraping up the excess oil with a butter knife, rubbing it on a paper towel, and discarding it.
Be sure to use a blotting motion to remove the oil. Don't try to rub the stain out — this can spread the oil, rather than removing it.;
, The method in this section should work for oil stains in most fabrics, including those used in clothing. If your oil stain is in a piece of clothing, be sure to insert a thin piece of cardboard, plastic, or another non-permeable material into the clothing under the stain before you start to treat it. This keeps the oil from soaking through to the layer underneath and also prevents any cleaning materials you use from doing the same.


For other types of fabric, like sheets and upholstery, you may not need to (or simply may not be able to) use an insert to protect any layers of fabric under the first.

, To soak up extra oil that's already worked its way into the fabric, try using a neutral absorbent powder like baking soda, talc, baby powder, etc. Gently work the powder into the fabric with an old toothbrush to soak up excess oil. You should notice solid clumps of powder begin to form — this means that your powder is beginning to absorb the oil. Dust the clumps off as they form and continue scrubbing. Add more powder as needed.


You'll want to gently brush until you notice the solid clumps of powder becoming infrequent (this usually takes about five minutes or less). When you're finished, wash the powder out by rinsing lightly with water and scrubbing gently with the same toothbrush you used to work it in.

, Next, grab a bottle of liquid dish soap (note: not dishwasher soap) and squeeze a small drop onto your stain. Wet your toothbrush with water, then gently scrub the soap into the fabric. Scrub for about two to five minutes to allow the soap to dissolve the oil in the fabric.


If you're working with a piece of fabric that can't go in the washing machine, like, for instance, a delicate wool scarf or a section of upholstery on your couch, you may now want to wet your toothbrush and work the water into the fabric as a makeshift ""rinse"". Allow to dry, then repeat the steps above as needed (or see below for alternatives).

, If you're dealing with an oil stain in clothing or another piece of fabric that can go in your washing machine, you'll want to finish your stain-removal cycle by tossing your item in the wash. Before doing this, apply a small amount of your laundry detergent directly onto the stain and gently scrub it in with your toothbrush.


Applying detergent directly to a stain before washing is an old stain-removal trick that useful for nearly all types of stains. The extra detergent ensures that the affected area receives an especially deep cleaning during the wash cycle.

, Add your pre-treated clothing or fabric to the washing machine with a load of similar items. Follow all directions on your clothing or fabric's care label when picking your wash settings. For the greatest cleaning power, use the largest amount of detergent and the hottest temperature of water allowed. When your load is finished, machine or air dry it as your normally would.


If you used an insert, don't forget to remove it before adding your item to the wash.

, When your garment or fabric is completely dry, check the area of the stain for any remaining oil or discoloration. At this point, most minor stains should be completely removed. However, heavy stains, dried-on stains, and stains from especially thick oils may require several cycles to completely remove.


If you're dealing with a white piece of fabric, you can try treating your stain with bleach to remove any lingering discoloration on your subsequent cycles as long as you make sure to wash your item in a load of whites.

, For most clothing and fabrics, the method above, which uses only common household materials, should work well for removing the majority of oil stains. However, it's far from the only method used for this task. Many different methods which use less-common materials also exist — if you're having trouble removing a particularly stubborn stain, you may want to try using one of the solutions below in your stain-removal routine.


Acetone: This chemical, often used as a nail polish remover, is sold in most health and beauty stores. Be sure to use only pure acetone — not an acetone-based product with fragrances or dyes. Drizzle acetone directly onto your stain and dab with a towel to spread it. Repeat as needed, then soak up the acetone and launder as normal. Note that acetone should not be used with modacrylic, acetate, triacetate, or natural hair fibers like silk and wool, as it can damage these fibers.Rubbing alcohol: Isopropyl alcohol, also known as rubbing alcohol, is a natural de-greasing agent sold in most department stores. Try treating your stain by dabbing it with a cloth soaked in alcohol before laundering.
Spray lubricants: Believe it or not, some spray-on lubricants like WD-40 can be used to help remove oil stains. Try spraying the affected area with lubricant, then allowing it to sit for about half an hour while the lubricant soaks in. Finally, pre-treat your fabric with detergent and wash as described above."

, You want the gum to freeze. Depending on the size of the gum and the garment, it should take about two or three hours.









If you put the fabric on top of the bag rather than in it, make sure there's enough room in the freezer so that the clothing isn't touching anything in there except the plastic bag it's sitting on. Try to limit cross-contamination.

, Open the bag and take out the contents.








, Use an old, dull knife or a butter knife (to avoid cutting the fabric). Do not allow the gum to thaw out, as the freezing solidifies it and makes it easier to scrape off.









If the gum does thaw out before you get it all off, freeze the garment again or use an ice cube (see Tips below).

Take a piece of ice and slowly rub all over the gum. The coldness of the ice will harden the gum, making it easier to chip away later.If the leather item is small enough, place it in a plastic bag and then put it in the freezer for about an hour. Putting the item in the freezer will have a similar effect as the ice--the gum will harden and become easier to chip away from the leather.
If you don’t have a plastic bag, you can rub the ice directly on the gum. Make sure that if the ice drips onto the leather, you wipe it up immediately, as water left on leather for too long can stain it.;
, Use a hard, flat edge to remove the gum from the leather. In a pinch, a fingernail will do the trick, as will a credit card, butter knife or even a metal spoon. Avoid very sharp items or else you may gouge the leather. The hardened gum should scrape off easily.


If you chose to put your piece of leather in a bag and into the freezer, remove it and chip it away with a hard, flat-edged tool as listed above. After you have done this, proceed with all of the other steps listed in this method.

, Use a damp, clean cloth to rub some saddle soap onto the spot where the gum was until you have a light lather on the leather., Clean any remaining spot where the gum was stuck to the leather with the saddle soap lather, using circular motions to rub it into the spot.

, Scrub any small bits of gum remaining with a soft, dampened toothbrush. The toothbrush bristles will work to dislodge the lathered gum. The gum should be completely removed when you are done with the toothbrush.

, Wipe off the saddle soap with a second, damp clean cloth. You don’t want to wash the lather away with water because water, if left on the leather for too long, will damage the color of the leather.

, The leather conditioner will help to ensure that there is no discoloration caused by the gum, soap lather, and damp cloth.

If possible, soak up excess oil immediately.,
Treat with baking soda and vacuum.,
Pour rubbing alcohol on the stain.,
Treat the carpet with a soap/vinegar solution.,
Treat with carpet cleaner.,
Rinse with cool water.,
Finish by vacuuming again.",How to Remove Oil Stains2," As tough as it can be to remove stains from ordinary fabric, carpet can can be even more difficult. The tight interwoven fibers of most carpets can make it especially tricky for cleaning agents to penetrate to the oil, so you'll want to do as much as you can to remove the stain on your carpet before it sets. If the stain has just occurred, press a folded-up paper towel or rag into the stain into absorb as much of the oil as you can.


As noted above, you won't want to scrub with your towel or rag, as this can spread the oil over a larger area.
Blot continuously until you're not picking up any more oil. Because it's extra-tricky to remove oil from carpet once it's set, you'll want to concentrate especially hard on removing oil from the carpet before a stain even has a chance to form.

, Next, as with fabric, you'll want to gently rub a neutral, absorbent powder like baking soda, corn starch, or talc into the stain to absorb extra oil from the carpet. You should notice solid clumps begin to form as the powder absorbs the oil. Unlike with fabric, however, it's difficult to simply brush these clumps out of the carpet, so you'll want to use a vacuum cleaner to remove them.

, Next, pour a small amount (no more than a few cupfuls) of rubbing alcohol (also called isopropyl alcohol) onto the stain. Allow the alcohol to soak into the stain and begin to dissolve the oil for about ten minutes. Blot the alcohol out of the carpet with a clean cloth.

, With a few common household materials, it's easy to make an effective carpet cleaner. Mix 2 cups (473ml) of warm water with 1 tbsp. (14.7ml) of white vinegar and 1 tbsp. (14.7ml) of liquid dish soap. Soak a sponge in the solution. Blot your stain repeatedly, scrubbing gently. Do this for about 5 to 10 minutes or until you notice your stain begin to dissolve.


When done, blot your stain with a rag or towel to remove excess moisture.

, At this point, if you have any commercial carpet cleaner handy, feel free to use it. Because you've already pre-treated your stain with the methods above, the cleaner should be extra-effective. Follow the instructions included with your cleaner to apply it to the stain. Most carpet cleaners will direct you to spray or pour the solution on the stain, let it set, then blot or vacuum the solution out of the carpet.

, When you're done treating your carpet, wash it with a small amount of cool, clear water. This water works as a ""rinse"" cycle, helping to dissolve any leftover cleaning materials soaked into the carpet. Some cleaning materials, if left to sit in carpet, can discolor or damage the fibers of the carpet. Others, like the vinegar and soap solution above, aren't necessarily harmful to the carpet, but leave a noticeable odor that shouldn't be allowed to take hold in the carpet. In any case, a little water can help remove leftover substances from the area of the stain.


After rinsing with water, immediately blot with a rag or towel. Don't let water soak through the carpet onto the floor, where it can cause damage if allowed to sit.

, Repeat the steps above as needed to work the stain out of the carpeting. When you're finished and the stain has been reduced or removed entirely, give the affected area one final vacuuming. This removes any leftover cleaning materials in the carpet and helps to dry to carpet out, preventing damage than can result from moisture left to sit in the carpet.

Soak or wash away excess oil immediately.,
Scrub with baking soda and water and allow to sit overnight.,
Soak with warm water and vinegar.,
Scrub the stain with an abrasive or stiff brush.,
Use a commercial grease-cutting cleaner.,
Use mineral oil for kitchen appliance surfaces.,
Use trisodium phosphate for concrete.,
Try using club soda.",How to Remove Oil Stains3," As with the types of oil stains described above, if you have the chance to do so, you'll want to remove as much oil as possible before it has the chance to set. However, since you're working on a hard surface, you don't have to worry about spreading the stain like you would with fabric, so feel free to scrape, wash, or rub the oil away as needed.


If you're working on your driveway, avoid washing oil into your yard. Some types of oil and certain cleaning solutions can be harmful to plants and grass and can even create unsightly ""dead spots"" in your landscaping., The first action you should take to treat oil stains on hard surfaces is similar, but not identical, to that used for the stains described above. Mix baking soda with water to create a loose (but not liquid) paste, then work the paste into the stain with a sponge or brush. Here, you're using the baking soda as a mild abrasive, rather than for its absorbent properties.


When you've given your stain a thorough scrubbing, allow it to sit overnight (or as long as is possible). As it dries, the baking soda paste will absorb the broken-up oil stain, making for easy removal in the morning.
For extra cleaning power, you may want to substitute hydrogen peroxide in your paste if you have it.

, Next, make a cleaning solution from water and vinegar as a cleaning solution/rinse. Mix about 2 cups (473ml) of warm water with 1 tbsp. (14.7ml) of white vinegar. Soak a rag in this mixture, then use it to spread the solution over the stain area, removing any dried baking soda in the process. Allow the solution to sit for about half an hour so that it can soak in and help dissolve up the stain.

, When you've allowed your makeshift cleaning solution to soak into your stain, remove it with an abrasive that can break up any remaining oil. There are many abrasives that may work here: steel brushes, fine-grain litter, abrasive pads, toothbrushes, and even sand can perform well.


If you're working on a hard surface that is vulnerable to damage or scratching, like a stove top, you will want to shy away from harsher abrasives like steel, sand, and so on. Instead, use a toothbrush or sponge.

, If needed, follow up your initial cleaning and scrubbing with a commercial cleaner to finish the job. A variety of grease-cutting solutions are available at grocery and department stores for relatively cheap. Some of these solutions are for general usage, while others are specially-formulated for certain surfaces (e.g. ovens, stove tops, driveways, etc.). Though every cleaner will be different, most function in the same way: apply the cleaner to the stain, allow it to set, then scrub it off.

, For certain hard surfaces in the kitchen where oil stains are common, like the stove top and the fan hood, mineral oil can be an effective cleaner. Soak a paper towel in mineral oil, then scrub the stained areas. For particularly difficult stains, you may want to try adding baking soda to the oil stain. In addition to removing stains, this method gives your appliances a pleasant sheen.


You won't want to use mineral oil for your driveway unless the stain is fairly small, as, compared to other cleaners, mineral oil can be somewhat expensive and impractical to work with.

, Some driveway stains, like those from dried-on motor oil, can be especially tricky to remove with normal cleaning methods. In these situations, try using trisodium phosphate (TSP), a heavy-duty cleaning powder often sold at specialty cleaning stores. Mix TSP with water to create a smooth paste and spread it over the stain, then allow it to dry. When the paste dries completely, scrub it away with a rag or brush. Repeat as needed until the stain is suitably reduced or removed.


Don't rinse dried TSP down the storm drain, as it is known to be harmful to aquatic ecosystems., When all else fails, try this old-fashioned method used by grandmothers everywhere. Pour a small amount of club soda onto your stain, allow it to set for about five to ten minutes, then wipe it away with a rag or sponge. Compared to other cleaning solutions, club soda is mild, but surprisingly effective. Best of all, it's cheap — large bottles of club soda usually only cost a dollar or two at the grocery store.

, Soak the corner of a paper towel in vegetable oil, then press it against the gummed table. Rub the area vigorously. The gum should release from the table.Any kind of vegetable oil will work for this method.
A light, unscented oil such as canola will leave less of a residue.

, To use this method, tear off a short section of duct tape. Lay the duct tape on the affected surface, sticky side down. Press the tape to the table, then lift it off.The gum should stick to the duct tape and lift off.
If there's still any gum on your table, repeat this method until the gum is removed.

, Put a small amount of peanut butter on, and let it sit for 15 minutes. Follow by scraping it off with a butter knife.The oil in the peanut butter will help to dissolve the chewing gum and release it from the table.
If you don't have peanut butter, try another oily substance such as mayonnaise, facial moisturizer or make-up remover wipes.

, Press the blade between the gum and the table's surface. Push the blade gently across the table, being careful not to press down. Pressing down could scratch the table.A dull edge, such as a butter knife, should be used. Sharper blades should be used with caution, as they could cut you or scratch the table.

, Dampen a cotton ball with acetone, or paint remover. Gently rub the wet cotton against the gummy residue.Because this is paint remover, this method is not recommended for varnished, painted, or finished surfaces.
Repeat until residue is no longer visible.

, Put wood filler onto any scratches or holes that might result from removing gum. Smooth it out with a putty knife until it feels smooth to the touch.Drying on a small area may take a few hours.
Allow the filler to dry completely.
Choose a wood filler that is paintable/stainable.

, With a fine grain sandpaper or an orbital sander, rub the area until it's very smooth. If you sand it, and it's still not smooth, reapply wood filler and sand again.If the surface will be visible, be careful to limit your sanding strokes.
Once your surface is sanded smooth, you may paint or stain if desired.

, If the surface needs only light repair, a wood oil may be sufficient. Generously apply the wood oil to the affected surface with a brush. Allow to soak in for 30 minutes, then rub off excess with a soft cloth.Applying the oil along the wood grain will work best.
Tung oil is good for tables on which food may be prepared, as it's non-toxic. For outside tables, Danish oil or teak oil is recommended.

, Furniture polish may be used following application of oil. After table has been allowed to thoroughly dry, spray a soft cloth with furniture polish. Spread liberally across the table's surface.Furniture wax may also be used. It requires more effort to apply, but results in a more stable surface.
Furniture spray contains silicone, and will have a brighter finish than either wax or polish. Buff well to bring out the most shine.

, If you have a high-pressure washer, great. You can throw it in there and it'll do the job for you. If you don't, you'll have to improvise. You want a large amount of hot water tackling the stain with as much force as possible, literally blasting the stain away.









If you have a large tub and a powerful shower head, consider holding the material underneath it for 10-20 seconds, depending on the size of the stain.
If your faucets lack the adequate pressure, heat up a pan of water and do the job yourself. Place the material on the shower floor or in the bathtub, and rinse it with the high temp water, carefully pouring the heated water on the stain.

, You will be soaking the sweater in water, which could cause it to lose its shape. You will need to stretch the sweat back out to its original shape. This tracing will be your template for that step.

, For a large, bulky sweater, try using a tub or large basin instead. The sweater will need to be completely submerged, so make sure that the water is deep enough.

, Pass your hand through the water a few times to mix everything together. Do not agitate the water so much that you get frothy bubbles. The dish soap will help break up the stubborn stain, and remove it.








, Do not wring or twist the sweater, or you may ruin the shape and fibers.

Add a generous squirt of a mild liquid dish detergent like Dawn or PalmOlive and stir the mixture together by hand until it forms a bubbly solution.








Try treating large spills and splatters with a sprinkling of flour. The flour will soak up the oil or grease, which can then be scooped up and thrown away.Make sure you clear the area of any electronic appliances or other objects that could be damaged by moisture before you get underway.;
, For most appliances and metal surfaces, it will be okay to use the abrasive side of the sponge. Otherwise, stick with the smooth side to to keep from causing damage, especially if you’re treating materials like wood that scratch easily.








Squeeze the excess solution out of the sponge so you don’t make a mess while cleaning.
For heavy buildup or stains that cover a large area, you can add a little more soap directly to the sponge.

, Use tight, circular motions to lift the grease off of the surface you’re cleaning. Wring out the sponge or washcloth periodically to clear it of dingy water, then rewet it before you continue scrubbing.








Wring out and rewet the sponge as many times as needed until the grease is completely gone.If the stain happens to be on a non-carpeted floor, you can also use the soap solution to mop it like normal., Wet a separate, clean sponge and wipe down the surface again. This will help you make sure you’ve gotten the last of the greasy residue and also remove any remaining soap solution.

Once time is up, all you’ll have to do is wipe down each spot in the order that you sprayed them.
The longer you leave the vinegar, the more it will eat away at set-in messes.

, Blot at the stain with a damp washcloth or sponge. Most of the grease should come right off, leaving behind a sparkling, sanitized finish. If any residue remains, make another pass using a clean section of the cloth or sponge to avoid smearing the grease back over the area you just cleaned.








You may need to reapply fresh vinegar a couple times to erase stains that cover a large surface area.
If vinegar alone isn’t enough to do the trick, try again and this time sprinkle a small amount of baking soda over the grease stain. The foaming action of the two ingredients is doubly effective for dissolving stubborn grime."

Grab a bottle of oil.,
Wet a clean washcloth with a few drops of oil.,
Rub the washcloth over the grease.,
Wipe away any remaining oil.",How to Clean Up Grease3," Believe it or not, oil can be extremely useful for loosening the hold of greasy messes. Most cleaning experts recommend using a natural, scent-free oil that won’t cause saturation or discoloration, like vegetable or mineral oil.If you don’t have a bottle of mineral oil around, baby oil will also get the job done.
Avoid dark oils that might potentially stain porous, light-colored surfaces.

, The simplest way to do this is the hold the washcloth over the mouth of the bottle, then turn the bottle upside down so that it soaks a circular spot. This spot will provide just enough oil to clean greasy messes without adding to problem.








Be careful not to glob the oil on too heavily, or you may have trouble getting it all off.

, Work the oil into the stain using a forceful circular motion. The oil will cut through the grease, which will be absorbed by the dry portion of the washcloth. Keep rubbing until you’ve removed all the grease, applying more oil as needed.








Press the tip of your finger into the spot beneath the washcloth to create a more focused scrubbing area.
For a deeper clean, try scouring dried or burnt-on grease with an abrasive sponge or toothbrush after you’ve applied the oil.

, When you’re cleaning grease from materials like wood and unsealed stone, it may not be a good idea to leave behind large quantities of oil. Once the grease is gone, buff out the last traces of oil with a towel or chamois. The end result will be a spotless surface that’s polished, glowing and totally grease-free.









A thin layer of oil can actually help protect natural materials by repelling moisture, which could otherwise lead to warping, swelling and cracking over time.
Don’t try to rinse off the oil using water—this will just cause it to bead up and collect on the surface.

Try dish detergent.,
Pour on some baby powder.,
Rub some chalk on it.,
Cover it up with cornstarch.,
Pour on some talcum powder.,
Make a salt and rubbing alcohol solution.,
Use some dish soap.,
Use a dry cleaning solvent.",How to Remove Grease from Clothes1," The best and simplest way to remove anything oily or greasy from any fabric is by generously applying a concentrated dish detergent directly to the stain. It contains no harsh chemicals so you don't have to worry about it damaging the fabric. Dish detergent is formulated to cut through grease plain and simple. Using a small brush (old toothbrushes work great!) scrub the stain in a circular motion for several minutes. Keep pouring on the detergent if needed. Allow the fabric to rest for 30 minutes or so at least before placing in the washing machine. Wash in warm water on heavy duty cycle. This method uses only one ingredient and works wonderfully!;
, As soon as you’re able, pour a small amount of baby powder all over the fresh grease stains on your clothing. The baby powder is fine enough that it will fill in the crevices between the fibers, and absorb the grease. Leave the baby powder to ‘soak’ for 10-15 minutes, and then brush it off. If the grease is still faintly visible, toss it in the washing machine under cold water. The combination should do the trick, and by the time the clothing has dried, there should be no trace of grease left!

, Because chalk is such a fine powder, it easily absorbs the grease in your clothes and makes it easy to remove. Fill in your grease stain with plain white chalk, or scrape some of the powder over the stain. Allow it to set for 10-15 minutes and then rub it off. If the stain is still visible, you can wash it with cold water. The rinse/dry cycle will finish the task and should fully remove the stain.

, Yes, another one of the fine powders (just like baby powder and chalk), cornstarch works wonders at soaking up fresh grease and oil stains. Pour a small amount of the powder on the stain and allow it to set for a quarter of an hour. You can brush off the cornstarch afterwards, or leave it on and put it in the washing machine. Wash your clothes on ‘cold’, and your grease stain should be gone!

, Don’t have any of the aforementioned powders on hand? Try using talcum powder to remove the stains. Follow the same process as explained above by pouring a small amount of the powder onto the grease stain, and allowing it to soak for 10-15 minutes. When it’s had a bit of time to soak up the grease, throw the clothing into the washing machine and wash it on ‘cold’.

, This solution works best for stains on thicker fabrics, such as denim or linen. Mix together one part salt with three parts rubbing alcohol, and then pour it onto the grease stain. Use a soft cloth to rub the mixture into the stain, working it into the fibers. Allow the solution to soak for 10-15 minutes, and then wash your clothing as you normally would. By the time the clothing has been washed and dried, their should be a missing grease spot!, There’s a reason they use dish soap to clean up oil spills - they are great at dissolving tough oil stains. Find a dish soap that is used for the purpose of dissolving oil (these often have a special type of oil-eating bacteria as an ingredient). Cover the grease stain with the dish soap, and rub it in gently with a soft cloth. Then, throw your clothing into the washing machine and run it under the normal settings. Your clothing should be grease-free after a single wash, but you can repeat the process again if it’s not., If you’re up for spending a few bucks, pick up a specialty dry cleaning solution used for cleaning up grease stains. These are typically spray-on or iron-on liquids that are applied directly to the stain prior to washing. Because they are dry-cleaning grade, they should work out the stains almost immediately, making your clothing look good-as-new."

Allow the mayo to sit on the sticker for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.,
Wipe the mayonnaise off the sticker area and begin to peel the sticker back.,
Repeat if necessary.",How to Use Household Products to Remove Stickers and Marker1," Before you smear the sticker area with mayo, try to peel/remove the sticker without damaging the box or surface. Remove the sticker as slowly as possible in order to keep the sticker in tact as you remove it (keeping it in tact will open the possibility of getting more sticker off the item rather than trying to rip pieces).;
, Try to remove as much leftover residue that may be easy to lift off the item.

, Depending upon the sticker size, approximately 1 tsp. could do the job.

, You want the compound to permeate the sticker and any remaining residue so give the mayo some time to start working.

, You may need to also use your index finger to rub the area in the even the sticker does not peel easily.

, If the sticker still does not budge or you only remove a portion, repeat the process. Consider adding more mayo if you feel as though the mayonnaise didn’t do the job during the first pass.

Try using shampoo.,
Use waterless mechanic’s soap.,
Try simple green.,
Use a bit of WD-40.,
Pour on cola.,
Try using aloe vera.,
Use Lestoil.",How to Remove Grease from Clothes2," Believe it or not, hairspray can actually work to remove set-in grease stains. Heavily douse your grease stain with hairspray, using a paper towel in between the fabric and the spray. Allow it to soak for thirty minutes, and then put it in the washing machine for a regular wash. Air-dry your clothes when finished in the washing machine, and you should be good to go! If this process doesn’t work the first time, you can repeat it until the stain is totally removed.

, Granted, this does sound a little gross. However, cheese-whiz is a sworn-upon grease remover by some. Coat your grease stain in a thick layer of cheese whiz, and then rub it in with your finger and put it in the washing machine. A single wash should be enough to get out the stain - and the whiz.

, Shampoo is used for getting the natural oils and grease out of your hair and scalp, so why not use it for the same process on your clothing? Pour shampoo directly onto your stain, and use a cloth to vigorously rub it in. Let it set for 10-15 minutes, and then wash it as you would regularly in the washing machine. Allow the clothing to air-dry, and you should be grease stain free.

, Waterless mechanic’s soap - a type of powder detergent - is used in garages all over the world to remove oil from the hands of greasy mechanics. Pour the powder onto the stain, and then rub it vigorously into the oil stain. Let it set for thirty minutes, and repeat the process. Wash the clothing and allow it to air dry; if the stain still persists, repeat the aforementioned process again until it has been fully removed.

, Simple green is a cleaning solution used by many for regular household cleaning tasks. However, it also works to remove set-in stains. Pour the liquid directly onto the stain and let it set for 15-20 minutes, adding more if necessary. Then wash your clothing on a cold water cycle, and air dry it.

, WD-40 is used for a multitude of cleaning purposes, including oil and grease stain removal. Pour the cleaner onto the stain and wait for 30 minutes, allowing it to soak in. You should wash your clothes immediately after letting it soak, washing it with cold water and then air drying it when complete. Repeat this multiple times if necessary to completely remove the stain.

, It’s been known for quite a while that cola sodas have some amazing cleaning qualities, as a result of their ability to dissolve nearly anything. Although you may fear for furthering your stain, colas can remove set in grease stains. Pour it directly onto the stain, and leave it to soak for 1-2 hours (this isn’t long enough for the soda to stain). Follow this up with a wash in the washing machine and an air dry, and you’re finished.

, If you’re having trouble scrubbing out an oil stain, you can try aloe vera gel on it. Soak your clothing in cool water, and then pour aloe vera (100% aloe vera gel is best) onto the stain. Rub the gel into the stained spot vigorously for a few minutes, and then wash your clothing with cold water.

, Another multi-purpose cleaning solution, Lestoil is perfect for removing oil stains (it’s practically in the name). Pour the Lestoil directly onto the stain so that it may soak in for 20-30 minutes. Then, wash your article of clothing in the washing machine with cold water. If you’re removing oil from multiple articles of clothing at once, you can add the lestoil directly to the washing machine with the detergent."

Don’t panic if you cannot remove all of it.,
Try makeup.,
Know that you will not get ink poisoning.",How to Remove Sharpie Ink from Skin3," As your skin cells die (a very normal, fairly fast process) you should be able to easily scrub and wash off any remaining ink. This should not take more than a few days. In other words, the ink should come off more or less on its own.








, If any remaining ink needs to be covered up (for example, your frat buddies wrote racist slurs all over your face and you have an internship interview the next day), try makeup. You’ll need foundation and powder in your skin tone. You can also use Dermablend Cover Crème, which is well known for being able to cover just about anything and is frequently used to cover tattoos.









You may need someone a little more experienced to help you apply it if you don’t know how because it is harder than it sounds, but you should be able to cover up any remaining ink with makeup.

, The idea that you can get ink poisoning from getting ink on your skin is false.Ink poisoning can only result from orally ingesting ink, and then only a great deal of it. Again, don’t panic. If you are very concerned, you can call your local poison hotline.

Assemble your ingredients.,
Dab as much of the grease as possible with the cloth.,
Find the grain of the leather.,
Spread talcum powder on the item.,
Gently brush the talcum powder off the item.",How to Clean Grease Stains on Leather1," If you've just spilled some butter or your boots or gotten bacon grease on the couch, it's best to leap into action right away. If you catch it quick enough, all you need to clean your leather item is:

A microfiber cloth
Talcum powder;
, Gently blot at the grease stain, trying to absorb as much of it as possible as quickly as possible. The trouble with cleaning leather is that it tends to absorb liquid, especially grease, making it difficult to clean topically once it's been absorbed.









Avoid scrubbing the leather. This can damage the fine grains of the leather, making the stain worse. Blot gently and use some kind of lint-free microfiber cloth.

, Just like wood, leather has a direction of texture. You'll have more success in applying any cleaner if you apply it along the lie, as opposed to across it. In other words, any time you wipe or blot at the leather, you want to do it with the grain.









If you're having trouble finding the grain, try to work from the ""outside"" of the stain in to the center. At the very least, you'll be able to shrink the stain this way., Use regular household baby powder to soak up the grease. Be liberal with your application of the powder. It works particularly well at drawing the grease out without damaging the leather because it's more absorbent than the leather is, as long as you get there in time.









Let the powder sit overnight, or at least several hours to do its work.

, Using a cloth, gently brush off the talcum powder. Be careful not to scrub the powder back into the leather, working the grease back out.

Assemble your ingredients.,
Apply the detergent.,
Soak the leather with the distilled water.,
Blot dry with a clean cloth.",How to Clean Grease Stains on Leather2," One particularly effective method of cleaning grease from smaller items is to use a bit of dish soap and distilled water to create a lather and clean the item. You'll need a couple of clean micro-fiber cloths, the soap, and water. Consider using a spray bottle to make the job easier.








, Dip the cloth into the liquid detergent. Dab the patch test area with the cloth, being gentle to work with the grain of the leather.








, Use your clean fingers to rub the patch test area until you work up a gentle lather. Apply more water as needed to clean the stain.








, Allow the piece to dry fully before attempting to clean again. You might have to attempt several applications before the stain is shrunken significantly or completely removed from the item. Give it time to dry before attempting to clean it again.

Assemble your ingredients.,
Mix the ingredients thoroughly in a bowl.,
Do a patch test.,
Dip the cloth into the pasty mixture and dab the test area.,

Try alternatives.",How to Clean Grease Stains on Leather3," To create a simple and effective homemade leather cleaning solution, you'll just need the basic ingredients to make a loaf of bread:









3/8 cup of distilled water
1/8 cup of sea salt
1/2 teaspoon white flour
1 tablespoon baking soda

, Use a spoon or fork and work your salt water, flour, and baking soda into a kind of a paste. This is highly effective in gently lifting grease from leather without affecting the leather grains of your item.









Alternatively, you can try a mixture

, Find a less visible spot on your item to ""patch test"" the cleaning solution of choice. If your leather is dyed in any way, any kind of cleaner can affect the color, so pick an out-of-the-way patch to test it on.








, Use a small amount of the mixture on the cloth and be extremely gentle. You want to use the same basic principle as the quick-fix method, gently dabbing and letting the cleaner do the work. Don't make it worse by scrubbing.








, Be gentle and allow the area to dry completely before attempting to clean again. It might take several applications to completely eradicate the stain, or shrink it considerably, but allow the leather time to rejuvenate before you clean it again.








, There are many different cleaning solution recipes used with varying degrees of success. Try different recipes if you can't get the spot as clean as you'd like. Use the same basic method for cleaning, but try different combinations of natural products you've got on hand.Some have reported success using:









Equal parts water and white vinegar
Equal parts lemon juice and cream of tartar













One part of vinegar to two parts of linseed oil

Dab fresh ink with a cotton ball.,
Scrape the paper gently with sandpaper or a razor blade.,
Use whiteout.",How to Remove Printer Ink on Paper1," Inkjet (or ""bubble jet"") printers spray droplets of ink onto the paper, and depending on the type of ink used and the printer, this ink may remain wet for several minutes. Immediately after printing, you may be able to pick up a small portion of the ink using a cotton ball.This can make the next step easier, even if the ink is still mostly visible on the paper.


Do not rub the paper vigorously, as it may rip.
Most home and office inkjet printers use aqueous inks, typically the cheapest option, which take a few minutes to dry unless the printer includes a heating mechanism.;
, Sometimes, the ink will remain mostly on the surface of the paper. Scrape the top level of paper off using a razor blade or ultra-fine grit sandpaper.Scrape gently in one direction only, towards yourself.


This has a greater chance of success if you try this immediately after printing. Thicker paper will also help, as it can withstand additional scraping.UV-cured inks, which tend to be more expensive and durable, are quickly bonded to the paper before they have a chance to soak in.They may be easier to scrape off than other types of printer ink.

, If the above methods do not work, you may have to give up on removing the ink. Apply whiteout instead and allow it to dry before writing or drawing over it.

Apply acetone with a cotton ball to smudge the ink.,
Rub the acetone in once with tissue paper.,
Put the acetone-soaked paper in an ultrasonic cleaning machine (optional).,
Look up the latest news on laser ""unprinters."",
Use whiteout.",How to Remove Printer Ink on Paper2," Laser printers fuse the ink (technically ""toner"") to the paper fibers before the paper is ejected, so the ink is already dry and bonded by the time you see it.Acetone, also sold as fingernail polish remover, can be applied with a cotton ball to dissolve some of the ink into a liquid again. This is not a perfect method, but may be the only one easily available. The paper will end up grey and smudged, but new printing or writing should be clearly visible on top of the smudge.


Keep acetone away from heat sources, as it is flammable. If you feel dizzy from fume inhalation, move to fresh air. If you get acetone on your skin, eyes, or mouth, immediately rinse with lukewarm water for 15 minutes, without pausing to remove contact lenses., Rubbing the acetone over the ink greatly increases the amount of ink removed, although about 1/3 of the ink will probably remain as a grey smudge and faint image. Rub tissue paper only once across the affected area, since additional rubbing may tear the paper and does not noticeably increase the amount of ink removed., Ultrasonic devices use high-frequency sound waves to agitate contaminants and break them off of surfaces. This can be used to remove even more of the ink smudge, although the paper will still not appear as new. However, while these machines are sold for household use, they range from $150 at the cheapest, to several thousand dollars for higher-capacity, stronger versions.

, These devices uses short pulses of laser light to burn off laser-printed inks, but as of September 2014, they only exist as theory or prototypes. This may change, however, so search online for news about ""unprinters"" or about the company ""Reduse.""These devices will not work on inkjet-printed paper.

, If none of the above methods work, try using whiteout instead. This will leave a visible raised, white surface on the paper, but once dry it will allow you to write or draw over it.

Apply this mixture directly to the marker stain and let it sit for a moment or two. Grab a clean, slightly dampened cloth and use this to rub the mixture into the stain using circular motions. This may take a little elbow grease, but the stain should come off.

, A magic eraser is a special cleaning pad designed to remove stains from a wide variety of surfaces. All you need to do is wet the magic eraser slightly, then use it to scrub the permanent marker stain from the surface.

, WD-40 is a commercial cleaning product with multiple uses in the home. Simply spray some WD-40 directly onto the marker stain then scrub it with a clean cloth to remove.

, A dry erase marker can be used to remove stains from many surfaces, and it works extremely well on whiteboards. This is due to the fact that dry erase markers contain a non-polar solvent. Simply draw over the previous marker stain with the dry erase marker, then wipe off., In certain circumstances, it is possible to remove a marker stain by simply rubbing it with a pencil eraser.

Lay the stained fabric face down on a layer of paper towels.,
Apply stain spot remover.,
Wash the fabric, if possible.,
Head to the dry cleaners.",How to Remove Sharpie1," Make sure that you have enough paper towels to absorb the excess stain remover. These towels should also absorb some of the stain. You may need more paper towels as you work, so keep a roll of paper towels handy.


You should also work on the stain on a surface that will not be damaged by the stain remover. For example, you could work on the stain while the item is in top of your washer or dryer.;
, Apply stain remover to the underside of the stain. You can do this by turning the article of clothing inside out, but make sure that you place paper towels between the layers of fabric. Applying stain remover to the underside of the stain will push it out through the top instead of pushing it further into the fabric.








, If the fabric you are cleaning is something that you can throw into the washer, then you will want to do so right away. After applying the stain remover, wash the fabric in cold water with detergent. Do not use warm water, do not dry in a dryer, and do not iron. Heat can cause the stain to set.









If you cannot wash the fabric because it is part of a chair or other piece of furniture, then you may be able to just dab the area with some cold water to remove the fabric cleaner. Follow the label’s instructions for how to treat this type of fabric.
If the item is all white, then you may consider adding about ¼ cup of bleach to the washer as well. Make sure that you add the bleach using your washer’s bleach dispenser. Do not just pour the bleach into the washer.

, Some items cannot be washed in a washing machine and they require dry cleaning instead. If your item label specifies that it is “dry clean only,” then you will need to take it to a professional cleaner instead.

You may also consider taking your item to the dry cleaners if the stain remover did not work. If none of these methods worked, or if you are working with a delicate fabric, then your best bet is to ask a professional to remove the stain for you.
Make sure that you explain that the stain was from a Sharpie when you take the item to the dry cleaners."

Use a firm dabbing motion, pressing the rag into the stain and lifting it up directly without rubbing it back and forth., If the stain remains, dampen a clean cloth with more rubbing alcohol and dab the stain again. Then rinse with a clean, damp sponge or cloth.Once the stain is gone and the upholstery has been rinsed, let it air dry.

Consult your local hardware store.,
Be sure to read the label of any product before you buy.,
Try a Magic Eraser.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Furniture3," Hardware stores should have a stock of commercial carpet cleaners. You can ask one of the employees for a recommendation, but most cleaners will list what they work best for on the bottle. Lift Off #3is an example but you can get any number of products.

, Commercial products often contain chemicals that can cause damage if used on the wrong surface. Check the labels to make sure it is appropriate for the specific surface you need to clean.

, You can get these at places like Target or Walgreens. They work great, even on bamboo items!


Use furniture oil if the sheen gets rubbed off.
Other products such as Goo Gone or Bon Ami can remove permanent marker stains and are available at most hardware stores.

Purchase a magic eraser sponge.,
Cut the sponge into smaller pieces.,
Dip the sponge in some water.,
Rub the stain with the sponge using circular movements until it is gone.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Plastics2," You can find them in the cleaning department of most grocery stores. They are white and shaped like bricks. Be sure that you purchase a plain magic eraser, without any additives, such as bleach.

, This will make it easier to work with; a small amount will also go a long way.

, If the stain is particularly tough, consider using rubbing alcohol instead., Do not press too hard. It may rake anywhere between five to ten minutes before you start seeing any results.







"
"
Find some rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, or acetone.,
For curved surfaces and small stains, soak a cotton ball with the alcohol.,
Wipe the stain clean with the cotton ball.,
For flat surfaces and larger stains, pour the alcohol over the stain.,
Wipe the stain clean with a paper towel.,
Continue wiping the surface with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol until the stain is gone.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Plastics3," All three will help dissolve the chemicals in the permanent marker, making it easier to dissolve. Here are the benefits and drawbacks of each:


Rubbing alcohol is the safest to use, but it may not be as effective and you may need to use it a few times before you get the stain off. The higher the percentage, the more effective it will be. Try to get something that is 90% or higher.Hand sanitizer works great on curved surfaces because it holds its form better and does not drip as much. It will be about as effective as rubbing alcohol.
Acetone is the strongest and most effective. It can remove paint and melt certain surfaces, so it is not recommended for painted surfaces and softer plastics. Consider testing in an inconspicuous area first. Simply dampen a cotton ball and press it against the area for a few seconds before wiping it away. If the plastic appears distorted or loses its color, do not use acetone; try rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer instead.

, If you are using hand sanitizer, squirt a few drops onto the stain and spread it with your finger so that the entire stain gets covered.

, This works well on curved surfaces as well as keyboards and phones. If the stain is stubborn, then soak a fresh cotton ball with the alcohol and hold it against the stain for a few minutes before wiping it away. Do not try this with acetone; acetone can melt plastics if it is left in contact with them for too long.








, Spread it around with your finger until it is covering the entire stain.








, For stubborn stains, let the alcohol sit for a few minutes. Again, do not leave acetone on plastic for longer than a few seconds, or you may ruin the plastic surface.








, Most of the stain should have disappeared after the initial treatment, but you may have some residue. Keep in mind that the longer the permanent marker has been on the plastic, the more difficult it will be to remove; in some cases, it may have soaked too deeply into the plastic. In this case, you may still see a slight ""ghost"" of the stain.

Gather your supplies.,
Mix the baking soda and toothpaste until you get a thick paste.,
Spread the paste over the stain.,
Scrub the stain for a minutes.,
Rinse the area clean.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Plastics4," You will need one part baking soda and one part white toothpaste.How much you use will depend on the size of the stain. Be sure that the toothpaste is white (or a pale mint color) and not the gel kind; white toothpaste is more abrasive than gel toothpaste and thus more effective. Because this method uses abrasive materials, it is not recommended for painted surfaces, as it may scratch the paint. Consider testing the paste in an out-of-sight area first.


For very small stains, you will probably need a pea-sized amount of toothpaste and baking soda. For larger stains, you will need up to a teaspoon or tablespoon of each.
You will also need something to mix the toothpaste and baking soda in, such as a small bow, dish, or cup.

, Measure out some baking soda and toothpaste. Make sure that you are using equal amounts, and mix them together using a fork or spoon. You can also use a toothpick or popsicle stick.








, Do not spread the paste too thinly, but also don't spread it too thick. If you can see the stain through the paste, you may want to consider using a little bit more.








, If the surface is very textured, consider using a toothbrush; the bristles will help you get into all of the little nooks and crannies. If the surface is very smooth, consider using a towel or your finger, and don't scrub too hard or you will risk scratching the surface.








, The baking soda and toothpaste should have removed most of the stain, however, you may want to consider following up with some rubbing alcohol to get rid of any residue.

Try some tea tree oil.,
Buff the stain away with a pencil eraser.,
Try using some sunscreen.Sunscreen contains oils, which can help dissolve the chemicals in the permanent marker stain.,
Consider using some baking soda and vinegar.,
Try some hydrogen peroxide.,
Spray on some hairspray.,
Use commercial oil-based cleaning products with care.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from Plastics5," The oil will help dissolve the marker stain, making it easier to remove; it also smells much more pleasant than rubbing alcohol or acetone. Simply soak a cotton ball with some tea tree oil and rub it over the stain until it disappears. For tiny areas, consider using a Q-tip instead. When you are done, wipe the area clean with a paper towel.









If there is any oily residue, soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol and wipe it clean.

, Make sure that you are using a good quality rubber eraser. This will be most effective on light stains and smooth surfaces. Simply rub the stain with the eraser until it disappears.







, Keep in mind, however, that the oils in sunscreen can also stain certain surfaces, so you might want to test it out first on an inconspicuous area first.








, Sprinkle some baking soda over the stain, and then drizzle some white vinegar over it. Let the foamy mixture sit on the stain for a few minutes, then wipe it off using a towel., Be sure to get the type that comes in a dark-colored bottle from the first aid section of a drug store. Soak a cotton ball with some hydrogen peroxide and wipe it over the strain. For larger stains, pour the hydrogen peroxide over it and wipe it off using a paper towel.







, The chemicals in the spray will help dissolve the stain, making it easier to remove. Spray the affected area, then wipe it clean using a paper towel. Keep in mind that the chemicals in some hairsprays may damage certain plastics. Consider testing in an out-of-sight area first before working on the stain.

, Products such as Goo-Gone and Goof-Off can be great at removing sticky residue and stains, including permanent marker stains.However, the chemicals in these products may also ruin certain surfaces, especially if they are shiny. Be sure to read the manufacturer's instructions and consider testing the product in an inconspicuous area first. You may also end up with some oily residue, which you can clean off by wiping a cotton ball soaked with rubbing alcohol over it.

Use bleach to remove permanent marker from white fabrics.,
Use a mixture of vinegar, milk, borax and lemon juice for satin.,
Use rubbing alcohol or acetone on sturdy fabrics.,
Use citrus juice on regular clothing.,
Use rubbing alcohol or hairspray to remove stains from carpet.",How to Remove Permanent Marker2," Dilute a small amount of bleach in water and dip the stained part of the clothing into the liquid. The stain may come off immediately, or may require soaking.


If you need to soak the item, just keep on eye on the fabric to ensure the bleach doesn't begin to dissolve it.
Once the stain has disappeared, you should wash the item immediately, as normal.

, Satin fabrics respond well to a mixture of one tablespoon each of milk and white vinegar and one teaspoon each of borax and lemon juice.Mix the solution in a small cup, then apply directly to the stain and let it sit for 10 minutes.
Take a clean, dampened sponge and use it to dab (not rub) at the fabric until the stain comes away.

, Stains on sturdier fabric, such as towels and sheets, can be removed with a little acetone or rubbing alcohol. Simply pour a little of either of these liquids onto a clean cotton ball and use this to dab at the stain until it disappears. Wash the items immediately.

, Citrus juice, such as that from a lemon or lime, can be used to gently remove marker stains from most items of clothing, without fear of bleaching or staining. Simply apply a little of the freshly squeezed juice directly to the stain and dab with a cotton ball or clean cloth until it disappears.


For more fragile fabrics, dilute the citrus juice to half strength with water first. Wash the item of clothing immediately.

, Pour rubbing alcohol into a cleaning cloth. Dab the cloth onto the carpet stain. As with any carpet stain, do not rub or you'll spread the stain and weaken the fibers. Keep dabbing until the stain lifts off.Alternatively, spray a little hairspray on the stain and use a clean towel to dab away.
Once the stain has been removed (using either of these methods) dampen the carpet with a little water then use a clean towel to blot dry.

Use an aerosol hairspray on leather upholstery.,
Use hydrogen peroxide and rubbing alcohol on microfiber upholstery.,
Use Windex, rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover on other furniture.",How to Remove Permanent Marker3," Spray some aerosol hairspray onto a clean cloth and use this to scrub at the marker stain. You may need to use more hairspray or switch to a cleaner section of the cloth before the stain is fully removed.


Once the stain has disappeared, clean off any hairspray residue with a clean, damp cloth and work a little leather conditioner into the furniture.

, To clean a marker stain from microfiber upholstery, apply a small amount of hydrogen peroxide to a clean towel and use this to scrub at the stain for 10 15 minutes.


Next, apply a little rubbing alcohol to a different towel and use this to scrub the stain for 10 to 15 minutes.
Use a third clean towel dampened with water to clean off any remaining marker. Blot the area dry using a dry towel.

, Other types of upholstery will usually respond to stain removal using Windex, rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover. All of these use the same method:


Apply a little of your chosen cleaning agent to a clean, dry towel and use it to dab at the stain (not run) until clean. Some people find that towels that match the color of the upholstery work best.
You may need to apply the cleaning agent to a new section of the towel and continue dabbing a number of times before the stain comes away. Just don't let the fabric become soaked in the cleaning agent, as this could stain.
Once the stain has been removed, pat up any excess moisture in the fabric using a clean, dry towel. If possible, place the furniture outdoors to dry completely.

"
"
Use alcohol.,
Place a little alcohol on a sponge or towel.",How to Remove Permanent Marker4," Try using either rubbing alcohol or 80 or 101 proof liquor.

, Rub it into the stained skin, using some elbow grease. A faint mark may remain, but this will fade after a shower or two.

"
"
Pour a small amount of hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol or non-acetone nail polish remover onto a clean, soft rag or paper towel.,
Use a pencil eraser and rub the mark well.",How to Remove Permanent Marker from a White Board2," Do not use any type of abrasive cleanser, such as Clorox or something with grit, as this will damage the surface of your board and it will stain permanently.








Wipe away the permanent ink with the wet cloth.
Wipe the board with a wet cloth to remove any remnants of the solvent, otherwise it may interfere with the dry erase marker when you try to write on the board.
Dry the board completely before use.

, Only try this if the other methods don't work, as scrubbing the board with the eraser could potentially damage the surface.

Use a ""magic eraser."",
Try a regular eraser.,
Make an alcohol solution.,
Apply a dry erase marker over the permanent marker.,
Try nail polish remover or acetone on plastic.Acetone and nail polish removers containing acetone can strip away most paints and dyes, and the dye in Sharpies is usually weak against it.",How to Remove Sharpie2," These handy cleaning products can be found in the same aisle as your household cleaners at the store. A “magic eraser” is made of melamine foam packed with air and uses no chemical solvents. It lifts stains from your surfaces using a type of physical reaction, rather than a chemical one, and it essentially works by sanding the stained surface on a microscopic level.Simply scrub the marked wall with the ""magic eraser"" until the stain lifts out.
Wipe the wall with a moist cloth when done to remove any melamine residue left behind.
Do not use a magic eraser on glossy paint because it can dull some of the glossiness away.

, You may also be able to lift a stain from a tablet screen, countertop, or other hard surface just by using a regular pink eraser.Rub a large pink eraser over the surface of the Sharpie stain as if you are erasing it. You may need to go over the stain several times to see any progress.








, You can create a solution of alcohol and water to use as a stain remover. Mix one part isopropyl alcohol with two parts water. Then, use a clean white cloth to rub some of the solution onto the stain. You may need to repeat this treatment several times before the stain comes out.







, You may also be able to get rid of a Sharpie stain by coloring over it with a non-permanent dry erase marker. This method works best if the stain is on a dry erase board or similar surface, such as a window or computer screen. The chemicals in the dry erase marker cling to those in the permanent ink, thereby lifting it out of the surface and away.








Color over the Sharpie stain completely with the dry erase marker.
Wipe the colored area with a paper towel.
Repeat as needed until the stain lifts away.

,









Cover the bottle of nail polish remover or acetone with a clean cloth. Tip the bottle upside-down briefly, just long enough to soak the portion of cloth above the bottle with the product.
Rub the portion of your cloth soaked in nail polish remover on the stain. You should notice the stain lifting out with only moderate pressure. Increase pressure as you scrub only if necessary.
Wipe clean with a dry portion of the cloth.

Soak your skin water.,
Scrub the area.,
Wash the area with soap and water when done.,
Apply some alcohol based hand sanitizer.",How to Remove Sharpie3," Soaking the area of your skin that is stained with Sharpie will help to moisten it and make it easier to remove the stain. Soak the area by placing it into a bowl of warm soapy water or saturate a washcloth with warm soapy water and lay it over the Sharpie stained area of your skin.







, After you have soaked your skin, you can use a washcloth to scrub the area for about one minute. Rub the area in a circular motion to try to remove the Sharpie stain.









For extra exfoliation, you can apply some sugar to the stained area of your skin and use the washcloth to work it into your skin.

, You can follow up the scrubbing by washing the Sharpie stained area of your skin with warm water and soap. Use your fingertips to apply the soap and then rinse it away with warm water.









Pat the area dry when you are finished.

, If the sharpie does not come out using plain soap and water, then you may want to try a bit of alcohol-based hand sanitizer to remove the Sharpie from your skin. Apply a dime sized amount (or more if it is a larger area) to your skin and rub it in. Then, rinse the area with warm water.









You may want to apply some moisturizer after all of this scrubbing. Over-washing your skin can cause dryness and irritation.

Treat the stain as soon as possible.,
Test stain removers on an inconspicuous area.,
Avoid using heat.",How to Remove Sharpie4," The sooner you start treating the stain, the better your chances of removing the stain will be. Do not hold off on treating the stain or do part of the process and then put it aside. Treat the stain completely as soon as you notice it., Some stain removers may lead to discoloration of fabrics and other surfaces, so it is best to test an area of the fabric or surface that people will not notice.For example, you might test the inside of the leg of a pair of jeans, the back of a sofa, or an area of hardwood flooring that is always covered by an area rug.

, Using heat may set the stain, so avoid exposing the stain to heat. Do not use a hair dryer, clothing dryer, or iron to treat the stain."
"
Treat the stain as quickly as possible.,
Apply a pre-wash treatment solution.,
Apply rubbing alcohol.Place the stained fabric face down on a flat surface, so the stain is facing away from you.,
Use nail polish remover on stubborn stains.,
Use gentler alternatives on delicate fabrics.,
Launder the fabric.",How to Remove Pen Marks1," The longer you let the ink sit in the fabric, the harder it will be to remove, so take action as soon as you notice the stain. Ideally, the ink will still be wet when you treat the fabric.;
, There are a wide variety of pre-wash treatments available in the cleaning aisle of the grocery store, where you purchase laundry detergent and dryer sheets. The handiest variety is found in pen form; this allows you to keep a cleaning agent on you at all times in your pocket or bag.


Remove the article of clothing if possible and lay it on a flat surface — any table will do.
Press the tip of the pen into the stain, releasing the treatment solution.
Do not rub at the stain, as this will rub it further into the fabric and/or spread it around. Simply soak the stain in the solution.
Dab at the stain with a clean paper towel or rag until the stain is removed, or at least significantly lightened.

, Put paper towels between the fabric and the surface to soak up the alcohol and the staining liquid, so you don’t mess up your table. Apply the rubbing alcohol to a cotton ball or rag, then gently press it into the back of the ink stain. Rinse the fabric with water when you’ve removed the stain.

, If you weren’t able to get to an ink stain while it was still fresh, you may not be able to loosen it from the fabric with the usual methods. If that’s the case, apply nail polish remover to it.


Place paper towels between the fabric and the flat surface you place it on to protect the surface underneath from the nail polish remover.
Apply the nail polish remover to a cotton ball, then transfer it to the cloth by dabbing the cotton ball onto the stain.
Apply a generous amount of nail polish remover; the stain should be completely saturated.
Press clean paper towels or cotton balls onto the stain until the ink has come off completely.
Reapply nail polish remover and change out the paper towels protecting the table surface as necessary.

, If you’ve gotten ink on pure cotton, silk, or high quality wool, you may want to avoid applying harsher chemicals to it, as they may damage the fabric while treating the stain. Instead, try one of these alternatives:


Create a solution of equal parts fresh lemon juice (not the bottled kind you can buy in the store) and a gentle laundry detergent. Transfer that solution to the stain using a clean rag or a cotton ball, soaking the stain with a generous amount of it. Allow the stain to soak for at least two hours before laundering the garment in cold water.
Blot the stain using cold milk instead of detergent or alcohol.

, If you’ve gotten to your stain quickly with either a pre-wash treatment solution or with rubbing alcohol, you may have removed the stain effectively. However, to make sure you’ve gotten all of the offending ink, and to remove the chemicals you applied, which don’t belong on the fabric, make sure you run the garment through the laundry as soon as possible.


If you were unable to remove the stain completely before laundering the fabric, spray hairspray onto the stain and allow it to dry before running the garment through the laundry. The hairspray will help break down the chemicals, raising the likelihood of the stain coming out in the wash.
With any stain, check the fabric to make sure the stain has been completely removed before putting the garment through the dryer. Applying heat to a stain that has not been completely removed will actually cause the stain to set even further, making it difficult to remove at a later date.

Apply hairspray, nail polish remover, rubbing alcohol, lens cleaner, or even just water to the pen mark.,
Rub the stain with a clean cotton ball.,
Allow the page to rest and dry between attempts.,
Use corrective white-out.,
Xerox the page if you need a clean sheet.",How to Remove Pen Marks2," Pens use a wide variety of inks, some of which will break down and loosen with the simple application of water, and some of which will need heavy duty chemicals like the acetone used in nail polish removers to break down.


The list provided here moves from harshest to weakest chemical strength. Try each of these options until you find one that works on your ink.
Don’t apply these liquids directly to the page, as it will soak through and cause the paper to rip.
Instead, apply the liquids to either a Q-tip or a cotton ball, and transfer them gently to the page.

, Be careful not to apply enough pressure to rip the page. Continue rubbing and dabbing until the stain comes out.

, A ripped page is far more unsightly than one with a stray pen mark on it. By allowing the page to dry completely between attempts, you lessen the likelihood of ripping.

, While this will not “remove” the pen mark, it will cover it up. You can purchase white-out in the same aisle where you purchase pens. Simply apply a light coat using the brush attached to the lid of the bottle. Allow the liquid to dry before writing over it with pen again.

, Anyone who looks closely at the page will be able to see that there is corrective fluid on it. If it’s important that the page be smooth and clean, you should make a Xerox copy of the page after you’ve made your correction.


Note that for some official documents, especially those requiring signatures, a Xeroxed page may be unacceptable. Double-check to make sure.

Try an eraser first.,
Acquire sandpaper.,
Tear off a section of sandpaper.,
Set up your work surface.,
Set up the paper with the stamp.,
Sand the ink off the paper.,
Alternate with an eraser.",How to Remove Ink Stamps from Papers1," If the ink stamp is light enough, an eraser by itself might do the trick. This will better protect the paper. Pencil erasers are fine as long as they're still soft. If you’re not making any progress after about five minutes, switch to something more abrasive., Any type will work as long as the grit is between 150 and 400.The lower the grit, the higher the abrasiveness. If you’re using thin paper (such as notebook paper), opt for the highest grit possible., Make sure it measures about 1 by 1 inch (2.5 by 2.5 cm). This will be small enough to focus on the ink stamp without affecting the surrounding area., Place several sheets of scrap paper on your work surface. Pile them one on top of the other. This is to cushion your paper from the hard surface of the table so you may avoid tears. The number of sheets will depend on how thin your working paper is.


Make sure your work surface is solid. A table should be fine. Clear away anything you won’t need.

, Place it face-up on top of the scrap paper. Hold it down firmly with your free hand. Be sure to use all of your hand and not just your fingertips. Position this hand so that the inked area of the paper is visible between your thumb and index finger. Make sure the paper is perfectly flat.

, Work away from your body. Use slow and gentle strokes. Avoid pressing too hard. Be patient. This method can be time-consuming.


As you sand, hold the paper up to the light to make sure you're not in any danger of sanding through.
When the sandpaper feels less gritty, you can clean it by holding it up and flicking the back of it.

, Try erasing the ink as it becomes lighter. This mainly helps with any smearing effects from the sanding. Continue the process. Keep sanding the stamp. As the marks lighten, you can use the eraser to remove what remains.Keep in mind the paper is weaker where you have sanded it, so be as gentle and patient as possible."

Open your book.,
Check the thickness of the paper.,
Acquire a book repair knife.,
Hold the knife in your dominant hand.,
Begin scratching.,
Alternate with an eraser.,
Touch up the area.",How to Remove Ink Stamps from Papers2," Turn it to the desired page. Make the page as flat as you safely can get it. Avoid cracking the spine.

, Make sure the page is at least as thick as the pages at the beginning and end of a typical library book. You can use this method on white or colored paper. You could also do this on the inside cover of the book. If the page is thin like computer paper or notebook paper, use another method.For extra protection, it might help to place several sheets of scrap paper under the page you’re working on.

, You can find these in specialty craft stores or online. Look for a blade that’s completely flat on one side with a deep bevel on the other. This will remove the ink stamp while protecting the page from damage.Don’t use an X-Acto knife or butter knife. It will remove the stamp, but it will also damage the page.

, Position it the same way you would hold a pen or pencil. Place your grip towards the bottom of the blade. You can position the blade vertically, horizontally, or at an angle., Start with a letter or small design element in the stamp. Gently follow the shape of the letter or element as you scratch. Move in a back-and-forth motion with the tip of the blade. Be patient. This method can be time-consuming, but you will get professional results.For example, if you’re removing a capital L, move the blade vertically on the long stem and horizontally on the shorter stem.

, As the letters or lines begin to lighten, try to erase them. Erase gently. Move in a regular motion as if you were erasing pencil marks. This will prevent damage that could come from additional scratching. Continue the process. Keep scratching out individual letters or design elements with the knife. As they lighten, you can use the eraser to remove what remains., When all marks are gone, touch up the formerly stamped area with the eraser. Use quick, yet gentle, strokes. Brush away any residual debris with the back of your hand."

Hold the book in one hand.,
Fit the sandpaper on your index finger.,
Start sanding.,
Check the remaining two page edges.,
Tear off a piece of the 320-grit sandpaper.,
Buff the surface.",How to Remove Ink Stamps from Papers3," Buy 100-grit and 320 grit. You can purchase sandpaper in sheets, but rolls might be more convenient. The rolled form will conform to your finger as you sand., This is the tougher grit paper that will remove the stamp. Keep your strip no wider than the width of your index finger. Make the length slightly longer than the pad of your finger (from the tip to the first knuckle)., This is to protect the jacket from being sanded in the process. Set it aside in a location where it won’t get damaged., This should be the hand you don’t write with. Hold the book with the remainder stamp facing you. Try to maintain a firm grasp to keep the book from slipping., Make sure it doesn’t extend beyond the width of the sanding surface. Otherwise, you could damage the book cover., Gently use a back-and-forth motion. Begin with the remainder mark. When the ink begins to disappear, lightly sand the rest of the edge to keep the page widths even. Keep sanding until the remainder mark is completely gone., Look for any hint of discoloration. If you see any, lightly sand those areas until the discoloration is gone. This will give all three page edges an even color., This is the finer texture that will smooth out your pages. Aim for the same length and width you tore of the 100-grit. Fit this piece of sandpaper to your finger as you did before the initial sanding., Gently move your finger back and forth. If you only sanded the side with the remainder mark, this is the only side you need to buff. If you sanded two or all three sides, buff those, as well."

Make a cleaning solution using dish soap.,
Test the finish.,
Gather some of the soap suds with a soft cloth.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Wood Furniture1," This method is most effective for fresh ink spills. Dish-washing soap works because of its grease-fighting properties. It lifts the stain and prevents it from getting into the wood. Mix a half teaspoon of liquid dish-washing soap with a one third cup of hot water in a small bowl. Stir the solution to make lots of soap suds.;
, Before using any cleaner on wood, you should testhow the finish reacts to it. Stick a cotton ball into the soap suds and rub it against a small section of the furniture. Try to find a spot out of view. If the soap damages the finish, stop. If it doesn't damage the finish, proceed with the next step., Make sure you're only getting into the suds, not in the solution. Then, gently wipe the ink stain with the soapy cloth. Follow up with a clean, damp cloth to rinse it off, then dry the area with a clean towel.


If the stain is still visible, you can use superfine steel wool (number 0000) dipped in liquid wax. Rub the steel wool lightly onto the stained area. The steel wool should remove only a fine layer of the surface. It's important to be gentle so that you don't remove too much wood. Wipe away the shavings with a clean cloth.

Place a clean white towel inside the jeans under the stain.,
Pour a small amount of 90% isopropyl alcohol or spray the hairspray directly on the stain.,
Blot the stain with a clean absorbent cloth or cotton ball.,
Rinse the jeans with cold water to remove the alcohol or hairspray after the ink is no longer visible.,
Launder the jeans in cold water in a washing machine.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Jeans1," Using a white towel will ensure that no additional color will be transferred to the fabric during the stain removal. The towel placed inside the jeans will prevent the ink from spreading to other areas of the jeans., For small stains, the alcohol can be applied with a cotton ball or cotton swab.Be careful to pour the alcohol slowly and just on the ink so the stain doesn’t bleed and spread.








, Each time you blot use a clean cotton ball or a new spot on the cloth as the ink will be drawn out of the jeans with the alcohol or hairspray.







, Be sure to use cold water as hot water may set any remaining ink and make the stain much harder to remove.








, Check to be sure that all of the ink is gone before drying the jeans because the heat from the dryer will make the stain set in. If any ink remains repeat the process of blotting with alcohol and wash the jeans again.

Make a baking soda paste.,
Spread the paste over the ink stain.,
Clean up.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Wood Furniture2," Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is great for cleaning because it becomes a light abrasivewhen combined with water. It's safe to use on wood because it's mild yet effective. To make the paste, add the baking soda to a half cup of water. Put in small amounts at a time until the mixture thickens into a goop.

, Rub it in with your fingers, making sure to completely cover over the stain. You don't have to scrub at it: let the baking soda do the work. If you scrub too hard, you risk damaging the wood's surface. Wait 10 to 15 minutes.

, Use a soft cloth dampened with water to remove the paste. Repeat the process until the ink is completely removed. For bigger stains, you might need to repeat this more times. Once you're satisfied with the results, finish by wiping the surface dry with another soft cloth.

Clean up.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Wood Furniture4," Apply denatured alcohol on a clean, soft cloth and wipe the surface with the cloth to remove dirt and other impurities. If the wood has a finish, you'll need to remove it. You can either sand it off, which takes a lot of work, or you can use chemical strippers.


If you choose to remove the finish using chemical strippers, do the work in a well-ventilated area. They contain very harsh chemicals, such as methylene chloride,which can do serious damage to your eyes, lungs, and skin.
Shellac and lacquer can be removed with just denatured alcohol.

, Common household bleach contains chlorine, which works for dye stainsand may work to remove set-in ink. Another choice is a wood bleach containing oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is great for iron-based stains, which covers some types of ink. Yet another choice is two-part wood bleach. The first part contains sodium hydroxide and the second part has hydrogen peroxide. The former open up the pores of the wood, while the latter reacts to the former. You can find either type of wood bleach at any hardware store.

As with any other harsh chemicals, be sure that your work area gets plenty of air. Use gloves to protect your skin and wear a mask to protect your lungs.
When working with two-part bleach, use separate cloths for each part to prevent the two chemicals from reacting with each other.

, Work it into the stained area with a clean cloth, avoiding getting any on the surrounding wood. Let it sit on the surface for 10 minutes. Repeat the process if necessary.

, Carefully wipe away the bleach with a cloth dampened in water. Avoid touching the surrounding wood. Follow up with another damp cloth and use it to wipe the entire surface. Next, towel it dry. Wait at least 24 hours before refinishing it.

Blot the stain with a damp cloth.,
Launder the garment.,
Air-dry.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Linen1," An alcohol-based hairspray is best. Aerosol cans typically spray more evenly than pump hairspray, so you may want to choose an aerosol brand, but either kind will work. The hairspray will help loosen the ink from the linen fibers.This method can be used for clothing or other linen items, such as couches.;
, You want to give the hairspray time to work, so don’t spray the stain and then start blotting immediately. Wait up to ten minutes to allow the ingredients in the hairspray to react with the ink., You should be able to see the ink coming to the surface of the fabric. Gently blot the ink away.

Determine whether your leather is naked or finished.,
Determine the depth of the stain.,
Read the care instructions for your leather, if possible.,
Spot-clean an area before applying any of the following methods.,
Try wiping the leather gently with a cloth dampened in a soap-based cleanser.,
Treat the leather with an ink stick designed for use with leather.,
Try busting out some saddle soap.,
Try some leather cleaner and conditioner.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Leather1," Naked leather, being extremely absorbent and essentially untouched, is difficult to clean without professional help. Put a drop of water on the surface of the leather item. If the water soaks in, the leather is unfinished and will require professional assistance. If it beads up, the leather is finished and you can begin cleaning.Take unfinished leather (like suede) directly to a dry cleaner for ink stain removal. Unfinished leather is extremely absorbent and the stain will be very difficult to remove even professionally. Try to use home remedies for unfinished leather is likely to cause you more time and hassle than it's worth.;
, If the ink stain is fresh and only on the surface of your leather item, begin cleaning according to the steps below. If the ink stain is older or has soaked deep into the leather, you will likely have to re-dye the leather professionally to remove the stain.

, The manufacturer may recommend a certain conditioner or cleaner to remove ink stains. They may also advise against doing something, possibly on this list, that either won't clean the leather or will actively hurt it.

, Locate a small spot of the leather in an inconspicuous area. Using whatever solution you end up trying, wipe a small amount into the leather and check for signs of damage or discoloration.


What you're doing here isn't checking that the solution is cleaning the leather; what you're checking is that the solution isn't ruining the leather. If the solution doesn't in fact work on your particular leather, you don't want to add insult to injury and make it even worse. That's why spot-cleaning is recommended., Soap-based cleansers, like Ivory, are gentler than solvent-based cleansers, making them better suited for cleaning stains off of leather.


How do you tell apart cleansers that are solvent-based from those that are not? The packaging should clearly say ""solvent"" or ""solvent-based"" if that's indeed the case, so be on the lookout.

, Much of the time, when you take your leather item to a professional cleaner to get serviced, this is what they use to remove stains. Although they can be pricey, it's only a nominal cost compared to what you probably paid for authentic leather.

, Saddle soap both cleans and protects leather, most often leather used in saddles — hence its name. Saddle soap is usually a combination of very gentle soaps and emollients such as glycerin and lanolin, which help rehydrate the leather after cleaning.


If you want to treat your leather better and increase its lifespan, apply saddle soap in small quantities to it regularly. The key to healthy leather is proactive treatment, not reactive treatment.

, Much like saddle soap, these products help both clean the leather and hydrate it, helping to stave off cracking. Although ink stains may be too tenacious for some leather, give leather cleaner and conditioners a try to see the difference it makes.


What you use to apply the leather cleaner and conditioner matters. You'll probably want something like a non-scratch, nonabrasive scrubbing pad instead of a terry cloth applicator pad. Terry cloth applicators are fine for conditioning, but they won't get the trick done if you're trying to remove a persistent stain.

"

Blot at the stained area using a soft, dry cloth or paper towel.,
Apply a leather cleaner to the stain.,
Moisten a cotton ball or a cotton bud with rubbing alcohol.,
Gently rub at the stain using the moistened cotton.,
Change the cotton ball or bud with a new one as soon as it picks up enough ink, to avoid smearing the ink stain to other parts of the leather.,
Dry the area using a blow dryer set at the lowest heat setting.,
Apply leather conditioner to the area using a soft cloth.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Leather Upholstery1," Try to get as much of the ink out as possible, without spreading the stain to surrounding areas.;
, Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions as indicated on the packaging.

, The cotton ball or bud should be moist enough, but not dripping wet.

, The ink should start to transfer to the cotton. Work from the outside of the stained area towards the middle.

, Repeat the rubbing process until the ink stain is fully removed.

, This will allow the alcohol to evaporate instead of eating away at the leather.

, The leather conditioner will allow for moisture to be restored to the leather.

Obtain a small piece of fine-grit sandpaper.,
Do a spot test.,
Buff away the stain.,
Follow up with white vinegar or rubbing alcohol.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Suede1," Sanding is generally considered the best way to remove stains from suede.An emery board, a common type of nail file, is convenient and will also work well for this method.An emery board is essentially a small strip of fine-grit sandpaper glued to a piece of cardboard. You can buy inexpensive emery boards from most grocery stores, pharmacies, and beauty shops.;
, While sandpaper is relatively safe for suede, it may not be right for all items. Some processing and dyeing methods may make suede more prone to damage from friction. To make sure sanding won't ruin the suede, do the following before tackling your stain:


Pick a small, inconspicuous spot on your item to test.This should be in an area that is hidden from view during normal use, such as the inside of a jacket. If you can find no such spot, pick one that is less visible, such as the inner side of a shoe rather than the outer side.
Gently rub the sandpaper on the spot. Go back and forth a few times.
Check for damage. It's normal to see some loose fibers after sanding suede. These can be shaved off with a razor. However, if there is any discoloration or major changes in texture, you should try a different cleaning method.

, Gently go over the stain with your sandpaper. Make small circular motions all over the stained area. Apply only the lightest amount of pressure possible. Be careful not to abrade the fabric. The stain should gradually wear away., It's possible that sanding alone will not remove the stain. If there is still a stain that won't get any lighter, stop buffing and try a solvent method:


Soak a soft bristle brush with either white vinegar or rubbing alcohol.
Gently scrub the stain, being careful not to abrade the suede.
If the brush dries out before you've completely lifted the stain, soak it again with your solvent of choice.
Once the stain is lifted, finish up by brushing the area with a clean toothbrush."

Create a cleaning solution.,
Soak the garment.,
Remove and rinse.,
Air-dry the linen.,
Repeat the process if needed.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Linen2," Fill a bowl or basin with 1 quart of warm water. Add 1/2 teaspoon of dishwashing detergent and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the water. Mix until well combined.This method may be best for larger stains, as you will soak the entire garment.

, Submerge the linen into the solution. Let it soak for approximately 30 minutes. This will allow time for the chemicals to react with the stain. You may want to gently stir the solution from time to time., Take the linen out of the soaking solution and rinse it with cold water. Pay special attention to stained part of the garment. Don’t use hot water, as it can permanently set the stain.

, Squeeze out excess moisture without wringing the fabric. Squeezing the liquid out instead of twisting it will help keep the shape of the garment intact. Set it out to dry on a flat surface or hang it on a clothesline.

, If traces of the stain remain, repeat the process by mixing up a fresh soaking solution. You may also want to try another method, such as rubbing alcohol, if the stain is particularly stubborn.

"
"
Apply rubbing alcohol directly to the stain.,
Place a heavy item on top.,
Blot the stain.,
Flush the spot with alcohol.,
Rinse in cold water.,
Air-dry your garment.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Linen3," Alcohol works because it dissolves the pigments in the ink. Be sure to get all parts and edges of the stain. You may want to put cardboard or another material beneath the fabric to ensure it doesn’t bleed through. Cover it with something absorbent like a cotton pad or a thin stack of paper towels.This method may be best for smaller stains, as you only apply the product to the stained area.

, Putting a book or pan on top of the cotton or paper will help it better absorb the stain. Let this sit for up to thirty minutes to allow the alcohol to dissolve the pigments in the ink.

, Don’t rub, or the ink could spread, making a bigger stain. Just gently press down on the stain with a rag or paper towels. Be sure to use a new section after every few blots, or you will end up putting the ink back into your clothing., This will ensure the ink is completely dissolved. You can blot the area again if you see remnants of the ink., Pay special attention to the edges of the stain. Cold water helps remove the stain as well as the alcohol. Don’t use hot water, as this may set the stain.

, You can lay it flat or hang it on a clothesline. Avoid using the clothes dryer, as this could set the stain if it isn’t completely removed as well as damage or shrink the linen.

Make use of hairspray.,
Try using isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol.,
Attack the stain with a magic eraser.,
Use nail-polish remover — the kind that's not acetone-based.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Leather2," Yes, you heard right: hairspray. It may not be the most glamorous cleaning agent (or it may be glammed-out, depending on your perspective), but some ink incapacitators swear by it. Here's what you do in order to try to remove the stain:


Douse a Q-tip or cotton swab thoroughly in hairspray.
Quickly take the Q-tip and attack the spot of the foul.
Apply leather cleaner and conditioner to the spot of the foul afterwards. Because hairspray can dry out leather, causing it to begin cracking, it's important to treat the leather after using this method.
Repeat until the ink stain is removed.

, 70% isopropyl alcohol has worked for some leather owners in the past, although it's probably not a preferred method.Soak a Q-tip or cotton swab with a bit of rubbing alcohol before rubbing it on to the stained leather item. Because alcohol is also a drying agent, be sure to couple this approach with leather cleaner and conditioner afterward. Repeat if necessary.

, Dampen the tip of a magic eraser and then rub it into the stain. Magic erasers contain a material called melamine foam, which helps remove tricky stains.Finish routine by applying a leather conditioner to the spot using a clean towel.

, Some people have succeed at removing ink stains with the help of non acetone-based nail polish removers.Dab a little on a Q-Tip, rub the Q-tip against the stain, and finish with a nice bit of leather cleaner and conditioner to keep the leather from unnecessarily drying out.

Treat your leather on a regular basis with quality protection products, such as leather conditioner.,
Take good care of your leather.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Leather3," Leather conditioners help hydrate your cowhide, leaving it less susceptible to cracking. Some leather conditioners even tout the ability to form a seal over the leather which keeps stains — ink and otherwise — from embedding itself too far into the leather.

, There are plenty of things that you can do to better care for your leather, apart from giving it a good moisturizing bath every now and then. Because ultimately, a better cared-for piece of leather is a cleaner piece of leather. And a cleaner piece of leather is one you'll be less likely to spill ink on.

"
Get a can of hairspray, and spray a small amount directly on the stained area.

,
Leave the hairspray on the stain for about 5 minutes.

,
Use a soft, dry cloth to gently wipe the hairspray from the leather.,
Dampen another piece of cloth.,
Apply leather conditioner to the area using a soft cloth.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Leather Upholstery2,",, Make sure not to rub too hard. The hairspray should start lifting the ink. Repeat the process of spraying and wiping as necessary, until the ink stain is fully removed.

, Wipe the stained area using the damp cloth to remove any remaining stickiness from the hairspray.

, The leather conditioner will allow for moisture to be restored to the leather.

Find the right eraser.,
Rub the stain with your eraser.,
Follow up with a solvent if necessary.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Suede2," It can be an eraser made of rubber, vinyl, or art gum. The important thing is to make sure your eraser is white (or tan if it's made of art gum). Erasers that are dyed bright colors like pink can create an even worse stain.Suede cleaning kits are often sold with a special suede eraser., Press the eraser against the stained suede and rub it just like you were erasing pencil off of paper. Apply strong pressure to the eraser as you rub. Erasers are gentle and unlikely to damage the suede.


Keep going back and forth with the eraser until the stain either is completely lifted or stops getting lighter.
Depending on how badly your suede is stained, this step may take a long time. You may also end up needing to use a second eraser if the first is completely worn down.
Brush off the residue when you're finished., If the stain persists after your eraser stops being effective, you will need to remove the rest of it with a suede-safe solvent:


Soak a soft bristle brush with either rubbing alcohol or white vinegar.
Scrub the stain gently with the brush. To avoid abrading the suede, use only a very light amount of pressure.
For stubborn stains, alternating between rounds of erasing and brushing may give you the best results.
Run a clean toothbrush over the area once the stain has been completely removed. This will help to restore your suede to its proper texture."
"
Seal your suede with a protective coating.,
Mop up excess ink immediately.,
Remove the stain as soon as possible.",How to Remove Ink Stains from Suede3," Because suede is so difficult to clean, it's better to prevent ink stains from happening in the first place. Suede-protecting sprays can be found in most drugstores, leather shops, and shoe stores. Even if the sealant cannot protect your suede completely, it may result in a stain that is lighter and easier to remove compared to an unsealed item.


Be sure to do a spot test with the sealant before coating your entire item. Even products specifically made for suede may still cause discoloration due to variations in manufacturing.Re-seal items every few months.
Brush your item with a suede brush before and after spraying., A universal rule of stain control is to soak up extra liquid before it can spread. Blot the ink with a clean cloth. Do not rub with the cloth by moving it from side-to-side. Instead, pat the spot with up-and-down motions. Be careful not to press down too hard. Rubbing and too much force can push the pigment into your suede, making the stain harder to remove., You should begin stain removal immediately after the ink has dried. The longer you leave the stain, the more difficult it will be to remove. Sometimes stains allowed to set for too long may become permanent.


Unlike many other types of stains, it's more prudent to allow ink stains on suede to dry out before cleaning. The sandpaper and eraser methods will not work on wet ink. Additionally, attempting to clean wet ink using only a solvent may cause the ink to run, spreading the stain."

, After you’ve applied the bleach, pour a little bit of distilled white vinegar on top of the (formally) stained area. This will neutralize the area where you applied the bleach. Basically, it will keep bleach droplets from rising to the surface after you’ve finished cleaning., Use a wet rag to rinse off the area. Scrub for a few minutes to make sure that you’ve removed all of the bleach and vinegar. Then, let the wood dry overnight., This is one of the weaker wood bleaches, but you still might notice some discoloration. Again, don’t panic. Sand down the area and apply a light wood stain. Then, reapply the finish. Your floor should look like new again."

Determine what kind of ink you are dealing with.,
Deal with a mystery stain.,
Read your fabric label.",How to Remove Ball Point Pen Stains from Cotton1," Not all pens that have a ball are actual ""ballpoint"" pens, and different pens use different kinds of ink that must be removed in different ways. Traditional ballpoint pens (like the ubiquitous Bic and Paper Mate) use a fast-drying, oil-based ink that requires a solvent to remove. Rollerball pens, on the other hand, (common manufacturers include Uni-Ball and Pilot), use water-based inks that are fairly easy to remove, while gel pens use a highly-pigmented type of ink that can be a bit more difficult.If you have the offending pen, go to the website of any online office supply store and search for the name/model of the pen. The product description will tell you if it is a ballpoint, rollerball, or gel pen.
You can also check the pen manufacturer's website for more information, and product-specific ink-removal instructions.;
, If you do not have the pen and don't know what kind it was, first try the method for removing ballpoint ink. If that doesn't work, move on to the method for rollerball ink, and finally, the method for gel ink. Rinse the garment thoroughly between each treatment, but do not put it in the dryer until the stain is gone!

, If your garment is machine-washable, as most cotton garments are, you should be safe treating your stain at home. If your garment is dry-clean or hand-wash only, you are better off taking it to your neighborhood dry-cleaner for assistance. The cost to have a shirt laundered is usually under $5, and you will save a lot of time and hassle.


Be sure to tell the dry cleaner what kind of pen caused the stain, or better yet, put the pen in a plastic bag to prevent further staining, and bring it with you.

Find a suitable solvent around your home.,
Place the stained garment on an absorbent surface.,
Apply your alcohol-based solvent of choice.,
Wait 3-5 minutes.,
Blot the stain.,
Repeat the treatment as needed.,
Wash the stained area using detergent.",How to Remove Ball Point Pen Stains from Cotton2," The most fabric-friendly way to remove an oil-based ink stain is with Ethanol (Ethyl alcohol,) which is a common ingredient in many household products. Rubbing alcohol, hairspray (preferably aerosol, not alcohol-free), or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer are all great choices.


Prepackaged hand-wipes and some brands of baby wipes will also do the trick in a pinch.

, You can use a dry white (bleachable) towel, or several layers of paper towels or napkins. This will give the ink somewhere to go. Make sure that only one layer of fabric is resting on the towel, otherwise, you risk spreading the stain to another part of the garment, as well.

, If you are using rubbing alcohol, soak a cotton ball in it, and dab it liberally onto the stain. If you are using hand sanitizer, squirt some out and rub it into the stain using a cotton ball or your fingers. If you are using hairspray, spray it on until the fabric is saturated. .If you are using a wipe, blot the fabric firmly, trying to really squeeze the solvent into the stain. You can also leave the wipe on the fabric, and place something heavy on top of it (like a dinner plate weighted with a book, or can of food) for several minutes.

, The solvent may need a few minutes to break down the oils in the ink, depending on how strong it is, and how long the stain has been there.


Alcohol-based products can dry out quickly, so dab/spray more on as needed to keep the stained-area damp long enough for the ink to break down.

, Use a clean, dry cloth to blot the stain. You want to try to press the ink out of your garment, into the blotting cloth and the absorbent surface underneath. Most, if not all of the ink should come away readily at this point.

, If you were able to remove most of the ink using your alcohol solvent, you are on the right track! If some ink remains, move the garment to a clean part of the towel, or put some new paper towels down under it. Apply a bit more solvent, wait, and then blot it once more.

, If there is just a bit of ink remaining, or you think you got it all but want to make sure, apply a small amount of your normal laundry soap or to the affected area. Let it soak in for a few minutes. Then rub the fabric together to agitate it, and rinse it thoroughly under warm water.


If the stain is completely gone, you can launder the shirt as usual.
If the stain is not gone, repeat the above method, or try one of the methods for other types of ink.

Repeat the previous two steps, if needed.,
Launder the garment using your normal detergent.",How to Remove Ball Point Pen Stains from Cotton3," Skim milk works best. There is no need to soak the entire garment, just the portion that is stained. Wait at least half an hour, and then scrub the stain gently with a toothbrush, cuticle brush or similar soft-bristled brush, and rinse thoroughly with warm water., Mix the bleach powder with a small amount of water to form a thin paste. Rub this paste into the stained area, and let it sit for 1/2 to 1 hour. Then scrub the stain with a soft-bristled brush, and rinse thoroughly with warm water.


Your stain should be entirely, or at least mostly gone at this point.

, If the stain is responding to the above methods but is not quite gone, then repeat the previous two steps. If it is not responding, rinse the garment thoroughly, and try either the method for removing gel ink stains, or the method for removing ballpoint ink stains.

, Inspect it thoroughly before placing it in the dryer. If the stain is not 100% gone, continue treating it until it is. The heat of the dryer will set any remaining ink and make the stain permanent.

Hand-wash with soap or regular detergent right away.,
Treat the stain with ammonia.,
Treat the stain with an alcohol and vinegar solution.,
Experiment with other methods.",How to Remove Ball Point Pen Stains from Cotton4," Gel ink manufacturers all confess that removing gel ink can be difficult, if not impossible, due to the highly-pigmented nature of the ink. Your best bet is to get the stain out as quickly as possible using an all-purpose cleaner. Add a small amount of your normal detergent, stain removal gel, or even liquid hand soap directly to the stain, and rinse thoroughly with running water. Then try to blot out any remaining ink by pressing the fabric between two absorbent cloths, or stacks of napkins or paper towels., Dissolve 1 teaspoon of household ammonia in warm water. Soak the garment in the ammonia solution for 1 hour. Rinse thoroughly, then hand-wash with your normal detergent, scrubbing the stain with a soft brush, if needed.If the stain is responding to this treatment, repeat as needed until the ink is gone, and launder as usual.
If the ink is not coming out, continue on to the next step.
NEVER mix ammonia with chlorine bleach.

, Mix 1 cup of rubbing alcohol with cup of vinegar. Place the garment on a clean dry towel, and apply the solution to the stained area with a rag or a spray bottle until the fabric is thoroughly saturated. Allow the solution to soak in for at least 5 minutes, then pour a small amount of table salt over the stained area. Wait 10 more minutes, and then scrub the stain with a soft brush, and rinse with hot water.


If this method removed some, but not all of the ink, repeat until the stain is gone.

, Gel ink formulas differ, and while some simply can't be removed, others may respond to alternative treatment options. If the above methods didn't work, you can always try the methods for removing ballpoint or rollerball ink. Just make sure to rinse the garment very thoroughly between experiments to avoid mixing chemicals. You might get lucky, or you might have to learn to live with your newly-enhanced garment.

, The solvent acetone will cause the pen ink to break down and dissolve, similar to rubbing alcohol. It is also highly flammable like alcohol, and the vapors can be toxic in large amounts, so use in a well-ventilated area.








Acetone can be very harsh on your skin, so use it sparingly and be sure to rinse your arm with soap and water and moisturize afterwards.

, The alcohol in hand sanitizer will break down and loosen the pen. Wipe the area with a clean cloth and the ink will wipe off with the sanitizer.








The amount of alcohol in hand sanitizer varies. Look for one that is 60%-90% alcohol., Vinegar contains the acetic acid,which is an effective solvent that can dissolve oil and many other compounds.

Water-based inks tend to seep through paper and take longer to dry, so they are more likely to smear and get on your skin.Roller ball pens and some gel pens are usually water soluble., It will be kind of gross and may get messy, but the oils in these products will help dissolve the oil contained in the ink. Dissolving the ink will bring it to a liquid state, and when you clean off the butter or shortening with a dry paper towel, the ink should start to come off.


This same principal means that oils like coconut oil, baby oil, or olive oil will also help dissolve the ink. Pour some oil onto a paper towel and use it to scrub off the ink.

, Toothpaste contains baking soda, which will pull the ink off the surface of your skin.The toothpaste may cause your skin to tingle. Use a damp cloth or water to rinse off.

They might be able to clean dye stains caused by blue jeans dye, newspaper print, fresh ballpoint ink, paint, shoe polish, and permanent marker from leather.

, Leather is a sensitive material. In order to avoid damaging your leather, read manufacturer directions carefully before utilizing any cleaning product on your leather. Do not use your leather cleaning product in a way that is not recommended.All products intended to remove dye from leather are a bit different. It is therefore impossible to give specific directions regarding use. Generally, though, you’ll need to apply a bit of the cleaning product to a rag, then wipe the dye away using the rag.
Some products might direct you to scrub the leather with steel wool, a horsehair brush, or sandpaper after applying the dye-removal product.

, Before you commit to a particular dye removal product, test it on your leather object in an out-of-sight spot. For instance, if you’re cleaning a leather jacket, don’t wipe the product across the arms and back of the jacket. If the cleaning product has an adverse reaction with your leather jacket, you will ruin the whole jacket.Instead, test the cleaning product on a small portion of the jacket that will not be regularly seen. For example, you might wipe the product on a small area on the inside of the jacket and observe its effect.

Spray a small amount of window cleaner on the stain, enough to dampen it gently, then apply about a teaspoon of peanut butter on the stain and let it sit for several minutes. Wipe up the mixture thoroughly with a clean rag and go about rinsing the upholstery more thoroughly.

, Whatever you've used to remove the ink from the leather upholstery, you need to take steps to remove excess moisture from the area. Make sure to wipe down the area thoroughly with a very slightly damp cloth, and go back over the area with a dry towel to extract any excess moisture.

, This will help prevent future stains and seal some added moisture into the leather to prevent it from cracking over time. It's essential that you treat your leather seats with conditioner immediately after removing the stain.


Use a clean, soft, cotton towel and apply a small dab of leather conditioner to the affected area.

Move the object when possible.,
Provide ventilation.,
Remove or cover nearby items.,
Lay down protective sheeting.,
Protect yourself.,
Choose a chemical stripper.,
Brush, spray, or roll on the chemical stripping agent.,
Let the stripping agent dwell.,
Scrape off the paint.,
Scrub and rinse the area.,
Sand the area.,
Dust and clean.",How to Strip Paint," Removing paint is messy business, and if the object you're stripping is small enough, move it to an outdoor or semi-outdoor location before starting. This could be a patio, driveway, outdoor work area, or even an open shed or garage.


Moving the item is ideal for small furniture, doors, fixtures, and other portable items.;
, Sometimes it’s not possible to move the object you're painting, either because the item is too large or not portable, or because the weather won’t allow it. When you can't move the item outside, open windows, open vents, and turn on fans to provide plenty of fresh air in your workspace.This applies when you're working with large and heavy furniture, walls, and other items that cannot be moved.

, Paint stripping requires you to scrape and sand, and this produces a lot of dust. If you aren't able to move your item from its position, remove other objects from the room to protect them. This includes furniture, pictures, decorations, rugs, and any other furniture or items that may be in the room.Cover anything that can't be removed with a protective 6-mil plastic sheet. Tape the sheet in place so dust can't seep under.

, Protect the floor around the object you're stripping with 6-mil plastic sheeting. Use painter’s tape to tape the sheet in place. This will prevent chemical stripper, paint, and dust from damaging the floor below.


For a small object, spread out the sheet and place the item on top. For a large or immobile object, cover the ground around the object with the sheet.
Make sure you have an extra 6 feet (1.8 m) of plastic around the object.If you're stripping walls, cover the entire floor area with the sheeting and tape the plastic to the baseboards.

, Chemical paint strippers, paint, and dust are dangerous to breathe in, and you don’t want these things on your skin or in your eyes. Wear personal protective gear anytime your stripping paint, and this includes:Chemical-resistant gloves, such as green nitrile or black butyl rubber
Wrap-around safety glasses
Long sleeves and pants
Respirator outfitted with cartridge for paint strippers, especially if you're working indoors

, There are many types of paint strippers on the market, and they’re all good for different surfaces and areas. The chemical stripper you choose will depend on the object you're stripping (such as a wall versus furniture), how many layers of paint you're dealing with, and how old the paint is.Citrus-based strippers like CitriStrip are more environmentally friendly than their traditional counterparts. These strippers are generally good for up to four layers of paint at a time, and are ideal for flat surfaces and some furniture.
Pastes like SmartStrip and Peel Away 1 are ideal for tough jobs, and can even be used on uneven surfaces like brick. These types of strippers can remove up to 30 layers of paint at once, and require less scraping than other chemical stripper types. This type of stripper isn't great for furniture, as it can stain.
Some paint removers contain methylene chloride, which is an old, effective, and fast-acting chemical stripper. While this chemical agent is good for most surfaces and jobs, it is very caustic and releases a large amount of volatile organic compounds.

, Chemical paint strippers come in liquid, paste, and gel forms. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding exact application quantities and techniques. Gel strippers like CitriStrip can be applied with a brush or roller. Pastes like SmartStrip and Peel Away 1 should be applied with a trowel. Liquids can be brushed or rolled on.


For two-part systems like Peel Away 1, apply the paper provided after you’ve coated the surface with the stripping agent.
For fast-acting strippers like methylene chloride, work in small areas if you're removing paint from a large surface, otherwise the stripping agent will dry. Apply the stripping agent to a small surface, let it dwell, scrape off the paint, and then move on to a new area., Dwelling time is the amount of time a chemical stripping agent must stay on a surface to properly soften and dissolve the paint. For most chemical strippers that contain methylene chloride, the dwell time is only 20 to 30 minutes.The dwell time for Smart Strip is between three and 24 hours.
The dwell time for CitriStrip is between 30 minutes and 24 hours.
The dwell time for Peel Away 1 is between 12 and 24 hours.
After the minimum time, you can begin testing a small patch to see if the paint will scrape off. If the paint isn't ready, give the product more time and then test again.

, Once the chemical paint stripper has had time to soften and dissolve the paint, you'll be able to scrape the paint off the wall. Start at a section of bubbling paint and use a plastic paint scraper to get under the peeling paint. Hold the scraper at a slight angle out from the wall and push it under the paint to scrape it off.For two-part systems like Peel Away 1, you don’t need to scrape or scrub. Instead, just peel off the paper layer and most of the paint will come with it.

, Once you’ve scraped away the paint and stripper, you'll have to rinse the area to clean it. The scrubbing and rinsing method depends on the type of paint remover you’ve used:For Peel Away 1, scrub the surface with a wet nylon brush to remove residue. Leave the surface to dry, and then spray it with the neutralizing solution Citri-Lize. Scrub the area with a nylon brush, rinse with water, and allow to dry.
For SmartStrip, scrub the residue with water and a nylon brush. Rinse the area with a damp cloth and allow to dry.
For CitriStrip, scrub the area with mineral spirits and a scratch-free abrasive pad.

, Sanding will remove dust, dirt, and any paint or chemical stripper that’s been left behind. Use a fine-grit sandpaper. For small surfaces, sand the area by hand or use a sanding block. For larger surfaces, use an orbital sander to make the work more efficient.


For wood surfaces, sand in the same direction as the wood grain to avoid swirl marks., Use a damp rag or lint-free cloth to wipe down the entire surface that you’ve sanded. This will remove dust, paint, and chemical particles.Rinse the cloth often if you're working with a large surface. After cleaning, let the surface dry. Vacuum the area to remove any leftover dust.


Once you’ve finished, you can paint or refinish the surface you just stripped.

Use rubbing alcohol.,
Try peroxide.,
Draw over the old marks with a dry erase marker.,
Apply neutral shoe polish.",How to Erase Old Marks off a Dry Erase Board1," Wet a sponge with alcohol and rub it into the stain. Dry the board with a clean dry cloth. Use 99% or 90% isopropyl rubbing alcohol for the best results.








You can put rubbing alcohol directly on a paper towel or tissue and rub that on the old marks.
Many hand sanitizers contain rubbing alcohol. Rub them directly on the old marks and wipe off of the board.
For tough stains, rub few drops of isopropyl alcohol around with your finger on the old marks. Use enough alcohol to leave a thin layer. Allow it to sit for a few seconds and then wipe dry.;
, Pour some peroxide directly on the old marks. Wipe the peroxide off with a cloth or paper towel. You might need to rub the board again with a clean cloth or paper towel to fully remove the marks.








, Slowly and carefully draw over what you want to erase with a dry erase marker. A dark-colored marker will work most effectively. You might need to repeat this several times.








Erase what you've written over as you normally would.
This will work well to erase permanent marker from the dry erase board.

, Rub neutral (no color) shoe polish onto the old marks. Buff the polish off with a clean cloth. Shoe polish provides a smooth, like-new surface.

Get a tube of regular toothpaste.,
Turn the piece of wood so that the stain is facing up.,
Squeeze a generous amount of toothpaste onto the surface of the wood.,
Dampen a washcloth.,
Rub the toothpaste in.,
Wipe away any remaining toothpaste.,
Clean up your work area.,
Add baking soda if any marker stain remains.",How to Remove Marker from Wood1," You want basic white toothpaste. Not gel, whitening paste, or anything with abrasive crystals in it. The traditional white paste will do the trick without damaging the wood.Sometimes rubbing alcohol or peanut butter can be used in place of toothpaste to remove marker stains, but toothpaste is usually more effective.;
, You want to make sure the spot you’re removing is accessible and flat, so that the toothpaste doesn’t run down the surface while you’re trying to rub it in.

, Make sure your marker stain is covered with a thick layer of toothpaste. You can apply more later if you don’t have enough., Grab a clean washcloth and hold it under running water. Any temperature that’s comfortable to you is fine. Once the washcloth is soaked, squeeze any excess water so that it’s damp and not dripping wet.

, Using a circular motion, rub the toothpaste into the marker spot for three to five minutes or until most of the toothpaste disappears.Apply enough pressure that your toothpaste can penetrate the marker, but not so much pressure that you’re going to damage the finish on your wood.
Add more toothpaste if the washcloth doesn’t move freely over the entire surface of the marker stain.

, Using your damp washcloth, wipe off any toothpaste that’s still left on the wood. Make sure you wipe in the direction of the wood grain, not against it. The wood will dry and any toothpaste should be gone., Your marker stain should be removed. All you have to do now is clean up your area. Put away your toothpaste, dispose of your washcloth to be cleaned, and replace your wooden object if it’s movable.

, Repeat the previous steps, but add an equal amount of baking soda (for the amount of toothpaste) to your stain. This will add abrasion so use caution when you’re rubbing the mixture into the wood.


If the baking soda doesn't work, follow the same steps using rubbing alcohol or peanut butter. Be sure to wipe away the alcohol or peanut butter with a damp washcloth, then let the wood dry before cleaning up.

Use toothpaste.,
Spray hairspray on the marks.,
Try muscle cream.,
Clean the marks with acetone (nail polish remover).",How to Erase Old Marks off a Dry Erase Board2," Rub ordinary white toothpaste onto marks on the board. Wipe clean. Toothpaste contains a very mild abrasive and is water soluble.








This method will also remove permanent marker marks from most smooth, non-porous surfaces.
Any brand will work.

, Spray a light film of hairspray on the old marks. Let it soak in for a couple of minutes, then wipe off with a paper towel or cotton rag. Clean off any residual stickiness with soap and water.









You can also clean off old marks with spray deodorant.

, Clean the old marks with a muscle cream like Ben-Gay. This removes permanent marker stains with only a few wipes. Muscle cream is less abrasive than toothpaste, and it contains alcohol, which makes it a great cleaning agent.







, Pour a generous amount of acetone on a sponge or paper towel. Wipe a section of the board. Repeat the process in the same section of the board using more acetone on a new paper towel. Wipe the board clean with a dry paper towel.









Acetone is combustible. Dispose of the paper towels responsibly.

Use vinegar and water.,
Make a paste with baking soda and water.,
Rub the old marks with coffee grounds.,
Smear margarine on the old marks.,
Clean the board with car wax.",How to Erase Old Marks off a Dry Erase Board3," Combine vinegar and water to make a cleaning solution. Wipe or spray it on the old marks. Next, wipe the board with a clean paper towel.








The ratio of vinegar to water should be 1 tsp (4.9 mL) vinegar to 8 oz. (236.5 mL) water.

, Add a small amount of water to baking soda. Rub the paste into the old marks on the board. Thoroughly wipe the paste off with a damp cloth or paper towel. This works well on marks made by permanent marker.








, Rub damp coffee grounds on the board. They are mildly abrasive and will remove the marks without damaging your board. Clean the board thoroughly after using the grounds. This will prevent the board from turning brownish., Massage margarine onto the board. You will notice that the margarine will slowly change to the color of the old marks. This shows it is working. Wipe the margarine away with paper towel.

Be sure to remove all of the margarine so it doesn’t prevent writing on the board.
If the stain is more than a year old, put some plastic wrap over the margarine and wait 24 hours before wiping the board clean.

, Apply car wax to the marks in circular motions. Wipe the wax off with a clean cloth. This method is very good for removing the most stubborn stains. Car wax conditions the board and leaves the surface like-new.









Another good solution from the garage is WD-40. It also lubricates and conditions the board.

Gather your materials.,
Turn the piece of wood so that the marked surface is accessible.,
Spray the abrasive or enzyme cleaner onto the surface of the wood.,
Wipe off the marker stain with a damp washcloth.,
Soak a washcloth in rubbing alcohol.",How to Remove Marker from Wood2," Removing the marker stain will be easier if you have all your materials ready and accessible before you start. You’re going to need:


A mild abrasive cleaner or enzyme cleaner. You can get these at any big box store (like Walmart) or most supermarkets.
Rubbing alcohol. You can also get this at most supermarkets or big box stores.
A damp washcloth. Hold a clean washcloth under running water and squeeze out the excess water.

, You want to make sure the spot you’re cleaning is facing up so that the cleaner doesn’t run down the surface of the wood.

, Make sure you cover the entire area of the marker stain.Let the cleaner sit for a two to three minutes., Wipe in a circular motion until you remove the stain. This may take a few minutes. Rinse any remaining cleaner from the wood using a clean corner of your damp washcloth., If the stain is still there after using cleaner, soak your washcloth in rubbing alcohol. Wipe the alcohol-soaked washcloth over the stained area a few times, then rinse."

Wipe the marker stain away using a baby wipe.,
Sand the area with 80-grit sandpaper.,
Sand the area with 100-grit sandpaper.,
Stain or treat the wood with finish.",How to Remove Marker from Wood3," First, try to rub a baby wipe on the area where the marker has stained the wood. Make sure to rub with the grain, not against it. The alcohol in the baby wipe may remove most of the marker stain.

, You’ll first sand the marked area with 80-grit sandpaper. This should remove most of the stain, but will leave some abrasive pattern behind on your wood. Make sure to sand with the grain of the wood, not against it.

, Go over the same spot with 100-grit sandpaper until the entire stain is gone. Again, sand with the grain of the wood, not against it. This should smooth out the area and blend it with the rest of the wood., Staining or finishing the wood will protect it from future marker damage. You can get wood stain at any home improvement or big box store.

Buy a gel based paint stripper such as CitriStrip.,
Grab gloves specific for paint stripping.,
Begin the process by a ritual of cleaning it up with tsp solution.,
So put on the gloves, lay down some plastic sheeting (make sure it's not plastic bag thin), we want to ensure quality effort is being put forth, place your project upon and start by adding some of the gel solution into a metal cup/ bowl.,
After you've taken your social break get back to work by using the scraper to remove the bubbled paint.,
Now, clean up the piece by washing it rinsing it through with mineral spirits, the no odor kind, and use the appropriate steel wool to do this.

",How to Strip Latex Paint from Wood," It is non-toxic. The benefits it gives you include the ability to work at any hour of the day, tolerable aroma, and ease of knowing you're not going to cause a disaster. This stuff is so safe you can strip in your own bedroom if you wish. It's a great option because who wants to work outside when you can't be certain what the weather is like? And how many of us have obligations during the day? Tons, so the chances of you working on a special project means you're likely to squeeze it in when you find the time. Plus the texture of being gel like means way better ease of clean and application. It isn't runny so if you have a piece of furniture standing vertical it's going to work.;
, Not the usual latex kind. Just a step above them. Don't forget to invest in a good quality paint scrapper tool. They cost about $6 for a good one, and the bonus is this tool can do like 5 jobs in one. Like cleaning up paint tools, puttying, and so forth. Wanna make sure you do a complete job? Add a paint stripper scrubber. It's super cheap and a great solution for when you come to areas where you need extra elbow grease, as you don't want to damage the material by exerting too much pressure. Don't forget a good paint brush to apply the gel but expect to dispose of it, because without a good drive to clean it quickly and efficiently, like with no odor mineral spirits it's going to be stained orange and the bristles will become stiff. You'll need to keep no odor mineral spirits available to cleanse the piece after it's been stripped. It's the best way to remove any lingering traces of the solution.

, Tsp is great for removing grease and other dirt which can't be seen but is most likely there. You'll be happy you did so. Plus your going to so much of the effort to do it right the first time so adding this extra 5 min isn't worth skipping.

, Then apply in thick long strokes. After the areas you desire to strip have been applied, give it at least 45 min. The product recommends checking after 30 min, but an extra 15 min is well worth it because when stripping layers of paint you really never know how many layers you're taking off. You'll notice the creepy bubbling and skin like texture change indicating great progress.

, Some places you'll get lucky and get right down to the raw material, others you may need to focus into. Any spots not removed take some gel stripper onto the scrubber and rough it up a bit. You'll get it.

Wipe up the spilled paint.,
Use damp paper towels.,
Mix mild soap and water.,
Use a cloth with rubbing alcohol.,
Repeat if necessary.",How to Remove Paint from Vinyl1," Use a dry paper towel or soft cloth to remove as much of the fresh spillage as possible. Wipe it up until there is nothing else you can by simple wiping. If the spill is large, you can contain it with cat litter or shredded paper., After you’ve wiped up with dry paper towels, use damp paper towels to tackle the rest of the spilled paint. Go over the spilled area until as much of the paint has been removed as possible. The damp paper towels should remove most of the paint.You will have to go through several damp paper towels if the spill is large.

, To remove the remainder of the paint, mix several drops of mild soap into a bucket of water. Then, dip a clean cloth into the mixture. Use the cloth to clean up the rest of the spilled paint., If the paint has still not been removed, pour rubbing alcohol on a soft cloth and gently rub it over the paint. Press the cloth on the stain and allow it remain for ten minutes if the stain has not been removed. Then, remove the cloth and rinse the area with water.Make sure the area is dry after you rinse it off. You can dry it off by patting it with a cloth or paper towel.

, The paint may not be removed completely on the first try. Repeat the process as many times as necessary until all of the spilled paint has been removed from the floor. Avoid using alcohol too many times on the floor, but you can use water and mild soap as much as needed."

Wipe up wet paint.,
Soften dried paint with water.,
Soften the dried paint with heat.,
Scrape off as much paint as possible.,
Perform a solvent test.,
Use a solvent.",How to Remove Paint on Hardwood Floors," If the paint has recently spilled and is still wet, use a damp cloth or a damp paper towel to clean up and collect the spilled paint.


Hopefully, if you catch the paint before it dries, it won’t have time to make any hard to remove markings on your floors.;
, Once paint dries, it can be a little harder to remove. Try using warm water and a mild soap mixture to soften the paint marking. Create this water and soap mixture in a small bowl, and dip a section of a rag into the mixture. Wring out the rag, and rub on the paint with the warm, damp rag until the paint starts to loosen.Don’t use large amounts of water to try and soften the paint. Water can cause serious damage to hardwood floors by making the wood swell.
This water and soap step works best for latex paint spills, but will likely be ineffective for oil-based paint spills.

, Tougher paint spills, like oil-based paint spills, may require some heat to loosen the paint. Use a hair dryer on its highest heat setting to warm and soften the paint. Hold the hair dryer a few inches away from the floor and keep it on the paint spill for about 20 seconds.Although heat guns can be used to do the same job of warming up the paint, using a hair dryer is a more gentle way of warming up the paint.

, Use a plastic putty knife to push and scrape at the edges of the paint spill. The putty knife’s tapered edge will help to run across the flat surface of the floor, and get underneath the paint. This step may prove to be easier when first softening the paint with either warm water or direct heat.


Be very careful with your scraping tool. Some metal scrapers have such sharp edges, that one wrong move could leave a knick in your flooring. Plastic scrapers may prove me be a bit gentler while still being efficient.

, If the paint still isn’t lifting from your hardwood floors, you may have to use a solvent. Common solvents used to remove paint include nail polish remover, rubbing alcohol, paint thinner, and mineral spirits. This step is usually a last resort, since some solvents can take off finishing from hardwood floors. Before you apply one of these solvents to your floor, test a small, inconspicuous area of your floor by applying a tiny bit of the solvent to a Q-Tip, rubbing the Q-Tip on the hardwood floor, and see how it reacts to the floor finishing.Be sure to wear protective gloves when handling these solvents. Some could cause serious skin damage. Also be sure that the area you’re working in is well ventilated with open windows and fans. These solvents give off dangerous fumes.
If any of the solvents take off the floor finishing, try to avoid using them.
You also may want to wait some time after performing the test to let the solvent test areas dry, and see if there is any visible difference in the coloring or texture of the wood.

, Once you have found a solvent that won’t damage your floor (or if you don’t care about the floor finishing being damage because you’re going to redo the floors anyway), slightly dampen a small area of a rag with your chosen solvent, and rub it onto the paint stain until the paint dissolves away.Use another dry area of the rag to wipe the area dry once the paint is removed.

Apply vegetable oil, baby oil, or cooking spray to the paint.,
Rub the paint off your skin.,
Wash your skin with hand soap.,
Use a pumice soap for pesky patches.",How to Remove Spray Paint1," First, soak a cotton ball in the oil of your choice. Use the cotton ball to liberally dab your skin with the oil. If you use cooking spray, you can just spray it directly on your skin., Rub vigorously, but not so hard that you hurt your skin. The paint should start to thin out almost immediately.If you have trouble, try scrubbing the area with a washcloth. A washcloth also will come in handy if you’ve spray painted skin that’s not easy to clean in a sink, like your feet.  

, Once you’ve thinned out the spray paint, grab some hand soap, lather the area, and rinse. This will wash away the residual spray paint and oil.Try washing with hand soap at least twice if your hands are still oily or if any traces of spray paint remain.

, If oil didn’t remove all of the spray paint, you can try a pumice liquid soap, pumice bar soap, or pumice bar. Any method of using pumice should work, but be cautious with pumice if you have sensitive skin.


Pumice soaps are typically used to remove grease and grit from jobs like car maintenance. Pumice bars are often used to clean feet. You can find pumice products at your local convenience or drug store.

Blot up the excess wet paint.,
Spray area with a stain remover.Wet paint can be targeted swiftly with the right kind of applicable stain remover.,
Rub the area with a dry cloth.",How to Remove Spray Paint from Clothes1," If you've caught the stain at an early point, you're in luck. Paint stains become much harder to clean if they're allowed to dry. Water-based paints like spray paint may be reduced considerable by putting it in the sink and blotting up the paint with a paper towel. When one area of paper towel has been blotted up quickly move to a new area of towel to keep the blotting going.


Blotting is important to do before you get to any rubbing. If you rub before you blot, the paint will just get pushed deeper into the fabric, spreading it around.;
, The type of stain remover you use will depend on the type of spray paint it is. Consult the can and check if you're still unsure.


Water-based paint can be eased out with a dab of dish soap and some committed scrubbing.
Turpentine, WD-40 or even hairspray can be used to treat oil-based stains.However, spray paint tends to be acrylic, so it should be approached as a water-based paint while it's still wet.

, With the right spray in place, the chemicals can do their work. It's up to you to make sure they get around. Rubbing a dry cloth up against the affected area will give the paint somewhere to soak up into. Continue rubbing the area, and don't be afraid to get rough with your rubbing.If one area of your cloth gets too saturated, move onto the next.


It is obviously preferable that the dry cloth in question isn't one that you would care much if it got discoloured.
Repeat the process until you've removed as much paint as you're reasonably going to. Don't be surprised if you're not able to get all of it out. Every smidgen of paint soaked out makes the existing stain less apparent.

Use cotton balls to dipped in oil to get tricky areas.,
Try rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover if you're still struggling.,
Rinse off your hands with soap and water.",How to Remove Paint from Skin1," Simply wash off as much as you can, working lightly. Don't worry if some of it doesn't come off at first -- this is just to help you use less oil later on. Always start with soap and water -- many water and latex paints will come completely free with simple hand washing.The earlier you can get to the paint, the better. Once it has dried it will be a little trickier to remove.;
, Mineral oil is the best cleaner since it works effectively on both oil, water, and latex-based paints. Pour just enough on your skin to cover the entire painted area. Lightly rub it on, then leave it for 2-3 minutes to soak in.









Any vegetable oil will work here, in a pinch, including coconut, flax seed, olive, etc.

, Using your fingertips, rub the baby oil into the painted part of your skin, and gently scratch off as much of the paint as you can. You can just use your hands, working in small circles to massage the oil into the paint and remove it.








, If you have an old washcloth, you could use this as well, though it may get stained. You just want something a little rougher to scrub your skin. Scrub lightly in circles to remove tricky bits of paint.








, Saturate the cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and use it to get at any stains that don't respond well to the mineral oil. Some people have had success with make-up remover as well.









Alcohol will dry your skin out if left for too long. Use a moisturizer once you're done to prevent cracking or flaking.

, Once you've got everything off, use soap and water to remove the oil and smell of alcohol.









If you still can't get the paint off, you're likely using a stronger oil-based paint. You can attack it directly using other oils and cleansers.

Do this until you can’t remove any more paint with only the damp cloth., After you’ve wiped up as much paint as possible, pour rubbing alcohol onto a cloth. Place the cloth on top of the area with the spilled paint. You may have to use multiple cloths if the area is large. Allow the cloth to sit on top of the paint for ten minutes. Then, wipe it up with a damp cloth., If the paint has not been removed, you can use steel wool and liquid wax to remove the paint. Liquid wax can be bought at many car shops and supermarkets, like Walmart. The steel wool should be superfine, and it can be bought from most grocery stores. Dip the steel wool into the liquid wax and gently scrub the surface until the paint is removed., Once the paint has been removed, you will need to remove all of the cleaning products from the vinyl. Use mild soap and water to clean the area. You can dip a rag into the soap and water, or you can use a mop. Then, allow the floor to dry.You can apply a coat of wax to protect the floor once it has dried.

, If nothing else works to remove the paint, you can use a product called PEC-12. It’s a commercial solvent that is highly effective in removing oil stains, but but it is highly toxic. Make sure to use gloves, a face mask, and eye protection when using it. Apply PEC-12 to the damaged area and use a non-abrasive wipe or cotton balls to wipe off the paint. Then, rinse with water and pat it dry with a cloth.PEC-12 can be purchased online and at many camera supply shops because it is often used to clean cameras.

Pour vegetable oil into a dish.Measure out enough vegetable oil to cover the primer stain on your skin and pour it into a small dish.,
Mix in a few drops of lemon essential oil.Squeeze three drops of lemon oil into the vegetable oil.,
Apply the mixture to the spot.,
Wash away the residue with soap and water.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Remove Primer1,"


Most primers are oil-based, so plain water won't be effective against them. As oil-based products, though, they are oil-soluble and can usually be lifted with the use of additional oil.
A little will go a long way, so you may only need 1 to 3 Tbsp (15 to 45 ml), even when you need to remove a large primer spot.
Vegetable oil isn't your only option, either. Most cooking oil will work just as well. Try using coconut oil, olive oil, or canola oil if all-purpose vegetable oil isn't available.;
, Mix the two oils together using your finger or a plastic spoon.


This step is not strictly necessary, and you should be able to remove primer from your skin with only vegetable oil and no essential oil. The lemon oil can make the process slightly more effective, though, since the mild acid in the lemon oil can help cut through the primer without harming your skin.

, Pour the oil mixture directly over the primer spot on your skin. Use your fingers to scrub the area until you see the oil mixture turn white.


The oil mixture will turn white when it has picked up most of the white primer.
You could also use a clean rag to apply the oil mixture and scrub away the primer, but be prepared to sacrifice the rag since you won't be able to remove the primer from the cloth if it stains.

, Rinse away the whitened oil mixture, then wash the spot thoroughly with soap and water.


The soap should help attract any additional oil-based residue left behind from the primer and the oil-based cleanser.
Scrub well until you no longer feel any oil on your hands. Rinse once more, then dry your hands.

, Usually, most of the primer will be gone after a single round of scrubbing with this oil-based cleanser. If some stubborn stains still remain, though, simply go through the process again to remove them.

Flush away excess wet paint.,
Spray the stain with hairspray.,
Rub the stain with a dry cloth.,
Run the item in the washing machine on a cool setting.",How to Remove Spray Paint2," You’ll have the most success removing spray paint from fabric if you can treat it while it’s still wet. If you’ve simply dusted fabric with spray paint or if it’s dried, you can just start cleaning it. However, if it’s soaked with wet paint, you’ll want to run it under cold water to flush out as much paint as possible.Hold an article of clothing until the water starts to run clear.
If you’re dealing with a carpet or upholstery stain, blot the affected area with a cold, damp cloth or towel.

, Hairspray contains alcohol, which breaks down the paint’s bonds. You can also use other alcohol-based treatments, like nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol. Test by applying the cleaner to an inconspicuous area, then spray the affected area liberally., Once you’ve saturated the area with an alcohol-based cleaner, rub it down with a dry cloth. You should start to see some of the pigment transfer from the fabric to the cloth. If necessary (such as for thick layers of paint), repeat spraying and rubbing the area.If you’re dealing with carpet or upholstery, keep spraying and rubbing until you’ve removed the stain and dried the fabric.

, If you’re dealing with an article of clothing, you can machine wash it once you’ve started to break down the paint’s bonds. Check the garment’s label to ensure it’s marked safe for machine washing. Apply a pre-wash stain remover, and run it through the washing machine on a cool setting.Be sure to use a cool setting, since warm or hot water will set the stain.
If a stain still remains, let the garment air dry, then repeat the spraying, rubbing, and washing process. If repeating the process doesn’t work, take the garment to your professional dry cleaner.

Apply paint stripping gel to the painted surface.,
Cover the gel with plastic wrap.,
Use a pressure washer to remove the gel.,
Apply masonry cleaner to porous surfaces after stripping.",How to Remove Spray Paint3," Purchase a solvent gel marked “paint and varnish stripper” to remove spray paint from masonry or stone walls. Put on a pair of protective gloves and use a paintbrush to apply a thick layer of the gel onto the spray painted surface.Be sure to test the stripper in an inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire affected surface., If you’re treating items like a decorative object or piece of furniture, wrap it completely in plastic. If you’re removing spray paint from a wall, cover the area with plastic. Make sure the plastic wrap tightly covers all areas where you’ve applied the gel., You can remove the gel once you see the surface start to warp and wrinkle, or after about four hours. Pressure wash with cold water at a setting less than 300 psi. Hold the nozzle about 1.5 to 2.5 feet (about 0.5 to 0.75 meter) from the surface, and wash from the bottom up to prevent dripping pigment from re-staining the surface.Wear work clothes, protective gloves, and goggles when pressure washing a wall.
Repeat the stripping process on stubborn patches as necessary if any paint remains.

, Even after pressure washing, stripper can leave a residual shadow on stone or brick walls and other porous surfaces. Purchase masonry cleaner and dilute it at one part cleaner to six parts water. Apply the diluted solution to the surface, let it sit for one to two minutes, then pressure wash with cold water."

Try an automotive detail cleaner.,
Apply carnauba wax to the spray painted area.,
Buff out the wax with a clean microfiber towel.,
Use a rubbing compound.",How to Remove Spray Paint4," You'll first want to try the least aggressive treatment when dealing with car graffiti. Start with a car exterior detail cleaner, which is available at your nearby automotive or home improvement store. Spray the cleaner onto the affected area and rub vigorously with a clean, dry cloth., Squirt several generous dabs of wax onto a clean sponge. Rub the sponge over the spray paint using circular motions. The wax contains oils that should start breaking down the spray paint almost immediately.Carnauba wax is also called Brazil wax. Look for a product marked 100% carnauba or Brazil wax at your local home improvement or automotive store.
Reapply more wax and use harder pressure to remove stubborn patches of spray paint.

, Wipe your towel across the waxed surface in quick, broad circular motions. This will remove excess wax and buff the freshly cleaned surface. If you still see any stray spots of spray paint, repeat the waxing and buffing process., If you don't have success with carnauba wax, try applying an abrasive rubbing compound. Apply a small amount of car exterior rubbing compound to a cloth and lightly rub the affected area in small circles. Wax and buff the area once you've rubbed out the spray paint.Don't rush the process or try to rub in broad, hard circles, or you might damage your car's paint. Try testing the compound in an inconspicuous area first.

Scrape off excess paint.Paint that has dried onto clothing is a real pain to get off, and you might have to resign yourself to the fact that it will never be removed completely.,
Use an alcohol-based cleaner or paint remover.,
Throw it in the laundry.Laundering clothes after treating a stain with an alcohol-based cleaner will at least offer some confirmation whether the stain is removable or not.,
Use a fabric-coloured pen to hide the stain.,
Talk to your dry cleaner.",How to Remove Spray Paint from Clothes2," All the same, you can get a surprising amount of it removed without any chemicals or fluid. Taking a butter knife or your fingernail, scrape the excess paint away from the stain. Because the paint has dried, it will actually come off in chunks. You won't be able to scrape the paint that has soaked into the fabric, but the simple act of scraping the stain may have a significant impact on removing it.

, Alcohol-based cleaners, like acetone nail polish remover or hairspray, are arguably your best bet for fighting acrylic-based spray paint stains. These cleaners will break the bonds in the acrylic plastic.Unfortunately, they're far less effective once the paint itself has set into the clothes. If the stain is completely dried and you haven't seen any improvement from the alcohol-based cleaners, a heavy-duty paint remover may do the trick.


Keep in mind, however, that paint removers have some tough chemicals in them, and they might strip the dye from your shirt completely. As such, they should only be used as a last resort.

, If it comes out of the laundry with the stain in place, there's nothing you can do outside of covering it up. Luckily, certain stains (especially on black clothing) can be covered quite well with fabric pens and other ""destaining"" products.

, Because dried paint is essentially bound to the fabric it has stained, sometimes the best option is to fight one stain with another. There are fabric pens available that are specifically intended for covering up paint stains. Go to a arts or fabric store and try to find a pen that matches the colour of your clothes.


Paint shows up on jeans like a sore thumb, but you may be in luck if denim is your problem. Because denim tends to be in shades of blue and black, there are lots of paint pens that fit this range.

, Laundering clothes actually tends to solidify any dried stains on your clothes. Given that dry cleaners are professionals (and have no doubt handled an issue like this before) you may find it helpful to bring the issue to their attention.Even if they're not able to fix it via cleaning, they still may be able to offer advice or help that is specifically catered to the type of stain at hand.

Regulate your spraying.,
Wear a paint poncho.,
Strip to your underwear while painting.",How to Remove Spray Paint from Clothes3," While other kinds of paint stains can result from dripping or excess paint, a spray can is specifically made to be accurate and precise. With this in mind, your first step towards preventing paint stains should be the proper use of the spray paint itself. Spray the can in short, controlled bursts. Make absolutely sure the nozzle is turned away from you before you fire. Remember to shake the can frequently to improve the paint's consistency.Check the instructions on the can if you have any doubts.

, Paint ponchos are specially designed to protect your clothing from staining.They can be bought relatively cheaply at a local hardware store. Failing that, you can also make a paint poncho of your own by cutting arm holes in a garbage bag and wearing it while you work.


Paint ponchos can be uncomfortable, especially if you're painting somewhere where it's already hot. Still, the mild discomfort is more than worth saving your clothes from harm.

, Obviously, getting down to underwear while you paint is reserved only for a few scenarios. Painting at home and inside make the most sense in this case. However, you can't risk messing up your clothes if you're not wearing them. Due to the fact that drying paint absorbs heat, disrobing also helps tend to the issue of overheating while painting.

Wash the area with warm water and liquid soap.,
Use a cooking or essential oil to pull away the paint.,
Rub the skin with oil and water until the primer comes off.,
Make a salt scrub for an exfoliating, more powerful cleaner.,
Use turpentine oil with care for serious stains.,
Rinse the skin until it is clean.",How to Remove Paint from Skin2," Create a thick lather on the skin, then rinse the lather away. This will remove some of the paint from your skin and make it easier for the oil to get in and lift the paint away.








, Simply coat the affected area in the oil and let it sit before scrubbing. You can use a variety of oils as they all have the same cleaning properties. More likely than not, you'll want to use what you have around the house, including:









Vegetable
Coconut
Olive
Essential oils, such as lavender or rosemary

, Use a washcloth or your hands to rub the skin with oil. Rinse the skin to see if all the paint is removed, then add more oil if the skin is still stained.








, Mix equal parts salt and oil, then scrub the mixture onto the paint to remove it. Any oil will do. However, it is best to use the biggest grain of salt you can get, usually ""course"" or kosher salt will do, since that provides a better scrub.







, If you still can't get the paint off, turpentine oil will do the trick. Pour it onto a cloth or cotton ball, not directly onto your skin, then use it to scrub away the paint. However, make sure you use it in a well-ventilated area, and use as little as necessary for the cleaning. While certainly not fatal, the fumes from turpentine oil aren't great to inhale.









Rinse off the area with soap and water immediately after finishing.

, After rinsing your skin with warm water, you may want to shower to remove any unpleasant stickiness remaining.

"
Use liquid hand soap to create a thick lather on the area.,
Mix up an all-natural remover for tough paints, like spray paint.,
Use mayonnaise to get at tricky oil-based paints.,
Try Vick's Vapor Rub as a cleaner.,
Try a sugar scrub for an exfoliating, moisturizing wash.,
Try professional paint wipes.",How to Remove Paint from Skin3," Liberally apply the soap and see how much paint you can get off with your hands or a washcloth. Rinse and repeat if the lather becomes darkly colored, like the paint you were removing.







, Mix in 1







, Mayo will naturally pull off paint, especially if it is oil based. Place a dollop on the skin and rub it into a thin layer over the paint. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes before scrubbing with soap, water, and a washcloth.








, Vick's actually contains turpentine oil, but in much lower, and safer, quantities. Cover the paint in a layer of the oil and let it sit for a few minutes. Then scrub it clean with a washcloth, soap, and water.








, Simply wet your hands and the affected area, then place roughly a tablespoon of plain white sugar on it. Rub it into the skin, using it to scrub gently at the paint to leave your hands smooth and clean.









This can be an effective way to clean your skin after using harsher methods, such as oil or Vick's.

, If you're always in the studio, and you're always covered in paint, it might be a good time to invest in some painting wipes. Specifically designed to remove paint without harming your skin, the following brands are biodegradable. natural and almost always effective:

Use a razor to scrape away any drips.,
Sand away the smears.,
Wipe the dust with a damp rag.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Remove Primer2," Any drips, lines, or globes of primer should be removed with the use of a single-sided razor blade.


Hold the blade at an angle, positioning it so that the sharp edge is nearly parallel and just slightly tilted toward the surface.
Scrape down the drip, working from top to bottom, until most of the primer has been lifted away.
Adjust the angle of the blade as needed to get at the primer. An angle that is too shallow won't scrap anything away, but an angle that is too severe can damage the surface you're working with.

, For spills or smears, you will need to use sandpaper or a sanding sponge to sand away the excess primer.If you use a sanding sponge, make sure that the sponge is labeled for use with the type of surface you're working on (wood, plastic, or metal).
Before sanding the primer away, you should also put on a safety mask to avoid breathing in the primer dust.
Start with a medium-grit and sand in one direction. Don't be discouraged if you don't see much initial progress; you'll need to sand for about five minutes, applying firm pressure the entire time, before any notable improvements show.

, Use a clean, damp rag to wipe away any dust and debris from the working surface when you finish scraping and sanding.


Dry the area with a second rag immediately after wiping it down with the damp rag.

, Check the surface in bright light and look for any traces of primer. If some still remains, repeat the process until the stain disappears.


Experiment with different sanding grits. Be careful, though, since some surfaces might become damaged if you sand them with a heavy-grit or sand them down too much.
You should be able to use this method with most hard surfaces, including walls, wood furniture, and hard floors.

Carefully scrape away excess primer.,
Mix a detergent solution.,
Blot the stain with the detergent.,
Rinse well.,
Repeat as needed.,
Blot with acetone.If the detergent solution didn't work, use a sponge to blot the stain with a small amount of liquid acetone.,
Rinse well.",How to Remove Primer3," Use a single-sided razor blade to carefully scrape away excess primer from the surface of the cloth.


Hold the razor blade at an angle so that it just barely points inward toward the fabric.
Scrape away the primer, working in one direction, until you've lifted away as much as possible. Work slowly and carefully to avoid ripping the fabric.

, Make a cleaning solution by combining one part liquid hand dishwashing detergent with one part cool water.


The exact amount necessary will vary depending on the size of the stain, but you should prepare enough to thoroughly soak the stained area.

, Soak a sponge in the detergent solution, then use it to vigorously tamp and blot at the stain.


Do not scrub the stain since doing so may cause it to spread deeper into the fibers of the material.

, After working on the stain for several minutes, rinse the material under cool water.


Work from the back side of the fabric, if possible, and rinse until the water runs clear.

, If parts of the stain still remain, continue sponging it away with the same detergent solution.


Repeat as needed until the stain disappears or until you no longer notice any additional progress.

,


As before, you should only blot the stain and not scrub it.
Do not use acetone on fabrics containing acetate or triacetate.

, Rinse away the acetone with cool water.


Continue rinsing until the water runs clear.
Do not use the acetone more than once. If you need to work on the fabric further, return to the detergent solution.

Apply paint stripper to the stain.,
Scrub with a wire brush.,
Rinse with a pressure washer.,
Work around the entire spill area.,
Rinse well.",How to Remove Primer4," Pour paint stripper on a patch of stain no more than 1 foot (30.5 cm) in height and width. Allow the paint stripper to saturate the area for three to five minutes.


Even if the stain is larger, you should only work on small sections to prevent the primer residue from spreading too dramatically during the process.
Try brush cleaner or a traditional paint stripper, like turpentine or mineral spirits. If none of these options work, consider calling the primer manufacturer for a recommendation.Always read the instructions on the paint stripper label to avoid misuse.

, After letting the pain stripper soak, scrub the soaked area of the stain with a long-handled wire brush.


Ideally, you should scrub while standing rather than crouching since you can apply a greater amount of pressure that way.
Scrub from different angles so that you can work on the stain as thoroughly as possible.

, Rinse away the paint stripper and primer residue with a moderate-pressure washer hose.Do this while the paint stripper is still wet. Do not wait for it to dry since any primer residue it picked up will have a chance to set again if you do.
The pressure from the washer hose should scrape away even more of the primer, but a moderate pressure is still recommended over a high pressure. High pressure can actually cause the cement to wear away, causing more harm than good as a result.

, Repeat this process around the entire spill area, working in 1-foot (30.5-cm) patches.


Apply the paint stripper.
Scrub the paint stripper into the stain.
Rinse the paint stripper and primer away with a pressure washer.

, When you think you've covered the entire spill area, rinse it down using light pressure from a pressure hose.


Inspect the area while it is wet, then again after it has dried.
If some of the stain still remains, you can use the same process to try removing it.

Wipe off any remaining wet paint that may still be on the fabric.,
Flush the back of the fabric with warm water.,
Mix together equal parts of dish detergent and warm water.,
Blot the front side of the garment with the soapy sponge.,
Rinse the garment under warm water, again from the backside of the fabric.,
Repeat this process, blotting and rinsing the stained garment until the mark is more or less invisible.,
Rinse your garment using your washing machine.",How to Remove Paint from Fabrics1," The detergent method will work best if it hasn't set in completely yet.It's also the easiest to pull off on the fly, as most people should have detergent on hand, whether you're at home or at work. If you don't have any detergent available, you can try using bar or liquid soap. It may not be as effective, but you definitely want to attempt to clean the fabric before the paint dries.






;
, You should rinse from behind the stain, isolating the section that's been covered. If the stain has come from a watercolor or kids' tempera paint, it will probably start to rinse out fairly quickly.These washable paints don't always come out immediately, but you'll definitely start to see some color bleeding out of the fabric. Check the paint bottle to see if you have a washable paint. If you do, you'll have a much easier time cleaning the stain, and you may just have to rinse with water and can skip using the detergent.








, Before starting to apply to your clothing, you'll want to check the labels of your garment and your detergent to ensure that they're compatible.If you're not totally sure, apply the mixture to an inconspicuous area of your garment. This way, you can check the viability of your mixture without damaging your clothes irreparably. Soak a clean sponge in the detergent and water mixture. Be sure not to use a paper towel or cotton cloth. The fibers will get stuck and rub off in your clothing, creating a larger mess.









Always put a cloth or fabric underneath your damaged clothing. You don't want it to bleed onto the surface that you're operating on. Even if the paint is washable, you'll avoid staining your countertop or table with any excess color.

, Remember that blotting is different than rubbing. If you rub at the fabric with your sponge, you'll essentially push the paint deeper into the fibers of your fabric. While you can be pretty vigorous with the blotting, you want to make sure you aren't permanently damaging your garment. You can also put the shirt between your fingers, rubbing the mixture gently into the fabric.







, If you're cleaning a washable paint, then a good amount of pigment should be washing out from your fabric. Make sure that you aren't staining anything else with your dripping, including your sink. If there's excess paint and water in the garment, make sure to wring it into a separate bowl. You'll be able to dispose of it more easily.








, You might want to try using a bristled toothbrush to rub at the stained area. This can often be successful in releasing paint from the fibers of your clothes without rubbing the color any deeper into the fabric. Be cautious with this, however, as any excessive force may get the pigment stuck in the fabric.








, Running your stained article of clothing through a wash cycle can often get rid of the stain completely. You've loosened the paint using the detergent, so your washing machine will work much more efficiently. Without pre-treating the garment, however, the washing machine might not be able to fully eliminate your stain. Certain washable or water-based paints may not require this step.


Don't wash your paint stained garment with another article of clothing, as the paint will bleed onto your other clothes. You don't want to damage your entire wardrobe just to save a single item.
If the stain is still present after a wash cycle, place a bit of acetone on the front of the garment and blot with a clean sponge. Do not put acetone on fabrics that also contain acetate or triacetate, as it will melt these fabrics on contact. "

Go to your circuit breaker or fuse box. Switch off the appropriate circuit or unscrew the correct fuse. Eliminate the risk of electrical shock and injury.If your circuits or fuses are missing labels, either shut off all the power or test each one until you find the correct one.;
, If possible, favor taking it down over cleaning it where it is. Reduce the chance of stripping paint from the ceiling or wall by accident. Work in an area of your choosing, with proper ventilation and safer footing than a ladder. Exact instructions for removing light fixtures will vary according to their design, but generally they follow these points:Taking light bulbs out to avoid damage.
Unscrewing the plate from the mounting bracket in the ceiling.
Using a circuit tester to confirm that the wiring is powerless.
Disconnecting the wiring.

, Lay down a dropcloth, tarp, newspapers, or similar material over the floor. If you have removed the light fixture, also cover your worktable. If you are using more than one covering, check for gaps between them. If you are keeping the fixture in place, apply painter’s tape around it to protect the ceiling or wall.Drips from the cleaning agent may strip paint or otherwise mar other surfaces.

, Wear cleaning gloves. Protect your eyes with safety glasses, especially if you are working from underneath the fixture. If using a ladder, make sure it is high enough to work safely, rather than overreach and lose balance on a shorter ladder. Open windows and use fans to create cross-breezes for circulation.Fumes from cleaning agents may be overpowering or poisonous. For long projects or areas with poor ventilation, wear a ventilation mask, especially if you are working on a ladder.

, If you painted the fixture yourself, ask yourself what you used: latex, acrylic, or spray paint. For latex or acrylic, you will need rubbing alcohol to strip it.For spray paint, you will need acetone.If someone else painted it, look for brush strokes, which indicates latex or acrylic paint.


If you are still unsure, select two separate areas to test each chemical. Do not mix rubbing alcohol and acetone by applying it to the same area. Wipe off whichever one doesn’t work, wipe again with clean water to rinse, and let it dry before using the other.

, If the area to be cleaned is very small, simply wet a corner with rubbing alcohol or acetone. For larger surface areas, pour the agent into a plugged sink or bowl and soak the whole cloth. Wring out any excess to reduce the chance of accidental drips.Both rubbing alcohol and acetone may affect other surfaces if they come into contact by mistake.

, Scrub the surface area with your soaked cloth. Soak the paint first so the cleaning agent has time to be absorbed and loosen the paint’s bond. Then scrub more forcefully to remove the paint.Due to the heat generated by light bulbs, the paint may have baked onto the surface, which may make rubbing ineffective.However, always start with cloths to see if that works, since harder tools may damage the metal, wood, or plastic.

, If rubbing with a cloth doesn’t work, use a utility knife to cut X’s in the paint. Apply as little pressure as possible to avoid nicking the fixture’s original surface. Then soak a new cleaning cloth with mineral oils and wipe it over the paint. Give it a half-hour or more to sit. Then try rubbing the paint off again. Repeat as needed.Depending on how thick the paint it is, this may require several soaks. Very thick coats may require a few days’ worth of repeated applications.

, Pour equal parts white vinegar and clean water into a pot. Stir to mix. Set the pot on an oven burner and turn the heat to medium-high. Bring the solution to a boil., First, put on a pair of heat-resistant cleaning gloves. Protect your hands from scalding, since you want to use the solution while it’s still hot. Immerse a portion of your cleaning cloth into the water. Squeeze out the excess to avoid dripping boiled water on yourself., Gently rub the cloth over the painted area, rewetting as necessary. Worry less about removing the paint at first and more about soaking it. Let the heated solution weaken the paint’s bond to the glass for easier removal., Rewet your cloth. Scrub the painted area a second time. Apply more pressure this time, but be careful not to break the glass. Scrub the paint clear of the glass as it continues to loosen. Rewet your cloth and repeat as needed., If any paint refuses to budge, wet the surface area again with your solution. Depending on how long you’ve been working, it may have cooled off by now, so reheat it if you need to. Wait a moment for the paint to soak it in. Then gently scrape the paint off with a utility knife. Work slowly and surely to avoid scratching the glass."
"
Put on proper safety gear.,
Wipe off any and all paint that that you still can from the fabric.,
Pad the back of the fabric with a thick bit of paper towels or a cotton rag.,
Place paint thinner or turpentine directly on the affected area.,
Scrub the area with detergent.,
Let the garment soak overnight and run it through the laundry the next day.",How to Remove Paint from Fabrics2," Before you begin, remember that paint thinner is quite toxic.When attempting to clean your stains, wear proper safety clothing, including gloves, safety goggles, and a respirator. If you're cleaning the stain while inside in your home, open a window to properly ventilate the fumes. This solvent is also very flammable, so be sure not to bring it near any sort of open flame.


Even though turpentine is less toxic than most paint thinners, there's no harm in being safe and wearing the proper gear when cleaning fabric with it.

, Paint thinner or turpentine works best for oil-based paints, especially if the paint has dried significantly. Oil-based paints are much harder to remove than water-based paints, but can still be attacked with a little bit of know-how.









Keep in mind that oil-based paints take a significantly longer amount of time to dry than washable or latex paints.After an oil-based paint has dried completely, it's a much larger pain to get rid of. If you notice an oil-based paint stain on your clothing, you should rub it out immediately. Your chance of saving the fabric will increase exponentially if you can treat these stains early.
If the stain has set, you can even use a knife or other sharp object to scrape the dried paint from the fabric. Be careful not to stab into the garment and damage it.

, This will help catch any paint that seeps through the back of the fabric. If the paint bleeds through to the other side of your garment, you may end up staining the other side of your fabric. You also don't want to damage the surface that you're working on. This especially important with oil-based paints, as they won't wash out nearly as easily as a latex or water-based paint.









You will have to change out this backing pad a few times throughout the cleaning process. If the paint has bled through completely and stained the pad, then you won't be able to avoid staining other parts of your clothing. Make sure to be conscious of how much paint the pad has been absorbed. If you think the pad will start leaking soon, you should swap it out.

, Make sure that if you're using paint thinner, it's a thinner that matches directly to the paint that was used.Anything too volatile and flammable will most likely damage your fabric. You don't want to discolor your clothing in the process, then you have to be careful with the thinner that you choose. If don't know what sort of paint is responsible for the stain, then your best bet is to use turpentine., After you've treated the stained area properly with your paint thinner or turpentine, you'll want to apply detergent to it. Make sure that if your fabric can't be bleached, you don't use a detergent with bleach. You can apply the detergent liberally to the affected area, blotting it with a small sponge or cloth. Be careful not to rub too harshly, as you could push the paint deeper into the fabric.









If you are still wearing your rubber gloves, you can use your fingers to apply the detergent. If not, don't let your bare skin touch the paint thinner. Many thinners can be quite toxic to your skin, and you want to avoid any potential risk.

, Fill a bucket with hot water and let your stained article sit overnight. Check the tag on your garment to check the maximum temperature that it can handle. When you wake up the next morning, you can run it through a normal laundry cycle. Be sure not to wash it with any other articles of clothing, as you run the risk of staining the rest of your load.


If you see a significant change in the coloration after the first attempt, then it's worth repeating the process again.If not, however, the stain may be permanent. This means you may have to throw the garment out. The more times that you apply the thinner or turpentine to the fabric, the larger the risk of further damage to the material.

If you’re cleaning fixtures, use a screwdriver to remove the fixtures from the walls or doors. Carefully set aside the screws for each fixture.You can use individual plastic bags to keep track of which screws go with which fixtures. Label the bags with permanent marker.;
, Because many brass fixtures are quite old, they may be covered in lead-based paint. You’ll need a pot you do not plan on cooking in ever again to remove this paint. You can save the pot, however, for your future cleaning needs.If you don’t have an old pot, you can likely buy one at either a donation center or a grocery store for under $5.
You can also use an old crockpot, but only if you can commit to not cooking in it again.

, Try not to overfill the pot, and split your cleaning into two sessions if necessary. All of the brass should have enough space in the pot not to touch any other items., Fill the pot with enough water that all of your brass is completely submerged. Add about 4-5 tbl. (59.14-73.93 mL) of soap and give the pot a good mix with an implement you don’t mind throwing away., Set your stove to low heat to get the water simmering rather than boiling. This will allow the brass to slowly heat up. You’ll need to give the brass plenty of time to soak in this simmering water so that the paint can fully loosen.If you’re using a crockpot, set to the low setting and leave it on for a minimum of 8 hours and up to overnight.

, The paint should have started to separate from the brass. Your brass will now be very hot, so exercise caution when removing it from the pot.


You may want to put on a pair of gardening gloves when removing the brass. This should still allow you to have the necessary mobility you need to handle the tongs, while also allowing you to protect yourself from the heat.

, Cooling off the brass immediately should make the paint even easier to remove. It will also make the brass much safer to handle. Let the brass sit in the ice for about 5 minutes, then transfer it to an old towel you’re prepared to throw away., While you’re removing the paint, you’ll want to protect your hands from any chemicals. Wear rubber or gardening gloves and check them frequently for holes or tears., Now that the paint is loosened, it should be easy to remove with a sponge of steel wool. Once you’ve penetrated through the paint, stop scrubbing. You don’t want to scratch the brass.


If you start to notice any scratching, switch to a soft cloth to more gently rub off the paint.

, Use the flat edge of the screwdriver to carefully scrape off paint chips and strips that are sticking to the brass. Go in one direction only, and be sure to scrape away from your body., If your paint is sticking in any small crevices or hinges, scrub those spots with a brush. These areas might need extra attention that can’t be provided by your steel wool.Avoid wire brushes, as these may scratch the surface of your brass.

, Once your paint is removed, you’ll need to clean the brass off once more. Wet a soft cloth and wring out the excess water, and then use the damp cloth to gently wipe away any paint residue.

, Your brass should now be free of paint, and this will complete the cleaning process.


If you’re dealing with older brass, you may now see a nice antique patina on the metal. Depending on your preferences, you may choose to leave that intact rather than polishing or waxing it away., If the paint still isn’t coming off, you may need to address it with a chemical stripper. There are a variety of commercial liquids and gels you can apply to brass in order to strip the paint. You’ll need to let it sit for a few hours, and then you should be able to wipe off the paint residue with a rag.Protect yourself from these substances by wearing gloves while you apply and remove it.

, Choose a slightly soft lemon that will yield plenty of juice. Make a cut across the short side of the lemon. Once your lemon is cut in half, remove all the visible seeds from its surface by scraping them out with a knife., You’ll probably need at least a few teaspoons (about 15 mL) of table salt to completely cover the lemon. The salt will act as a natural sponge when you apply it to your brass., Rub down the entirety of your brass item with the lemon and salt, squeezing out lemon juice as you go. Check on the salt layer, and replace it when necessary., Use a damp sponge or cloth to wipe away the lemon juice and salt mixture. Be sure to thoroughly clean the brass, as any leftover lemon residue will become sticky and hard if it dries., Use a soft, dry cloth to buff your brass by gently wiping the surface in small circular motions. Your brass should now be shiny and gold in appearance.

, It’s a great idea to protect your brass with a layer of oil. Pour a teaspoon (4.92 mL) of olive oil onto a soft, dry cloth and rub the oil onto the brass. Move in small circles to coat the entire piece.If you prefer, there are also a variety of commercial wax options for your brass. The application process will also require a soft cloth, and you can buff the surface using the same small circular motions you would use with the oil. Some of these substances may require you to wear protective gloves.

Wipe any excess or remaining wet paint from the affected area.,
Spray hairspray on the affected area.,
Scrub gently with a brush or washcloth.,
Run the garment through the laundry.",How to Remove Paint from Fabrics3," If you know that you've used a latex-based paint, and the paint has already dried significantly, then you definitely want to use hairspray to remove the stain.You should still wipe off any excess paint that you can, but your stain is probably more deeply set if you're using hairspray. Use a knife or other sharp object to scrape off more deeply set paint.









While latex paint comes out of fabrics much more easily than oil-based paint, it will dry more quickly. Within one or two hours, the paint will dry completely. This is when you should resort to using hairspray. If you catch a latex paint stain before it dries, scrub it with soap and water. After a few rinses and a trip through the washing machine, it will probably be removed.

, If you don't have hairspray, then you can use a pure isopropyl alcohol, otherwise known as rubbing alcohol. This is the active compound in the hairspray that will break down the stain, meaning that either method will work in the same fashion. You can give the hairspray a couple of minutes to set in. Make sure that you've really doused the problem area in hairspray. It should feel quite moist, as you'll need quite a bit to break down the stain if it's already set.







, If you rub too harshly, you'll damage your fabric permanently. You should see the paint starting to loosen or liquify from the affected area. If the hairspray isn't changing color at all, then you may have not applied enough, or the alcohol base may not be strong enough. Continue scrubbing until you notice a reduction of the stain's size or pigmentation.









If you're not seeing immediate results with the use of hairspray, then you may have to purchase some proper rubbing alcohol to fully get rid of the stain. You can repeat this process in the exact same fashion that you would with hairspray.

, After you've successfully removed some of the paint by scrubbing, you can run a normal wash on your damaged article of clothing. Even if the stain hasn't disappeared completely, you've definitely loosened it, and more of the stain should wash out with a rinse.


You also can apply a bit of detergent and water to the stain after applying the hairspray. Because latex paint does not react negatively to water, you won't run into the same ""gumming"" problems that you would with oil-based paint.

Gather your materials.,
Mark all hardware with tape or wire twist ties.,
Remove the old hardware.,
Prepare a warm water bath.,
Remove the hot hardware with plastic tongs or chopsticks to avoid scratching.,
Finish up by placing the hardware in a bath in isopropyl rubbing alcohol, if needed.,
Grease any hinge pins and re-install.,
If you're using brass finishes, coat them with beeswax or olive oil to preserve the finish.",How to Remove Encrusted Paint from Door and Window Hardware," For removing encrusted paint from door and window hardware, a non-toxic approach is to use:


Old pot (or a slow cooker with a plastic crock pot liner)
Copper mesh scouring pad (not steel wool)
Isopropyl rubbing alcohol
Utility knife
Marking supplies;
, Old hardware usually fits back better into the exact door or window it came from.

, Use a manual screwdriver to avoid stripping stuck screws. Use a knife to score all paint lines to avoid chipping and peeling the remaining paint.

, There's no need to boil, but you should soak the old hardware in hot water for up to 6 hours. Note that this process makes a mess of the pot. But like magic, the paint peels off in sheets. Modern latex paint comes off the easiest, but older oil paints are not impossible to remove via this method.

, The paint will likely stick stubbornly to crevasses. Use the least harsh scraping tool you have: fingers, nylon brush, and finally, copper wool if the other methods don't work. Plated finishes, and plated brass in particular, are very fragile. Repeat as needed: the paint hardens very quickly. Some people have great success with an ice bath after the hot bath: your experience may vary.

, The alcohol takes longer than a water bath, but sometimes gets paint missed by the other techniques.

, If the screws are too loose, stick a flat toothpick with wood glue into each hole first.

, You may also choose to leave the hardware uncoated. Plated brass finishes are often rendered rusty by age or by the years of paint. They'll never polish up to shiny again, but can tarnish to a pleasing dark brown similar to that of solid brass.

Wear gloves and painting clothes.,
Remove excess paint as soon as possible.,
Let the rest of the paint dry and crumble.For the paint that you can’t quite remove manually, don’t force it.,
Use a cleaning soap.,
Saturate the stained area with alcohol.,
Wait 10-15 minutes.,
Scrub the area.,
Launder the shirt as usual.,
Repeat the process if necessary.",How to Remove Paint from Your Shirt1," You don’t want to stain any more clothing or get your hands dirty. So wear gloves and clothing that you wouldn’t mind getting paint on.;
, You can use a kitchen utensil like a knife or spoon or a scraper such as a popsicle stick.

, There’s a good chance that some or most of the paint will crumble off after it dries. After you’ve removed the dry paint, you can clean the remainder of the paint that has seeped into the fabric.


After the paint dries, use your hands to make gentle creases in the fabric that is stained to help make the paint crumble off.

, A dish soap/hand soap combination (1:1 ration) should work well when used with these steps. You might also consider fabric soap as well.


Test your cleaner of choice. You may want to test a small amount of your cleaning liquid on the inside or hidden part of your shirt, so you are sure it won't harm the shirt further.
Dab the area with a sponge. Soak the sponge in your soap solution. Pat the stained area with soap and then rinse under warm water. Repeat this process until you get out as much of the stain as possible.

, Saturate the painted area in either isopropyl rubbing alcohol or hairspray. Hairspray is slightly more effective, but more expensive, and alcohol is less expensive, but slightly less effective. Remember, you need to soak the area with product, so rubbing alcohol may be a better choice.

, This time period will allow the alcohol to soak in and effectively saturate the fabric and paint.

, Using an old cloth, rub the area in circular motions, so you don't just smear the now soft paint. Use some elbow grease.

, You’ve now done as much as you can to clean the shirt yourself by hand. You can run the shirt in the laundry machine.


Be sure to run it alone so that the shirt doesn’t potentially expose your other clothes to stains.

, Look at the stained area. If it looks good, you’re all set. If not, repeat the process, as needed, starting with the alcohol step. Maybe you need to use more alcohol or let it soak in the fabric for a longer time period this time.

Wash the area with warm, soapy water.,
Gently pull the latex away from your skin.,
Saturate areas where the latex is stuck.,
Rinse your body in warm water once the latex has been removed.,
Shave the areas where you plan to use latex.,
Moisturize your body before applying latex.,
Use oil to protect sensitive areas.",How to Remove Liquid Latex," You can use soap or body wash paired with warm water to loosen the latex. Massage the area with your hands or a scrubber to help the latex lift from your skin.


If you bought a latex kit, it may have come with a bottle of body wash designed to wash away the latex. Regular body wash works just as well.;
, Grasp an edge between your fingers and pull it up to reveal your skin underneath. You may wish to have a warm washcloth that you use to sooth the skin while removing the latex.


The latex will be extremely stretchy, so keep your fingers or the washcloth against the area where the latex and your skin meet to reduce painful pulling on your skin.
The longer the latex has been on your body, the easier it may be to remove; over time, perspiration and your skin's natural oils will loosen the latex.

, If the latex has adhered to your body hair, cover the affected area with warm, soapy water and massage gently. Pay special attention to your hairline, eyebrows, and other sensitive areas that have large amounts of growth. Don't yank the latex off or you risk pulling out hair.

, This will clear away any of the smaller pieces that may still be in your hair or on your skin. Pat your body dry with a towel.

, Since the latex is most difficult to remove in areas with a lot of hair growth, shaving first will make it much easier to remove the latex later. Shaving your legs, arms, facial hair, and so on will save you from pain when you're finished with your costume.


Even areas that don't seem especially hairy may have fine, invisible baby hairs to which the latex will adhere. Don't forget to shave your back, stomach, and so on.

, Using a good moisturizer just before applying latex is another way to help it come off more easily later. Slathering on some lotion protects your skin and hairs from getting too ""attached"" to the latex.

, If you don't want the latex to stick to your eyebrows, eyelids, and other sensitive areas, you can use olive oil, almond oil or another oil you have on hand to protect them. Just be careful not to let it drip to the places where you want a flawless latex finish.

Because lead is so toxic, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has tested all of the do-it-yourself kits on the market and only supports two particular brands – LeadCheck and DLead.;
, Test kits react to two chemicals – rhodizonate or sodium sulfide. To be thorough and accurate, get a test kit for each chemical. The results are shown by a test strip or swab that changes color when it comes in contact with one of these chemicals.


If you’re color blind, have a friend or family member confirm your results.
Do-it-yourself kits are not always reliable. Results may be contaminated by other materials present in your test sample.

, Professionals use x-ray fluorescence technology to determine which paint in your home contains lead. These contractors are certified in lead paint detection and removal. If lead is detected, they will assist you with determining a removal strategy.


In some cases, it is wiser and safer to allow a certified professional to detect and also remove the lead paint in your home., Information is also provided about laboratories near you that can help you test for lead.

, Leaving these systems on will result in lead paint dust being spread throughout your home. Close all vents.


Keep all windows closed to prevent dust from blowing around.

, Seal off air intakes, ductwork, dryer vents, bathroom vents, doorways, windows and other openings to your home with one-mil (.001 inch) polyethylene sheeting. This heavy-duty plastic sheeting will help minimize how much dust gets dispersed through the air.Seal doorways with poly sheeting. Close off and seal any room in which lead paint is not being removed. Exterior doorways also should be sealed.
Secure the plastic sheeting in place with duct tape. You can get these materials at most hardware stores.

, Tape the plastic to the floor or baseboard at least five feet beyond the area you’re working in. Seal the side of the plastic so dust can’t get under it. If you have wall-to-wall carpet, be very thorough. Once lead paint dust gets into carpet, it can be very hard to remove.


You could tape the plastic to the baseboard instead, but be very careful, since this could strip the paint off when you remove it., Everything, including furniture, bedding, drapes, dishware, toys, food, rugs, etc.) must be removed to avoid contamination. If it can’t be removed, cover it with two sheets of heavy duty plastic. Secure the sheeting in place with duct tape so that all seams are sealed., Lead is extremely hazardous. Children and pregnant women should never, under any circumstances, do any lead paint removal work. Everyone, including pets, must stay out of the work area until clean-up is complete.


If necessary, make arrangements for temporary living quarters.
Seal off and restrict the work area to only others working on the project., Disposable coveralls are a good option. Use paper-bootie shoe covers and remove them when you leave the work area. You’ll also need gloves, goggles and a half mask respirator equipped with a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter to protect your lungs.


Only HEPA respirators can filter lead dust and fumes. Paper or fabric dust masks will not protect you.At the end of the day, take a shower as soon as possible to remove any lead dust on your skin.
Always wash your work clothes in a separate load from the rest of the laundry.

, The lead dust will cling to the wet surfaces, allowing you to easily wipe away loose paint without causing a massive dust cloud. Before disturbing any painted surface, always use a water-filled spray bottle to wet the area.

, Using a 2 inch carbide scraper or wire brush, scrape off the loose and flaking paint. Start at the top and work your way down. Keep cloths and an empty bucket nearby. Continually wipe up water, dirt, sludge and paint flakes as you work and wring out the rag into the bucket.


You can also use a HEPA vacuum intermittently to clean up debris.
Continually wet the surface with the spray bottle as you work to keep it moist.

, Continue to work wet by moistening the surface before you start sanding. Never sand lead paint on a dry surface. Wet hand sanding with a coarse-grit sanding sponge or using an electric sander equipped with a HEPA filtered vacuum attachment are the only techniques that should be applied.Liquid paint removers can be used safely on small areas, like windowsills, doors and woodwork. Always read the warning labels and follow the instructions when using these products.Clean up the debris after every work day. Mist the debris with water, sweep it up and put it in double 4-mil or 6-mil plastic garbage bags. Wet-dust and wet-mop all surfaces., Do exterior work on calm days with nice weather. Wet-misting and vacuuming should be used to control the dust and paint chips. Cover the ground around the house with heavy plastic sheeting. Make sure the outer edges of the sheeting are raised so that it will properly trap the debris.


Removing all of the exterior paint isn’t necessary, and would cost you a lot of time and money. You only need to remove paint where it is loose and flaking off., When you're dealing with lead paint dust, only a HEPA vacuum is sufficient for the job.Use the vacuum to pick up as much of the paint chips and dust as possible. Be sure to get in the nooks and crannies.


Double check the cracks and corners, especially around windows, for debris. Use an attachment to get into the hard to reach areas.
Do not remove your respirator or any of your protective gear before or during cleaning.

, Soak a heavyweight paper towel in the solution and begin wiping the work surface. Start at the top and work your way down, so that the debris and residue are always being pushed in a downward direction.


When the paper towel surface gets dirty, toss it into a bucket and get a new one.
Make sure the paint chips you wipe off also go into the bucket.

, Always wipe horizontal surfaces in the same direction. Rinse and wring out the cloth in the bucket often. Change the water in the bucket as soon as it starts getting cloudy.

, Begin to fold the plastic inward, starting at the corners. Continue folding until the plastic is fully rolled up on the floor. Put it in 6-mil garbage bags, along with all of the debris you collected in the bucket.

, Be sure to get into the corners and edges of surfaces, where debris can hide. If you’re working around old wooden floors, be extra thorough. These older floors have a lot have cracks that the dust can settle in.

, Make sure the paint chips you wipe up are wrung out into the bucket. After you've washed it, refill your bucket with clean water and repeat the rinsing technique from earlier – dip a cloth in the clean water, wipe down the surface, rinse and wring out the cloth, repeat.


Remember to change the water in the bucket often.
Double-bag all debris and paint chips in 6-mil plastic garbage bags and throw them in the trash.Thoroughly wash off your tools and respirator. Be sure to throw away the respirator filters and sanding sponges.

Do not apply too much pressure or you might scratch the surface of the faux leather.

, Mix 1 quart/950mL water with 1 ounce/30mL dish detergent. Dip a sponge or soft cloth in the cleaning solution. Wipe the affected area down with the hot soapy water. This should help remove any remaining flecks of dried paint.For tough stains, dip the toothbrush in the cleaning solution and scrub the stain.

, Once you have removed the dried paint from the faux leather, dry the affected area with a cloth made of microfiber or cotton. You can also use a paper towel to dry the faux leather.

, If you have a tough stain on faux leather that doesn't respond to hot, soapy water or scrubbing, you might need a special cleaner. Look for cleaners that are specifically formulated for faux leather, and use the cleaner according to the manufacturer's instructions. You can use these cleaners on wet or dry paint."

Use heavy hand lotion or cream.",How to Get Spray Paint off Your Hands2," A much gentler, albeit more time-consuming, way to release pain from the hands. This method moisturizes instead of stripping the hands of moisture, as acetone does.


To remove spray paint from the hands with hand cream, simply squeeze a generous amount over the area that is painted and cover lightly with your hands. Leave the hand cream on your hands for a minute or two; then wipe it off with a cloth or paper towel. Repeat as necessary.

Use an oil to remove spray paint from the skin.,
Try oil and a cotton cloth.,
Use ordinary vegetable oil.,
Use an essential oil like lavender or tea tree oil.,
Use olive oil and salt.,
Try out mayonnaise.,
Try butter or margarine.The oils present in butter and margarine make it hard for the spray paint to properly adhere to your skin, giving you an opportunity to rub it off.",How to Get Spray Paint off Your Hands3," Oil is supposed to soften the spray paint on the hands, while a quick abrasive starts the general process of removal. In fact, oil is such a popular way of removing paint from skin that many different oils are now used; sample one of the oil methods suggested under this section.

, Cover the area with baby oil for one to two minutes, and then begin gently wiping with your cloth. Repeat as necessary.

, Squirt some into the palms of your hands. Rub it onto the spray paint. Leave for 3 minutes, then wash off with ordinary soap and water.

, Dilute some of the essential oil in water, cover hands with oil, and wait for one to two minutes. Begin gently wiping hands with cloth, repeating as necessary.

, Apply a generous amount of olive oil to the hands and set stand for several minutes. Use coarse-grained salt like Kosher or sea salt to begin rubbing between hands. Repeat as necessary.

, Mayonnaise is a simple emulsification of oil and eggs, meaning that this method — like the method above — is all natural. Simply coat the hands with ample mayonnaise and let stand for several minutes. Wipe off with water and a towel. This method should make your hands feel smooth and hydrated.

, Work the butter or margarine into your hands for at least a minute. Then, use coarse salt (Kosher or sea salt) as an abrasive to fully remove the paint. Since your hands will be greasy and oily afterward, wash thoroughly with a gentle soap and rinse.

If you're having trouble removing spray paint from your hands using the above method alone, try using an abrasive like salt or sugar along with the baking soda mixture.",How to Get Spray Paint off Your Hands4," Mix together roughly equal parts baking soda and water (err on the side of more baking soda). Pour baking soda mixture over hands and thoroughly work into spots where spray paint has dried. After a minute or so of rubbing hands together, the spray paint should come off quite easily.

, While salt and sugar are both desiccants (meaning that they'll sap moisture from your skin), they shouldn't be too rough on your skin in the end.

, No special shampoo is required – you can just use your normal product. Let the shampoo sit for about 10-20 minutes before washing off., Try to comb out the sections of paint that have now softened. You may want to clean the comb periodically with your fingers and set aside the bits of paint so that they don’t clog the drain.

, Once you’ve removed as much paint as possible, rinse your hair again in warm water. Comb your fingers through your hair to help remove any lingering bits of paint that have flaked off.

, Saturate the hair with conditioner to help restore some of its moisture. Let it sit in your hair for at least three minutes before rinsing so that your hair has a chance to soak up the conditioner’s oils."

Add warm water to the stained area.,
Treat the stain with detergent and warm water.,
Try rubbing alcohol.,
Use a toothbrush to scrub stain away.,
Throw in the laundry.,
Colour over the stain with a fabric marker if needed.",How to Get Paint Out of Jeans1," Because water-based paints are soluble with water, they're often quite a bit easier to fix than their oil-based counterparts. The first thing to do in the case of a water-based paint stain is to add some warm water to the affected area. Dab a washcloth in some warm water and press it gently against the stain, letting the warm water soak into the jeans fabric. , Once you have let some warm water soak into the stained area, it should be ready for some real cleaning. Add one tablespoon of laundry detergent to half a cup of water and stir. Once the two have mixed into a consistent solution, rub some of it onto the stain with your damp washcloth. Rub the stain in a gentle circular motion; if the stain is sufficiently big, begin rubbing the outside perimeter of the stain and gradually work your way inwards. Rubbing as such will minimize the risk of spreading the paint stain around further. , While a light detergent solution should work, it is likely that it won't have solved the stain problem entirely. If that is the case, using an Isopropyl rubbing alcohol solution and dabbing it on the stain should work towards lifting the paint away from the fabric.


Nail polish remover works too as an alternative to traditional rubbing alcohol, but may prove damaging to fabric. If you're at all concerned whether it's going to leave a stain of its own, do a test scrub of the nail polish remover on a part of your jeans that won't be easily seen, such as the inside or the bottom of a pant leg. , The bristles of a toothbrush will offer the abrasiveness and precision needed to fix a stain. Once you have your rubbing alcohol in place, scrubbing away at the stain should see results within a minute of exertion. Use some more rubbing alcohol and apply it to the stain if you're not yet getting the results you'd like.

, Once you've done all of this, the next best thing is to give it a proper once-over in a washing machine. Water-based paints are usually subject to cleaning in a laundry machine, and whatever bits you couldn't get out should be fixed (or at least lessened) after being put through a cycle.


As always, remember to wash your clothes according to their respective labels.

, If there's still a noticeable coloured blotch on your jeans after trying all of this cleaning, you can still try to remove the colour by getting a fabric pen from an arts and fabrics store. Find one that best approximates the colour of your jeans and dab it over the stain. While this is essentially trading one stain for another, the sameness of colour should make it harder to detect by the human eye.

Scrape the dirty brush on all sides against the inside lip at the top of the paint tin.,
Replace the lid firmly on the paint can.",How to Get Paint off a Paint Brush1," This will ensure less wastage of paint, as well as making the brush easier to clean.;

Act quickly.,
Scrape any congealed or blobbed paint off your clothing with a spoon or knife.,
Don’t panic.,
Dab as much off the paint off with a dry paper towel as possible.",How to Get Acrylic Paint Out of Clothes1," Regardless of the method you choose to remove the acrylic paint from your clothing, the faster you respond to treating the stain, the more likely it is that you'll successfully remove it from the clothing. , If the paint is still wet, dab it gently with a paper towel or cloth to soak up the excess paint. The key is to get as much paint off as possible as soon as possible.









A bristled brush may help with tougher fabrics, especially if the paint has congealed in large globules. A brush is a good substitute for a spoon if you don’t feel comfortable using eating utensils.

, Don’t give up and throw your shirt away or get frustrated. Even if it is a nice article of clothing, you might be able to save it from staining. Just move quickly and follow the instructions.

, This will only work if the paint is still wet. Remember to dab, not to rub. Dabbing will remove the excess wet paint that hasn't already soaked into your clothing. Rubbing will push the excess paint further into your clothing and make it even more difficult to remove. Once you have dabbed off the extra wet paint you can proceed to any of the following steps.

Rub olive oil or baby oil between your palms.,
Run your hands through the part of your hair with the paint.,
Use a fine-toothed comb to remove the softened paint.,
Shampoo as usual.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Hair2," Use a generous amount so that you can saturate your hair. If you have long hair, or if there’s a lot of paint in your hair, you may need to refill your palms with the oil several times.


If you don’t have either of these oils, you could use other substances from around the house, like peanut butter or WD-40.Follow the same process of rubbing the product between your palms, but if using WD-40, wear latex or disposable gloves since the product could cause skin irritation, and avoid using it near your scalp., Check that the affected part of your hair is coated with oil, and allow it to sit in your hair for several minutes. This will soften the paint and make it easier to flake off.For really stubborn dried paint, you may want to apply the oil to your hair, wrap your head in plastic wrap, and then wait a few hours to give it extra softening time., Make sure to use gentle strokes, so as not to pull your hair from your scalp or to break it off at the ends. Try dividing your hair into 1-inch sections and combing them each separately.


For bad tangles, start at the bottom of your hair and just comb out the last inch. Then move up and comb the inch above that. Progress this way until you’ve reached your scalp and can easily glide a comb from root to tip.

, Lather your hair with your typical shampoo and then rinse to remove the oil. Depending on how much oil was in your hair, you may need to shampoo and rinse a second time.


You may condition if you wish, but you don’t need to since the oil you used to remove the paint also moisturized your hair."

Scrape paint with knife if dry.,
Purchase an oil solvent or paint remover.,
Apply solvent to stained area and scrub.,
Cover with glycerin, should the issue persist.",How to Get Paint Out of Jeans2," Oil-based paints are known to be quite a bit trickier than their water-based counterparts when it comes to stain removal, as water is much less effective in solving them. If the paint stain you're tending to is already dry, you can remove at least some of the mess by taking a knife to the surface material. Scrape a blunt knife along the surface; in doing so, you'll hopefully get the excess that wasn't able to latch itself directly onto the fabric.


It is generally recommended you use a blunt knife for doing this, as sharp knives run the risk of causing damage to the pants themselves.

, Unlike water-based paints, which can be attacked relatively easily with warm water, oil-based paints require specific chemicals to be lifted. While paint removers are the most effective antidote for paint stains, they're not promised to be safe for use on clothing. An oil solvent is your best bet; they're relatively inexpensive and can be bought at any supermarket or arts store. Even if you don't have any paint stains yet, it's a good idea to keep an oil solvent handy so you can fix your clothes as soon as possible if it ever arises

, Using a towel, dab the solvent lightly and apply it to the stained area of your jeans. Rub the stain in small, circular motions, beginning from the outside of the stain and gradually working your way inward. Attending to the stain in this manner will minimize the risk of the stain spilling over into adjacent areas of your jeans. Applied correctly, the oil solvent should lift the paint.


Use a toothbrush if you think the washcloth isn't working as well as it should be.
If you think a heavier-duty chemical is needed such as industrial paint remover, it's a good idea to test the chemical on an innocuous part of your pants (such as the inside of bottom pant leg) first before moving in to solve the stain. That way, if it's shown to have damage, the damage will have been caused somewhere relatively harmless and irrelevant.

, If a chemical scrub hasn't properly fixed the issue, cover the stain with a dab of glycerin and let the pants sit overnight. The active chemical agents in glycerin should work towards dissolving and lifting the paint particles from the fabric.


If you don't already have some in your cabinet, glycerin is very easy to get and can be found at just about any supermarket.

Work slow and cautious while painting.,
Wear a paint apron.,
Take your clothes off while painting.,
Keep solvent and damage control supplies at hand while painting.",How to Get Paint Out of Jeans3," Though it may sound obvious or even condescending, it's a common misstep for people to get too confident and rushed while they're painting. This is especially true when it comes to painting large spaces such as ceilings and walls. Needless to say, the amount of time you'll be potentially saving is not work risking damaging your clothing over. Go slow with your work, and make sure you aren't tracking any excess paint on your brush or roller before moving onto applying it.

, An apron is a commonplace way of protecting your clothing. Aprons can take a beating, and most would agree it doesn't really matter how they look or how much paint gets on them. If you have a kitchen apron you don't mind about keeping the appearances of, you should wear it while you're painting.

, While this advice is arguably limited solely to home painting situations and wouldn't go over well in any professional context, the easiest way to save your clothes from paint is to disrobe down to your undergarments. That way, if you get paint on yourself, you can easily just hop in the shower and get it off.

, Even if you exercise all of the precautions, there's always a chance that mistakes will occur. If a stain does happen, it really helps to have all of the materials (such as rubbing alcohol or an oil solvent) in the same room to minimize having to run around to fetch it when time is of the essence.

Rinse the stain with warm running water.,
Apply a cleansing solution to the stain.,
Launder your clothing normally.",How to Remove Paint from Clothes1," Latex paint is the most common paint used in modern interiors, and is a popular choice for low-cost craft paint. It is also known as acrylic or acrylic latex paint.


Check the can or tube of paint for the words ""latex"" or ""acrylic latex."" If you see this label, follow the steps below to remove your stain.
If the paint can is unavailable, think back through your past painting projects. Did you clean your brushes with water or paint thinner? If you used water, you were most likely working with latex paint, and can use the steps below.;
, As soon as the spill happens, scrape off as much paint as possible using a butter knife, the edge of a spoon, or a similar object. The more time the paint has to dry, the less likely you are to remove it.









If the paint has already dried or you are tackling an old stain, scrape off as much as possible before you attempt to clean it with water or another liquid agent.
If your clothing has many layers of dried paint, you can use tape to remove many of them. Apply a strong tape like heavy duty duct tape, gaffer’s tape or auto repair tape to the surface of the stain, then quickly remove the tape. It should bring the dried paint with it! Be sure to dispose of excess paint responsibly, following the disposal process listed on the paint can.

, Latex paint is a mixture of water and acrylic, so there is a good chance you can remove fresh paint with water. Begin rinsing from the back of the fabric. Rub or scrape at the paint as you rinse to loosen its hold and to help the water get through the stain.








, Using an emulsifier will help break up and remove the paint stain. You can use a purchased cleanser like Goof Off, or you can use a homemade solution.









A mixture of hand soap and dish washing detergent makes a great paint cleanser, especially for fresh stains. Combine the hand soap and detergent in a small bowl, using a 1 to 1 ration. Apply the solution to the paint stain using a sponge, and tamp it repeatedly for at least 1 minute. Then rinse in warm water and repeat as necessary until the stain is gone or nearly gone.
If you are working with a dried stain, use hairspray or isopropyl alcohol to remove the paint. Rub the hairspray or alcohol onto the stain for one minute, then rinse using warm water. Repeat this step as necessary until the stain has disappeared or seriously faded.

, After you have rinsed the last of your chosen cleansing agent from your clothing, launder it according to the item’s care instructions. The wash cycle should remove any remaining paint, but be sure to check that the stain is fully removed before you dry your clothing.

, Use your fingernail, a wooden stick, a coin, or another item to scrape away at the paint and try to lift it off the fabric. When scraping, go with, then against the grain of the fabric, back and forth. Lift off as much as you can before proceeding to the next step. 







, Set the cycle you'd usually use for this type of clothing and wash with the usual detergent. Hopefully the washing machine can get rid of the excess paint that you weren’t able to remove with the scrubbing and the alcohol.

Remove any unabsorbed paint.,
Flush the stain.,
Hand wash with a detergent.,
Machine wash your clothes.,
Consider professional cleaning.",How to Remove Fabric Paint from Clothes1," The sooner you start fighting the stain, the better your chances will be of getting it out. If you have wet paint on your clothes, take them off right away and attempt to wash the paint out.If you can't take your clothes off, try washing the stain out with them still on. This is better than waiting to deal with the stain and allowing the paint to dry.;
, Many fabric paints are set by heat, which means they do not fully harden until they are heated, usually by an iron. To avoid setting the paint while you are trying to remove it, do not apply heat of any kind to your clothing until the stain is 100% removed.Do not use hot water when washing your clothes.
Do not put them in the dryer or use a hair dryer to dry the area you washed unless you're sure the stain is really gone.
If your fabric paint does not set with heat, you may use hot water when rinsing the stain out, but be sure to read the bottle thoroughly to make sure.

, If you got a large amount of paint on your clothing and not all of it has absorbed into the fabric, remove as much of it as you can before you start washing it. This will help prevent the paint from spreading to clean sections of the fabric.To remove paint from the surface of the fabric, try blotting it up with a paper towel or gently scraping it off with a putty knife.
Try not to rub the paint into the fabric as you do this.

, Once you've gotten as much paint off of the surface of the fabric as possible, bring your garment to the sink and run the stained area under water until the water runs clear. It's best to do this from the clean side of the fabric in order to avoid accidentally rubbing the paint into your clothing.Remember to use cold water to avoid setting the stain.
Always read the care instructions before you start washing your fabric. If tag on your garment says that dry cleaning is required, do not attempt to wash out the stain.

, Once the stain has been thoroughly flushed, apply some detergent to the affected area and scrub. For the best results, use one part detergent and one part water.You may have to scrub and rinse several times to remove the paint.
Dish soap or laundry detergent should both do the trick.
If rubbing the stain with your hands is not effective enough, try scrubbing the area with sponge or a brush. An old toothbrush works well for small stains.

, Once you've gotten as much paint out as you can by hand, put your garment in the washing machine on a cold water setting with plenty of detergent. This should get the rest of the stain out.Do not use hot water to wash your clothes or put them in the dryer unless the stain is completely gone. If the clothing still has a stain after it comes out of the washing machine, let it air dry and follow the steps for removing dried paint.

Identify oil paint stains.,
Remove as much of the paint as possible.,
Decide what oil paint solvent or thinner to use.,
Apply the oil paint solvent to the article of clothing.,
Soak the item of clothing in warm water.,
Launder the garment immediately after soaking.",How to Remove Paint from Clothes2," Though oil paint was once a popular choice for all types of projects, it is now primarily used for art and specialty crafts. Oil paint tends to be thicker and glossier than latex paint, and takes considerably longer to dry.


If you are unsure if you are dealing with an oil paint stain, check the can or tube of paint for the words ""oil paint"" or ""oil-based paint.""
If the paint can or tube is unavailable, try to remember how you cleaned your brushes or other materials after painting. Did you use water, or was a paint thinner such as turpentine required? If you used turpentine, white spirit or another, similar product, you were most likely using oil paint and can follow the steps below.

, If the paint is still wet, scrape excess paint away with a knife or the edge of a spoon, then blot the stain with a white cloth. If the paint has dried, scrub it with a knife or a strong-bristled brush.









Do not apply water or rinse the stain. This will only make the stain more difficult to remove.

, To remove an oil paint stain you will need to use a chemical paint solvent. There are many products available, and your stain may require a particular cleaner.


Check the paint can for a recommended cleaner.
If you are working with specialty craft paint, check an art supply store for a specialized cleaner.If you cannot find a recommendation for a specific cleaner or if you do not have time to find and purchase a recommended solvent, you can use turpentine or white spirits on most oil-based stains. Distilled turpentine can be purchased at any home improvement or paint store.
However, you should never use turpentine on fabrics containing acetate, triacetate or rayon, so be sure to check your garment’s care information before proceeding., Turn the stained clothing inside out and place it on top of a white absorbent cloth or a stack of paper towels. Using another white cloth or paper towel, sponge or blot your paint solvent over the stained area until the stain disappears. 








Replace the cloth or towels under the clothing as they become wet. This will help ensure that the cloths will continue absorbing the paint as it dissolves.
Watch your fabric for color bleeding or running. If you notice that the colors in your clothing are beginning to run, stop applying solvent. It is unlikely that you will be able to remove the paint stain from this item.

, Leave the garment to soak for at least an hour, preferably longer. Occasionally rub the stained area with your hands to loosen the remaining solvent.









Rub a high-quality laundry detergent into the stained area before soaking.
If you don’t have laundry detergent, mix dishwashing soap into the warm water to help cut the grease in the paint and solvent.

, Remove your clothing from the warm water, give the stained area one last scrub, and then wash it according to its care directions.

Identify sensitive or dry-clean only clothing.,
Remove excess paint using a butter knife or a spoon.,
Blot the stain with a dry cleaning solution.,
Next, blot the stain with a dry spotter.,
After blotting the stain with dry spotter, moisten a cloth with dry spotter and lay it on top of the stain.,
Rinse with dry cleaning solvent.",How to Remove Paint from Clothes3," If you are unsure about whether or not your clothing item is dry-clean only, check the care information and fabric content on its tag. Fabrics that are commonly dry-clean only include acetate, silk, wool, and velvet. Even if your clothing does not include these materials, if the care tag says ""Dry Clean Only"" follow the steps below to remove any latex or oil paint stains., It is best to treat paint stains when they are still wet, so be sure to remove as much paint as possible as soon as you notice the stain.









It is possible to damage sensitive fabrics by scrubbing too hard or using harsh brushes. For this reason it is best to remove excess paint using the dull side of a spoon or another similarly dull object.

, Using a sponge dampened with a dry cleaning solution like Afta, gently blot the stain. To keep the stain from spreading, begin blotting from the outside edge of the stain and work your way to the center.








, Dry spotters contain dry solvents that will absorb grease and oil stains, and they are particularly helpful when removing oil paint stains.









You can purchase dry spotter, or you can make it at home using coconut oil and liquid dry cleaning solvent., This will help pull the paint stain out of the clothing. Keep a cloth and dry blotter on the stain until it disappears.









To prevent the stain from running or bleeding, change the cloth often.
Keep the stain and the clean cloth damp with the dry spotter. They won't remove the paint when dry, and allowing the stain to dry will make it harder to remove later.

, Once the stain has been completely removed, rinse the area one more time with dry cleaning solvent. This will help remove the dry blotter and any remaining oil or grease. Then let your clothing dry normally.

Gently blot the stain with a cleaning rag or paper towel.,
Spray the window cleaner or hairspray onto the cleaning cloth or sponge.,
Scrub the paint stain with a the moistened cloth.,
Wash immediately.",How to Get Acrylic Paint Out of Clothes5," Don't rub the paint in. This step is only needed if the paint is still wet. 







, Hold the dampened area over the top of a bottle of nail polish remover and moisten with a little acetone. If you have either window spray or hairspray in the house, both of these products might remove the stain.









It's recommended that you test an inconspicuous area on the piece of clothing first to be sure the fabric can handle the chemicals in these products. If not, use a different method.

, Position the cloth over the stain and start scrubbing up and down. Try not to be too vigorous - you want to avoid spreading the stain. Remember to take off as much of the paint as possible with a knife or your finger nail before you start to scrub the paint stain with the cleaner. You want to avoid spreading the stain as much as possible. 







, This potent cleaning mixture needs to be removed quickly before it damages the fabric fibers. Wash as usual, then dry. This should remove the stain.

Scrape off as much paint as you can.,
Apply a solvent.,
Scrub the stain.,
Machine wash your clothes.",How to Remove Fabric Paint from Clothes2," Before you begin to remove a dried paint stain with chemicals, you should attempt to remove as much dried paint as you can manually. Depending on the amount of paint that is on the fabric, you may be able to scrape some off with a blunt scraper like a putty knife. You may also be able to use a brass wire brush or a stiff nylon brush to remove some of the dried paint.


Be careful not to rip the fabric as you try to remove the paint. If none will come off, move on to the next step.

, Once you have removed as much excess paint as you can by scraping and brushing, you will need to soften the remaining paint with one of several alcohol-based solvents. Chances are you already have one of these products at home. Apply a small amount directly to the paint to begin loosening it.Rubbing alcohol, turpentine, and mineral spirits are all effective solvents for acrylic paint.
If you don't have any of these solvents on hand, you can try an acetone-based nail polish remover or even hairspray (as long as it contains alcohol).
If none of these products work for you, try visiting your local home improvement store and buy a cleaning product that is specifically designed for removing the type of paint you are dealing with.
For stubborn stains, you may have to let the solvent sit on the fabric for a while before you start scrubbing.
Solvents are very harsh, so be careful with delicate fabrics. Acetone will damage certain fabrics, among them, those made of acetate or triacetate.Natural fibers like silk and wool are also easily damaged, so always test the solvent on a hidden area like an inside seam before using it.
If your garment cannot be treated with solvents, take it to a dry cleaner to be professionally cleaned.

, Once the paint molecules begin to break down from the solvent and soften, scrub as much of the paint away as you can. Use a brush with stiff bristles for the best results.Once you've gotten most of the paint out, you can move the garment to the sink and continue scrubbing it with detergent and cold water.

, After you have finished hand-washing the stain, put your clothes in the washing machine and wash them in cold water with plenty of detergent.Remember to avoid applying any kind of heat to your clothing unless you are sure that the stain is gone.

Hem your clothing.,
Make it look intentional.,
Cover the affected area.,
Reuse the fabric.",How to Remove Fabric Paint from Clothes3," If you got paint on the bottoms of your pants legs or sleeves, you may be able to modify your clothing slightly to get rid of the stained area. Simply raise the hem to convert your long pants to capris or your long-sleeved shirt to a ¾-sleeved shirt.


You can hem your own clothing if you know how to sew, or you can take it to a tailor to have it professionally done.

, Fabric paint is meant to be applied to fabric, so one way to save your garment is to simply apply more paint. Create a fun design on your clothing that incorporates the stain. No one will ever know that you didn't intend to get paint on your clothes.Don't try to cover up the paint stain with a new paint color that matches the fabric. This may not come out well.

, If you don't want to apply more paint to the fabric, think about other ways you could cover it up. For example, you could attach a decorative patch or even cover the area with sequins.If you don't like to sew, you can find iron-on patches for clothing.

, If you can't think of any way to salvage your garment, but you really like the fabric, you may be able to make something else out of it. For example, if you got paint on your favorite blouse, try making a throw pillow out of the unstained portion of the fabric. You may also be able to cut a large shirt with a paint stain into smaller pieces to make a child's shirt.


This will require sewing skills. You can find patterns for making clothes online. If you don't know how to sew, find a tailor who will make custom clothing with your fabric.

Scrub the rusted area with a stiff brush and a strong detergent solution.,
Try baking soda and water.,
Rub the area with dish soap and a potato.,
Use sandpaper to remove the rust.,
Use a rust remover that is less acidic.,
Put an undercoating on the area.,
Apply an eco-friendly rust remover.,
Remove or replace any metal in the area that is not rust-resistant.,
Apply rust-resistant metal primer to metal fixtures.,
Countersink any nails in the painted surface.",How to Remove Rust Stains from Paint," This can help to remove any rust on the surface of the paint without damaging the painted surface. You can use a plastic or a metal brush. Mix washing detergent with water and scrub the area until the rust is gone.Let the area dry completely before you apply any paint or sealer, as you do not want to area to retain any moisture.;
, Baking soda can help to break down the rust. Apply baking soda to the rusty area and use a brush dipped in water to scrub the rust off the painted surface. Scrub gently so you do not damage the painted surface., If you are worried about damaging the painted surface or if the painted surface is delicate, you can cut a potato in half and dip it into a bowl of dish soap. You can then apply the cut potato to the painted surface and rub away the rust.You can then cut the top layer of the potato and dip it in soap again to continue rubbing on the area until the rust comes off.

, Another option is to use sandpaper to remove the rust. Use very fine, fine, or medium sand paper so you do not damage the painted surface while sanding.Always wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from the sandpaper. You may also want to wear a protective mask so you do not breath in the sandpaper particles.
If the rust does not come off with the sandpaper due to excessive rust build up, you may want to use a drill mount abrasive. You can mount the abrasive onto your drill and drill the surface until the rust comes off.

, Acid can dull or even remove paint. Avoid damaging the painted surface by using a rust remover that is pH neutral or has a high pH, as it will be mild and less acidic. Look for pH neutral rust removers at your local hardware store., You can find undercoatings at your local hardware store or paint store. This product can be applied to a painted surface to stop the spread of the rust and prevent rust from developing on the painted surface., If you are concerned about using harsh chemicals on the painted area to remove the rust, go for an eco-friendly rust remover. These removers are made with natural ingredients and can be rinsed off surfaces with water. Look for eco-friendly rust removers at your local hardware store., To keep the rust from appearing again, you need to identify the cause(s) of the rust and address it. This could be a metal railing or item on the painted surface that is not rust resistant, a light fixture that is not rust resistant, or another object attached to the painted surface made of iron or steel. Look for any metal items that could be causing the rust and remove them or replace them so they are rust resistant.Though a fixture may be made of materials that are rust-resistant, like aluminum or brass, the screws, bolts, or other fasteners may not be rust-resistant. They can then cause rust to appear. Check the screws and bolts to ensure they are resistant to rust.

, If you want to keep fixtures that are not rust-resistant on the painted surface, you should make it a habit to take the hardware off the wall and apply rust-resistant metal primer to the hardware. This will protect the metal and prevent rust from appearing on the hardware or on the painted surface., One of the most common sources of rust is nails that have rusted in the painted surface or along the rusted surface. You should look for any rusted nails in the painted surface and replace them with new nails. Use a nail punch to countersink the nails so they are ⅛” below the surface. This will prevent the nails from retaining moisture from the air outside and rusting.You can then fill any holes in the painted surface with putty to prevent water from getting into the painted surface. Make sure the painted surface is smooth and rust free before you paint over it.

Rinse and wash the concrete with soap and water before beginning.,
Pour or spray lemon juice on the rusted surface.,
Pour or spray white vinegar on the rusted surface in place of lemon juice for tougher stains.,
Scrub the surface of the concrete with a brush.,
Rinse off the concrete with cool water when you're finished.,
Use a sponge and diluted vinegar to scrub any delicate or painted surfaces.",How to Remove Rust from Cement1," Dirt and dust will just get between your cleaner and the stain, making your work less effective. Once you've cleaned the surface of the concrete you should let it dry before moving on., Almost all rust remover uses acid to lift and scrub away the stain, and the high concentration of citric acid in pure lemon juice makes it a worth-while cleaning candidate. Pour on the lemon juice and let it sit for 10 minutes before scrubbing with a wire brush.

, Let the vinegar sit for several minutes before scrubbing it with a wire brush. Rinse away the rust with some cold water and repeat for difficult stains., Let the lemon juice or vinegar sit for 5-10 minutes. Scrub the surface with a stiff bristled nylon brush if it is smooth or painted concrete. Work in small circles to remove as many of the rust stains as possible.


Do not use metal bristles as they can remove the top paste layer in the cement and expose the aggregate material beneath this layer.

, After rinsing, let the concrete dry. You may want to go after the stain again when you're done, as multiple washing is often the best way to fully remove rust stains.

, If you cannot use a wire brush without damaging the surface, stick to a sponge with some warm water. However, make sure that you test the cleaning product on a small corner of the concrete first -- many acids will strip or ruin the paint. Water down 1 cup of vinegar with 1/2 cup of water and start scrubbing in gentle circles. It may take 3-4 washes, but it will work over time.

Soak in vinegar.,
Use lemon or lime juice.,
Get scientific with phosphoric or hydrochloric acid.,
Use a potato.,
Check to see what other acids you have available in your home.,
Remove rust with fizzy cola drink.",How to Remove Rust and Corrosion1," This non-toxic household acid works wonders for rust, among a host of other household applications. Simply submerge the rusted item in vinegar overnight and then scrape the rust away in the morning.


It's best to use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. While white vinegar may work, it's not as effective as apple cider vinegar.
Although vinegar is effective, it is also relatively mild. You may need to soak the item for longer than overnight; a day might be best. After removing the rusted item from the vinegar, dip a crumpled-up ball of aluminum foil into more vinegar and scrape away at the rust.;
, Lemon or lime juice works particularly well for rust stains on clothing, but it can also be effective on metal if left to work for long enough time. Sprinkle salt over the rusted area, let soak with lemon or lime juice, and then scrape away with a crumpled-up aluminum ball.

, Phosphoric and hydrochloric acids are common household items that are inexpensive and work well on rust. Here's what you can find them in, and how to use them:


Phosphoric acid is actually a rust ""converter"" in that it turns iron oxide (or rust) into ferric phosphate, a black coating. Soak the rusted material in phosphoric acid and leave overnight. Then let dry. Scrape off the ferric phosphate after the surface has dried. Phosphoric acid can be found in cola drinks, naval jelly, and molasses.
Hydrochloric acid is often used in the steel industry to ""pickle"" steel by removing rust or scale. Hydrochloric acid can be found in several home cleaning agents, most numerously in toilet bowl cleaners.Hydrochloric acid keeps on working even after rinsing and drying. Vapours can affect other, polished, and metal objects in the same room and discolour them. One way to prevent this is to heat the treated object in an oven or fire. Another is using a neutralizing paste of chalk or lime.

, The oxalic acid in potatoes helps remove the buildup of rust.This method is especially useful for smaller rusted items, such as knives. There are two ways you can use a potato to remove rust:


Simply stab the knife into potato and wait a day or overnight. (Be careful when stabbing the potato.) Remove the knife from the potato and scrub away the rust.
Slice a potato in half, coat the inside with a generous portion of baking soda, and go to town on the rusted surface with the baking soda-coated potato. Wipe afterwards with an abrasive material, such as steel wool.

, Often times, you can create your very own rust removal solution without even leaving the kitchen. Pretty much anything acidic will start to loosen and eventually remove the iron oxide. Homemade solutions work particularly well with smaller rusted objects.


The active ingredient in most store-bought chemical solutions is some form of acid, usually phosphoric or hydrochloric, and most acidic substances found in your home can perform the same trick.
If you have any questions about interactions of acids or chemicals, do some quick research before using them. Although most household items are perfectly acceptable to use in combination, some interactions are best avoided.

, Place the rusty item inside of a glass or larger vessel filled with cola drink. Simply let it sit or just dip it. After each half hour, check for progress. The cola should do the job.

Make a baking soda paste.,
Coat the rust with vinegar.,
Clean the rust with lemon juice.,
Create a paste from the cream of tartar.,
Use lighter fluid to clean the rust.",How to Clean Rust Off Stainless Steel1," Mix one tablespoon baking soda and two cups (473 milliliters) water. Rub the paste on the rust spot in the direction of the grain with a clean cloth. Rinse and wipe the rusty area with a damp paper towel., If possible, submerge the entire rusty stainless steel object in a tall cup of vinegar. This works best with, for instance, cutlery or jewelry. If you can’t submerge the stainless steel object, or the rusty portion of it, fill a spray bottle with vinegar and spray an even coat of vinegar onto the rusty stainless steel object you’re interested in cleaning.Wait five minutes after applying the vinegar. Wipe the rust with a damp sponge.
Distilled white vinegar is best for this, but any type of vinegar will do.
Alternately, you could pour or spray a bit of vinegar onto a soft scrubbing pad and use it to gently wipe away the rust., Mix equal amounts of lemon juice and baking soda to form a paste. For instance, you might choose to combine one tablespoon of lemon juice and one tablespoon of baking soda. Coat the rust with the paste, then use a damp sponge to scrub the rust away.If the rust remains after one application, let the paste sit on the rust for 15-30 minutes, then scrub it away with a damp sponge.
Lime juice is a viable substitute for lemon juice in this solution.

, Combine one tablespoon of cream of tartar with a few drops of lemon juice. Cover the rusty spots on your stainless steel object with the paste. Using a soft sponge, rub the paste firmly over the rust. Wipe away with a damp sponge. Dry with a dish cloth., Squirt a bit of lighter fluid onto a clean dish cloth. Scrub the rust spot using the cloth. Because lighter fluid is flammable, this option should be used only as a last resort. Thoroughly wipe the lighter fluid away with a damp sponge after cleaning the rust.Do not clean rust off stainless steel with lighter fluid if you are near an open flame.

, Just like with your gentle stains, do not use metal bristles, as this can remove the top paste layer in the cement. Instead, us a stiff nylon brush and work in circles to lift up the stain. Rinse away all the cleaner when you're done, taking care to remove all of it. If left on the concrete for too long it may cause discoloration., Hydrochloric acid, in some tests, is the most effective way to remove rust stains. However, left too long to soak this acid can tint your concrete blue, so you need to act quickly. Dilute the acid a bit with 1 cup of water for 2 cups of acid to give yourself more time and avoid re-coloring your surface.; always mix acid to water to avoid a violent reaction.


Let the acid soak into the stain for 5-10 minutes.
Scrub away the rust stain, working quickly.
Rinse the surface thoroughly with water.
Repeat as needed., If you're having trouble getting to a stain, or can't scrub any harder, leave your acid on the stain for 10 minutes and set up a pressure water. The high-powered hose not only rinses away all the acid for you, it puts concentrated force on the stain to easily lift it off the surface.

Seal your concrete for the best protection against rust stains.,
Avoid placing metal bottomed furniture directly on concrete.,
Ensure that you have non-corroding bar supports when laying your concrete.,
Have your house inspected for leaks.",How to Remove Rust from Cement3," Concrete sealer is applied like a stain on wood, and it soaks into the pores of the concrete and protects it from stains. You can get it at any home-improvement store. For the best results, reapply the sealer every 2-3 years:


Choose a weekend with very little chance of rain to work.
Wash the concrete and remove any existing stains.
Starting in the corner, roll the sealant onto the concrete.
Let the sealant sit for 48 hours before placing any furniture on it., If you do need to, try and remove it during rainstorms. The number one cause of rust stains comes from outdoor metal furniture that gets wet, but this can be easily prevented with some forethought.You can get felt runners, or outdoor carpets and mats, to protect your concrete as well.
You can try coating your metal furniture with a sealant to prevent rust. You can also seal already rusted furniture to prevent the rust from spreading to your concrete.
Even interior concrete can get rust stains if the room is moist or humid, so be aware of any metal to concrete interactions.

, Some stains come from within the concrete, as water gets to the metal support bars and causes rust stains from within the concrete. The best way to prevent this is to be proactive -- making sure you pay for and get non-corroding bars in your foundation., Moisture causes rust, so if you have stains on your interior concrete you should get an inspection to look for leaks. The sooner you close up the leak the better, as moisture can cause more damage then just a few easily cleaned stains.

Make a baking soda paste.,
Make a paste of hydrogen peroxide with cream of tartar.",How to Remove Rust and Corrosion2," Mix enough baking soda and water together to form a paste a little bit thicker than toothpaste.This will require slightly more baking soda than water. Once the paste is mixed, apply to rusted material and begin working in with an abrasive, such as steel wool or a toothbrush. Wipe off and inspect the site.


You may need to use several applications of your baking soda paste in order to see results, but the process definitely works.

, Achieve the same consistency as the baking soda paste by using slightly more cream of tartar than hydrogen peroxide. Apply to rusted material, work in with an abrasive, and then wipe off.


If you do not have hydrogen peroxide, you can also use water to similar effect. The active rust-busting ingredient here is cream of tartar.

Obtain a power grinder or sander if you don’t own one already.,
Fit the grinder with the coarsest disc available.,
Secure the rusted material so that it will not move when you grind away the rust.,
Turn on the power grinder and brush the rotating disc against the rust gently but firmly.,
Use a power sander to finish the rust off.",How to Remove Rust and Corrosion3," They are readily available at any hardware store, although since they are power tools, they are likely to have hefty price tags. Many hardware supply stores such as Ace Hardware and the Home Depot rent out such tools for a significantly smaller fee. Power grinders are particularly useful for larger rust-covered surface areas such as on old cars.

, Grinders are equipped with removable discs which are interchangeable and replaceable once they’ve been worn down to uselessness. Stripping, fiber, and flap discs work well.


It is best to start grinding away the rust using the largest, toughest of these to quickly do away with the worst of the rust and avoid needlessly wearing down the smaller, more sensitive ones.

, Clamp it down with a vise, if possible, or make sure that it's heavy enough to stand still while you sand away.

, Be sure to keep it in constant motion to avoid accidentally gouging the metal.








, If any minor rust remains, sanding should get rid of it. Power sanders work just like power grinders, except that they vibrate a sanding pad rather than rotate a disc.


Detail sanders are specifically designed for hard to reach places, and should be used for rust on corners and uneven surfaces.

Set up an electrolyte solution.,
Use a different, sacrificial piece of steel as an anode.,
Connect a negative terminal (black in color) from a battery charger to a rust-free section of your rust-covered object for a good connection.,
Connect a positive terminal (red in color) from the battery charger to the sacrificial metal.,
Plug in the car battery charger and turn it on.,
Unplug the car battery and remove the leads from your objects.",How to Remove Rust and Corrosion4," First of all, this method is much easier than it sounds. Fill a plastic bucket with enough water to submerge your rusted object and mix one tablespoon of baking soda or washing soda per gallon of water. Use hot water, the warmer the water, the better. Mix well until it dissolves.

, The electrolysis process will take the rust from the object you want to clean and eventually attach itself to this metal. You want the sacrificial anode to be big enough so that half of it is submerged and the other half — the half onto which you attach your positive terminal — is above water. This is very important.


A steel can works fine as your sacrificial anode, provided it is big enough to be partly sticking out of the water. Rebar is good too.

Make sure the can anode is magnetic to avoid confusing it with aluminum. You do not want to use aluminum or stainless steel as your sacrificial anodes for electrolysis.

, You may have to manually scrape away some rust to achieve this. Fully submerge the rusty object, taking care to keep as much as possible of the wire out of the water.



Caution: Make sure this rusted object does not touch the anode to prevent an electrical short-circuit (a short).

, Remember not to submerge the sacrificial metal completely, or you'll risk eating away at the positive terminal, which you don't want to be eaten away.


If the sacrificial metal is completely submerged, consider using another wire as a mediator/connection between it and the car battery charger lead to keep the charger terminal and connection dry.

, The electrolysis process will gradually start working away at the rust. Let it sit for 12-20 hours.



Caution: If you ever want to check the status of your rusted object, be sure to turn off and unplug the battery charger first. You will see bubbles rise to the surface and muck gather at the surface. Both of these things are normal.

, When taken out, your rusted object should be rust-free, but still in need of some cleaning. Use a Scotch Brite pad to remove any sludge on the object and a bristle brush to clean those harder to reach spots.

Purchase a chemical rust remover.,
Apply the solution.,
Rinse with water and dry.,
Scrape off any remaining rust.,
Repeat the process if necessary.",How to Remove Rust and Corrosion5," Yes, they exist, but often the main component is some form of acid which can cause the fumes to be toxic or semi-toxic. The rust removers can be purchased at any hardware supply store and some auto body shops.


Some optional brands include Evapo-rust, Metal Rescue Rust Remover Bath (safe on paint, plastics, and skin), Acid Magic, The Works (20% HCL, hydrochloric acid), The Works Basic (9.5% HCL, hydrochloric acid) and WD-40 (light weight oil).
Use protective wear when handling commercial rust removers. Protective wear includes goggles, gloves, and a face mask or respirator.

, This is where the rubber really hits the road. You want to give the cleaners time and elbow grease to work their magic. You can do this in several different ways:

Some chemical solutions come already in a spray containers. Spray lightly and accurately onto rust and let sit overnight for heavy rust.






Other solutions need to be applied by using a brush. Scrape off any rust that can be easily removed and evenly apply the solution. Let sit overnight.






Another method is total submersion. If an item is small enough, find a plastic paint bucket or other container and place the rusted item in it. Pour enough rust remover solution to completely submerge it and let it sit overnight.







, Try to get as much of the commercial rust remover off your item as possible. Hit the item with a blowdryer, if possible, so that the item is completely dry and rust is discouraged from returning.

, Most of the rust should have been loosened overnight and the remainder should come off easily.

, The amount of wait time necessary to remove the rust depends on the item in question, how badly it is rusted, and how well the store bought product works. Sometimes the metal needs to be treated with the solution more than once, particularly if the rust is on a vertically standing object.

Scrub the area.,
Rinse and dry the area.",How to Clean Rust Off Stainless Steel2," If it’s in your sink, for instance, pour water over it. If the rust is on a vertical surface, use a spray bottle filled with water and spray it down., If your rusty stainless steel is on a countertop or other horizontally-oriented surface, this should be easy. If your rusty stainless steel is on a vertically-oriented area, place a tray or a layer of newspaper below the rusty area. Dip your fingertips in the baking soda and flick it at the wet, rusty area. The baking soda should stick to the dampened rusty area.After applying the baking soda, wait 30-60 minutes.

, Use a soft-bristled brush, a sponge, or an old toothbrush to clean the rust from the stainless steel by rubbing or scrubbing. Move the brush or sponge in the direction of the stainless steel grain., Once the rust has come loose, rinse the stainless steel or wipe it with a damp paper towel. Dry the area with a dry paper towel or microfiber dish cloth."

Apply a liquid cleaner containing oxalic acid to the rust.,
Wipe the cleaning agent using a sponge.,
Rinse the formerly rusty area.,
Do not use abrasive cleaners.",How to Clean Rust Off Stainless Steel3," Oxalic acid is a heavy-duty cleaning ingredient that will help you remove even the most serious rust spots. Spray the rusty stainless steel with the cleaning solution and wait about 60 seconds (or for however long the oxalic acid product recommends).Oxalic acid is a common ingredient in cleaning solutions like Krud Kutter and Bar Keepers Friend.

, About 60 seconds after applying the cleaning agent, dampen a sponge. Rub the rusty spot in the direction of the stainless steel grain., When the rust has been cleaned, rinse the area with fresh water (or spray with a squirt bottle). Gently dry the stainless steel using a clean towel., When dealing with rust that just won’t seem to come off, you might be tempted to use really heavy-duty cleaning products. However, avoid this temptation to avoid damaging your stainless steel. Only use the liquid cleaners, not cleaning solutions that contain grit. Additionally, avoid cleaning solutions that combine oxalic acid with chlorides (chlorine, bromine, fluorine, iodine, and so on)."

Gather steel wool, sandpaper, a wire brush, or a crumpled ball of tinfoil.,
Put your back into it!,
Use an electric sander for larger pieces of tinware.",How to Clean Rust and Stains from a Tin1," These easy-to-find items can brush away small rust stains with ease. There's no reason to attempt more involved methods for lighter areas of rust when you can rub them away with common household items.;
, Vigorously scrub your tinware with one of these items using a back and forth motion. You need to put a decent amount of pressure on the tin to effectively clear away the rust.

, A grinder outfitted with a grinding wheel, stripping or flap disc can easily remove larger areas of rust. There are important factors to consider before using an electric sander.


Sanders, flap discs and fiber discs work best on long, flat patches of rust. In contrast, wire wheels are suggested for corners and curved areas.
Make sure the grinder is constantly moving so it doesn't puncture or wear away the tin. Consider using a mouse detail sander for smaller areas.
Always begin with the coarsest grain and carefully move to smaller grains as the rust wears away.
If there is significant scratching left on the tinware try using a fine grain sandpaper to smooth out any of the remaining marks. "

Find and plug in a blow dryer.,
Blow dry the wax until it melts.,
Wipe it away.,
Get rid of leftover residue.,
If necessary, repeat.",How to Remove Candle Wax1," In this method, a blow dryer is used to re-heat and melt the candle wax so that it be easily wiped up. This method is a great choice for hard surfaces like tabletops and candlesticks. It's not quite as good of a choice for fabrics, especially if the wax is colored, as melting the wax without immediately soaking it up can cause the stain to spread.;
, Set your blow dryer to a ""hot"" setting and use it to heat up the wax. As you do so, try not blow the wax around - it's easier to wipe up if it's all in one puddle, rather than spread out.

, Use a cheap cloth or paper towel to wipe away the melted wax. Wax can be difficult to get out of the cloth or towel you use to wipe up the mess, so be sure not to use your ""nice"" towels. An old rag or a disposable paper towel will do the trick.

, If there's a film of wax left over, get rid of it with a little spray cleaner and a damp rag or sponge. All-purpose cleaning fluid works fine. If you're working on a fragile surface (like, for example, a fine wooden tabletop), be sure not to damage your surface with an abrasive rag or sponge.

, If, after wiping and scrubbing, any lingering bits of wax remain, try melting them again with the blow dryer and wiping them up, then using spray cleaner again. Repeat until clean.

Pre-clean the concrete.,
After initial pre-cleaning, let the concrete dry completely.

,
Using a 1:2 dilution ratio (1 part water to 2 parts F9 BARC), apply the F9 BARC through pump up sprayer liberally and evenly to the entire pad of concrete.,
Let concrete dry.,
If spots remain follow directions in #3 again.,
Let concrete dry.,
A natural by-product of the reaction of this product and the concrete are light and dark mineral salts.",How to Clean Rust Stain Off Concrete," Power wash concrete using a commercial grade pressure washer, degreaser and surface cleaner.  An alkaline concrete cleaner may be used. Rinse well.  Cleaning the concrete first will open up the pores of the concrete and allow F9 BARC to soak in deeper and remove more of the orange battery stain than just applying F9 BARC alone.;
,,  Do not “spot spray” on your first application. Use a circular overlapping spray motion. Spray from one side of the concrete pad to the other using a fine mist up to a uniform spray. High pressure low volume at 60-70 psi is recommended. Apply from control joint to control joint on the entire pad of concrete. Apply a bit more product on the areas with more staining. Apply as evenly and as thick as possible without letting F9 BARC run down the concrete. If F9 BARC does run down the concrete leave it alone. F9 BARC should begin to turn white and foam slightly.

, Stains will disappear as concrete dries.

, If not, proceed to #7. It is better to go heavier on the first application and lighter on the second application. On the second application you may use less product on the areas with less staining and more product on the areas with stains remaining. It is acceptable to mist-spray on this application.

, Stains will disappear as concrete dries.

, Wet the concrete with water to reactivate the F9 cleaner. While wet, lightly broom the concrete to help F9 penetrate the concrete even deeper. Do not let concrete dry. Rinse lightly with a pressure washer to remove remaining surfactant. Do not use a surface cleaner here. Allow concrete to dry completely and evaluate results.

Find white vinegar or lemon and salt.,
Soak the tinware in white vinegar.,
Pour lemon juice onto the rust.,
Wipe off the lemon juice or vinegar with a cloth.,
Wash the tinware.,
For extra tough rust, mix the lemon juice and vinegar.",How to Clean Rust and Stains from a Tin2," Either of these materials work well for removing rust as their acidic properties help to dissolve the stain. White vinegar (acetic acid) and lemon juice (citric acid) are both weak acids, which loosen the iron oxide (rust).

, Find a plastic container deep enough to ensure your tinware can fit. Cover the tinware in white vinegar for roughly 24 hours until the rust has dissolved.


Be sure to use enough white vinegar to submerge the tinware. If you don't have enough white vinegar to cover the entirety of the object, you can soak a clean cloth in vinegar and wipe the tin.
Scrub the rust off of the tinware using a rough sponge or aluminum foil,
The longer you soak your tinware, the easier it will be to scrub the rust off. It's still effective to submerge the object in vinegar for a few hours, but prepared for putting some extra work to remove the rust.

, Initially, only start with about a tablespoon of lemon juice. You may have to use more lemon juice for larger areas of rust, but start small first so you're not over-saturating the area with citric acid.


Apply the lemon juice first so the salt will stick. Make sure to have lemon juice leftover to reapply after you pour the salt.
Add the salt. Start with roughly half of a teaspoon of coarse salt (or table salt will do the trick) and apply it to the rust stain. Make sure the salt is sticking and that you used enough to thoroughly coat the rust stain.
Reapply the lemon juice. Add the same amount of lemon juice you used initially and pour it onto salt. The lemon's natural acidity makes it a great candidate for dissolving rust.

, Make sure you use a clean cloth so no other contaminants get onto the stain. Thoroughly rinse the stain afterwards and scrub vigorously to remove any remaining rust.

, It's very important to clean the surface with water after the rust has dissolved. If any vinegar or lemon juice is left on the tinware the acidity could damage the metal. , The acidity of both products work in tandem for a potent method of rust removal. The lingering lemon smell will leave your tinware with a fresh citrus scent.

Cut a potato in half.,
Rub the cut potato edge over the rust or stain.,
Remove the potato and thoroughly clean the rust stain.",How to Clean Rust and Stains from a Tin4," Find a medium-sized potato and slice it in half. Coat the cut end with dish soap or environmentally friendly cleaning powder. The soap causes a chemical reaction that helps to remove the rust stain.

, Work the stain vigorously with the cut potato edge until the rust has been removed. Remember you need to apply a significant amount of force in order to effectively scrub away the rust.


If you need to reapply the potato, simply cut off the soapy edge and apply the dish soap to the new edge of the cut potato.
A mixture of baking soda and water can be substituted for the dish soap if necessary.
If the rust stain is small, you can simply leave the potato over the spot for a few hours.

, Use steel wool or a coarse cloth to make you have enough friction to remove the remaining stain. Give the tinware ample time to dry.

Set an iron to medium heat.,
Layer towels over the wax.,
Place the iron on the kitchen towel.,
Replace paper towels as necessary.,
Turn off the iron.,
Remove any remaining color with a carpet cleaner.",How to Remove Candle Wax2," This method is similar to the blow dryer method in that it removes dried candle wax by melting it. However, this method differs in that it allows you to soak up wax as it melts, rather than wipe it up when it's all melted. Because of this, it's a great choice for wax that's stuck to fabric or clothing.


Though it's obvious, one thing bears mentioning: as you should during any occasion that calls for a hot iron, use caution with this method. Handle the iron with care - if you're unsure whether it's hot or not, flick a little water at it, rather than touching it. Never leave hot irons unattended, especially not face down.

, As your iron heats, put paper towels on top of the troublesome wax, making sure that they are as large or larger than the iron. Cover the layer of paper towels with a fabric kitchen towel.

, Gently rub the iron back and forth as you would if you were ironing clothes. This will gradually heat and melt the wax, which will be absorbed by the layer of paper towels as it melts. Keeping the iron in constant, gentle motion prevents it from burning your towel.

, Periodically remove the iron and towels to check your progress. If your paper towels start to appear saturated with liquid wax, discard them and replace them with new paper towels. Repeat until the wax is fully absorbed.


Replacing saturated paper towels is important. If you allow your paper towels to become completely soaked with wax and continue working, you'll start to spread hot wax around the fabric, rather than soaking it up. This can make the stain caused by wax bigger, which you definitely don't want.

, When you seem not to be making any more progress on your candle wax, you may turn off your iron and discard your paper towels. Be patient - this can take upwards of ten minutes. When you've soaked up all the wax you can, all that should remain is a slight discoloration in the fabric (assuming the candle was made from colored wax).

, To get any lingering discoloration out of your fabric, switch to a carpet or fabric cleaner. Use an appropriate cleaner - one that won't damage your fabric - and scrub gently with a wet rag after allowing the cleaner to soak in.

Get a canister of compressed air.,
Blow the air on the wax to cool it.,
Scrape away the wax.,
Follow up with all-purpose cleaner.,
If you're having trouble, use ice.",How to Remove Candle Wax3," Unlike the above methods, this method involves cooling rather than heating dried wax to make it easier to chip or scrape off of a surface. This method is a great choice if the wax is on a hard surface, such as a table or counter top, especially if the wax is too soft and gel-like to easily remove, but not liquid enough to wipe away or soak up. This also works well on non-washable fabrics like rayon and silk.


Canned air is available at most office supply stores. It's also commonly kept in any place where computers are used, like office buildings and schools, as it's often used to clean computers.

, Spray the wax with compressed air. The cool, rapidly-moving air should gradually cause the wax to cool and stiffen, becoming more brittle.

, Once the wax has hardened, use the edge of a credit card (or another similar stiff plastic item) to scrape it off. The wax should easily separate from the surface it's attached to, chipping off in brittle chunks. Repeat the blowing and scraping processes as needed.


It can be tempting to do so, but don't use a metal object (like a knife) to scrape. Metal can gouge or scratch the surface you're trying to remove the wax from, permanently marring its surface.

, When you've scraped as much wax away as you possibly can, you may notice a thin film or residue remaining. Use a little all-purpose cleaner and a wet rag to quickly soak this up and leave your surface like new.

, Using ice to freeze some stubborn wax can create minor puddles, but it's quicker and even more effective than canned air. Grab an ice cube with a rag and rub the wax, touching the ice directly to it. The colder wax gets, the more brittle it becomes, so you should have even greater success when scraping it away.

Clean up the area where the plastic or wax had been.",How to Clean Up Melted Plastic and Wax1," Be careful while doing this step, because overheating the stain can make it worse. The trick is to make the mess malleable, because it won’t budge while it is hardened.If the mess is in the oven, preheat the oven at the very lowest heat setting. Stay by the oven to make sure the stain doesn’t overheat and start smoking.
If the stain is on another hard surface like a table or wood floor, try using a hair dryer to warm the substance.;
, The plastic or wax should have softened with the heat, and you can begin scraping it off with a flat, sharp edge. This will require some elbow grease, but be careful not to scratch or chip the surface you are cleaning.


If you do not have a putty knife, you can use a butter knife or a razor blade.

, If there isn’t much of a mess left, this can be achieved with mild soap and a damp rag. In the case of more persistent stains, you may want to use a more heavy-duty surface cleaner and a rough sponge or scrubber."

Add a few ice cubes in a plastic sandwich bag and apply it to the surface of the wax. Chilling the wax will cause it to become brittle and easier to chip away.If the wax is on a pillow or removable fabric, consider putting the fabric in the freezer for better results.

, Using a butter knife, gently scrape the excess wax off of the fabric. Be careful to not use too much force as you could damage the fabric. You probably will not be able to remove all of the wax from the upholstery at this time.

By getting as much of the mess off as you can manually, you’ll allow the cleaners to work best. After you’ve chipped away at the mess as best you can, allow it to cool.

, Plastic is soluble in acetone, so this can be effective in removing the nasty stain.Acetone is found in most nail polish removers, which can be found at your local pharmacy.Be careful, acetone can stain certain surfaces. If you think acetone is your best option for removing the melted plastic or wax, try testing it out a small- and preferably hidden- spot first. This could be the underside of the table you're working with, or a part of the floor that is usually covered with furniture. See how the acetone reacts before dousing your stain with it.Make sure that there is absolutely no acetone left on the surface. Acetone is highly flammable, and if there is acetone left over on your surface, especially if that surface is a stovetop or oven, you could have a larger problem on your hands than a little melted plastic., Once the acetone has soaked into the melted remains, it should be pretty pliable. With a little bit of force from your knife, it should come right off., This is only necessary if there is still remaining plastic or wax. WD-40 is a lubricating & penetrating spray product that can be used to remove the leftover gunk by dissolving its bond with the hard surface.Like you did with the acetone, test the WD-40 on a smaller, out-of-the-way spot before applying it to the stain.

Grab your iron and plug it into an outlet near the stain.,
Cover the stain with a paper bag.,
Gently iron over the paper.,
Gently peel the paper bag off the fabric or carpet.,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Clean Up Melted Plastic and Wax3," Set it to the highest heat setting. If it has a steam setting, turn this off. A dry heat is best for removing the melted plastic or wax., An alternative for the brown paper bag is wax paper. Be careful not to use thin paper, as it can overheat the plastic or wax and cause a worse mess. Avoid paper with any writing on it, because the heat can cause the ink to transfer onto the fabric or carpet., Don’t push down too hard or stay on one section too long, because you do not want the substance to melt farther into the carpet or fabric. The goal is to get the plastic or wax to stick to the bag.

, This should be done while the paper is still warm from the iron. The plastic or wax should stick to the paper, leaving the surface clean.

, If there are still bits stuck to the carpet afterwards, try gently scrubbing the area with a carpet or fabric cleaner. The remaining pieces may budge with a little bit of friction.

Warm up an iron.,
Place a brown paper bag over the wax.,
Repeat several times.,
Remove any stains.",How to Remove Wax from Upholstery2," Plug in a clothes iron and let it warm up to a medium heat setting. Read the fabric’s label to ensure that the fabric is iron safe. If the fabric does not have a label, test the iron on a small, inconspicuous spot before applying the heat to a larger area., Iron the brown paper bag. The iron will begin to melt the wax and transfer it from the fabric to the paper bag.A clean rag can be used in place of a paper bag; however, the wax is likely to remain on the cloth after washing.
Be careful to use a paper bag without any writing. The ink from the print will transfer and stain the upholstery. If you use a paper bag from a store with a label, cut the label off of the bag before use.

, Move the paper bag and repeat the process until all of the wax has transferred from the upholstery to the bag., Use an upholstery or carpet cleaner to remove any residual stains after the wax is lifted. Spray the stain and let the cleaner sit for one minute. Then, carefully blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel. Repeat this process until the stain is gone."
"
Heat the stain with a hairdryer.,
Apply WD-40.,
Use dish detergent.",How to Remove Wax from Upholstery3," If you do not have an iron available, a hairdryer can have the same effect. Use the hairdryer to melt the wax and then carefully lay the brown paper bag on top of the wax. The paper bag will begin to absorb the warm wax. Repeat the process until all of the wax has been transferred.Use a blank paper bag or clean rag for this method as well.

, WD-40 breaks down the wax and makes it softer and easier to clean off of upholstery. Gently scrub the solution into the fabric and wipe away with a clean rag or sponge. Use warm water to clean the solution from the fabric once all of the wax is removed.Test the WD-40 on an inconspicuous portion of the fabric before using it on a more noticeable section.

, Combine the dish detergent with warm water in a small container. Dish detergent is designed to break down grease and, in some cases, can break down the wax. Gently scrub the wax with a clean sponge or rag and then let dry."

Open the valve cover.,
Insert the pump.,
If using an automatic pump, turn it on.,
If using a manual pump, start pumping.,
Screw the latch back on.",How to Inflate an Air Mattress1," Most air mattresses have either a one-way air valve (which allows air to easily enter the mattress but not leave it) or a simple hole somewhere on the side of the mattress. Your first step should be to locate this and remove the protective cap — you can't put any air inside the mattress without an opening to do so.


Note that some modern mattresses have pumps built into the side of the mattress. In this case, simply flip the ""on"" switch, and, provided the pump is receiving power either from an outlet or batteries, it will start to inflate the mattress.;
, Whether you're using an electric pump or a manual one, your next step is the same: insert the pump's nozzle into the hole or valve opening. The pump should make a tight seal with the material around the valve. If it doesn't, there's a chance that air may escape around the pump, making it harder to fully inflate the mattress.


If you can't get a tight seal around the pump (for instance, if you're using a pump that wasn't made for the mattress), you may want to try laying duct tape around the pump to keep it seated in the valve, though this can be ineffective if the pump is very loose. Another option is to melt plastic around the pump to make it thicker and give it a tighter seal, though this can present challenges for novice repair experts., Most modern air mattresses come pre-packaged with an electric air pump. If this is what you're using, make sure it's plugged in or has battery power, then turn it on! The mattress should immediately begin to inflate.


Note that electric pumps are usually quite loud, so you may want to be careful about running them around where others are sleeping.

, If you're working with an older air mattress or you lost your electric pump and had to buy a replacement, you may only have a manual pump at your disposal. Though these aren't as quick and effortless as electric pumps, they're usually quite effective in their own right. The two main types of manual pumps used for inflating air mattresses are:


Hand pumps: Usually large, standing pumps operated with an ""up-and-down"" motion. However, smaller hand-operated bicycle-style pumps are occasionally used.
Foot pumps: Usually take the form of a foot pedal attached to a hose and nozzle; stepping on the pedal repeatedly forces air into the mattress.

, Once the mattress is filled to the point that it is fully inflated and firm to the touch, remove the pump, then screw the valve or hole cap back on to trap the air inside. You're now ready to sleep! Grab some sheets, blankets, and pillows.


Note that air mattresses with one-way valves will automatically trap air inside. It's still a good idea to screw the cap back on for these mattresses to provide another layer of protection against deflation. Mattresses with simple air holes (and no valves), on the other hand, will immediately begin to deflate as soon as the pump is removed, so you'll need to screw the cap back on quickly!

Make the bed.",How to Clean a Mattress," Before you can clean the mattress, you must remove everything that’s covering it. Start by removing the top layer of items, including pillows, decorative pillows, blankets, toys, and other objects.When you remove your pillows for sleeping, take the pillow cases off and throw them in the laundry basket.
Fold up blankets and move items from the bed to a different part of the room so they're out of the way when you clean.;
, Once all the decorative items, pillows, and covers are off the bed, remove any sheets that are covering the mattress. This includes top sheets, fitted sheets, and any mattress protector you may have installed.


Throw fabric sheets into the laundry basket along with the pillow cases., When everything is off the bed and the mattress is bare, you can begin the cleaning process. Wash the sheets, linens, and pillow cases in the washing machine while the mattress is being cleaned. That way, you'll start with a completely fresh bed.


Read and follow care labels when washing any fabrics. Use the hottest water and dryer settings possible to kill any bacteria or dust mites that may be hiding in your linens.If you use a duvet, remove the cover and wash it with the linens as well.

, The first step to cleaning your mattress is vacuuming. This will remove mites, dust, dead skin, hair, and other debris from the mattress. Use a wide brush attachment to vacuum the top of the mattress. Use the long upholstery nozzle to get into cracks, to vacuum edges and piping, and to clean the sides and corners.


Before vacuuming, make sure the nozzle and brush attachments are completely clean., Any recent spills that are still wet should be cleaned immediately. Get a clean cloth damp with cold water. Blot the spill with the damp cloth. Do not rub or scrub the spill, as this can push it farther into the mattress. Keep blotting until you’ve absorbed all the excess liquid., Combine 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid dish soap in a small bowl. Use a spoon to stir them together and creates suds. Dip an old toothbrush into the suds. Gently scrub the suds into affected areas of the mattress. Wipe away excess cleaner with a clean, damp cloth.For a memory foam mattress, use only the smallest amount of cleaner possible, because memory foam should never get wet.
This solution will be effective to treat stains from dirt, food, drinks.

, Spray some enzyme cleaner onto a clean cloth. Blot the stain with the cloth to saturate it. Let the enzyme cleaner sit for about 15 minutes. Blot the area with the same cloth to remove the stain. Blot the area with a clean cloth that’s damp with cold water.


Don’t spray liquid cleaners directly onto the mattress. Mattresses aren't designed to get wet, especially memory foam, so use as little cleaner as necessary to treat the stains.
An enzyme cleaner will break down the proteins in blood, urine, sweat, vomit, and other biological stains. It will also be effective at treating grease and oil stains., Once you’ve dealt with stains, you can clean and deodorize the entire mattress. To do this, sprinkle a generous dusting of baking soda over the entire surface of the mattress.To give your mattress a fresh smell, stir five drops of your favorite essential oil into the baking soda before sprinkling it onto the mattress.
To apply the baking soda more evenly, pour it into a sifter first, and distribute it over the mattress using the sifter.

, Let the baking soda sit on the mattress for at least 30 minutes. This will give it time to break down acids, absorb smells, and absorb any liquid left over from your spot cleaning.You can leave the baking soda on for several hours if you have the time. The longer it’s on the mattress, the more it will absorb and clean.

, When the baking soda has had time to sit, vacuum the mattress to remove the baking soda. You'll take acids, odors, and liquid that the baking soda has absorbed along with it. Use the brush to cover the top of the mattress, and the long nozzle to get into corners, cracks, seams, and piping., Once the mattress is clean, it’s a good idea to let it air out for a while so any liquid left in the mattress can dry out. Moisture that’s trapped inside the mattress can lead to mold, and this will be very difficult to remove.


During the warmer seasons, open a window in the room to let in fresh air and dry out the mattress faster.
You can also open drapes and curtains to let in the sunshine, as the UV rays in the sun will help kill bacteria and mold on the mattress, eliminate odors even more, and dry it out faster., For conventional mattresses that don’t have a designated top and bottom, turn the mattress over so you're sleeping on the other side. For mattresses that do have a designated top and bottom, rotate the mattress 180 degrees. This will ensure even wear over the surface of the mattress.


You should flip or rotate your mattress every three to six months to ensure even wear., A mattress protector is a plastic case that you can use to keep your mattress safe. You slip the case over the mattress like you would with a duvet and duvet cover. Then close the zipper to seal the mattress and protect it from spills, dust, dirt, stains, and even bed bugs.


There are also mattress pads and covers you can buy to protect just the top of the mattress from spills and dirt., When the mattress is clean, dry, flipped, and protected, you can make the bed with your clean linens. Start with the fitted sheet, followed by the top sheet. Put the pillows back in their cases, and return all pillows, blankets, and decorations to the bed as well.


Feel the mattress all over before making the bed to check for moisture. If you encase a damp mattress in linens and blankets, it won’t dry out and you'll have mold growth."

Use a powdered cleanser like Comet, Ajax, Bon Ami, or Bar Keeper’s Friend. Scrub at the crayon stains in your dryer. Rub hard to work the crayon out., Sprinkle your powdered cleanser onto a dampened toothbrush. Scrub with the toothbrush in any cracks and corners where the crayon might have wedged itself. Add more cleanser to the head of your toothbrush as needed to really scrub at the crayon.

, Dip a clean sponge or rag into water. Use this to wipe off the loose crayon wax. Wipe any chunks of crayon off of the sponge or rag and wet it again. Now use it to wipe off any powdered cleanser still in your dryer.

, Be sure that you have rinsed all the powdered cleanser out of the dryer before you start the process again. You might need to begin by running the dryer for another 15 minutes. This will loosen any stubborn crayon wax. Scrub and rinse.


Test your dryer's cleanliness on some old clothes or white rags to check that there are no stains left.

Continue to saturate your rag as you go across the table.You can use a toothbrush if you are having problems lifting the wax.

, As you work the mineral spirits into the wood, the old wax will transform into a black gunk. Use a dry rag to remove the gunk before rinsing the table. Use a rag saturated with plain water to rinse the table., Use a dry cloth to buff the water and mineral spirits off the table. The wax finish should now be removed.

Wipe the wax off with a damp cloth or rag.",How to Dewax a Table4," You can also place a bag of ice cubes or frozen vegetables over the wax. Getting the wax cold will harden it and make it easier to scrape off of your table., Use a dull instrument like a credit card so that you don't chip or scratch the surface of your table. Push the credit card under the wax and try to work it off the table. If it helps, break the wax up into smaller pieces to make it more manageable., Putting a cotton rag over the top of the remaining wax will protect the surface of the table from the heat that you apply to it. Lay the cloth over the portion of the table that still has wax on it., Use a hairdryer or iron and apply heat to the cloth that's lying over the wax. Go over the area with the wax in a back and forth motion, making sure not to apply heat to a single area for too long. Continue to apply heat the area that has wax for five minutes. Doing this will heat up the wax and make it easier to remove.Applying heat to one part of the table for an extended period of time can damage the finish on your table.

, Lift up the rag that you used to protect the table top to uncover the melted wax. If the wax is still solid, put the rag back down and continue heating it until it melts. You should be able to then remove the wax easily by wiping it down with a damp rag or cloth."

Use a hair dryer if there is no pump available.,
Use a vacuum cleaner or shop vac.,
Use a bike or tire pump.,
Use a garbage bag.,
Inflate it with your breath if all else fails.",How to Inflate an Air Mattress2," If you don't have any pump to inflate your mattress with, don't worry — it's possible to use common household items to do the trick. For instance, you may want to try using an electric hair dryer. Simply turn the hair dryer on and hold it against the open valve hole to begin filling the mattress. Because the hair dryer won't perfectly fit your mattress's air hole, the inflation process will usually be slower than when using a pump.


Be sure to use cool air, not hot air, if you have a choice. Most air mattresses are made from plastic or vinyl, which can sometimes melt or deform if exposed to high heat.

, Any sort of machine that can be made to blow air can conceivably be used to inflate an air mattress. For example, many shop vacuums have a ""blow"" function in addition to their ordinary ""suck"" function. Other tools, like snow blowers or leaf blowers, are specifically made for blowing. With a tools like these, all you need to do is hold the nozzle or blower up to the air hole or valve and blow to inflate the mattress.


It's even possible to convert some ordinary home vacuum cleaners to blow air instead of sucking it up. To do this, remove the bag and connect a long, narrow cleaning nozzle to the hole that the bag was originally attached to — air will shoot out of this nozzle and can be used to inflate your mattress., If you've biked or driven to the place where you're using your air mattress, you may have a pump handy and not even know it. Many standard bike and tire pumps can be used to inflate an air mattress. However, getting a tight seal around the pump nozzle can sometimes prove tricky. You may need to use a suitable adapter nozzle or increase the width of the pump's existing nozzle with extra material to make it suitable for use with your air mattress.

, Most people don't know that it's possible to inflate an air mattress with nothing more than a standard-size plastic garbage bag. To do this, first open the bag and swing it up and down to catch plenty of air. Gather up the open end of the bag to trap the air inside. Bring the bag up to your mattress's air hole and hold the open end of the bag around it. Squeeze the bag to force the air out and into the mattress (it's often easiest to do this by slowly laying on the bag). Repeat as needed.


If you have a choice, use heavy-duty trash bags for this method. Weaker bags are vulnerable to popping under your weight

, If you can't find any of the objects above to help you inflate your mattress, take a deep breath and try the old-fashioned way. Use soap or sanitizer to ensure the mattress's air hole is clean, then simply put your mouth against it and exhale. Repeat until the mattress is full and firm — using your mouth, this can take some time.


If your air mattress doesn't have a one-way valve, you'll need to keep your mouth pressed into the air hole and close your throat to keep air from escaping between breaths. Breathe through your nose to fill your lungs rather than using your mouth.

"
"
Unscrew the valve cover.,
Fold or roll the mattress to force air out.,
To save time, use a vacuum.",How to Inflate an Air Mattress3," When you're done sleeping on your air mattress and want to stow it for storage, unscrew the air hole cover. If your mattress has a simple air hole, it will immediately begin to deflate. However, more complicated models may require slightly more action on your part. If your mattress doesn't immediately start deflating, try one of the following tips:Look for an air-release switch to flip
Turn an air-release mechanism on the valve to let air escape
Unscrew the valve itself from its housing

, As air drains from your mattress, it will eventually settle into a mostly-deflated state. To get all of the air out, start to fold or roll the mattress starting from the end opposite the air hole and moving towards it. This will ensure that the mattress takes up a minimum of space when it's completely deflated.


To force absolutely all of the air out of the mattress, try making small, tight folds or rolls like you might do to force toothpaste out of its tube.

, If you'd like to speed up the deflating process, try using a vacuum to quickly pull air out of the mattress. You can use an ordinary home vacuum, a shop vacuum, or any other machine that can create a suction for this purpose. Simply open the air hole, wait for air to begin leaving the mattress, and hold the vacuum hose or nozzle over the hole to speed up the deflation.

Run a load of clean rags through a drying cycle.",How to Clean Crayon out of a Dryer2," Don’t spray the WD-40 directly in the dryer because it is flammable. Scrub at the crayon stains with the rag. Continue wiping until the marks lift off.


Avoid using this method in a dryer with a pilot light.

, Discard the rag with the WD-40. Get some paper towels wet and soapy. Use these to remove any oily residue in your dryer., After you wipe out the oil, unplug your dryer. Dip a sponge or clean rag into a bucket of warm soapy water. Wash the entire inside of your dryer. Focus on wiping down the areas where you rubbed most with the WD-40. Use a clean rag to wipe the inside of the dryer., Finish cleaning your dryer with a load of clean, wet rags. This will also collect any stray crayon pieces. Check the drum of the dryer for any streaks of crayon after you run the load. If you see more crayon, repeat the WD-40 cleaning process."

Wipe over the marks with a rag or paper towel. Let it dry, then wipe off the areas you’ve cleaned with a dry rag or paper towel.

, Scrub the crayon marks with the coated paper towel. Use a toothbrush coated with a bit of Cerama Bryte to get into any cracks where the crayon might have wedged itself. Once all crayon is removed, wipe the dryer clean with warm, damp cloths.


Load the dryer with old towels and let run for 15 minutes.

, Put a few drops of olive oil on the corner of a clean rag. Wipe at the stains with the olive oil. Repeat this process, applying olive oil to clean sections of the rag until you’ve rubbed over all of the stains. Dip a fresh, damp rag into water that has been combined with a few drops of liquid dish detergent. Use this rag to clean the areas of your dryer that you rubbed with oil."
"
Gather all the cleaning supplies.,
Clean the opposite area of the home from where your significant other is cleaning.,
Act confused about how to clean something if you get busted for not cleaning.,
Hide piles of clothes, papers and other junk underneath beds and behind furniture.,
Pretend that it takes you a really long time to clean––which is why nothing is very clean.,
Don’t do a very good job when you clean.,
Take frequent breaks.,
Don't be alarmed when ""the talk"" happens.",How to Pretend to Clean the House," Look industrious by stocking up on supplies like furniture polish, glass cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner and lots and lots of rags. If you look serious, your partner may leave you alone for a while, thinking that you’ve gotten the message and are going to get to work.


Find a bucket to carry your supplies. Don't forget to include brushes, rubber gloves and rags along with your cleaning fluids. If you keep a variety of cleaning supplies nearby it will be easy for you to spring into action with the appropriate cleaner while you're playing Xbox or watching the game. In fact, traipse a glove here, a scrubbing brush there and a bottle of cleaner right over there so that it looks like something is happening if your partner walks in suddenly.
Wear your “cleaning day” clothing. Find your raggiest outfit and old sneakers to get down and dirty. Or don an apron. Again, serious clothes send a serious message that you're ready to get the job done.
Locate the vacuum cleaner, and any other cleaning supplies, such as the floor polisher or carpet steam cleaner. You may not need to use any of these machines, but simply having knowledge of where they are may score points with your lady or man. Look for the on/off switches, as some noise will be helpful in convincing your more organized half that you're pitching in.;
, Make him or her think you're cleaning by never being in the same room together. The last thing you want are any witnesses to your lack of cleaning. If you have kids, don’t allow them to be with you (you never know if they may sing). Try not to clean in the next room; aim to be at the extreme other end of the house so he or she can’t hear/smell/see you not cleaning.

, At some point your work may be checked and you could be busted for just standing in the room doing nothing (or playing Party Poker on the computer). If you aren’t fast enough to make your significant other think you're cleaning (by having cleaner and a rag in your hand the minute he or she appears in the doorway), you're going to have to play dumb. Here are some quick responses:


“I was just going to clean the piano but couldn’t figure out what type of cleaner to use. I read once how ivory keys can disintegrate.” Act as if you're putting thought into how to clean a certain piece of furniture but don’t want to make a mistake that could ruin the piece. A move like this could motivate your partner to “show” you how to clean it by cleaning it her/himself. Of course, there is a limit of one time per piece to this fake dumbness!
“I never learned how to mop the floor.” Put the blame on your parents, school or ex for not showing you what to do. Even though you were in charge of mopping the kitchen floor after dinner while growing up, he or she doesn’t need to know. However, be aware that this excuse will wear thin pretty quickly, as cleaning doesn't require a degree in physics.
“I really don't know where to start.” If you're in a particularly messy room, act like you're so overwhelmed with the mess you don't know where to start. Even though this method may prompt your partner to just spring into action, exercise caution with your state of confusion––you could end up with a checklist instead or even worse, your partner may produce an empty trash bag that gets filled with your stuff.
If you're using the “I’m too confused or don’t know how to clean” tactic, act very interested when your significant other attempts to “show” you how to clean something. Give him/her your full attention so they are convinced you'll understand for the future.

, Give the illusion that you cleaned by just shoving piles of dirty clothes or items underneath the bed. However, if you plan to do this, make sure you won’t be revealed for your method:


Make sure the bed has a skirt. A bed without a skirt will quickly reveal what you’ve done and you’ll have to drag everything out from underneath and start over.
Choose an armoire or piece of furniture with a solid bottom. Like with the bed skirt, select a piece of furniture that will not readily reveal your pile-o-garbage.
Don’t overload a hiding spot. You don't want items to come spilling out so disburse your “stuff” amongst different pieces of furniture.
Limit hidden items to non-perishable pieces only. Hiding food, candy or drinks underneath beds will only promote bugs, which can create a whole new level of problems for you.
Be aware that this option is sloppy rather than long-term and will be revealed very quickly. It's not that hard to put dirty clothes in the laundry basket or to move the basket in front of the washing machine, where hopefully ""someone else"" will notice it needs doing. But finding uncleaned stashes will annoy your partner intensely, so be prepared for such a consequence.

, If you give the illusion that you are a really slow and obsessively meticulous cleaner, eventually your significant other will become annoyed and do it him/herself.


Become seemingly obsessed with getting one particular item or part of the house absolutely spotless. Explain in great depth why it is so important and how much effort it needs and don't move beyond that item or area the entire time set aside for cleaning. Your partner will be caught between annoyance that nothing else got done and amazement at your dedication to that one thing!

, You know how he/she likes the house, but if you clean it to the other person’s satisfaction, guess who will be on housecleaning duty every weekend? Instead of getting the job done, only clean enough to look like you're slowly cleaning but don’t hit everything. For example, if you are in charge of the kitchen, wash out pots and pans (you can leave a little residual food behind so she/he doesn’t think you can clean out the pans properly) but “forget” to wipe down the counters or sweep the floor––even if there are bits of food and seasonings strewn across everything.


Shift furniture around so that it looks like you vacuumed/mopped/polished, etc. When your partner later realizes that dust, crumbs and fur balls are still present, they might simply assume that you're hopeless at this type of cleaning and just do it instead.
Another tactic is to use a cleaning item in a much more tortured manner than that for which it was intended. For example, tell your partner that you just don't believe the vacuum sucks properly unless you sit on the floor with it and go over every square inch manually with the hose end. You get to the sit on the floor, the job takes ages and nothing else gets done, and your partner is left wondering why on earth they asked for your contribution.

, Every ten to fifteen minutes, call out that it's break time and ask your partner if they'd like you to make them a cup of tea or coffee too. Keep this up throughout the allotted cleaning time, especially if you're spring cleaning or have a large cleaning job of a few hours' duration.


If you like baking, start baking. Producing freshly home baked goods might get you forgiven for almost anything. Some people have no problems with cleaning up kitchen mess but balk at cleaning anywhere else in the house. If so, this may be your compromise point!
Make a really delicious coffee. The aroma will waft through the house, you can invite your partner to sit down to enjoy it and have a chat and oh dear, cleaning time is over and you have to go do that errand now...

, That moment when you are sat down and every single thing you've done poorly will be commented on, along with the suspicion that you're not really trying. Since live-in relationships require a lot of compromise, it's probable that by the time of this conversation that you'll need to be prepared to accept responsibility for cleaning at least two or three things really well, so pick your ""favorites"" (hate mopping but love vacuuming perhaps?), apologize for being so slovenly with everything else but promise that these few things are now your sole responsibility and will be done regularly, beyond expectations.


At this point, you'll need to learn how to vaguely enjoy cleaning. See How to enjoy cleaning for some ideas on convincing yourself that cleaning is not so bad.
Get yourself some shiny toys in the cleaning area. Robotic mops and brooms now exist and can be entertaining, buying you some cleaning avoidance time as well as almost being in the realm of ""play"". And the more heavy duty the cleaning equipment, the better it'll work, so splash out on durable cleaning goodies, maybe even a turbo version.
Hire a cleaner. This may be the best choice you've ever made in freeing up your time and putting an end to all the excuses!
Finally, it has to be said––since you've come this far and expended so much energy on avoiding the cleaning, why not just do it instead!

Keep an eye on your comforter.,
Professionally clean your comforter only every few years.,
Remove your down comforter from the bed.,
Think about using a duvet cover.,
Use a large, front-loading washing machine.,
Wash gently.,
Use the rinse cycle twice.,
Unload the comforter.,
Consider air-drying the comforter.,
Use a dryer on a low heat setting.,
Check and fluff periodically.,
Wait until dry.",How to Clean a Down Comforter at Home," The fabric may become worn with heavy or prolonged use. Stains, rips, mold, and other undesirable conditions may arise without you noticing. Look for loose feathers: down comforters are traditionally stuffed with the fluffy undercoating of geese, ducks, and other soft birds,and a flurry of flying feathers is a telltale sign that the fabric has torn. Repair tears with a needle and a thread that matches the comforter. Spot-clean any stains as soon as they appear.;
, It is usually unnecessary to clean a down comforter more often than this – and under normal circumstances, you should not take it to a dry-cleaner much more than once a year. The exception: if the fabric becomes extremely soiled, it might be worth your while to have it professionally cleaned for the sake of your peace of mind.Be aware: some retailers claim that if you wash too often or too heavily, you can harm the interior down fluff that keeps your comforter warm. Improper washing can strip the down of its natural oils and make it less effective. Furthermore, the comforter may shrink in the wash., Whether you are washing the comforter or just rolling for lint, it is best not to clean the comforter while it's still on top of your sheets and mattress. Bring it to a clean, dry place with water-resistant floors: a laundry room, a bathroom, or a patio.

, This over-blanket or ""comforter shell"" covers up your comforter and keeps it clean. You can buy duvets to fit various comforter sizes. Duvets usually zip shut around the comforter for the sake of protection. When you notice dirt or stains, you can easily remove the duvet cover and clean it without having to worrying about the comforter.

, Down comforters tend to be bulky, and a small machine will not likely do the job. If you have a top-loading machine at home, it probably has an ""agitator"" in the center of the washing chamber, which can rip or otherwise stress the fabric of the comforter. If you don't have a large, front-loading machine at home, consider taking the comforter to a local laundromat. Laundromats tend to have heavy-duty front-loading machines available.Your comforter should not be jam-packed into the chamber. Try to find a washing machine that is large enough to fit your comforter with a bit of extra air space. This will help the water and detergent reach every part of the fabric, not just the sections that wind up on the outside of a bundle.
If you aren't sure, check the owner's manual for your washing machine. It should list the maximum comforter size that you can safely wash.If you don't have the owner's manual, run a web search for ""owner's manual"".

, When you load your comforter into the machine, add a mild laundry detergent. Use warm water and a delicate cycle; hot or cold water can damage the down.Try to submerge the comforter as completely as possible into the water.


If your comforter is white, feel free to add bleach. It's usually safe to add bleach even if the label discourages it.Consider letting the washing machine run for a minute or two before you load the comforter. This allows the detergent to blend with the water, ensuring a more even wash. This is especially important with such a bulky item – otherwise, the soap might not reach every corner!, Make sure that all of the detergent has washed out before you pull the comforter from the wash. It's better to be safe than sorry. Before the comforter hits the spin cycle, pull it out and squeeze some of the water out of it by hand. This might make the waterlogged fabric lighter and more likely to spin well.

, Once the wash cycle is complete, remove your down comforter from the washing machine. Your comforter should look flatter, smoother, and less bulky than usual.


If your comforter is white, it may look discolored when you pull it from the wash. Don't worry: it is temporary. The discoloration stems from the wet down fluff, and the clean white hue should return as the comforter dries.

, This will take longer than an electrical drying machine, but it is less likely to shrink or damage the fabric. Be patient. Down is notoriously slow to dry. Lay the comforter out in a clean, sunny area, and give it time to dry.


Avoid line-drying a down comforter. The fabric can develop mildew if it's left hanging in the breeze.
Consider using air-drying as a prep or precursor to machine-drying. Mitigate the risk of mildew by fluffing and drying the comforter in the dryer afterward.

, If you do use a drying machine, avoid setting the cycle to a high heat. White comforters can safely dry at a higher heat than can colorful comforters – but they still run the risk of shrinking. Stick to a low setting unless you are extremely pressed for time.


Toss dryer balls, a canvas sneaker shoe with no laces, or sock-covered tennis balls into the dryer along with the comforter. Any of these items can help break up the feather clumps as it dries. This should fluff the comforter, and it might speed the process., Whether you choose to air-dry or to machine dry, make sure to keep an eye on your down comforter to make sure that the process is going smoothly. Check that the fabric is drying evenly through, and not just in patches. Fluff and distribute the down by kneading and shaking the comforter.Hold up the comforter periodically and feel for clumps of down. Clumps mean that the still damp and will need longer in the dryer.

, Once the comforter is completely dry, fluff it out and place it back on your bed. The whole drying process could take anywhere from 4 to 12 hours, depending on the method and heat setting that you use. Be patient. Make sure that you have plenty of time to let the comforter settle. Once the comforter is dry, it's ready to use.

Pull off all the bed linen and let the mattress breathe.,
Vacuum the mattress.,
Get a friend to help lift the mattress.,
Leave the mattress in the sun to air for at least 3-4 hours.Leaving it out for 6 hours or more is preferable.",How to Air Out a Mattress1," Remove all clothing, sheets and even pillows from the mattress so that it is completely open to the air. If possible, open all windows and allow the sun to shine on the mattress through the window.


When the sun shines on the mattress, it will naturally purge it of many germs and bacteria.
This is the ideal time to wash your sheets and other bedding as necessary. A recommended washing time is weekly for sheets and pillowcases and quarterly for blankets and heavier bedding items.
Wash the mattress cover monthly to quarterly, depending on how dirty it appears.;
, With the mattress exposed to the fresh air, run your vacuum over the mattress to gather any dust which may have accumulated on it. You need not vacuum every time you air the mattress, but a weekly or monthly vacuuming will help to remove dust and dust mites. With the mattress vacuumed, air will more easily flow over and through the mattress, and you will reduce the amount of time needed to air it.

, You will be unable to easily maneuver your mattress outside yourself. In order to get it through your house and outside, enlist the aid of an able-bodied friend. Air the mattress outdoors as often as you have time for, but aim for once or twice a year. Get help moving it to a dry, clean spot outdoors. Make sure it is a sunny out, whether it's winter or summer.

, Don't leave the mattress out in the evening air or it will become damp. Return it to the bedroom before the sun disappears.

My name is and I’m the CNA who will be changing your sheets today. First I’ll wash my hands, and prepare the supplies. I’ll be right back, okay?”If the patient is sitting upright, ask if it is alright that you lay them down flat.;
, You may not have to replace all the bedding every day. However, you may need to change the bottom and top sheets and the pillowcase regularly. The mattress pad, bedspread and blanket can remain if they are dry and unsoiled.Bedding that is at all dirty or wet from urine, stool, blood, emesis or perspiration should be changed., Make sure there are no hearing aids, dentures, jewelry, glasses, tissues or other items in the bed before changing the linens. This way you will be able to remove soiled sheets without shaking them.Make sure no tubes are tangled in the bed sheets., Put the bed at a comfortable height, and flat if possible.Ensure that you won’t have to stretch or bend over the bed in order to replace the bedding. Put the side rails up so the occupant won’t roll out and will have something to grasp onto.If the bed does not have side rails, you will need two people for this process: one for making the bed and the other for holding the patient securely on the bed.If there are wheels on the bed, make sure that they are locked., Wash your hands and put on gloves. Have a clean surface such as a rolling table ready for holding the clean items. You can also use the overbed table as a work area.Only touch the supplies with clean hands.

Carefully roll the patient onto the clean linen.Tuck the corners and sides of the clean fitted sheet neatly under the mattress. Pull the clean linen tightly on the bed so that it’s wrinkle-free.

, This will allow you to move the patient from side to side during the process. Fold a sheet in half and stretch it across the middle of the bed to use for this purpose. Place the draw sheet on top of the bottom sheet, from the patient’s shoulders to buttocks with at least six inches of sheet left on each side.Pulling the sheet on with a helper permits you to move even a large onto their side or higher up on the mattress.

Finished.",How to Fold a Fitted Sheet," Tuck your fingertips into the corner seam at the two far ends of the sheet. This means that you should have a hand in the one of the ""foot"" corners and one of the ""head"" corners, on the same side. Make sure the sheet is inside out the whole way around (even in the corners you're not holding), with the tag-side facing away from your body.






;
, Bring the tips of your fingers together and flip one of the corners over the other, switching it to be facing right-side-out. You should now have both corners on one hand.








, You should now have a short loop of the edge on one side of your arm and a long side on the other. Put your fingers on the hem that is touching your arm (the lower of the two that you should have), and follow it down the long seam, until you reach the next corner of the sheet which you. Tuck your fingertips into the corner so that you hold it right-side-out.








, Pick up this section of the sheet and tuck it underneath the first two corners, so that the right side of the fabric is touching the inside of the group you're holding.








, All of the corners at this point should be folded together except one.








, This corner will also be placed underneath the three corners in your hand, so that the wrong side of the fabric is touching the inside of the group you're holding.








, You should now have a long edge of the fitted fabric on one side of your arm and a short side on the other. Grabbing the short side fold or corner with your free hand, give the whole sheet a firm shake to help straighten it out. You're trying to form a square or rectangle with the sheet, of which the L of the fitted fabric will form two sides.








, Lay the sheet down on a flat surface and smooth it out into a square. You may need to ""pleat"" the fitted corner in order to get it to lie flat. Smooth as many wrinkles as you can.








, This will likely be in thirds, but it may be in quarters, depending on the size of the sheet.








, How you fold it depends on your own preferences, the thickness of the fabric, and the size of the sheet.








, Straighten and tuck as needed to flatten the fabric. This will prevent wrinkles.








, You're done! We recommend keeping all pieces of the sheet set together by also folding up the flat sheet and the pillow cases and then bundling the group together with a ribbon or twine. This will keep your linen closet tidy and space efficient. It also looks nice when guests come over!

, Some suitcases have liners that can be removed entirely from the rest of the bag, as well as additional storage pockets. Remove these components and set aside., Remove dirt, dust, crumbs, and other small debris from your suitcase by vacuuming the inside. You can use a hand vacuum or a standard vacuum’s hose attachment. Make sure you vacuum within any pockets or liners, If the manufacturer’s tag indicates that machine washing is safe, wash it according to the instructions. If the tag is missing or if it says that hand washing is required, fill a sink with warm water and a small amount of mild laundry detergent. Clean the removable components by hand and allow them to air dry., Nylon and other manmade lining can be washed gently with a damp washcloth and mild laundry detergent. If the outside of your suitcase is leather, be very careful not to drip any water on the outside, as this can damage it., Spot-clean the inside with baking soda and water, using an old toothbrush to scrub away stains or dirt.

, Once your suitcase and all of its components are dry, replace any removable liners or storage., If you plan to skip cleaning the outside altogether, or intend to wait before cleaning it, air out your suitcase by allowing it to stand open for at least one day. This prevents the buildup of smells or mildew caused by any remaining moisture. Close the suitcase when you are ready to clean the outside.

, Remove any debris from the outside of your suitcase by brushing it with a short broom or cleaning brush. For larger soft-bodied bags, a hand vacuum or the hose attachment for a regular vacuum may be more effective. If your suitcase is not leather and is covered in pet hair, lint, or another form of difficult-to-remove debris, use a lint roller. , Follow up with a leather conditioner and allow the suitcase to air-dry out of direct sunlight.

Walk through your house and complete any remaining room-specific cleaning necessary.",How to Clean a House," This will help you decide how to set up your cleaning schedule. Be honest with yourself about what you can do, how much time you have, and how motivated you're feeling.


Work from the top down, if at all possible. You don't want to vacuum and then get crumbs all over the floor, or dust the bottom of something and knock more dust down when you work your way up onto the previously uncleaned areas. If you don’t have much time, start with the clutter first and work your way to more serious things from there.
For the ""average"" busy person it works better to do a little bit every day so that the work doesn't pile up, and also have major-cleaning day a few times a month. What style you prefer is up to you (unless you have roommates, of course).;
, Know which rooms you plan to start and finish your cleaning in (generally back to front door works best). This will help expedite the process and ensure you are not duplicating your efforts, especially if more than one person is involved in the cleaning.


Make a plan so that you can vacuum, sweep, and mop all rooms together (and so that your hot water doesn't get cold) and you don't have to go from one task to another.
The below list of tasks can serve as a general all-purpose checklist, though they by no means have to be completed in order.

, If you live with other people, cleaning the house should not be exclusively your responsibility! You may have to take on leadership by setting up a rotational cleaning schedule, but it's far better than having to do this backbreaking work alone.


Make sure the tasks assigned are age-appropriate – i.e. grade school children can pick up their bedroom floors, teenagers can clean the garage or bathroom, etc. It should also be equal – cleaning the toilet is hardly on par with organizing the coffee table.

, Ugh. Cleaning the toilet is one of the worst tasks, so it’s best to get it over with as soon as possible. Throw on a pair of rubber gloves (not the ones for the dishes) to keep your hands away from the grime and bacteria, and give the toilet a gentle rub down with a sponge and hot water to loosen everything up. Let it soak in the hot water while you move onto the bowl.


After that, squirt toilet cleaner into the inside of the bowl and around the rim. Let it soak for a minute and then scrub it with a toilet brush. When you’re finished, give it a flush.
When you’re done with the bowl, return back to the outside surfaces. Spray them down with a disinfectant spray and wipe dry with a cloth or paper towel.

, Showers are notorious for getting grimy quickly. A shower cleaner and bristled brush (and some muscle power) should work great. If you don’t have shower cleaner handy, dish washing liquid is an excellent way to get rid of the scum in the bottom of the tub, just like it cuts the grease off your dishes. Then continue cleaning as usual with Lysol or other antibacterial cleanser.


Use car wax on showers to make it stay cleaner longer (not the floor; you might slip).For cleaning glass, use a half cup of ammonia and 8 drops of dish soap in a gallon of water to get it all cleansed.


, Most sinks are pretty heavy duty, but before you go to use any cleaner, make sure it’s appropriate for your surface. Once you’re sure it is, spray it down. Leave it for a minute to start eating away the bacteria and mildew, and then scrub it down with some elbow grease and a sturdy sponge. When it seems to be sparkly and fresh, rinse it out with warm water and wipe dry with a clean cloth or paper towel.


If you have some stubborn stains, you may need to use a brush to dig into them and loosen them. A wire-bristled brush (like one you use to clean your shower) is good.

, It is commonly thought that glass cleaner does the cleaning. In fact, it’s meant just to make it sparkly, not to get it clean. It's actually no substitute for soapy water, especially if your mirror is quite dirty. Here’s how you should clean your windows and mirrors:


First, wash your glass with a solution of warm or hot water, dish soap with a rag, sponge, or squeegee. Powdered no-scratch cleaner works fantastic for cleaning mirrors, glass, ceramics, and metals because it scrubs off hard water residue without scratching the surface. Then wipe down the surface with a dry, lint-free cloth or lint-free paper towels.
If you want to clean glass and be environmentally friendly, clean the glass with vinegar and water, dry with a lint-free cloth, and rub the glass with newspaper. No streaks! Make sure you use some elbow grease – it requires pressure to properly clean glass.
Alternatively, spray glass cleaner on a paper towel and clean the glass surface. The glass cleaner acts as a shield to help keep spots and dust easy to remove. When misused, glass ""cleaner"" will leave streaks. You can also use old newspaper to wipe the glass surface after washing; the glass will be streak free and this is a great way to reuse old newspaper.

, These save a lot of work when you use them right. Your dishwasher works best when you load it completely and run it right after you use your dishes.


Big things like pots and pans are usually best hand-washed because they don't fit well in the dishwasher.
Dishes wear out more quickly when washed by machine than by hand because the dishwasher's soap is abrasive; heirloom china, delicate wine glasses, and other really fragile things should be carefully hand-washed instead.

, It's much easier to wash your dishes if you do it right after you use them; you will rarely need to soak anything or scrub hard because the food juices won't have a chance to dry and harden. Just wet your sponge or scrubber brush with hot water, squirt on some dish soap, wipe each dish (both sides!), and rinse thoroughly with hot water.


If you use the soaking method, picture this: a bucket of brown water with dirt, grease, food particles, millions of germs, and a lot of other things that come off your dirty dishes. Now you know how disgusting (and unsanitary) that soaking water can be. If you need to soak a casserole that has baked-on gunk for ten or fifteen minutes, that's okay, but when you can, it's usually better to just wash the dishes promptly and avoid soaking.

, If you don’t dry the dishes, you risk water stains on glass or bacteria festering in the water.However you wash your dishes (if you wash them by hand), place the thoroughly rinsed dishes in a clean drying rack and allow to air dry.


Be sure to let your brush, sponge, and dish towel dry between uses to keep them from accumulating germs, too.

, Another not very fun task is the cleaning the microwave and the oven, especially if we don't clean them very often (they're easy to forget about). But it's one of the tasks where you'll notice the most difference– your kitchen may end up smelling better as you cook food, since there's no leftover residues cooking with it. Here are the details:


For the oven, check if there's a self-cleaning setting. That could do the brunt of the work for you. If it does, remove the wire racks to soak in soapy water, complete the self-cleaning cycle and wipe out the ashes at the bottom and then wash it down with some cleaner and a wet rag. If it doesn't have a self-cleaning option, remove the racks to soak in soapy water, spray down the insides of the oven with a cleaning solution, let it sit, and then get to work with a sponge and a scraper.
As for the microwave, you can use a bowl of vinegar, lemon and water, dish soap, or window cleaner. Just place it in the microwave, turn the microwave on for a few minutes, and then wipe it down with a rag. All that crusted gunk will come off easily, leaving your microwave looking like new.
Cleaning the kitchen sink, just for the record, can be found in the above bathroom section. Sinks are sinks, after all.

, Now that you've got the hard part out of the way, it's time to get to your cabinets. This part is actually up to you and what you feel makes sense. Just make sure you can come up with a system that is fairly intuitive and sensible.


Sometimes it's just easier to take everything back out and then put everything back in, rather than trying to work around everything and see what you can make work. Put your bowls with your bowls, your nice glasses with your nice glasses, your baking supplies with your baking supplies – you get the picture. Make sure what you use most is the most accessible, too.

, Again, we’re starting from the top down here. The first step to organizing any room is to get rid of or organize all the small bits. So those papers you have thrown about, the clothes on the floor, the wrappers next to your bed? Get rid of ‘em. Then you can really start to get to work.As you are cleaning, walk around the house with a garbage bag and a laundry bag. This way you can pick up as you go and won't have to walk back and forth.

, Sure, making the bed seems pretty pointless – after all, you’re just going to mess it up come nightfall – but once you have it, you’ll realize how much better it makes the room look and feel. It’ll give cleaning the rest of the room purpose, because once you’re done, it’ll look amazing.


Of course, you may want to wash the sheets and then make your bed. This includes pillowcases and the comforter, too. Jumping into a made bed at night feels great, but jumping into a made, clean bed feels even better.

, This should really be something you do every day, but it’s easy to let it get a little out of control. Map out your closet in your brain – where are your pants, your tops, your accessories, your underwear? Then get to organizing, keeping like items together and the articles you wear most on top.


It’s not a bad idea to go through your closet and figure out what you just want to throw out (random, non-apparel items included). Odds are there are at least a few pieces or things you’re not interested anymore, and they’re just cluttering up your space. But don’t throw them out – they can probably be donated.

, All those shelves and nooks and crannies (not to mention under and behind the bed) are paradise for dust and dander. To get at them, a dust mitt or dust cloth works wonders, but you could also use dusting spray or a disinfecting wipe to get the job done. Once everything is dusted, corners of the floor included, you can vacuum or mop accordingly.


Be gentle with certain pieces, like your lampshades and curtains. For these, you can take a blow dryer to them and gently blast away the dust.
When you're done, top off all your hard with a nice, fresh scent, like lemon or lavender.

, This all depends on what kind of floor you have: wood, ceramic, linoleum, and carpet (just to name the generics) all require different methods of cleaning. What method is appropriate for your floor?



Vacuuming is the most effective way to clean up all the dust and other loose junk that accumulates on your floor when you have carpet (and it's practically a daily necessity when you have shedding pets).
Alternatively, try using a dry dust mop (the microfiber kind works well) if you have tile/wood floors. You can use a carpet sweeper (non-electric machine you push that has brushes underneath) if you have carpet. Both involve less fuss than getting out the vacuum and will let you go longer between vacuuming sessions, too.

, Some of the new and innovative substitutes for mopping can be helpful, but they are still no substitute for a good rag mop for getting rid of glued-on grime. In your kitchen and other areas, this is a necessity to getting your floors looking sparkling clean. When it comes to tile or textured floors, nothing else will get the dirt out of the cracks and depressions.


There are a vast number of options for rag mops. Rag mops with real fabric scrub better and last longer than mops with a sponge.With a good rag mop, one thing is guaranteed: when you use a little elbow grease, your floors will look fantastic. Use hot water and the appropriate cleaner for your floor (again, read the labels).

, Your best defense against fleas is your vacuum cleaner. Besides not having carpet, that is. Carpet is a breeding ground for fleas (not to mention all the other things it's good for holding). If you have pets, vacuum daily. This will keep fleas successful from breeding (to do so, they need pet and human dander).


To kill fleas without using poisons, after each vacuuming, sprinkle borax on your carpets and let it work its way into the carpet backing. You'll never have fleas in the house if you do this. You can find the Borax in the laundry detergent area of grocery stores, usually on the top shelf.

, Teeny invisible dust mites are everywhere, and if we could see them, we would be dusting 24/7. They can be found just about anywhere in the home and can even cause sneezing, coughing, and asthma.In addition to dusting, vacuuming and mopping help, too.


To dust your furniture, take a damp cloth or dusting mitt and carry it over your surfaces. Go in a continual motion on every surface so you don't miss any spots, and work in one direction around the room. You may want to use a scented furniture spray like Pledge to help you out.

, Like glass cleaner, furniture polish isn't meant to be a cleaner. However, it can be used for cleaning. If you'd like to use furniture polish, make sure to carefully read the labels and find one made specifically for what you need.


Some furniture can handle water, and those that can should be used with the soapy solution from step two. Be sure to quickly dry off these surfaces.
Next, apply the suggested amount of furniture polish and wipe away according to the directions. This will keep dust from magnetizing to your furniture.

, As a general rule of thumb, all-purpose cleaners aren't always safe for every purpose you'll have in mind. Make sure to thoroughly read labels before purchasing to ensure it fits your needs and to read the label to make sure it's right for the chore you have in mind at the time. The last thing you want to do is ruin a good piece of furniture.


As another general rule, do not mix cleaners. Doing so could be very dangerous. Use them one at a time and follow the directions on the label.

, Now that you've got all the surfaces clean including the floor, it's time to hit the teeny stuff because you're almost done. Fluff the pillows, straighten the throw blankets, and organize everything in the room like you're about to put your house up for sale. If too many items are in sight, put some in storage in a labeled container – you may wind up forgetting where you placed them.


When you're all done, spray a room spray and sit down and marvel at your work. Did you miss anything? Oil the door hinges? Clean the walls? Replace the light bulbs?

, Outdoor tasks can help create a better living environment, though they're pretty easy to neglect. Raking leaves helps to prevent mold growth that happens in wet climates after raining. Doing so regularly will also assist in dropping the bug count in your yard and leave your yard looking neat and cared for. Did we also mention that it helps sunlight reach the grass and grow faster and healthier? That, too.


Don't have a rake or feel like doing the back-breaking work? A leaf blower can be used as a time saving method, too.
Trimming/pruning back plants (hedges, rose bushes, etc.) can help prevent water lines and dirt from getting on the walls of your home.

, That pile of dirty clothes on your bedroom floor had to go somewhere. The following are generic instructions for a washing machine:


First, begin the water at the needed temperature and level.
Next, pour in the needed amount of laundry detergent where the water is pouring.
If you use fabric softener, a great thing to use is the fabric softener balls that you pour your softener into and just throw in at the beginning. (This saves you from having to wait for the rinse cycle.) If you use one, do this with the detergent. If you put your clothes in first, you risk staining your clothes with the coloring in these liquids.

, The way you transfer your clothes into your dryer can affect the way they come out. Once the entire washing cycle is complete, shake to remove the twisting of fabric and the heavy wrinkles from the clothes and then toss them into your dryer. This process can help prevent wrinkling and helps your clothes dry more efficiently.


It also helps to empty the dryer while your clothes are still warm. Not to mention the awesome feeling you get from holding a pile of still warm, extra clean clothes.

, Though this was a pretty big list, it was by no means exhaustive. Other tasks include:



Emptying trash bins and taking out the trash

Cleaning the kitchen table

Changing bedsheets, pillowcases, and duvet covers
Cleaning walls

Clean other bedroom components.,
Decide where to air your mattress.,
Choose a good environment in which to air the mattress.",How to Air Out a Mattress2," If you want to expose the mattress to sunlight as well as fresh air, you’ll need to wait for a sunny, warm day. Spring through fall is the best time to find a day free of rain or excessive cold. If the weather is unpleasant, you do have the option of airing the mattress indoors, but the ideal, of course, is to air it out-of-doors.

, You should try to let your mattress breathe for at least one hour before replacing the bedding.Airing the mattress in the morning is often the preferred time because the average morning routine before going to work takes about an hour. This way, you can shower and breakfast at the same time your mattress is being aired, and replace it just before heading out the door.


If you work late, you might be too tired to strip the bedding and pillows from the mattress just to let it air. Late in the evening, the only thing you’ll want to do with a bed is sleep on it!

, In order to minimize or eliminate this odor, the first thing you should do after stripping off its protective plastic wrapping is to let it air. While normally mattresses should air for just an hour or two, new mattresses should air for a full 24 hours because off-gassing will occur during that entire first day., When you air your mattress, you have to remove – at the very least -- the sheets, blankets, and pillows from the bed. If airing the mattress outside, you could remove the bed skirt easily, too. You might consider laundering these things since you’ll be removing them from the bed anyhow, and if you don’t, they’ll just be strewn haphazardly about your bedroom, crowding your bedroom walking space.

, If you live in a relatively rural environment with lots of critters like mice and raccoons, you don’t want them making your new mattress into their home.Worse, they could mark it as their territory with urine or feces. In such an environment, air your mattress in doors. In an urban area, you might lack space and be obligated to air your mattress indoors as well. If you live in the suburbs, though, you’ll be able to air your mattress outside. Your backyard is the best place to air the mattress out. You could also lean it against a wall on a clean porch.


Urbanists whose homes have an upper-story balcony which can accommodate the mattress could consider setting it up there if they want to air it outside.

, You can air the mattress outside or inside. If airing inside, all you have to do after stripping the bed of linens is to open the window(s). For added purification, introduce plants into the bedroom. Plants purify the air naturally and will ensure the air your mattress is exposed to is as fresh as can be.If airing outside, ensure the spot you’re setting the mattress on is free of puddles or wetness, and will not be exposed to dripping water or precipitation. Find a place which is clean and dry for the mattress to stand. You should try to lean the mattress against a wall or vertical beam, either on its end or on its side. In this way, the maximum amount of area possible will be exposed to the air.
If airing outside, find a place where the sun can touch the mattress as well. If necessary, place a tarp between the mattress and the ground. A wet mattress will encourage mold.

Go for dry wood.,
Vacuum the fireplace on a weekly basis.,
Use water to drown a fire for emergencies only.",How to Clean a Fireplace," You can use conventional household cleaners on your fireplace. There are also cleaners you can purchase specifically made for fireplaces.Ammonia can work well as a cleaner, but may be harsher on brick fireplaces.
Oven cleaner can be applied to a fireplace. It can work well if there's a lot of built up burnt material in your fireplace.
Browse your local hardware store for cleaners made for fireplaces. These may be less harsh on your fireplace. Fireplace cleaners, like Quick n' Brite for example, may need to be diluted prior to use, so be sure to read instructions.;
, If you're adverse to chemicals, a homemade cleaner can work. You can usually make a cleaner with items from your kitchen.You can combine 2 tablespoons of cream of tartar with water to make a quality homemade cleaner.
You can also mix equal parts vinegar and water for a cleaner. You can place the cleaner in a spray bottle to apply.
Mix two to three tablespoons of dish soap with half a cup of baking soda. Work this into a pate for a quality homemade cleaner.

, Before applying any cleaner, you apply an all-purpose cleaner to the fireplace. Something like 409 spray, which you can purchase at most supermarkets, would work well here.If you're using a store bought cleaner, make sure the cleaner you choose does not interact negatively with your all purpose spray.

, You will sweep the fireplace quickly before scrubbing, so grab a small broom. You can find small brooms at most department stores.Check the pet aisle. Oftentimes, small brooms and dust pans are sold to clean up cat litter. This could work for cleaning a fireplace.

, This is for scrubbing debris out of your fireplace. A scrub brush or an abrasive sponge would work for a fireplace.You can buy such products at most supermarkets and department stores.

, Wear an apron, or wear old clothes, to protect yourself from dirt or debris. Lay a tarp down over the floor around the fireplace. Cleaning the fireplace will get dirty, and soot can be difficult to get out of clothes or carpeting.If you don't have a tarp, try using old clothes or towels you no longer use. Make sure it's material you are not attached to, as it will likely get ruined during the cleaning process.

, Any old wood, and other debris should be discarded prior to cleaning. Put on some cleaning gloves and get to work removing debris.If there is any wood that is salvageable, set this aside for later.
You may have to use a vacuum to suck up very loose debris.

, Take your small brush and use this to sweep. Thoroughly sweep any dust or ashes from inside the chimney.It can help to sprinkle coffee grounds over the ashes first. This can give them a more solid texture, preventing ashes from scattering in the air.
Sweep off the doorway to the chimney as well, as this is likely dusted with ash as well.

, The all-purpose cleaner goes on first. Spritz the inside of the fire place with a light layer of this cleaner. The purpose of this is to wet the area, which begins the cleaning process.Make sure to get the entire inside of the fireplace wet before proceeding.

, Get the cleaner you're using, whether it's handmade or store bought. Dip your abrasive tool in the cleaner and start scrubbing.Do not scrub too hard, as your brush is already abrasive. Use circular motions to apply until the fireplace is completely covered.
If there are hard-to-reach cracks in your fireplace, use a toothbrush to clean these areas.

, If the chimney only has minor statins, 10 to 15 minutes should be sufficient. If your fireplace's stains are very bad, wait at least 30 minutes.If you're using a store bought cleaner, read the label carefully. There may be specific instructions on how long to let the cleaner sit.

, The cleaner should loosen up dirt and debris from the fireplace. You should now be able to easily remove them with some scrubbing and cleaning.Wet a cloth under warm or hot tap water.
Buff the stain away. It should come off fairly easily.
Usually, after this the process will be complete. However, for very stained or damaged fireplaces, you may need to do a second cleaning, or even a third.

, Dry wood burns much more efficiently than other types of wood. It also tends to produce less smoke, cutting down on staining within the fireplace.Make sure any wood you buy is dry or seasoned.
If the wood is not labeled, ask someone at the place where you're purchasing the wood.

, This will cut back on the process of sweeping and removing debris when you clean the fireplace. However, take certain precautions. Make sure any embers have had at least 12 hours to dry before vacuuming., Fires in a fireplace should burn out naturally. The ashes will turn into a paste if wet, which is very difficult to clean. Only use water in the event of an emergency.You should also call 9-1-1 immediately when a fire starts in your home. Even if you think you have a fire under control, professional firefighters should examine your home to make sure the fire is completely out.

Define what range of uses your new pieces will have.,
Decide whether you want sets or not.,
Decide whether you're looking for casual or formal dinnerware.,
Choose your material based on durability, price, and intended use.,
Choose your color scheme based on your needs and your room.,
Choose shapes and textures, especially for accents.,
Measure tables and storage spaces in order to choose appropriate sizes.,
Consider whether you need serving pieces.,
Determine a budget for your purchases.,
Select as many settings as the number of people you can imagine hosting for dinner.,
Research dinnerware retailers thoroughly.",How to Choose the Right Dinnerware," Does it matter whether your new dinnerware matches your old stuff? If so, you'll need to coordinate by material, color, or pattern. Unless you hate your current pieces, consider how you're going to keep on using them., For example, do you plan to use these dishes outdoors on a regular basis? If so, you may want to look into less common but unbreakable materials, such as metal or laminate. If you'll only use a formal set during the holidays, you might want to coordinate with festive colors., Dinnerware often comes in 5-piece (formal) and 4-piece (casual) sets. Consider whether you want all your dishes to match this way, as most retailers now offer dinnerware “open stock,” meaning that you can purchase individual pieces rather than sets. If you wish, you can mix and match different colors, patterns, textures and shapes.

, It's probably not necessary to have a complete set of each, although it may be traditional. In theory, casual dinnerware is sturdy and designed for everyday use, while formal dinnerware is more delicate, but there's a lot of overlap here. If you find a good pattern, you might well be able to purchase a single durable, elegant set., Formal dinnerware is commonly made with bone china and porcelain; casual pieces may also be stoneware or earthenware.Porcelain is the hardest ceramic; bone china is nearly as strong because it is fortified by ox-bone ash. Both types are relatively expensive, and are often not ideal for dishwasher or microwave use because they are harder to replace. Many manufacturers now offer dishwasher-, microwave-, and oven-safe bone china and porcelain.
Casual dinnerware should be sturdy, dishwasher-safe, and microwaveable; ideally, it should also be oven-safe to 400-500F. Such pieces are traditionally most often made of stoneware or earthenware (cream ware, majolica, faience, delft), which are less sturdy and less expensive than bone china or porcelain. However, porcelain and inexpensive bone china casual dinnerware is becoming quite common.

, Plain white dinnerware is always very popular, because it's dishwasher safe, doesn't fade, matches most décor, showcases food well, and never goes out of style. However, you can also coordinate with your dining room or kitchen by picking a color. Dishware can also be plain or patterned.


If you have a brightly-colored dining room, neutral colors will complement it well. If you have neutral-colored décor, you can incorporate a bright color into your dishes that will bring out other aesthetic accents.
When considering patterns, include some plain dinnerware with your patterns so they aren't overwhelming. Note that many patterns are created with decals or transfers and should be hand washed to prevent fading or removal. Gold- or any other metal-lined patterns should not be used in the microwave.

, While smooth, round dishes are the most common and versatile, they can get boring. Your collection can be improved dramatically by adding a number of complementary pieces in dramatic shapes and textures. This is also a great time to consider some of the more unusual and dramatic materials and patterns.


For inspiration, look online and in magazines for Japanese table settings, where you'll see a wide range of shapes, colors, and textures used regularly.

, While there are approximate standard sizes for most pieces, they do vary a lot.


If you are considering very large plates, be sure to measure the space inside your cabinets and dishwasher: a 12” plate will often not fit into a nominal 12” cabinet, for example. Some people find that large plates encourage overeating, while others find elegance in a plate’s “negative space.”, For serving, you’ll want 2-3 dishes, 2 bowls, 1 covered casserole, 1 cake platter or stand, and 1 coffee/tea service. These dishes do not need to match one another, and are a great place to branch out into dramatic shapes, colors, and textures.

, Dinnerware needn’t be extremely pricey, but if you are buying a lot of pieces it will add up quickly. This is not a great place to be cheap, however. You hope to use these dishes every day for many years, so buy something you like and cut costs elsewhere.

, Usually, this means 12 servings, which covers a fair-sized party smoothly. If you're on a budget, buy enough for the family and add to your collection later; in that case, be sure to buy pieces that are unlikely to be discontinued, or it can be very difficult to complete the set later.

, You’d be surprised how many seemingly reputable department stores and the like have many, many horrible reviews: dishes that took six months to arrive, were broken in shipping, were refused for returns, and so on. If you are registering, be extra-careful: some places are infamous for simply not honoring purchases on registries, and when people complain they just refund the purchaser anonymously to a credit card.

Get permission.,
Focus first on what you know to be junk.,
Deodorize.,
Locate all used bowls, cups and plates.,
Pick up ancillary items.,
Organize, dust and vacuum.,
Liberate yourself from cleaning the man cave.",How to Clean a Man Cave," Now this step is highly personal to the man in question. You'll know whether you already have permission to cross the threshold of the man cave and begin cleaning, or whether you need to seek it. If you need to seek it, be assertive and have a factual list of why the man cave needs cleaning. Top of this list should be family/household health and sanitary well-being, ridding the place of vermin hotspots, having a pleasant place to invite man friends back to and the fact that you'll go on strike cleaning anything else if the man cave stays filthy.


Some of you may be thinking, ""There is no way I am responsible for cleaning this man's man cave. He should do it himself, just as he is expected to do his share in the house."" Good for you, you've got it all sorted and just need to pass on your secret formula to every other woman seeking shared shouldering of the household cleaning.;
, Finding items that must be thrown away isn’t for the man cave cleaning novice; it requires the acumen and intelligence of an experienced man cave ninja because it isn't just what's obviously strewn about––it's also about unearthing the hidden junk. And while there is probably some fine line you're never going to grasp between a collectible beer can and a beer can destined for recycling (do you really care about any such distinction anyway), there are plenty of items you'll know instantly as junk, such as an empty chip package or half drunk beer bottles. Focus first on what is clearly garbage and shift it on out and have a tough love approach to so-called collectibles that need recycling, not displaying.


To avoid a fight about collectible beer cans, rinse all beer cans and return them to him. Another thing to watch for - if they're flattened, they're for recycling. If they're whole and undented they're being collected for something. Would you want him to come into your scrapbooking area and throw out every loose piece of paper that wasn't neatly stacked by color in a drawer? Also ask if he's saving the recyclables for something specific, like a cause, or if that's household recycling. Respect boundaries.
Be shrewd and savvy when hunting for junk. Half eaten bags of chips easily sidle their way into intricate crevices of sofas, chairs and behind every piece of furniture. Beer bottles roll under things and cans are crushed (in demonstrations of man strength) and tossed every which way.
Dig right in between couch cushions. Prepare yourself for what you may find between and underneath couch or chair cushions because it may get ugly. Carefully peel back each cushion and remove the food, candy, newspaper or coin stash hidden beneath. Consider unzipping each cushion as well––sometimes even men run out of hiding places for their wrappers and cans and may end up stuffing them inside the cushion itself.
Check underneath just about anything that can be moved, shoved aside or peeled aside. Every piece of furniture in the man cave is fair game for trash hide n' seek and possibilities for stuffing junk run deep. Don’t just look underneath the perimeter of the furniture; be sure to look all the way to the back, especially if it butts up against a wall.
Look up. Junk may be hidden in odd places such as on top of high entertainment centers or even lamps. If you think like one of the guys, consider what you’d do with your bag of cookies after they’ve been eaten, but you really don’t want to get up and have to throw it away in the trash can. And if you're really unfortunate, there may even be something splattered on the ceiling from a manly competition to see who could throw highest (let's just hope for your man's sake that it hasn't involved your cooking).

, There’s a pretty good chance that your man has been sitting on his man cave couch after rolling around in the yard with the dog and it only gets worse when socks worn for days in a row are found stuffed into the sofa edges. To restore the odor-friendly equilibrium, your next line of defense is to deodorize and sanitize the place, as follows:


Couches and chairs. If you had the foresight to put slip covers on all the upholstered items, take them off and wash them using the “sanitary” setting on your washing machine. However, if you are dealing with straight up upholstery, you can attack the situation a few ways. Rent or hire a steam cleaning company to sanitize upholstery or you could drown everything in Febreze (or another fabric deodorizing spray).
Bleach and/or disinfect surfaces. The best way to murder germs is to go hard core and use bleach. Obviously, make sure bleach won’t damage the surface or you'll never hear the end of how you ruined the car trunk sale find of the century. For those areas that are tiled or have a non porous surfaces, bleach is probably fine; however, the only way to tell is to test the compound on a small, inconspicuous area. If you can’t use bleach, look for a disinfecting type agent instead. Even a wash down with vinegar and water will restore the healthy atmosphere.
Air. Spray disinfectant in the air, between couch cushions, underneath furniture and inside trash cans to release odor and germs from the area.
Choose scents he agrees to, he might prefer simple pine disinfectant to floral scents, ""fresh bread"" or other scents. His airspace is personal too and there are some scents you wouldn't want in your sewing room if he reciprocated and cleaned it. If he's allergic to scents just get it clean and air it out by opening the windows.

, If you have noticed that some of the dishes are missing from their usual kitchen station, most likely you can locate them in the man cave. Look for cups, glasses, dishes, bowls and utensils in the same places where you found wrappers and beer bottles. Also, consider checking window sills or countertops. You might also find platters, salsa bowls and nacho dishes in the man cave. Be prepared for nasty residues on some items.

, From dirty clothes to pieces of unopened mail, gather all items that may have found a new home in the man cave and make a pile. Consider creating your pile on top of a cleaned countertop or, if you’ve already deodorized the couch make your pile on a couch cushion. The idea is to clear the room of items that normally don’t belong in the man cave so you can finish cleaning.


Use an empty laundry basket to gather your bounty. An efficient way to gather the most items at once is to find a large basket or even a garbage bag to load up. Don’t worry about what you are picking up (as long as it’s not an empty chip bag or soda can––those go right into the trash), just gather and remove.
Make a pile using a rake. If there appears to be a tremendous amount of “stuff” strewn across the floor, use a clean rake to make a pile and then place everything into basket or bag.

, Dig into your pile of “stuff” and begin to organize. Make smaller piles such as a pile for mail, magazines, clothing etc. If something simply needs to be put back on a shelf or returned to its original home in the man cave and continue to organize.


Transport all piles back to the intended area. For example, if you have finally located the cable bill (amongst other pieces of mail), bring it to your desk or wherever you pay bills so it’s ready to be paid. Take dirty clothing to the laundry room, etc.
Re-examine the room for errant scraps or items left behind. If you have a big job to do, it’s easy to overlook items so go back and give the room a once (or twice over) to ensure you’ve found everything.
Using wood or another cleaner, remove dust from all surfaces. You may also need glass and other types of cleaners depending upon the furniture in the man cave.
If your man cave has carpet, sprinkle the area with baking soda and/or deodorizing carpet freshener. Wait a few minutes to allow the solution to soak into the carpet and then vacuum.
If the man cave has tile or wood flooring, sweep, Swiffer (using a duster) and then wash the floor using the recommended floor cleaner.

, This step should really be the first step because you need to bring the man with you as you're cleaning. Because in reality, this needs to be a training session, in which you demonstrate what he will be doing from now on. His space, his responsibility. And the embarrassment may just be enough that you'll never have to set foot in there to clean again. And if you're really lucky, he might apologize by showing a special movie for the two of you in his man cave. Lucky you.

Measure the height of your table as well. If you are setting your table for a buffet, you will want the tablecloth to drop to the floor. If you are setting your table for a sit-down dinner, the cloth should drop 8 to 18 inches (20.32 to 45.72 cm) from the table.;
, The formality of your table linens will depend on whether you are planning a special event, or if your table linens are for every day. For formal occasions, the napkins and other linens should always match the tablecloth. For an informal table, you can feel free to mix and match several colors or different patterns.

, Decide if you are looking only for a tablecloth, or whether you want to include linen napkins, place mats, and even chair covers.

, Instead, wash the cutlery's metallic end and try to avoid placing the handle join into the water. The reason for this is that many pearl cutlery joins use water-based glue and the glue will weaken in the water, causing it to split and crack.

, Dry immediately using a soft cloth. Towelling tea towels are the best.

Tighten the screws.",How to Adjust a Lazy Susan1," When a Lazy Susan becomes stiff and difficult to rotate, the problem is usually caused by either the center shaft or the position of its bottom shelf. Lightly spin the Susan and note where it locks up, has difficulty turning, or has poor clearance.If the center movable shelf begins to bind, it will prevent free rotation. In this situation, you’ll need to loosen this shelf.
If the circular shelves slip down the center shaft, the bottom shelf can begin to drag, making it difficult to turn. You will need to adjust the height of this shelf to fix the problem.;
, Look at the top of the center shaft. There should be one large bolt locking the exterior shaft to a metal sleeve positioned inside the shaft. This is the locking bolt for the shaft.This bolt holds the center shaft in place and maintains the length of the shaft. Sometimes excess pressure from this bolt can cause the shaft to bind.
On some models, the locking bolt might be located at the bottom of the Susan, however, in most cases it will found near the top.

, If anything is inside your Lazy Susan, empty it so you have more space to work. Using a wrench or ratchet, loosen the bolt by turning it one-quarter of a full rotation counterclockwise. At first, the bolt may require some elbow grease to break loose.Only loosen the bolt enough to manipulate the hardware inside the center shaft. On some models this might require more or less than one-quarter rotation.
Generally, it’s better to loosen the bolt in small increments. This will prevent you from loosening it too much, which could result in the alignment of the Susan being thrown off.

, Now that the bolt is loose, you’ll be able to adjust the center shaft. Slide the metal adjusting sleeve the bolt was holding in place no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) to provide better clearance between the center shaft and top of the cabinet.Work in small increments when adjusting the center shaft. Large adjustments could cause the Lazy Susan to topple over.

, Use your wrench or ratchet to carefully refasten the locking bolt in place. Do not over-tighten the bolt. It should be looser than it was initially, but still tight enough to hold the adjusting rod in place., Most Lazy Susans should have two or more locking screws located at the center of each shelf. These screws hold the shelves to the center shaft.When all of the shelves are held together by the front decorative panel, you will need to adjust the entire shelf system. In this case, there may not be screws located at the height of each shelf.
If the shelves must be adjusted separately, you'll only need to work with the bottom shelf. Locate the locking screws in the bottom shelf only.

, Loosen the locking screws using a Phillips-head screwdriver or similar tool. Hold the screwdriver so its head meets the fastener straight on. Apply firm pressure down on the screw while turning counterclockwise to prevent stripping fastener hardware.Screws can be left in their holes once they have been unattached from the center shaft. However, you may want to set loosened screws off to the side to prevent any from getting lost.

, Carefully lift the bottom shelf or entire shelf system until there is roughly half an inch (1.25 cm) of space between the bottom shelf and the bottom of the cabinet.The shelves may resist this adjustment and begin binding on the center shaft. Maneuver shelves until they are level and at a suitable height.
Under no circumstances should you lubricate the center shaft. Doing so could prevent the screws from holding their position.

, Hold the shelf in place with one hand and use your free hand to tighten the locking screws back in place with a screwdriver. Take care not to let the shelf slip as you reattach fasteners, as this could cause unlevelness or binding.Make the screws as tight as possible without stripping any of the hardware. The shelves must be stationary and secure to prevent this kind of misalignment.

Start with cups that are as clean as possible., If your cup isn't already wet, dampen it with some hot water. It's easier to remove the stain when there is little moisture present for the baking soda to cling to., Half a teaspoon or so should do the trick. You only need enough to make a light paste.

, A paste-like film should form as you rub over the dampened cup. Concentrate on places where the stain is darkest.

, Put some effort into rubbing directly over the stained areas of the cup. Continue doing this until the stain lifts. You may need to turn the cup around as you are scrubbing, to ensure that you reach all areas of the stain., Remove the baking soda residue from the cup with warm water. Check that you have removed the entire stain. If it's gone, turn the cup upside down and leave to air dry before returning to its usual storage spot.

, If you still see remnants of the stain after a good scrubbing, repeat the process with more baking soda. It will usually come off after an extra treatment or two.

Locate where there are door problems.,
Loosen the collar screw when doors close unevenly.,
Rotate the shelf unit and door counterclockwise.,
Rotate the door.,
Turn the entire assembly.,
Tighten the screw to finish adjusting uneven doors.",How to Adjust a Lazy Susan2," Door problems are usually easier to identify than rotation problems. The door of the unit may close unevenly or it may not have sufficient clearance at the top, bottom, or sides of the cabinet.


If the door does not close completely, or if it closes unevenly, you'll need to adjust the doors until they are centered correctly within the frame.
When the top or bottom clearance is insufficient, you'll notice the gaps at both sides of the door will be unequal.
When the side clearance is insufficient, the door will appear crooked. Additionally, the gaps around it will but unequal.

, Open the door and locate the collar at the top of the unit. For many models, this part will be made of white plastic. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to loosen the screw on this collar.Loosen the screw by one full counterclockwise rotation. Even loosened, the screw should remain in its position in the collar.

, Using both hands, carefully rotate the entire shelf unit and door in a counterclockwise direction. Continue until the collar hits the catch latch located at the back of the ceiling bracket.Turn the Lazy Susan slowly. Listen for a slight click. This is a signal that you've reached the catch latch.
Once you hit the catch latch, the collar should be properly aligned with the spring. You should feel a slight resistance to additional counterclockwise turning.

, Gradually rotate the door in a clockwise direction until it reaches the exact center-front. If possible, take a step back and check the alignment from a distance. Make sure the door is precisely in place before moving on.The plastic collar should remain fixed in place as you rotate the door, so it may be difficult to step away. Have a friend or family member help you evaluate the door position, in these cases.
If you accidentally rotate past the center-front position, continue rotating the door in a clockwise direction. Do not rotate it counterclockwise until after you finish setting it.

, Carefully and slowly rotate the entire assembly in a counterclockwise direction. Continue turning the assembly until the collar screw faces you. The door and collar should maintain their alignment as you turn the assembly.It may help you to maintain the position of the collar and door by marking their correct positions with a piece of painter’s tape, masking tape, or something similar.

, Tighten the collar screw back into its original position. The door should now be properly aligned and fixed into place. Give the Lazy Susan a few spins to check that everything works correctly, and your door adjustment is finished.To prevent the collar from twisting out of place while it’s fastened, you may need to hold it in place as the screw is tightened.

Refasten the bracket.,
Check the door to complete your side clearance adjustment.",How to Adjust a Lazy Susan3," Locate the plastic retainer clip at the bottom of the center shaft. Firmly grasp the clip between your fingers, open it, and pull it out. Under the clip should be a cut out portion of the shaft with a thumbscrew adjustment wheel.The cabinet will need to be completely empty when you make this adjustment. Do not attempt to complete the process when the shelves are loaded, especially if they are heavily loaded.

, Use your fingers to turn the thumbscrew adjustment wheel in the cut-out portion of the center shaft. Rotate the wheel clockwise to raise the door and counterclockwise to lower the door.


Generally you can expect that for each full rotation of the screw the height will be adjusted by about 1/32 in (0.8 mm).
You may need to apply gentle pressure to the underside of the bottom shelf to aid the adjustment if you are attempting to raise the door., After adjusting the door to the proper height, return the retainer clip to its original position at the bottom of the pole. The clip should fasten back into place firmly.It's a good idea to tighten all of the adjustment screws attached to the center shaft, shelves, and door after setting the height. Doing this could prevent the door from falling out of alignment again.

, Using erasable pencil, lightly outline the current position of the top and bottom brackets. If lighting is too poor inside the cabinet to make these marks easily, use a flashlight or electric lantern.Doing this will give you a reference point to work from as you make the adjustment. Pencil marks can be erased once you complete the process.

, Use a screwdriver to remove the setscrews and loosen the star washers holding the pivot housing in place on both sides of the pivot pole. Adjust the pivot housing and pivot pole until both are centered and aligned.When the star washers are in place but before fastening the setscrews, take a step back and look over your Lazy Susan. If the side clearance is still uneven, remove the washers and readjust the pivot.
Use your outline to guide your adjustments. For example, if the left side is low, you’ll likely need to move the pivot pole and housing to the right.

, Once you tighten the star washers, you’ll be ready to return the setscrews to their original position. When the screws are in place, check the side clearance of the Lazy Susan again to make sure that it wasn't altered as you refastened its hardware.This adjustment may take care of your side clearance problem. If the lower half of your Susan appears to be misaligned, you’ll had to adjust the pivot base in addition to its top.

, Open the door wide enough to expose the bottom bracket on either side of the Susan. Loosen this bracket by removing the fastening setscrew and star washer with a screwdriver. Now you can realign the pivot cam (metal arm) base so that it’s centered.You’ll have to repeat this process on the opposite side of the Lazy Susan where you’ll find an identical bracket/pivot cam base.
Work on brackets one at a time. After you’ve taken apart, realigned, and refastened the first bracket, move on to the next one.
When properly centered, the pivot cam bases of both sides should be aligned with regard to the center pole.

, Be careful when refastening; if you jostle the pivot cam, it could be knocked out of alignment. Replace the star washers and reattach the setscrews for the bracket. When fastened, similarly adjust the opposite side bottom bracket/pivot cam base.Verify that the position did not become altered while you were returning these pieces to their original positions by stepping back and evaluating the evenness of the side clearance.

, Sometimes these alignments (especially those made to pivots) can require several attempts before they are resolved. Double check door alignment after completing the top and bottom adjustments, especially.If the side clearance is still unequal, you will need to readjust the top pivot pole and/or bottom pivot cams.

Keep the wooden spoon(s) clean.,
Store your wooden spoons properly to preserve their beauty and extend their life.,
Use your wooden spoons for many cooking tasks.",How to Choose and Care for Wooden Spoons," When selecting your wooden spoon, always look for those made from hardwood. These spoons will be stronger and more durable than ones made from pine or other softwoods. Softwood wooden spoons will crack, split, and can absorb aroma and moisture too easily.


If you're not sure what type of wood the spoon is made of, ask.
Think about supporting a local craftsperson who has made such spoons; they will undoubtedly use quality hardwood, the finishing will be lovelier than mass-produced ones, and you'll be helping to keep their craft alive.;
, The best way to wash a wooden spoon is to clean it immediately after use, using warm, soapy water. Don't use abrasive cleaning sponges on it, just the soft sponges.


Stand wooden spoons up to air dry. They should be thoroughly dry before you put them away.







, Wooden spoons can be kept in the drawer, preferably with other wooden and soft utensils. Avoid storing with metallic utensils as they might dent the wood. Alternatively, store the spoons standing up in a utensil container – this can be a particularly effective look in a country-style kitchen.

, Wooden spoons are great for the following:

Stirring hot meals like risotto, soups, sauces, stews, and stir-fries






On non-stick pots and pans






For mixing cake and other batter in the mixing bowl.

Try cayenne pepper.",How to Get Rid of Centipedes," Their freakishly long legs make them very fast so you'll have to be quick. Centipedes don't usually invade homes in large numbers, so you may be able to get rid of your problem just by stomping on, or bug-spraying, every one you see. Note that if you are afraid to even approach or be near the centipede, even vacuum cleaners won't be useful.


If you don't want to kill the centipede, you can try to catch it in a jar and release it outside, but this usually leads to a high-pitched scream, a broken jar, and a free centipede.;
, Just place them in corners and crevices where centipedes tend to hunt. You may also catch other insects that are sneakily crawling around your home. Know that larger centipedes that walk over sticky or glue traps may escape by simply leaving behind a couple legs. Sticky traps are most effective for smaller centipedes, not larger ones.

, Keep in mind that insecticides are only temporary solutions. Any garden supply store will carry these products. Just make sure to follow the package directions. Even though these products shouldn't kill pets or humans, it's best not to have prolonged contact with them.


Sticky traps could possibly alert you to heavy traffic areas, allowing you to spray these areas or place more sticky traps. If one of your sticky traps turns out to be really popular and none of your other ones do, chances are the popular one is where you should focus most of your attention.
If you want to kill the centipedes, but you don’t want to poison the earth, yourself, or your pets, you can use natural pesticides like boric acid or food grade diatomaceous earth for continual centipede control.
Products containing plant-derived pyrethrin will exterminate centipedes on contact, and can be used as a fog or spray.

, Whether it's chemical insecticide, natural insecticide, or other, think about creating a moat-like barrier around the outside of your house. Because centipedes originate outside and come inside. When they do, they'll travel into the insecticide barrier. If they happen to make it inside, they should be dead or near death by the time you find them. Try using the organic pesticide containing cyhalothrin, which is used mainly for ants but does double duty for centipedes.

, If you've tried everything under the sun to help eradicate the creepy-crawly pests, it may be time to pony up and hire an exterminator. Exterminators may crawl your home for potential entrance points, locate and destroy any centipede eggs, and spray parts of your home with effective pesticides. We probably don't want to admit it, but exterminators do a better job of locating the problem and ensuring that it goes away. They're worth the money if you can afford it and are at your wit's end.

, The centipedes will have nothing to eat, and will hopefully die or move in with the neighbors A centipede without food is as good as a dead or soon-to-be-vacating centipede., Centipedes dry out and die if they don't stay in a moist environment. Clean up basements, closets, or any other damp areas, and use a dehumidifier.


Place packets of silica in the dampest places of your home. Silica is an absorbent that wicks away moisture from the air and ground. Look for silica packets in new shoes, for example, or buy some cheaply. Keep them in the dampest places of your home.

, Place firewood, mulch, tarpaulins, and compost bins away from the perimeter of the house and as far away as possible. Remove any compost, leaves, wood, and organic debris. Consider getting rid of damp items like compost bins if possible., This will keep the bugs from entering your home in the first place. Seal any cracks in concrete foundations, and caulk spaces around doors and windows.


Apply weatherstripping to the outside of your house to discourage centipede intrusion.
Caulk any holes between walls.
Look at gutters and downspouts and clear away away leaves, branches, or other material that may be blocking the water's natural flow down the gutter. This could be a potential home for centipedes.

, For a natural way to discourage centipedes from vacationing in your home, try laying down a thin layer of cayenne pepper at entrance points, both outside and inside your home. Dogs and cats should stay away from it, although they won't be seriously hurt if they happen to get a little curious.

Throw away infested garments.,
Wash your fabrics.,
Apply insecticide.,
Set traps.,
Apply a barrier treatment around the perimeter.,
Remove nests.,
Protect susceptible items.,
Leave doors and windows closed.,
Inspect flowers before bringing them inside.",How to Get Rid of Carpet Beetles," Familiarize yourself with common clues that indicate a potential carpet beetle problem and make yourself aware of how carpet beetles look.


Fecal pellets and shed skins are the most common signs of infestation. You can also expect to see carpet beetles in both adult and larvae forms.
Most adult carpet beetles are oval-shaped and only a little larger than the head of a pin. They can come in a range of colors, but most have some form of black and gray or black and brown patterns. Some varieties also have yellow or white on their backs.
Carpet beetles move slowly and roll over when touched.
The larvae of the carpet beetle usually has brown bands running across the body, along with long hair-like extension toward one or both ends.;
, A heavier concentration of carpet beetles, cast skins, or fecal pellets is a good indication that a certain location is the primary source of the infestation.


Carpet beetles are drawn to fabric. They can be found in the carpet, especially if that carpeting is in a closet or other dark location, but they are also drawn to clothing, upholstered furniture, and items made of fur or feathers.
Non-fabric items that attract carpet beetles include food cabinets, dog food, fresh flowers, and paint brushes.
Also check dark, undisturbed locations like air ducts, baseboards, and attics.

, Focus on the primary source of the infestation, but vacuum the entire home to ensure that all beetles have been removed.


Also vacuum any upholstered furniture or other fabric-covered areas that cannot be washed in a washing machine.
While you have a carpet beetle infestation, you should vacuum your home at least once a day for a week or more. You may even need to vacuum multiple times each day for the first few days, depending on how bad the infestation is.

, If a particular clothing item has already been eaten away, it is best to simply discard it.


Keeping infested garments increases your risk of being unable to stop the infestation. Even if you do not see any carpet beetles on the material, there is still some risk of the beetles remaining there.

, All clothing that is not stored in airtight containers should be washed in hot, soapy water. Linens, towels, and other fabrics should also be washed in the washing machine using hot, soapy water.


For particularly bad infestations, you may even need to steam-clean your carpet and upholstered furniture.Carpet beetles can be extremely resilient. Hot water is more effective against them than cold water, and the use of detergent is advised because soap can help kill these pests.

, Use a spray or dust that is specifically labeled for use against carpet beetles and follow the instructions on the label to apply the insecticide to your carpet.


In general, carpet treatment insecticides that contain chlorpyrifos, bendiocarb, and allethrin are the most effective against carpet beetles.
Aside from broad carpet treatments, spot treatments can be applied in cracks and crevices where carpet beetles might be hiding.
Add an IGR, or insect growth regulator, to your standard insecticide during application. IGR insecticides act as birth control to the beetles, preventing them from reproducing.Try dusting infested areas with boric acid for a solution that is non-toxic for humans. It kills nearly any insect it comes into contact with, but it does have a bleaching effect and should not be used on dark materials.
Take necessary precautions when applying insecticide. Wear gloves and protective clothing, and leave the area for a while as the insecticide disperses through the air. Wash your hands after application.

, Place hormone-based glue traps around cracks, crevices, and other locations from which you suspect the infestation to originate from.


Glue traps kill the insects and also give you a good idea of how bad the problem still is.

, A liquid insecticide should be sprayed along soil areas next to the home and around the lower portion of the foundation.


Outdoor treatments are especially important if you suspect that the infestation is originating from a vent or a location that connects to the outside.
For best results, the barrier should extend 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) up the home and 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) out from the base of the home.
Treat potential entry points, as well. Windows, door frames, vents, and utility pipes all serve as possible entry points for carpet beetles.

, Remove any birds' nests or bees' nests around your house or in your yard.


Carpet beetles often lay eggs in nests, so having these around your home increases your risk of infestation.
Destroy the nests or move them to an area far away from your house. If you keep them in your yard, make sure that the nests are on the side of the yard furthest away from your home.
Exercise caution when removing nests to avoid the wrath of angry birds and bees.

, Store off-season clothing and starches in plastic containers or bags. Open your closet door and dresser drawers for a few hours each day to expose the clothes to sunlight.


Carpet beetles are unlikely to find their way through the plastic, and they tend to scatter when exposed to sunlight.
You can also keep cedar chips or mothballs in your storage areas to deter carpet beetles from hanging around.
Regular carpet cleaning will also help prevent infestations from happening again. Fewer dust bunnies and less pet hair will go a long way in reducing the future carpet beetle population.

, Any windows or doors that do not have screens should be left closed as much as possible. Leaving these entrances open will only make it easier for carpet beetles and other insect to find their way inside your home.


Repair any holes in your window screens. Since carpet beetles are so small, even the smallest holes may give them the opening they need.

, Carpet beetles often linger on flowers and plants. Check the leaves and petals of any fresh-cut flowers for unwanted hitchhikers before bringing the flowers into your home.

Encourage natural earwig predators like toads and birds in your yard.",How to Get Rid of Earwigs2," The animals that prey on earwigs will help reduce the population and keep it under control. This means making your garden of interest to birds or toads, by having food sources (plants they like, etc.) and shelter opportunities.


Attract toads by allowing plants near your house but not adjacent to your house to grow wild. Or place some bricks on the ground, lay boards across them and put plants across the boards. Either of these steps will create a shady environment for toads.
Draw birds in by putting out a bird feeder or nest boxes. Plant bushes and trees that supply berries, etc. that you know for sure the local birds like. Birds may also visit a clean bird bath.

, Look under outdoor faucets and in crawl spaces. Get a builder or plumber to fix any leakages that you're not able to remedy yourself.

, Make sure that the gutters and downspouts carry water away from your foundation.

, Earwigs (and other insects) are attracted to bright light at night.

, Herbs such as mint, basil and lemon thyme may deter the entry of earwigs and other insects. Having them close to the home is great for cooking too!

Use a perimeter treatment.,
Call professionals.",How to Get Rid of Boxelder Bugs Outside1," A perimeter treatment is formulated for use around the exterior of the house and other structures. Spray one of these insecticides around all possible openings, including the entire perimeter of the home, attic vents, basement windows, cellars, windows, doors, siding, garden sheds, and garages.While this will not destroy all the boxelder bugs living in your yard, it will prevent them from getting inside. The bugs that pass over the insecticide barrier will also die, thereby reducing the population in your yard.
Concentrate on spraying the south and southwest sides of the house or yard.
Use a backpack sprayer or power spray rig to achieve maximum coverage. Direct the opening of the sprayer hose toward the area to be treated. Activate the spraying mechanism by pulling the trigger of the sprayer and apply the insecticide in a steady stream.
Pyrethrin-based are among the most effective types to use against boxelder bugs.These sprays are made from a highly poisonous compound found in pyrethrum flowers, and other chemicals may also be added to increase their effectiveness.
Do not use perimeter insecticides on your lawn. These chemicals will often damage your grass and other plants.;
, If you lack the equipment or if home treatment proves ineffective, call a professional exterminator to rid your yard of the bugs.


When you contact the exterminator, indicate whether you want him to prevent the bugs from entering your home or if you want a solution that will remove them from your yard completely. Perimeter treatment is more common, and if you do not specifically state your desire to be rid of the bugs completely, the exterminator may not take measures to remove them from your yard.

Check inhabitable spaces frequently.",How to Get Rid of Bats," The occasional rustling in the attic may just be an old water pipe or the sound of the house settling. Make sure you’ve excluded all other possibilities before you begin spending time and energy on a bat-removal project. The best way to tell that you have bats in your home is to see one with your own eyes or come across their tell-tale droppings.Consult a pest removal specialist or wildlife expert to determine what type of bats are commonly found in your area.;
, Bat excrement (commonly known as “guano”) most often takes the form of small, dark pellets. These are round in shape and give off an overpowering musky stench. Should you encounter bat guano in any part of your home, there’s a good chance that bats have recently been roosting there.While bat urine isn’t typically visible, it may leave behind small stains and a sharp odor.
Bat guano sometimes contains fungal mold spores that may be hazardous to breathe. In some cases, prolonged exposure to guano can lead to serious health concerns, including hemorrhagic fever and respiratory infections like histoplasmosis., There are many different varieties of bats. Find out when maternity season begins for your local bat population. If you drive off the mother after she’s given birth, her babies won’t be able to survive. This will leave you with an unbearable stench and an attic full of dead bats to dispose of.Bats live in a wide range of highly specialized conditions. In most cases it’s possible to narrow down the species by the region it occupies. This will give you an advantage when coming up with a strategy for safely managing the isolation and removal of your unwanted guests.See if you can get a good enough look at a bat that’s entered your home to be able to reference what species it is.

, Bats gravitate toward dark, enclosed spaces because they most closely resemble their natural cave habitats. Take a look around your attic, chimney flue, basement or crawlspace and see if you can turn up evidence that bats have been roosting there. Pay special attention to areas accessible through small cracks and apertures, as bats often use these as entry points.Bats are capable of squeezing into spaces as narrow as ⅜ths of an inch, so don’t discount small or inconspicuous openings.Watch bats as they come and go at night to see what entrances they’re using., Bats favor dark, quiet hideouts and have an aversion to lots of light and commotion. Try leaving a light on in the attic or another area you think bats might be inhabiting. For a two-pronged approach, you might also invest in a white noise machine and leave it running overnight to double your chances of scaring them off..


It’s against the law to exterminate bats in places where they’re considered a protected species, which means you’ll have to find a non-lethal way to get rid of them.Hanging strips of aluminum foil from the ceiling can create a series of obstacles that will disorient and repel bats., Bat boxes are small enclosed structures that provide a hospitable temporary environment for bats seeking a place to roost. The idea is to flush them out of your home while giving them somewhere else to go so that they won’t be tempted to return. For people living in wooded areas, bat boxes can be a good way to relocate bats without the need for more costly measures.You can construct your own bat box from scratch or ask your local pest control or wildlife removal service how to obtain one.Set up your bat box near the treeline of your property or alongside your home in a place with ample shade.

, By fitting suspected entry points with a one-way valve or tube, invading bats will be free to exit a space but won’t be able to get back in. This way, bats will simply leave on their own. Exclusion devices are arguably the most effective method for ridding your home of bats once and for all.Denying bats reentry is preferable to trapping them, which is often difficult and dangerous.
Exclusion devices can be found at most pet stores and home improvement centers and are relatively simple to install., If you’re not having any luck getting rid of the bats on your own, or you suspect you might be housing an entire bat colony, your best bet is to have the problem dealt with professionally. Pest control specialists will be able to pinpoint the places where bats are likely getting in, then remove them and seal vulnerable entry points to keep them from coming back.This will be the safest and most convenient option if you can afford to have it done.
In places where environmental conservation is a high priority, you may be able to find a team of wildlife experts to remove bats from your home at no cost.

, Once the bats are gone, it will be necessary to bar any openings that they might be using to make their way in. This can be accomplished by repairing longstanding cracks and damage, installing exclusion devices or in some cases applying new mortar, plaster or shingles. With these things in place, bats will find it difficult or impossible to regain access to your home in the future.Have a contractor go over the exterior of your home with you to look for places that might admit bats.
It’s important that you address each and every possible entry point. If the bats can’t get in through one, they’ll try to find another.

, Vacuum up dried droppings or scoop them into a garbage bag with a plastic scraper. Afterward, scrub the area thoroughly using an enzyme-based cleaning solution. This will help break down any remaining biological waste products so that no traces are left behind.Be sure to take the proper safety precautions when cleaning bat guano—wear thick rubber gloves, eye protection and a facemask or respirator to filter the surrounding air.It’s highly recommended that you leave the cleanup duties to a professional pest removal service.

, Perform thorough inspections of your attic, basement, crawlspace or other affected areas periodically to search for signs of reinfestation. Look for bats themselves as well as their droppings. Chances are that bats will stay out after you’ve sealed their entryways, but if they do happen to sneak back in you’ll want to find out as soon as possible to keep the problem from getting out of hand.Unexplainable drafts or debris can offer a clue that bats have gnawed their way in.
Though they usually wind up in attics and chimneys, bats have also been known to roost beneath decks, inside screened-in porches and under roofing tiles.

In all cases of using your vacuum cleaner for pest removal, always empty your vacuum cleaner and tie up the bag immediately after vacuuming, putting the bag outside in the trash.",How to Do Pest Control With a Vacuum Cleaner," A vacuum with a hose is most practical for sucking up bugs from irregular surfaces and overhead. A vacuum with a rotating brush is most effective at removing bugs and, more importantly, scraps upon which they feed, from carpets. Canister vacuums generally have a hose and some permit attaching a rotating-brush head; many uprights allow switching between the main brush head and a hose. A HEPA filter greatly reduces airborne particulate count and can be good for allergies, but replacements are not cheap. Simple bagless vacuums clog expensive filters quickly. Disposable bags, which are cheap, or vortex-style dirt separators extend their useful life. A vacuum vacuum with a long hose, and extension tubes, is best for hard-to-reach areas.;
, Since the vacuum is your way to kill the bugs. Be sure to configure it to maximum power. There is usually a knob for vacuum suction power. Turning on the vacuum should be easy. You will need to either click the foot pedal or turn the switch to on position.

, If there's nothing to eat, they won't come in and won't multiply if they occasionally do come in. Keep food in sealed containers like the refrigerator and jars, vacuum dust from carpets, corners and shelves, and vacuum or mop hard floors. Clean floors under items where dirt may settle, including sinks, refrigerators, and especially stoves.
This is much easier and more effective than trying to keep up with chasing bugs one by one.






Don't pull on a gas stove or pull hard on a refrigerator with an ice maker to move it lest you damage the supply line. Try a vacuum cleaner extension, or temporarily removing the drawer under the stove, to get under them.






For vacuuming things other than the floor, use a simple nozzle without electrical or moving parts which has been taken off the vacuum and cleaned. A brush nozzle generally won't scratch.







, A vacuum cleaner can be used to cut down the spider population immediately and vacuuming out the webs will stop the increase of spiders in future days and months. In removing a spiderweb, you remove the spider's home, the nursery for future baby spiders, and the spider's grocery store. (On occasion the spider web itself is actually consumed by the spider!) This is a pretty big deal since one of those egg sacks can have 300 little baby spiders in it. While most never make it to maturity, imagine roughly half becoming egg laying females. That's 150 times 300 eggs!
Vacuum up every spiderweb you can find. By removing the web, you're removing all the comforts that the spider needs to survive and repopulate.






Use an extended vacuum end of a canister vacuum cleaner to reach high places.






A hand-held vacuum is useful for the nooks and crannies where spiders tend to hide.







, Moths flutter around, fall into your food and drink and can be costly to get rid of.
Vacuum cracks between benches, counter tops, and under the refrigerator. Food particles from grains filter into all your cabinets from the counter tops; these particles find a resting place in the tightest cracks and float downward toward the fan under your refrigerator. These areas need a thorough vacuuming from time to time.






Vacuum the pantry shelves where the food is stored.






Look to the place where the ceiling and wall meet. Indian meal moths climb the wall and spin their silken cocoons at that point. At first glance they may look like spider webs, but webs or cocoons, get that vacuum out and suck them away!






Dispose of the vacuum bag or contents outside in the trash can so that the pests are not reintroduced into the house.







, If you feed your pets inside, keep in mind that a major source of pantry pests is dry pet food and bird feed.


Be sure to vacuum pet feeding areas and pet food storage areas often.

, The first cockroach gets there through various means - flying through open windows, walking in the door but the most notorious the German cockroach has to be transported via your grocery bag, the cute little dresser from the garage sale or even in that sugar you borrowed from the neighbors. As a general rule, cockroaches lay about 30 eggs in what is called an ootheca or egg purse. Upon nearing maturity, these are dropped anywhere the roach might be.
Due to airborne particulates from the cockroach fecal matter, the cockroach exoskeleton and various body parts left behind cockroaches can be a direct cause of respiratory ailments. A non-HEPA vacuum may exacerbate the problem, so only use a vacuum with a HEPA filter. A vacuum cleaner is particularly useful in the control of roaches because the ootheca is readily visible and quickly vacuumed up.






Look for the ootheca in drawers, on shelves, under cabinets or anywhere cockroaches my be living. Vacuum roaches, ootheca, and all.






After vacuuming, wash the area with strong soap.Dispose of the bag or contents direct into a trash can outside that is going to be collected shortly, so that you don't re-introduce the pests.







, If you've had an invasion of stink bugs in your home, the vacuum is a great way to collect them quickly without getting the stench all over you from accidental squashing. Simply vacuum them up from wherever they're resting (usually walls and windows), and dispose of appropriately.
Stink bugs can also be vacuumed off exterior walls if your vacuum cleaner extends that far.






Other bugs you can remove this way include Western conifer seed bug and the box elder bug.







, Vacuum the mattresses and pillows of all beds in the home to reduce the dust mite population.Dispose of the vacuum cleaner contents properly, in a sealed container.

, You might also wish to add flea powder to the vacuum cleaner bag or on the carpet if this won't cause problems for your cleaner.Dispose of properly.

, Use the vacuum cleaner to remove food particles and silverfish eggs.

, Ladybugs can congregate in numbers large enough to infest your home over the winter break. While they're beneficial insects in the garden, disturbed ladybugs can emit a bad odor and can cause allergic reactions in susceptible people. If you're experiencing a problem with them, vacuuming them up in a fresh bag or vacuum container and then depositing them somewhere far away in the garden can be one way of getting them out of the house and back into being beneficial in the garden.


After vacuuming, place cloves in window sills and anywhere else there are cracks that they might be attracted back to.You can also try wiping down with clove oil diluted with some water.

, These flies tend to infest homes around August through to October and tend to cluster on high ceilings.

, If they're not trapped inside, the spiders and insects will crawl out wherever they're left.

Then remove the hose from where it joins the vacuum by placing your fingers around the hose just above where it meets the vacuum cleaner and pulling up., Look for blockages in the wand, hose, and the inlet where the hose joins the vacuum. Gently remove any stuck debris from the vacuum.You can wash the wand and hose in warm, soapy water. Allow them to dry before reattaching them to your machine.

, The cleaner head and the brush bar inside of it collect a lot of hair and debris, which can build up inside the brush bar. Access the pieces by laying your vacuum down with the front on the floor. Remove the red C-clip that keeps the cleaner head attached to the vacuum by gently forcing it out. Pull the cleaner head from the vacuum cleaner.If your cleaner head does not attach with a C-clip, you can unscrew it at the bottom., To clean the brush bar, remove the sole plate by turning the two dials on the brush bar in a one-quarter counter-clockwise circle. Pull the sole plate out. Clear any hair or debris from the brush bar or from the area where the brush bar joins the vacuum cleaner., Replace the sole plate by lining up the three lugs on the lower base of the sole plate with the lugs on the cleaner head. Slide the sole plate up into the cleaner head until you hear a click., Place the C-Clip on the cleaner head before reattaching it. Then line up the cleaner head with the connection slots on the ball. Press the cleaner head back into place until you hear the click., Press the cyclone release button and remove the cyclone. Lift up the clear inspection cover and remove any debris. Lay the base machine on its front and look for the red collar of the internal hose. Pull the red collar down to dislodge the internal hose. Use your fingers to remove any debris.

Replace the internal hose collar and the cyclone., Push the cyclone release catch or the latch on the top of the canister. Gently pull the canister from the vacuum cleaner., There is a catch release on the canister that holds the filter in place. Disengage the release, which will allow you to open the top of the canister. Take the filter out of the canister by grasping the top and pulling it out., Lay the back of the vacuum on the ground with the suction part sticking up in the air. Locate the central locking dial on the ball and turn the dial counter-clockwise until it unlocks and comes off. Turn the filter one-quarter of a circle counter-clockwise, then lift it from the vacuum.If your model does not have a ball, then Filter B will be located near the bottom of the canister.

, Do not add any kind of soap or detergent when cleaning your filters, and don’t process them through any type of washing machine or dishwasher. All you need to clean the filter is running water. Expect to rinse your filter up to 10 times.


When washing filter A, wet the filter under running water and then squeeze the water from the filter.
When washing filter B, let the water run over the filter, then gently tap it on the side of the sink to remove the water., Place both filters in a warm room with good air circulation. Filter A should be laying horizontally, while Filter B sits with the larger side facing up. If they still feel damp after 24 hours, wait until they are dry to put them back in your vacuum.

Do not try to hurry the process by placing them in a dryer, using a hair dryer, or putting them near an open flame. This can damage your filters., Slide Filter A back into its place in the cyclone. Push Filter B back into the ball, then secure it with a one-quarter turn clockwise. Place the central locking dial back into place, then turn it clockwise until you hear it click shut., If your vacuum came with additional attachments and accessories, remove them from the machine to make the cleaning process easier.

You can wash all non-mechanical accessories, including small plastic pieces and small brushes.
If you have a dishwasher, run the items through a wash while you continue cleaning the rest of the machine.If you don’t have a dishwasher, wash the accessories in soap and cool water.

, Push the cyclone release button, which will allow you to pull both pieces out since they are attached to each other. Separate the two pieces by lifting the lever that holds them together. After you lift the lever, pull the top canister out of the bottom canister.If you haven’t removed the filters already, do so now. Set the filters aside while you clean the canisters.

, The lower canister is the part of the unit that holds the debris. Empty its contents into the trash., Make sure that the latch that covers the area where the filter sits is open so that water can run out of it. Wash both the outside and the inner rim of the top canister. Use a soapy cloth to clean away the debris.

Spray the bugs with soap and water.,
Spread food grade diatomaceous earth.,
Use borax.",How to Get Rid of Boxelder Bugs Outside2," Add 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of dish soap to a standard-size spray bottle filled with water. Shake well to combine, and spray the soapy solution on boxelder bugs as you see them.


There are several theories as to why soap effectively kills boxelder bugs. The leading theory is that the soap breaks down the hardened skin of the insect, causing the bug's cell membranes to deteriorate. As a result, the bugs dehydrate and die.Note that this only works when the spray is used directly on the boxelder bug. When you see a group of these bugs, douse it with soapy water, making sure to coat each individual insect. Soap has no residual effect on boxelder bugs that do not come into direct contact with it.

, Sprinkle this substance around the perimeter of your house, around the base of boxelder trees, and in any area of the yard where boxelder bugs seem to gather.


Diatomaceous earth is a porous sedimentary deposit that consists of fossilized phytoplankton called diatoms.
You can find diatomaceous earth at most home improvement stores. You may also be able to find it at retail garden supply centers.
Wear gloves and other protective clothing as you spread this substance. You should also carefully follow the instructions printed on the label of the container. While this substance is non-toxic to humans, it is quite possible to have an allergic reaction to it.
Diatomaceous earth kills boxelder bugs and other insects by breaking down their hard, protective coating, similar to the way in which soap kills insects.

, Sprinkle a coating of borax around the base of boxelder trees, inside the exterior siding of your house, and anywhere in your yard where large groups of boxelder bugs gather.


Borax is a white boron-based compound often used for green household cleaning.
You can usually buy borax in the cleaning aisle of major grocery stores and some larger drug stores or department stores.
As with diatomaceous earth, borax breaks down the protective coating of the boxelder bug, killing it by destroying cell membranes and ultimately dehydrating the bug.

Remove female boxelder trees from the yard.,
Introduce predators into the environment.,
Hose them down.As soon as you see the bugs beginning to gather, spray them out of the yard with a forceful jet stream of water from an ordinary garden hose.,
Remove or kill them by hand.",How to Get Rid of Boxelder Bugs Outside3," Boxelder bugs are only attracted to female boxelder trees, so removing these and only planting male boxelder trees will usually fix the problem.


Boxelder trees that bear seed or fruit are female.You can also identify female boxelder trees by looking at the flowers. The flowers of female boxelder trees share one stalk, while those on male boxelder trees do not.

, The natural predators of the boxelder bug are the praying mantis and most types of spiders.Note that this is fairly risky move to make. Purposefully introducing a new insect into your yard's ecosystem can upset the balance, and you may find yourself with a praying mantis or spider problem after the boxelder bugs have been reduced.
You can place praying mantis egg cases or captured spiders in your bushes or trees. Alternatively, you can attract praying mantises to your yard by planting rose bushes and raspberry bushes. Plants that attract small ""prey"" bugs are also good at attracting both the praying mantis and many varieties of spider.

,


This will not kill the bugs and may not offer a permanent solution, but it will deter the boxelder bugs from gathering. As such, it proves most useful if done toward the beginning of an infestation.

, If the infestation is still small, you can literally squash the problem early by stomping on or swatting the bugs when you see them in your yard.


Alternatively, you can trap them in jars and release them outside of your yard. Wear gloves when doing this in case you are forced to touch them in the process.

Pick up large pieces of debris by hand.,
Shake area rugs outside.,
Use packaging tape to pick up hair and pet fur.,
Brush the carpet clean.",How to Clean a Carpet Without a Vacuum1," Even if you were using a vacuum, large chunks of dirt or trash need to be picked up. Get a small trash bag and take the time to bend down and clean up before getting started with any deeper cleaning. This will make your home look cleaner already.;
, If you have any area rugs or smaller, removable carpets, take them outside. Over your lawn or driveway, vigorously shake out the dirt and debris. Be careful not to breathe in deeply since dust will be flying around. Take note if there’s any wind that may blow dirt back toward your house., Roll out and cut a few inches of tape and press it to the carpet to pick up loose hair, fur, or dirt.Discard of the tape strip when its stickiness is gone and cut off a new piece. This method is time consuming since tape strips are thin, but is an easy way to clean surfaces without doing a deep clean.


Lint rollers are an alternative to using packaging tape.
Break the carpet into sections to make cleaning less daunting and so you can keep track of where you’ve already cleaned.
Don’t wear dirty clothes or shoes to clean since you’ll be on the ground, but also keep in mind that you may end up dirty after cleaning.

, You can buy carpet brushes or sweepers at home good stores. Take the brush across the carpet like you would with a hairbrush. This method is good for carpets that have longer fibers; you can reach deeply into the grain of the carpet and pull out dirt that’s trapped.Pick a brush that has stiffer bristles for short fiber carpets. Soft synthetic bristles won’t have enough tension or power to push dirt off.
A brush with metal teeth is good for faux fur rugs or very fine carpets. Be careful though as it may damage and separate a delicate weave.
Some brushes come on the end of long broom-like handles so you don’t have to clean on your knees.

Determine the material that the rug is made of.,
Cover newly made spills immediately with dry towels.,
Make a stain solution.,

Apply many layers of towels over the affected area.,
Leave the solution to clean for 24-36 hours or until dry.,
Gently remove the piled towels the following day.,
Keep your rugs dry.,
Cure color running problems by allowing the rug to sun-dry for three to five days, or even longer.,
Fix moth damage and rot.,
Take the rug to a professional if the rug is in poor condition and the moth damage is severe.,
Re-weave broken fringes.,
Deal with frayed or worn edges.,
Repair cuts, tears, and holes.",How to Clean a Valuable Oriental Rug and Remove Stains," Rug treatment varies depending on the kind of stain, its age and its chemical composition. The steps below cover a 'do it yourself' economical stain removal procedure, but looking up more information on your rug material is recommended to be certain that you're using the best procedure for the rug.;
, Always blot a stain, never push the liquid or solids into the rug.

, Mix 1 tablespoon mild detergent with ⅓ cup of white vinegar and ⅔ cup of water.

, Blot again, moving towards the center of the wet stain.

, Weigh down the solution placed on the stained area.

, Do not shift the weight.

, Brush out the area. Repeat the steps if necessary.

, Water can cause damage and ""color running."" Rugs with color running caused from flooding must be dried out completely and quickly, to prevent additional damage.


If the water is dirty or contaminated, then it needs to be handled by a professional rug washing plant. Bring severely soaked rugs to professionals. Completely soaked rugs may need to be dried in a professional dry room overnight.

, The ultraviolet rays of the sun can help to bleach out any run colors. However, if overexposed, the sun's harsh rays can also fade the colors of the rug. So, proceed carefully, sunning the rug one day at a time if you are placing the rug outside. Check it carefully each day for over exposure by spreading the rug's pile and checking its original pile color.

, At the very least, take your valuable rug out of the house and vacuum the back and front of it slowly. Doing this will thoroughly disturb any moths, as well as removing them. Air and sun the rug for a while.

, The professional will be able to do a thorough cleaning and moth-proofing. They can also perform partial replacement, as needed.

, If it is a hand knotted rug, it will need hand weaving to get back to its original character and construction by a skilled weaver. Many styles of re-constructing the rugs can be done. This is where consulting a skilled operation is important. If a machine repairs a machine made rug, this can be done for less cost.

, Depending on how bad the wear is on the edges, many techniques can be employed, ranging from reconstructing the original edge to re-wrapping over the edge. Again, skilled professional weavers need to do this work.

, Some cuts and tears can be sewn up at home by hand, provided you're comfortable with doing this. However, holes, dog-eared corners, and large threadbare areas will need professional reweaving by skilled weavers, who will sometimes need to replace the warp, weft, and pile with exactly the same dyed wool, in the original character of the rug.


Large reweaving projects are best done overseas by professionals, where labor is still relatively cheap. If the warp and weft need replacing, the rug will need to go on the loom. If only the piling needs replacing and re-knotting, the work will be completer faster.

Purchase a hardwood floor mop.,
Purchase one box of black tea.,
Boil four to six cups of water.,
Drop your hardwood floor mop cleaning pad into the bowl or bucket.,
Place the tea-soaked pad on the hardwood cleaning tool and mop the floor.",How to Clean a Hardwood Floor Using Black Tea," Regardless of what type of cleaning fluid/method you use, using a special, flat head hardwood floor mop will provide you with the best result.


Look for a mop that has washable/reusable flat pads. Many hardwood flat floor mops come with one or two cotton pads, designed to fit specifically fit your mop. However, if you mop your floor often (more than twice a week) you may want to purchase a package of refills.
Consider purchasing both a large and small mop to accommodate both larger and smaller spaces. Depending on your space, if you have a large floor area, you may want to buy a mop with an extra large head. Additionally, for small, hard to reach spaces, a small mop may do the trick.;
, Or check your cupboard for any brand/type of black tea. You want black tea because this type of tea contains tannins, which will give your floor a bright shine.


Consider buying tea that has a pleasant aroma. Try different flavors such as lavender, ginger or lemon--all flavored black tea may leave behind a clean, pleasant smell.
Allocate at least three tea bags for approximately four cups of boiling water. Generally, the best potion is to use three bags, but if you want something stronger or have a tougher job ahead of you, add one or two to your brew.

, You’ll want to bring the water to a rolling boil before you drop your bags into the water. This will allow for the seeping process to occur.


Drop tea bags into kettle, pan or bowl after the water has come to a rolling boil. Check to make sure either the water is fully boiling or your tea kettle is “singing.”
Allow the tea bags to seep for several minutes. Unwrap the bags, place in the boiling water and leave them for up to 10 minutes. This will also allow the water to cool slightly, making it easier to use for mopping.
Remove and discard/recycle tea bags. If the water is too hot, use a pair of tongs or a spoon to remove the tea bags. Wait until the bags are cooled before placing in the trash (as the boiling hot bags may permeate through the plastic or paper trash bag)
Transfer tea to a bowl or a bucket. Once the tea is still hot, but not scalding transfer to the bowl or bucket you like to use to clean the floors.

, Make sure the tea is hot but not too hot to touch. You will need to wring out the pad before placing it over your hardwood cleaning tool.


Fully immerse the pad in the steaming tea so that it is completely soaked. If the water is still to hot for your hands, use a wooden spoon to submerge the pad into the water.
Wring out the pad into the bucket. Wearing a pair of rubber gloves, wring the pad into the bucket. Wearing the gloves will protect your hands from the hot water and allow you to effectively wring out the pad.

, Mop as usual using broad, even strokes across the floor, going along with the wood grain.


Consider rinsing and re-soaking the pad after cleaning every floor, depending on how dirty the floor. Rinse the pad in a separate bowl or sink in order to avoid contaminating the tea.
Go over any areas that were difficult to clean or had excess tea (to avoid streaking).

Determine if you want a multi cyclonic (or “Cinetic”) vacuum.",How to Choose Between a Bagless and a Bagged Vacuum Cleaner," Bagless vacuum cleaners tend to be better for the environment. This is because they do not produce anything to throw away other than the dirt collected. Bagged vacuums, on the other hand, may go through dozens or hundreds of disposable bags during their lifetimes. Keeping excess trash out of landfills benefits the environment.;
, Bagged vacuums are often better for people with asthma, as well as environmental allergies. This is because many modern vacuum bags are made from HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) material, which traps dust and dirt.


Most bagless vacuums come with HEPA filters as well. But adding the extra layer of protection in a bagged vacuum may be better for those who have severe health problems stemming from exposure to dust and dirt.A full vacuum bag will release much less dust into the air when you throw it out than a full bagless vacuum canister will when you empty it. Some vacuum bags are made with rubber seals that release almost no particulate matter at all when you remove them from the vacuum, making them ideal for asthma and allergy sufferers.

, Vacuum bags can hold as much as twice the amount of dirt and dust that a bagless vacuum can hold at any one time. If you don’t mind potentially emptying your vacuum twice as often, a bagless vacuum may be right for you. Bagless vacuums’ reduced capacity also means that people who are sensitive to dust and dirt will be exposed to allergens much more often than with a bagged vacuum.

, A bagless vacuum cleaner may require regular filter cleaning in order to work at optimum levels. These filters must also be replaced regularly. Bagged vacuums require much less maintenance, since any filter mounted on them catches much less particulate matter., Bagless vacuum cleaners can be more expensive than bagged vacuums. Over time they can save money since you do not have to go out and buy bags on a regular basis. If you do not vacuum often, however, you may not need to buy bags very often for your bagged vacuum cleaner.


Filter replacements can be a hidden cost of bagless vacuum cleaners. Because the filters on a bagless vacuum catch more dirt and dust than a bagged vacuum, you will need to clean and replace the filter more often, and these filters can be expensive., Bagged vacuum cleaners generally provide more suction. That can be useful for heavily carpeted areas, or for people with pets that shed a lot. But if you’re only vacuuming hard surfaces, you may not need that extra suction.


Bagged vacuums often provide less suction as the bag fills up. If you have a bagged vacuum, remember to check periodically to see if the bag needs to be replaced., One big advantage that bagless vacuums have over bagged models is that you can easily retrieve items from the canister. On the other hand, you can’t retrieve lost items from a vacuum bag except by cutting into it. And because many bagless vacuums have clear canisters, you can also see where the item is. If you think you might need to retrieve items like from the canister on a repeating basis for any reason, a bagless model might be a better idea for you.

, Bagged vacuums can be larger than bagless vacuums. This is because most portable, lightweight vacuums, such as handheld and lightweight “stick” models, are bagless.


Most full-size vacuums, whether bagged or bagless, do not take up that much room. But if you live in a tiny apartment with only enough storage space for a lightweight vacuum, you may not be able to find room for a bagged model.

, Most, but not all, bagless vacuums have clear canisters. These allow you to see when the canister is full, so you don’t have to open the vacuum to check. On the other hand, you can’t see inside a bag. Some new models of bagged vacuums have indicator lights to signal when it’s time for a bag change, but most do not.Many portable, lightweight bagless vacuums do not have clear canisters. If you have one of these vacuums, emptying it after every use may be a good habit to adopt.

, Most bagless vacuum cleaners operate on cyclonic technology, in which a fan sucks in air and creates a small cyclone within the vacuum cleaner canister. The force of the cyclone separates dirt from air. Multi cyclonic models use multiple fans to create more suction and separate the dirt and dust into even finer particles. This process can help prolong the filter’s life, but these models of vacuum cleaner are usually very expensive.


Newer model Dyson vacuums operate on what the company refers to as “Cinetic” technology. These vacuums operate similarly to multi cyclonic vacuums, and are also similarly expensive."

Check any labels or tags on your carpet.,
Spot clean stains.,
Get a bucket of water and dishwashing soap.,
Scrub the carpet gently from side to side.,
Change the bucket to fresh water.,
Put smaller area rugs in a bathtub to wash more thoroughly.,
Block off the newly cleaned areas and let it dry overnight.",How to Clean a Carpet Without a Vacuum2," Depending on what your carpet fibers are made of, there may be specific instructions you need to follow. Not all materials can be treated the same way. Some rugs may need to be taken to a dry cleaners and some carpets can be soaked in vinegar without any consequence., Before doing a comprehensive cleaning of your carpet, check around for egregious spots and stains that need to be dealt with. It’s easier to get stains out before cleaning the entire carpet so you don’t accidentally rub the stain deeper into the fibers.Blot stains, don’t rub them.
Sometimes you just need to use scissors to trim long fibers that have stains that simply won’t come out.

Hydrogen Peroxide is best for getting out bodily fluids and stains such as blood or urine.
You can use commercial stain removers and cleaning products to get rid of stains. Make sure that the chemicals won't ruin your carpet by double-checking its compatibility with your carpet material.
Dab beer and wine stains with club soda poured onto a rag cloth.
Scrape off gum and sticky substances with a plastic serrated knife.
For grease and other difficult stains, put some dish detergent that's designed specifically for grease in a spray bottle and spray and dab the stain until it's gone., Fill the bucket with water and put a few drops of soap in to make some bubbles. Wring out any excess water so you don’t saturate the carpet. Getting your carpet too wet will make it harder to dry.For a natural home remedy instead of dish soap, combine baking soda and vinegar. Sprinkle baking soda on sections of the carpet, spray enough vinegar to make it foamy, then sop it up with paper towels.

, Dip a large sponge or scrub brush and use it to scrub the dirt from your carpet. Work across the carpet in sections to make sure you get every piece of the area. It’s best to start against a wall or in a corner and work backwards so you don’t have to sit or kneel in wet areas that you’ve already cleaned.


Scrub brushes with a handle will give you better control.
For large carpets, have several sponges on hand so you can change them out when one becomes too dirty to be productive.
While you scrub, change out the water frequently to avoid rubbing dirty water back into your carpet.

, Once you’re finished, rinse out the bucket and fill it with just water. Go back over the carpet again with a wet, fresh water towel to scrub out any extra dirt. Again, don't oversaturate the carpet with moisture.

, Fill a bathtub with lukewarm water and some mild dish soap. Gently swish the rug around in the tub to break up any dirt. Drain the tub and refill it a few times to fully rinse everything down the drain., Set up barriers by moving your furniture across the entryways that lead to the clean carpet. Keep kids, pets, or shoed feet away from the carpet while it dries to prevent any new dirt from ruining your progress.Set up fans to blow on the carpet to speed up the drying process.
Clean your carpet on dry, low-humidity days so that it will dry faster and mold won’t build up.

Sprinkle the carpet with a powder to cut odors.,
Pick up any smaller debris with a carpet sweeper.,
Sweep your rugs and carpets with a broom.,
Beat the dirt out of your rugs.",How to Clean a Carpet Without a Vacuum3," Liberally pour baking soda, cornstarch, or flour onto your carpets and let them sit for 30 minutes to an hour. This method works best with area rugs that can be shaken outside. Or instead, clean up by sweeping up the excess powder with a stiff broom or carpet sweeper. It’s easier to clean these powders from a carpet with fine fibers, but long fibers will trap them along with dirt.You can use this method to dry clean your carpets, but you may need to use a vacuum to suck up the fine powders.
If you don’t want to vacuum because of the noise, wait until a better time. If you don’t have a vacuum, there still may be remnants left in your carpet since the fine powders may escape a broom or tape.

, Sweepers are relatively affordable tools that you simply run across your carpet to help pick up dirt. They do not require electricity and are much quieter than a vacuum, so you can clean anytime and anywhere. Run a sweeper across your carpets for quick crumb removal or dirty shoe trails.Carpet sweepers have brushes that may need to be replaced periodically when they become filthy or too run down.
Carpet sweepers cannot handle the dirt capacity of a whole house, so if you're cleaning each room you may need to clean out the bristles as you go.
Empty out the sweeper regularly so you don't spread dirt around your house instead of cleaning it.

, Get an old-fashioned broom with stiff bristles, preferably made from bristly broom corn. These brooms are self cleaning because dirt doesn’t stick to the natural bristles like it does to a synthetic broom. Sweep in the direction of a dustpan or a door that leads outside to help minimize the mess.Using a stiffer broom forces dirt out of your carpet but it does require some forceful sweeping which can double as a workout.
Broom corn bristles may break off while sweeping. Simply add them to the pile of dirt you’re going to throw out.
Using a broom works best for short fiber carpets or carpets with stiff bristles.

, Take your area rugs and removable carpets outside and hang them over a railing or fence with the dirty side facing up. Use a tennis racket, paddle, or a sturdy stick to beat the dirt and dust out. Stand to the side of the rug so that you don’t get any flyaway hair or dirt on you. It’s also easier to beat the rug from a side angle rather than straight on.If it’s a sunny day and there is no call for rain, use a garden hose to wash any extra dirt out of the rugs. Let them air dry outside.
Sunlight can fade the color in rug fibers, so be careful if you’re cleaning a delicate material.

Vacuum wool carpet nearly everyday after it’s first laid.,
Run a vacuum twice a week in high traffic areas.,
Vacuum once a week in low traffic areas.,
Use a vacuum cleaner with soft bristles and good suction.,
Scrape up solids and blot spills immediately.,
Use plain water on wet stains.,

Blot stubborn stains with mineral turpentine.,
Use wool detergent and vinegar to clean water based stains.,
Steam clean your carpet at least once a year.,
Remove all furniture and items from your carpet.,
Get your carpet professionally cleaned.,
Rent a steamer for a day.",How to Clean a Wool Carpet," When you get new wool carpet, it’s important to vacuum it often to remove lint and dust from installation. Lightly vacuum your wool carpet every other day for the first week after it’s installed., Areas on your wool carpet that see a lot of foot traffic need to be vacuumed at least twice a week. Pass your vacuum over carpet in frequently used rooms five to seven times.

, Even if an area of your carpet isn’t walked on much, you should vacuum once a week to remove dust or dirt that moves through the air. Pass a vacuum over any low traffic areas of your carpet three times once a week.

, Make sure you use a high quality vacuum cleaner on your carpet to extend the life of the wool fibers. Use a vacuum with soft bristles to gently agitate any trapped dirt and dust and make sure the suction is strong.If you have high-pile carpet, use a vacuum with bristles that can adjust higher off the ground.

, Wool naturally deters liquids from absorbing into its fibers, but that doesn’t mean you should let spilled food or drink get a chance to stain. Scoop up solids without letting them dig deeper into the carpet and blot--don’t rub--spills with a dry paper towel., If a spill is fresh, plain warm water will probably suffice on wool carpet. Fill a water bottle with warm water, spray a little on the spill after you blotted all that you can up. Lightly rub the water onto the stain with a soft cloth or sponge and blot any excess water up with a dry cloth or paper towel.

, So your pet pooed or peed on your wool carpet. Baking soda will absorb the odor and white vinegar will help disinfect the area. Liberally sprinkle baking soda on the stain and let it sit for 30 minutes then vacuum. Make a cleaning solution out of 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) vinegar, 2 cups (470 mL) water and 1⁄2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) liquid dishwasher detergent, and follow these directions:Dip a clean cloth or sponge in the cleaning solution and wring it out.
Lightly rub the stain using circular movements.
Rub a water dampened sponge or cloth over the area to rinse and blot with a paper towel.

, Remove stubborn stains like lipstick, rust, oil and crayon with mineral turpentine. If you don’t have this commonly used paint thinner at home, look for some at your local hardware store. Soak a clean rag in the turpentine, and lightly dab and blot the stain with it. After the stain disappears, blot all excess moisture up with a dry, white paper towel and move on to the next step., Whether you need to flush mineral turpentine or clean stains like coffee or juice, an approved wool detergent like Softly and white vinegar will clear your wool carpet right up. Mix 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) wool detergent, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) white vinegar and 1 litre warm water. Dampen a cloth in the solution, lightly rub and dab the stain, and use a water dampened sponge to remove the cleaner.Blot all water up with a dry, white paper towel and let the area dry for several hours.

, Wool is great at hiding dirt, but that doesn't mean it's not still there. Trapped sand and dried mud can wear out the fibers on a wool carpet the more you walk and rub your feet around on it. Steam clean at least once a year to remove all trapped dirt and consider cleaning it twice a year on highly used carpet., Find a place to put all items on the carpeted room that needs to be cleaned. Remember you will have to wait at least a day for the carpet to fully dry before you arrange items back on it, so stack furniture along the edges of another room not being cleaned. Make sure you can easily move around the room if you need to.

, Hire a local carpet cleaner to professionally steam clean your carpet using hot water extraction. It will deeply remove dirt, dust and dander from pets. Look in the yellow pages and read reviews about potential cleaners online.

, Steam cleaning your carpets yourself can be a less expensive option than using a professional carpet cleaner. To find where to rent a steamer, call your local hardware and carpet stores. They will likely rent steamers or direct you where to. Check to make sure you have compatible cleaning solution for the machine and if it's certified by the Carpet and Rug Institute."

Rent or buy a pressure washer.,
Put on gloves, old clothes, and shoes with good grip.,
Set up the pressure washer.,
Test the machine.",How to Clean a Brick Patio1," Call a local hardware store or cleaning equipment rental company for prices on pressure washer rentals, which can range from $50 to $250 a day, depending on the machine model and where you live. Ask a store employee to recommend a model that will work best on your brick patio. If you have the money to invest, consider buying your own pressure washer.Opt for a gasoline-powered pressure washer over an electric model, which will mean dealing with electrical connections that need to be kept dry and out of the way during cleaning.;
, Always wear old clothes when using a pressure washer, as rocks or debris from the surface of your patio may be propelled upwards by a stream of water when cleaning. Anticipate getting wet during the cleaning process and dress accordingly, in old clothing that you don’t mind getting soaked. Wear shoes with good grip (i.e. rubber soles) to avoid slipping during the cleaning process., Connect a garden hose between your water source and the high pressure hose on the pressure washer. Attach the nozzle securely. Squeeze the trigger on the gun of the machine to release excess air, then turn on the water.Most pressure washers come with multiple nozzle attachments.

, Point the gun of the pressure washer towards a discreet corner of the patio and turn on the machine engine. Spray a quick test stream to gauge the water pressure, and to see if it is strong enough to cause any damage to your patio.Always test the least powerful nozzle first, then move to a stronger nozzle if you wish.

Spray the patio.,
Clean the deck from the house, outwards.,
Repeat the process if necessary and let the patio dry.,
Remove efflorescence residue.",How to Clean a Brick Patio2," If you are giving your brick patio a basic cleaning, you can use plain water to wash it. If there is a buildup of mildew, grime, or other residue, add detergent to the machine. Apply a gentle stream of soapy water to the patio using a low pressure nozzle, then let it sit for 5-10 minutes to penetrate dirt.Only use detergent that is specified for pressure washer use.

, Move and rinse the soap thoroughly to ensure that the patio gets a good cleaning. Always move the stream away from your home, and not towards it, to avoid pushing dirt and debris upwards towards your walls, doors, and windows. Spray in gentle, consistent strokes to avoid leaving stripe markings on the patio., If the brick patio still looks dirty after rinsing, repeat the process by applying more detergent and rinsing again. Continue until you are satisfied with the results. Allow the patio to air dry before putting furniture, plants, or other items back onto it., After the patio dries, you may notice a white powdery residue. This residue, called efflorescence, is normal and easily removed by scrubbing it with a cleaning brush. Do not attempt to remove the residue with the pressure washer, which will make the problem worse."

Make a dish washing liquid solution.,
Apply the soap solution and let it sit for 10 minutes.,
Scrub and rinse the brick.,
If stains remain, scrub them with trisodium phosphate.",How to Clean a Brick Patio3," Fill a small bucket with warm water. Add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of dish washing liquid and a teaspoon of table salt. Stir the liquid to mix., Dip a clean cloth or rag into the cleaning liquid and wring it out. Rub the solution onto the stained brick with the cloth thoroughly. Let it sit for 10 minutes., Use a stiff bristle brush to scrub the stained areas of the brick. Rinse the brick thoroughly with a clean, wet cloth. Allow the brick to dry., In a plastic bucket, mix ½ cup of trisodium phosphate (a heavy duty cleaner available at hardware stores, or online) into a bucket full of hot water. Put on protective gloves (i.e. rubber or latex), safety goggles, and protective clothing. Use a stiff bristle brush to scrub the mixture onto the stained brick, then rinse thoroughly with warm water.Patio bricks can also be cleaned with a mixture of oxygen bleach and warm water, in a ratio specified by the manufacturer.
Keep pets and children away from the area while cleaning with harsh chemicals, which may be dangerous.

, Be smart: avoid getting ""stuck"" in a certain area and needing to rewash it after you've walked over it. Clean from the far corner of any given room, towards the door, so that you don't end up doing extra work.

, It's important to do this before you introduce water, so that you can sweep it all up without it sticking. You can also vacuum at this stage, if desired.

, You can try baking soda for tile floors; dissolve 1/2 cup of baking soda in warm water, and use it to mop your floors.For wood floors, try vinegar; just combine 1/4 cup of white vinegar with 1 quart of water and use that.,, Walk around carefully so as not to get dirt on the areas you've already cleaned, but keep going until everything has had a good mopping.

, If it gets too grey or grimy, add more detergent/natural products and water. This is a good time to rinse the mop out, too.

, By this time your floor might have some streaks of dirt that the mop missed or even spread. To remove them, wipe the area with clean water, over and over again. Another method is to splash hot water around the floor, wait, and then mop the area twice or thrice. Just avoid flooding your floor!

Clear the floor.,
Cover drywall and outlets.,
Sweep the floor.",How to Clean a Garage Floor1," You should remove anything from the garage floor that isn’t nailed down. Loose objects may get in the way while you clean, and they could get damaged during the process. Move all cars, bikes, tools, basins, boxes, and other items out of the garage until you are finished.You may leave items on shelves if you are confident that they will not be in the way of any water spray, hoses, or soap.;
, Pin or tape a plastic drop cloth or tarp to the walls at least three feet up. Make sure that any drywall or electrical outlets are covered by this cloth. This tarp will protect your walls from water damage and stains., Before you apply any cleaning solution or water to your floor, you should sweep it with a broom. This will push dirt, dust, and large debris out of the way. Collect it in a dustpan, and throw away."

Mop up spills right away.,
Use lemon juice or vinegar on a rust stain.,
Sprinkle cat litter over oil stains.,
Apply a store-bought grease remover.,
Scrub tough stains with detergent and water.",How to Clean a Garage Floor2," If you spill oil or another solution on your garage floor, always clean it up right away. These liquids can set in the floor, making them more difficult to clean later on. Use paper towels to mop up the mess, and throw them out when you are done., If you have rust stains on a concrete floor, try pouring lemon juice or vinegar on the stain. Use enough to cover the stain. Wait five minutes, and pour a second dose on top. Using a scrub brush with stiff bristles, scour the stain from the floor.

If this does not work, you can try the same method but with a stronger, store-bought acid or rust remover.
For very tough rust stains, you can mix ten parts water to one part muriatic acid. Apply to the stain, and leave it for five minutes before scrubbing out.Do not use acids or vinegar on epoxy floors., If you have a dried oil stain or if there is oil residue leftover after a spill, find some cat litter containing clay. Spread this over the stain. Leave the litter alone for a few hours or overnight to absorb the oil. Sweep it up when you are done.If the cat litter has not completely absorbed the oil after a day, replace it with fresh litter, and leave it for another day. For bad oil spills, this process can take a few days.

, For oil and grease stains, you can purchase an oil and grease remover. Follow the instructions on the label. Generally, you will apply the solution to the stain, and let it dry. This usually takes several hours. When it is dry, you can sweep it up.These grease removers can typically be bought at a hardware store.

, Gather a box of powdered detergent, a bucket of warm water, and a stiff scrub brush. Sprinkle the detergent over the stain until it completely covers it. Dip the brush in the water, and scrub the stain vigorously until it is gone. When you are finished, wipe up as much detergent as you can with rags or paper towels, and let it dry."

Mix a cleaning solution.,
Scrub the floor.,
Use a power washer.,
Run a buffer over the floor.",How to Clean a Garage Floor3," No matter how you decide to clean your garage floor, you will need a warm and soapy cleaning solution. You can buy degreasing solutions from a hardware store, auto store, or sometimes even a grocery store. Follow the instructions on the label to mix the proper amount of cleaning solution with warm water in a bucket.

You can also use powdered laundry detergent. Mix 1/3 cup of detergent with every gallon of warm water that you use., For lightly soiled floors, you can clean them using a deck brush or a push broom with stiff bristles. Pour the cleaning solution on the floor. Let it sit for about ten or fifteen minutes so that it can absorb the dirt and oil. Once the time is up, use your brush to scrub the floor, moving across the entire floor. Once you have finished scrubbing, rinse the floor using a hose. Let the floor dry.Keep the garage door open as you clean. You can use a broom to push the water out of the door outside. This will help it dry.
You may want to start far away from the door and move towards it as you clean. When you finish scrubbing, you will be next to the door. This will prevent you from having to walk across the slippery and clean floor.

, If your garage floor is really dirty or if it has not been cleaned in a long time, you should try a power washer. You can rent these from a hardware store. Cover the floor with the cleaning solution, and wait fifteen minutes. Turn on the power washer, and spray down the floor, moving the nozzle in broad strokes across your floor as you do so. Keep moving the spray across the floor; do not let it linger too long on one spot or else it can scratch your floor.
Keep your garage doors open when using a power washer so that the water can drain out.

, You can rent a floor buffer from a hardware store. This will scrub the floor of your garage in a more powerful way than you can do by hand. Apply the soapy cleaning solution to the floor. Turn on the buffer, and guide it over the floor. Rinse with a high-pressure hose. Let the floor dry afterwards.It might be easier if you break up the floor into sections.

Scrape off large debris.,
Absorb moisture.,
Choose mats according to whether they will be indoors or outdoors.,

Choose mats according to traffic and use.,
Clean your mats periodically.",How to Choose and Use Doormats," Depending on your living situation, you may have doors to the back or side yards in addition to just the front. Make sure all have doormats. Also mat entrances to the main part of your house from messier or unfinished areas such as a basement, workshop or garage.
, Having two mats gives you a second chance to catch whatever is on the bottom of shoes., Use longer mats inside and outside so that most people who enter will end up stepping on each mat at least once with each foot., For outside mats, choose something that has loops, brush-like fibers, or a bit of grit in it to remove and trap large debris.





 A boot scraper.

Mount a boot scraper for entrances where you have (or expect) a lot of mud or snow, and encourage people to use it if they accumulate heavy soil on their shoes.

, Indoor mats often look a little more like carpet. Choose fibers that will absorb moisture.

In wet or heavy traffic areas, make sure that moisture is also contained.
Some mats are hybrids, providing both absorbency and scraping functions. Use these instead of a purely absorbent second stage or as the second stage of three if you have a larger entrance or garage or mud room to mat.

,

Choose outdoor mats that are designed as such, built to take weather and temperature changes.
If outdoor mats will be in an uncovered area, choose an open style that will drain out water quickly.
Choose indoor mats that won't damage or discolor the floor underneath and that fit with the style of the room.
Choose colors that don't show dirt. Dark and mottled colors are good choices. Remember, if you choose good doormats, they will collect lots of dirt.

, How often does an entrance get used? Does the mat need to be decorative in addition to being functional?, It is possible for doormats to get so full of dirt, debris, or moisture that they no longer clean shoes very much.

Shake, vacuum, or sweep out loose debris. If the mat is fairly dry, this may be all you need to do. It's a good first step for wet cleaning.
Check washing instructions for indoor throw rugs. Many can be washed in a machine and line dried.
Spray down outdoor mats with a nozzle on a garden hose.

Damp-mop once per month with a hardwood floor cleaner.Use a damp flat mop with a microfiber head.",How to Care for Hardwood Floors1," Microfiber mop pads are more effective than sweeping with a broom. They’re also safer, since some broom bristles can scratch the floor's surface.


When dusting with a microfiber mop, lift it off the floor as little as possible so that the dirt stays securely trapped on the pad.
Daily dusting is your best line of defensive against scratches and surface damage.;
, If you leave a lot of debris on the floor when you vacuum, this can scratch the floor’s surface. After using the microfiber pad, carefully vacuum the floor using a floor-brush attachment.


Use caution when vacuuming hardwood floors. Keep an eye on the vacuum’s wheels, which can damage the surface if you aren’t careful.
Never use a vacuum with a beater bar attachment, since this can scratch the finish on the floor.

, Do not dampen it with water. Instead, mist the mop head lightly with a cleaner made specifically for hardwood. Use the minimum amount of cleaner required to get the floor clean.


If your floor has protective sealant on the surface, check the manufacturer's recommendations before using a cleaning product.
Never wet-mop or steam mop a hardwood floor. Both can dull the finish and damage the wood."

Create a cleaning routine and stick to it. For best results, dust every day with a micro-fiber cloth. Vacuum biweekly with a soft-bristled floor-brush attachment. Damp-mop once per month with a hardwood floor cleaner.

, These finishes seal and protect the wood underneath and give your floor a glossy shine. Normal wear and tear will eventually leave visible scratches and make the surface dull. Polishing periodically with a buffing pad can renew and refresh its appearance by restoring shine, buffing away microscopic scratches and evening out the floor’s surface.


Check the manufacturer's recommendations for polishing products and follow the instructions exactly.
Never use wax on a floor with a urethane or other glossy finish.

, Use protective window coverings, such as curtains and blinds, to block UV rays and protect the wood from excessive heat. If left uncovered and exposed to direct sunlight, most wood types will gradually begin to age and fade. Rearrange rugs and furniture regularly so the wood’s appearance will age evenly.

, When routine cleaning no longer restores the floor’s shine, it's time to recoat the surface. How often you need to do this depends on the amount of foot traffic you have in your home. Unless you’ve done it before, you will probably need to contact a professional to refinish your floor’s surface.If your floor surface has deep scratches, visible gouges, discoloration and other significant damage, consider sanding your floor and then refinishing it. Unless you have experience, contact a professional for this.
You might have difficulty re-sanding a pre-finished floor. Many new pre-finished floors only have a small core of wood and can only be sanded once.

Avoid using water and vinegar to clean with, as well., Position them inside and outside your home’s exterior doors. Encourage visitors and family members to wipe their feet on them. Place additional mats in other high-traffic areas, such as in front of the kitchen sink and down frequently used hallways. A floor mat should also be placed in any area where water might be splashed, like by the kitchen sink.


Be sure to use floor mats that are made specifically for hardwood floors.Other types of mats, such as rubber-backed and non-ventilated mats, can trap moisture and debris underneath, causing surface damage to the floor.
Shake the mats out regularly to prevent debris build-up.

, The legs of furniture can leave behind significant scuffs and scratches on your floor’s surface. Place stick-on felt protectors under the legs of your furniture and keep them on at all times. These felt protectors get dirty quickly, so replace them often. If you don't, the debris embedded in the felt may scratch your floor.


Never drag a piece of furniture across a hardwood floor.
You can also try using thin, cup-shaped plastic protectors to cover the legs of furniture.

, Try to avoid wearing them when you have to walk on the floors. Consider keeping a pair of slippers or socks near the entryway so you can easily remove your heels at the door.

, Unfortunately, your pet’s claws can easily scratch the surface of your floor. Trim their claws on a regular basis to prevent this. If you are unable to trim the claws yourself, bring your pet to a professional groomer. Pay attention to your pet’s paws, as well. Pets often track in debris and other substances that can stain and scratch your floor. Keep your pet’s paw pads as clean as possible.

Ponder patterns.",How to Choose an Area Rug1," Area rugs come in all different sizes, from welcome-mat to 15’ by 15’ (450 by 450 cm). It’s important to make sure the rug will fit into the room it graces. However, by the same token, don’t skimp on size. Many rooms that would look great with an 8’ by 10’ (243 cm by 305 cm) rug look strange with a 6’ by 9’ (90 by 135 cm) rug, for instance.If you’re struggling to visualize rugs of different sizes, try laying out newspapers in different sizes where you want the rug to go.;
, Your rug will be sharing space with your tables and chairs, so they should complement each other as well as possible. When you’re selecting your rug’s size and proportions, consider not only the room it’s going into, but the things that will be on top of it.A rug can really tie a living room together. Try arranging a sofa, coffee table, and chair on a big 8’ by 10’(243 cm by 305 cm) rug, or place a small 3’ by 5’ (91 by 141 cm) rug beneath a coffee table. Should you keep the legs of the sofa on or off the rug? Many design experts say that it’s up to you--just be consistent.In the dining room, measure your table, then add add 54” (140 cm) to both the length and width. These are the dimensions you’ll need so that guests can rise without pushing their chairs off the rug.If you’re buying an area rug for the bedroom, an 8’ by 10’ (243 cm by 305 cm) rug is the right size for a queen bed, and 9’ by 11’ (275 by 335 cm) is perfect for a king.You can also place a little area rug at the foot of a bed., Rugs come in all different sizes, and they’re made in all different ways as well. Some rugs are mean business, and others are fluffy as clouds. Pick a style that fits the room the rug is going to be in, factoring in traffic, washability, and comfort.


A flat weave is ideal for if the rug is going to be walked over a lot (like in a hallway or family room). This is easier to clean than a shag rug, and durable.Shag weaves are luxurious and heavy, but they are best suited for low-traffic areas like the bedroom. They should be avoided if anyone with muddy feet could come near them.A plush low pile suits a rug that’s going to be sat on a lot and walked on occasionally. It’s a good choice for kid’s rooms and playrooms., Rugs come in a dizzying array of fiber compositions, from wool to recycled t-shirts! The fiber you choose has a lot to do with your style--not just your visual aesthetic, but the feeling that you want to impart when you walk on the rug. Here are a few popular fibers to choose from.


Woven animal fibers, like wool, can be incredibly warm, soft, and comforting. They run on the pricey side and require frequent cleaning, which can be expensive.
If you want fluff, you might like synthetics, such as nylon. Synthetics are reasonably priced and easy to clean, as well.Plant fibers, like cotton and jute, can be really soft like their animal counterparts, and they clean up easily too. However, they sometimes wear out after a few years., If you’re buying a rug for a room that’s already been decorated, you probably already have a working color scheme in place. A pastel rug will complement a shabby chic aesthetic, while a burgundy Oriental carpet will add to a Victorian feel. You can also use the color of a rug to pick up smaller design elements in the room (for instance, an orange rug might call back to the sun in a print on the wall).Don’t be afraid to add a pop of color! If your room is decorated in neutrals, a bright rug might perk it up beautifully.Pale rugs can be intimidating, but they shouldn’t be overlooked. They can do a lot to brighten up a space. Furthermore, if they’re machine washable, they’re quite easy to care for., A patterned rug can do a lot to dress up a simple room! If you have a room decorated with a lot of solids, think about adding one or two brightly patterned rugs to jazz things up. Patterns range from traditional Oriental designs to bold, modern stripes and dots."

Be patient.,
Examine the knotting.,
Be willing to pay a bit more.,
Investigate the ethics of the rugs you like.,
Buy a rug pad, too.",How to Choose an Area Rug2," It can take months to find the ideal rug. Even if you’re not a hardcore interior design perfectionist, it’s best to accept the fact that you may not be able to find your ideal rug in a single shopping session. Check multiple stores for your rug, and allow yourself ample time in each one.

, If you’ve found a rug with a beautiful front, don’t forget to look closely at its back, too! Rugs can be knotted a few different ways, which influences their lasting power and (to a certain extent) their value. In general, hand-knotted rugs are valued above all, though hand-tufted and machine-knotted rugs are respectable, too. Here’s how to tell the difference between them.Hand-knotted rugs have no trimming or backing to hold the knots in place. They may have small imperfections, if you look carefully.
Hand-tufted rugs have a cotton backing glued to the underside. They are slightly less durable than hand-knotted rugs, but they can last a while as well.
Machine-knotted rugs have an dulled version of the rug’s pattern on their backs. They also may have additional fringes that are sewn on (instead of being incorporated into the weaving).

, Area rugs are much more inexpensive than wall-to-wall carpeting, but a good one doesn’t come cheap. Some interior decorators offer a rule: for consistency in interior decorating, your rug should cost about the same as your sofa did. If you’re strapped for money, it’s good to check vintage stores and eBay for diamonds in the rough., Unfortunately, many rugs are produced in factories that benefit from child labor. This means that if you’re making an effort to resist child labor, you may need to do a little research on where your rug comes from. There are many nonprofits that can help--like Good Weave, which stamps ethically-produced rugs with a special symbol., If you want your rug to stay looking its best, get a rug pad of the same size at the time of purchase. In general, thin pads made of materials like rubber and jute are the best choice. Stay away from thick, waffle-type pads, which will make an area rug look wrinkly. The pad will keep the rug looking good longer, and will prevent it from skidding on a hardwood floor."

Reassemble the swiffer and test.",How to Assemble a Swiffer WetJet," Open the box and unwrap all the pieces. This includes removing any sticky tape from the handle, floor piece, cleaning solution and cleaning pads. Set all these items to the side for easy access.;
, After lining up all 3 of the main pieces, snap the pole with the mop, the middle pole, and the pole with the handle together.


If your Swiffer is pre-assembled, you may need to pull the handle to extend the pole. Listen for a click. Once the pole is extended, it is permanently extended.

, Your Swiffer will generally require 4 AA batteries. To remove the battery panel, click the notch inside the area that holds the cleaning supply. Open the cover and insert the batteries., Your Swiffer should come with liquid cleaning supply. To insert the liquid, turn the Swiffer upside down. The flat side of the cleaner should fit flush against the pole of the Swiffer. Once the cleaning bottle is aligned, firmly press it up into the Swiffer holder.You should hear a click once the liquid is inserted correctly.


Older models may need the lid of the cleaning solution to be turned slightly. In current models, there is a seal that will be broken by the Swiffer. If you suspect you have an older bottle, try turning the lid a quarter turn.

, While looking at the cleaning pad you will see two strips of paper. These will need to be removed to allow the sticky adhesive to seal onto the Swiffer itself. Once removed, line the adhesive up with the bottom of your Swiffer. Put the Swiffer down onto the pad and hold for three seconds and the pad should automatically stick on.Swiffer pads have an extra-tough-spot cleaning strip that is textured. It can be found on one side of the mopping pad. When applying the pad to the Swiffer, put the tough-side at the back end of the mop.
Swiffer pads come in many styles with different cleaning products. If you don’t like the initial choice, don’t be afraid to go back and exchange your Swiffer for a new style.

, To use your Swiffer, lay it on the floor pointed at the mess you wish to clean. Gently press the button on the handle to release the cleaning liquid. Mop the Swiffer back and forth to clean the liquid.


A 2-3 second hold of the button will release enough liquid to clean approximately 10 square feet of flooring.

, To access the batteries, you must remove the Swiffer cleaner. To do so, hold the Swiffer upside down. Push the large button between the cleaner and the Swiffer pole. Pull down firmly to remove the cleaner., The battery tab will have a finger notch you can pull down. Put your finger within the opening and pull down. This will slide the battery cover off., Remove the batteries and replace them with new ones. Check to make sure you are putting them in the correct direction.Batteries should be recycled. Your local township should have a recycling depot that will recycle your one-use batteries free of charge.Save them in a container until you’re ready to dispose.

, Once you’ve inserted the new batteries, replace the battery cover and the cleaning supplies. If you don’t need your swiffer right away, you can test it without putting on a pad by holding the button down.


If the Swiffer doesn’t release liquid, disassemble it and check that the batteries have been inserted correctly.

Hot water will help cut through grime. Ultimately, by using hot water, you’ll decrease the chance that you’ll need tougher solvents that could damage the marble., Distilled water is water that has gone through a process to remove minerals and other impurities. By using distilled water, you’ll reduce the chance of discoloring or staining your marble.


You can buy distilled water at just about any grocery store or box store. It is usually cheap., Pour detergent into a bucket with your hot, distilled water. Follow the directions of the soap and dilute it with an appropriate amount of water. Mix your solution thoroughly. Make sure to only add pH neutral soap to your water.


If you prefer, you may be able to use a commercially prepared marble cleaner. Simply follow the directions on the bottle and then clean as you would with a water and detergent solution. Some products include Stone Tech, Resolve, or Simple Green., Take a mop with a soft mop head (preferably microfiber) and dip it into your solution of detergent and water. Wring out the mop head to relieve it of excess water and systematically mop your floor. Do short strokes that overlap.


Rinse and wring out the mop head after you’ve covered 10 to 20 square feet (1 to 2 square meters). This might vary depending on how dirty the floor is., After you’ve mopped your floor with a detergent solution, you should mop it again with cool clean water. By mopping it again, you’ll help pick up any dirt or debris that remains on the floor. In addition, you’ll remove any suds that remain on the floor.

, When mopping your floors, you need to make sure you change the cleaning solution or water often. If you don’t, your floor might become streaky or could be scratched by debris in the mopping water.


If your water appears brown or you see it full of dirt, dump it. Refill it with new water (and soap, if you want)., Since marble is relatively porous, it’s important to sop up as much of your cleaning solution or water as you possibly can. If you don’t, the solution could leech into the marble and discolor it.Switch out wet and dirty towels as needed.

, All spills on marble should be cleaned up immediately. This is because marble is a porous material and can absorb spills. If you let something sit too long, your marble will discolor or stain.


Take a wet microfiber cloth and use it to blot up anything you’ve spilled on the marble floor., pH neutral cleaners won’t damage marble floors. As a result, stay away from acidic cleaners. They might scratch or hurt the shine of marble floors. Avoid:


Vinegar
Ammonia
Citrus cleaners (like lemon or orange).
Cleaners intended for ceramic floors., One of the worst things you can do to your floor is to let it air dry. By letting it air dry, you’ll allow the water/solution to soak into the marble. This could stain or discolor the marble.

, The best way to limit staining on your floor is to seal your marble periodically. Locate a sealing product specifically formulated for marble. Read the directions and apply the seal onto the surface of the marble. Depending on the product (and use), you may have to reseal every three to five years.


Make sure to protect other surfaces, such as wood, tile, or grout, with plastic or painters tape.
Contact a professional if you are uncomfortable sealing your marble floors by yourself., When you come across a scuff or other mark that won’t come off during a normal washing, use a felt pad to remove it. Simply dab the pad in a mixture of detergent and water and rub the marble gently along its grain.


Do not rub in a circular pattern. This will damage your marble., Take a soft dust mop or a broom with soft bristles and sweep the floor. Make sure to sweep up as much debris as you can. Pay special attention to areas along walls or doors., If you choose to use a vacuum, you need to be careful not to damage your marble floor. The plastic on the nozzle or wheels of a vacuum can etch or scratch marble. As a result, use caution if you decide to use a vacuum


If you have a central vacuum system in your home, you may be able to use a soft floor attachment on the nozzle. However, you should test the attachment in an inconspicuous area (such as behind a door) before using it., Rugs and mats will help accumulate debris. As a result, sweeping or vacuuming your floor will be easy. In addition, rugs or mats will protect high traffic areas from scratches."

Use pest grade or food grade diatomaceous earth.,
Follow safety instructions.,
Choose a dusting tool.,
Dust a fine layer onto carpet edges.,
Dust around furniture legs.,
Keep humidity down.,
Leave in the carpet as long as needed.,
Use other pest control methods at the same time.,
Remove the DE with a filterless vacuum.,
Consider leaving DE under the carpet edges.",How to Apply Diatomaceous Earth to Carpet," Diatomaceous earth (DE) comes in two forms. Most DE sold as a pest control treatment or labeled ""food-grade"" is safe for home use and not linked to serious health issues.Never use pool grade or industrial grade DE in your home, since these forms can (eventually) cause permanent respiratory problems.All DE products are actually a mix of the ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" types. Food grade DE still has a small amount of ""unsafe"" DE, and is still dangerous if inhaled in large quantities.
DE sold for pest control has to meet specific safety standards and list safe instructions on the label (at least in the US), so this is usually the best choice. Food grade DE may not have a detailed safety label, since it is not intended to be used in pure, dry form, but it is similar to pest-grade DE and the risk of harm is low with the precautions below.;
, Since food-grade DE is meant to be stirred into food and eaten, some people assume it is completely safe. However, the concentrated, dry powder can seriously irritate the lungs, eyes, and skin. Review these safety precautions before you begin:Always wear a dust mask at minimum, since inhalation is the main danger. A respirator mask is much better, especially if you plan to use DE many times.Wear gloves, eye protection, long sleeves, and long trousers.
Keep children and pets away from the carpet while the diatomaceous earth is there.
Consider testing a small area first, following the instructions below. Assuming there are no negative reactions from you our your household members, repeat on the rest of the carpet.

, Professional pest controls use special dusters to put down a fine, even layer of dust, but these can be hard for consumers to find.You can use a feather duster, paint brush, or flour sifter instead. Spoon (don't pour) the DE onto the dusting tool slowly, to avoid a cloud of dust.Squeeze bottles or bellows are not recommended, since they cause too much drifting., Carefully apply an even, barely visible layer of dust around the perimeter of the carpet. The insects need to crawl across the dust for it to injure them, and they're more likely to avoid piles or thick layers of dust.Thick layers of DE are also more likely to get kicked up into the air and irritate lungs or eyes.


Carpets are usually only treated on the edges so human activity doesn't kick the dust into the air (where it's more likely to make you cough than kill insects). If the carpet is in a side room, you might be able to dust a larger area and stay out of the room for a few days.

, Diatomaceous earth is not intended for use on upholstery or mattresses, where it can irritate human skin. However, a thin layer around the legs of furniture will affect any insects that crawl up onto the bed or couch.This won't stop the insects from reaching the furniture, but it will expose them to DE on the way and (hopefully) kill them a few days later.

, Diatomaceous earth is more effective in dry environments.Run a dehumidifier in the room if you have one. A cross-breeze can also help, but avoid pointing fans where they could blow away the powder.

, As long as you aren't kicking up dust or coughing (which shouldn't happen with proper application), there's no need to remove the diatomaceous earth. It remains effective as long as it stays dry, and often takes a week or more to start killing insects. Since the insects may have laid eggs by then, leaving on the diatomaceous earth for several weeks will help prevent a rebound.

, It's hard to predict how effective the DE treatment will be. An insect population in one neighborhood may even be more resistant than the same insect species somewhere else. Instead of waiting to see how it goes, attack the insects with multiple treatments at once. Find out about more treatments for bed bugs, cockroaches, carpet beetles, or fleas.

, Diatomaceous earth is very hard and can quickly ruin a normal vacuum's filter. A normal vacuum might be fine for a single, light application, but a filterless vacuum or a shop vac are better choices if you plan to apply the DE multiple times.There is no hurry to remove DE from your carpet unless you applied too much (leaving visible piles of dust). Just keep the proper tools in mind so you don't damage your normal vacuum cleaner during regular carpet cleaning.

, As long as DE stays dry, it can remain effective for months or even years.If you can lift your carpet, consider leaving a thin layer of DE underneath the edges, where it won't get kicked up.


It's best not to leave DE out in households with pets or young kids.

, Stay within the business's means while still purchasing commercial carpet that is high in quality.

, Certain types of yarns are more durable than others and better for areas with high foot traffic.


Tufted carpet with woven backing is ideal for areas where a lot of people will be walking. It has a backing that is punched through and glued to another backing made of plastic, which makes it strong and long-lasting. Most commercial carpets do have tufted construction for durability.
Commercial carpet made of nylon is not only ideal for areas with high traffic, but also does well in areas where it is likely to get wet and dirty. Nylon carpet looks good, lasts a long time and cleans easily.
Olefin yarn is softer and less expensive than other types of commercial carpet, but does not do well in areas with high foot traffic.

, Level loop has small loops and cut pile is short and plush.


Both types of commercial carpet are usually made of either nylon or olefin. However, level loop performs best in high-traffic areas. Cut pile works well in office settings.

, It is important to have the correct dimensions of the space so you are sure to purchase the correct amount of commercial carpet.


Round up to the nearest foot or meter so you are not short on the amount of carpet needed. If you have more than necessary, you can always trim it to fit.

Throw away any old magazines, trash from food, and work- or school-related papers. These messy items are the first things your guests will notice, so they should be the first that you clean up.If you have time before guests arrive, do a second walkthrough with a laundry hamper. This time, pick up out-of-place items from every room, place them in the hamper. Once you’ve walked through the house and placed items in the hamper, return the items to the room they belong in.
For example, grab the cereal bowls from the living-room couch, and place them in the dishwasher.;
, Whether you’re dusting a bookcase or cleaning kitchen counters, always start cleaning on the upper surfaces, and work your way down to the lower surfaces and the floor. This will push dust from higher surfaces down onto lower surfaces, ensuring that you fully clean the appliance or room.If you clean from the bottom up, you risk leaving dirt or other residue on the higher-level surfaces.


This step applies on both large- and small-scale cleaning. If you clean the top floor of your house first, you’ll bring dirt from upstairs rooms down the bottom floor. Then, when you finish dusting and vacuuming the bottom floor, you’ll have removed all of the dust and dirt. .

, Unexpected guests are likely to notice smudged windows and dirty tabletops long before they spot an un-swept pantry.Large, highly visible surfaces—especially windows, tabletops, and counters—show fingerprints easily and should be cleaned. Clean large visible surfaces using Windex or another all-purpose cleaner. You may already have these products around the house, but if not, they can be purchased at a local convenience store or grocery store.


When cleaning large surfaces, like windows, it can help to mentally break the surface down into a grid. This will help you clean the window fully: start in the top-left, then top-right; move to cleaning the middle-left, and so on., Since your unexpected guests are bound to enter by the front door, and the entryway will be the first part of your house that they see, it’s important to concentrate on this area.If there are shoes or coats strewn about, clean those up and put things in their proper place.


Also clean the entryway floor: if it’s carpeted, vacuum the area. If the entryway is tile or linoleum, a quick mopping would help.

, If your guests are going to eat or help prepare food while they’re at your house, you should straighten and wipe down kitchen appliances, the stovetop, counter surfaces, and the tops of tables. Spray an all-surface cleaner, such as Windex or a store brand, over kitchen surfaces and wipe them clean with a rag.


If you’re lacking cleaning supplies, slip an old sock over your hand and use this as an impromptu duster., It’s almost certain that your guests will need to use the bathroom, if they’re staying for any length of time. Depending on the cleanliness of the bathroom sink and toilet, you may need to get out your Comet and toilet cleaner and quickly scrub these areas.Make the bathroom clean and presentable: set out fresh towels, straighten the bath mats, and tidy up any stray toothbrushes, razors, or other personal grooming items.

, If there are sections of your house that it’s unlikely your guests will see, or rooms they’re unlikely to enter—for example, a second-floor home office, or your bedroom—you can skip cleaning these altogether. There’s no need to spend your already short amount of time cleaning areas that won’t be seen.If you have large amounts of clutter that you need to clean quickly, put the messy items in a room that your guests are unlikely to visit, and shut the door.

, Your guests aren’t likely to inspect the cleanliness of your house, but they will notice if things are messy or out of order. For example, since it takes less time to throw out (or hide) a stack of old magazines than it does to scrub out the kitchen sink, take care of straightening messy areas before you break out the cleaning supplies.Put away strewn or messy clothing, close the shower curtain, make sure toilet paper is available, make your bed, and clean books or magazines off of chairs and sofas.

, Vacuuming carpets and rugs is a relatively quick process that makes a great deal of difference in the overall clean appearance of your house.If you’re pressed for time, only vacuum areas where you guests will spend time: start with the entryway, living room, and hallways. Vacuum large open areas first; your guests are unlikely to notice specks of dirt in a dark living-room corner.


Before you begin vacuuming, check your vacuum’s bag or dust-receptacle. Vacuuming with an already-full bag will clean very little dirt from your carpets.

, Most cleaning supplies are designed to be sprayed or applied to surface, and then left to sit for 10–15 minutes before being wiped off or scrubbed away. Giving these products time to sit will increase their effectiveness and make your job (scrubbing off dirt and stains) much easier. If you’re using cleaning products in multiple rooms—for example, both the kitchen and bathroom—spray or apply the products in both rooms before you start cleaning.While you’re waiting for cleaning products to set, focus on other straightening you can do. For example, if you’ve sprayed toilet cleaner in the toilet, use the next 10 minutes to make your bed and put out new towels.

First, find out which type of product was used: natural ones called wax, or synthetic ones called finish. If the previous owner is unable to tell you, you'll need to examine the floor yourself:


If the floor is not shiny or glossy, and you can feel the original material with your finger, it has not been treated.
Wipe a small section of the floor with a cloth dipped in mineral spirits or paint thinner. If the cloth turns yellow or brown, your floor has been waxed.
If the cloth does not pick up any residue, your floor has been finished.;
, If your floor has never been treated, you can select any wax or finish product intended for the material your floor is made from. Polyurethane is a popular, glossy option, but each product will appear slightly different, so do your research and determine which look you want. If your floor has already been treated, you'll need to choose the correct option:


Wax is difficult to fully remove, since it soaks into the wood. This makes the floor unsuitable for a synthetic finish unless you hire a professional to strip the wax fully, but new wax can be applied without difficulty after stripping, or even simply applied on top if the old layer is only scratched, not dirty.
If the floor has been finished, you can go over it with a floor machine with scrubbing pad attachment to remove part of the finish, then apply that same type of finish to improve the appearance. If you can't figure out what type it is, or if you want to use a different type, you'll need to strip the old finish off entirely first.If you don't want to strip a previous finish, you can use a water-based silicone polish instead of waxing. Simply sweep the floor, then apply several even layers of the polish with a mop., Determine where you plan to wax and remove everything from that area. Put up signs in public areas to let people know the area will be off limits for at least 8 hours.


To be extra safe, tape down the edge of any adjacent area to protect it from the wax, especially carpet areas.

, If your floor has not previously been treated with wax or finish, you can skip straight to Waxing the Floor. If it was treated with wax but the old layer only suffers from scratches, not discoloration, you can also skip straight to waxing. Otherwise, you should continue on to Stripping the Old Finish section to learn how to strip the previous treatment away.

, Having determined what type of finish is on your floor by following the instructions for Preparing the Floor, buy a stripping solution that will remove that type. Also make sure the stripping solution is safe to use on hardwood, or whichever material your floor is made from.


If you can't find a product that specifically matches the type of finish previously used on your floor, try out a ""universal"" floor stripping solution on a small corner of your floor to test it.

, Remove all dust and debris from the area using a dust mop if you have one, or a broom if not. Put on clean footwear afterward to prevent further dust from getting on the floor.

, Chemicals in the solution can be dangerous to the skin or create toxic fumes. Work in a well ventilated area and protect yourself with gloves, long sleeves and pants. Use goggles and a respirator mask for large stripping jobs or poorly ventilated areas.


The respirator mask should be labeled as an organic vapor blocker.

, A heavy duty trash bag allows for easy cleanup and lets you use the bucket for other purposes later. Follow the instructions on the floor stripping solution to determine how much you need, and whether to dilute the solution with water.Have a mop ready.


The trash bag is especially essential for mop buckets, since you don't want to later clean your floor with residual floor stripping solution.
A ""strip mop"" is a specialized mop that will do a more effective job, but any mop will do.

, You don't have much time to apply and remove the stripping solution, so it's important to have a second mop handy for cleaning up. The first mop will be too saturated with stripping solution to use for cleaning purposes., Stripping solution makes the floor slippery, so plan your route in advance to avoid having to walk over it. Scrub the floor evenly and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, but do not allow it to dry.

Try to agitate the finish with your mop as you apply the stripping solution. The stripping solution should change color as it removes and mingles with the finish over the next few minutes.If you are stripping a large floor, do so in small sections so the stripping solution doesn't dry.

, For large jobs, an auto scrubber or rotary machine is recommended, as it will do a thorough job pulling up all the finish.If using an auto scrubber, scrub the area leaving the squeegee tool up (not in use).
If using a floor machine or burnishing machine, use the stripping pad attachment. Large jobs may require multiple stripping pads.

, You can use a doodle pad for this or a long handled razor blade tool such as a poll scraper. If you don't want to buy a specialized tool, any sharp flat blade such as a putty knife will do the job. Without stepping on the slippery floor stripping solution, use the blade to work the wax away from edges, where the stripping solution and mop have difficulty pulling off the finish.

You may need to scrub the baseboard as well, if it has picked up wax residue. You can purchase a special baseboard stripping pad if you are using a floor machine.

, Do this after the finish has been worked off but before the solution has dried. If you worked in the stripping solution with an auto scrubber, simply lower the squeegee attachment and pick it up again. Otherwise, you'll need a wet vacuum to remove the solution.


If a section begins to dry out, pour a little water from your clean water bucket to keep it wet.

, Rinse several times to ensure all stripping solution is removed. You can add a stripping neutralizer to your water to ensure the next wax will adhere properly.If you don't want to buy one, simply wash it thoroughly several times.


You can use an auto scrubber or floor machine for this step as well, as long as you change the pad beforehand. Don't use the same pad you used to apply or wipe up the stripping solution.

, Thoroughly clean any tools used, including the interior of machinery hoses and tanks. If left uncleaned, the stripping solution will dry into a hardened mess and ruin your tools.

, Don't move on to waxing your floor until it is completely dry, or the wax may not attach properly. You can put a fan in the room to hasten the drying process.

, Floor wax is a natural product that works into the pores of the wood. If you are trying to create a similar result using a synthetic finish, which bonds over the wood, you will need to follow the specific instructions that came with your product.


Polyurethane, the most common modern finish, should be stirred, then applied as quickly as possible and in one back and forth layer across the room, overlapping the previous stroke so you keep a wet edge. You should wear an organic vapor respirator mask and keep a fan blowing out a window while you work., Use a dust mop to pick up as much dust and as many small particles as possible. Anything you don't get off the floor is likely to get caught in the wax, where it will stay until someone strips off the wax.

, Never use a used mop, even if it doesn't look dirty. Sponge mops that have also been used for cleaning the floor are likely to introduce dirt into the wax, ruining the look.

, The trash bag prevents the wax from caking onto the mop bucket and ruining it for future uses. If you are using a flat wax applicator mop, you can skip this step. Those mops are designed to have the wax poured directly onto the mesh backing on the upper side., Immerse a sponge mop into the wax, or pour some wax onto the upper side of a flat wax applicator mop. If your mop is dripping, you should press it into the wringer portion of the mop bucket or press it against the sides of the bucket. Don't actually wring your mop; the goal is to make it damp with wax, not dry or dripping., Start at the opposite end of the room from the door so you don't have to cross the waxed portion to leave the room. If you try to wax too large an area at once, you are more likely to miss spots or apply the wax unevenly.

If your first layer is too thick, the whole process could fail to set properly. Be careful not to drip excess wax onto the floor, and only use a damp,not soaked mop.Once the floor in one section is evenly covered, mop over it with broad strokes in the same direction to create an even appearance. Now you can move on to the next section.

, This should take about half an hour, but could be longer in areas with high humidity. After ten minutes of natural drying, you can point a fan into the room to make it dry faster, but do not point it directly at the waxed floor.This could interfere with the adhesive.


Read the label of your floor wax for more accurate estimate of drying time.

, After the previous layer is completely dry, wax the floor again. Remember to do it in sections and plan your route to the door.


Your specific floor wax product should include a recommended number of coats. If it doesn't, apply three or four thin coats. Stop if the wax starts turning yellow.
Avoid stepping on or placing anything onto the final coat for 8 full hours to ensure a perfect finish.

, If you allow the wax to dry it will be extremely difficult to remove. Scrub it off of any tools you plan on using again using soap and hot water.

, Many waxes are no-buff and will remain glossy with no further effort. Others require polishing with a buffing pad or burnishing machine. If you don't want to track down specialized equipment, simply use a clean, dry terry cloth towel to polish your floor with a circular motion.


Tie the towel around a dry mop head and you don't have to be on your hands and knees.
A buffing pad can be attached under the brush of the floor machine and used to buff the floor.

, Wooden floors should have an additional layer of wax added once every six to twelve months. Vinyl floors should be waxed every six months, as should sealed ceramic or stone floors., The wax seal is not watertight, so the water could damage the wood. Wipe up spills with a damp paper towel instead. Vinyl and other non-wood surfaces can be cleaned with a damp mop, not a soaking one.


This does not apply to wood treated with polyurethane, which can be mopped with a mop dampened by a mixture of one quart (1 liter) water and 1/4 cup (60 mL) vinegar., Use a terry cloth or buffing pad to polish the floor if it begins to get dull. This shouldn't be necessary for no-buff wax.

, If you don't want to do this manually, use a floor machine with a light scrubbing pad just strong enough to remove a small portion of the wax.


You should apply a new layer or two of wax after removing some to create a strong protective layer again.
This should not be required for several years at least if your floor was waxed properly.

You may also want to clear out a drawer and/or clean out the closet. Be sure to leave some empty hangers for guests too. The space should feel open and inviting., Start by dusting the room. Vacuum or sweep and mop the floor. Also, be sure to clean any mirrors as your guests will surely want to see if they look as good as your room makes them feel!


Be mindful of any strong scents or odors in the space as well. Your guests may not appreciate the jasmine air freshener you love so much. Open the windows and air out the space if needed.

, Take off the old sheets and make up the bed with fresh, clean ones. Tuck in any corners and make sure the comforter is straight and neat. Pile up the pillows and turn down the sheets to create an inviting place to curl up.Lightweight sheets such as cotton or satin are great for warmer months, while flannel or jersey sheets are better for colder months. Matching sheets and a comforter with a gender-neutral design would be best.

, Clean the mirrors, counters, sink, toilet, shower/tub, and floor. Make sure there is soap, a clean hand towel, and ample toilet paper. If guests are staying more than a night, empty a drawer or clear a space on the counter for their toiletries.It is also a good idea to make sure there is a plunger visible to prevent guests from having to ask.

, Check the electrical outlets and electronics, and put fresh batteries in the TV remote. Replace burnt-out lightbulbs, ensure the clock is accurate, and check that the blinds or shades, and doors, will close properly. You should also do a quick sweep for any hazards, like a loose rug that could cause your guests to trip., Lay out an extra blanket or two in case your guests get chilly, and a fan in case they are too warm. You’ll want your guests to have clean towels as well as tissues and a wastebasket. Provide an alarm clock but be sure the alarm is turned off! You could include a reading lamp along with a few magazines or books as well.

, At the very least, provide a clean glass for your guests. If you want to go the extra mile, consider putting a few water bottles in an ice bucket on a tray on the bedside table. You could also add a few snacks; individual bags of chips or crackers, fresh fruit such as apples or bananas; or even foil-wrapped chocolates or cookies would be delightful.

, By adding a few thoughtful items you can make your guests feel more comfortable during their stay. Fresh flowers are a nice touch, as would be a robe and/or slippers., Don't make your guests ask or guess where to find basic items like a hairdryer or iron. If you can't leave things out in plain view, leave a simple note in the bedroom explaining where each item is kept and any instructions they may need to know.This is especially helpful if there is a TV in the guest bedroom with either a tricky remote or different channels than the guest is familiar with.

, If your guests include children, put out a few toys, games, or stuffed animals. You may also want to install a nightlight. If your guests have difficulty getting around, don’t put them on the third floor. Offer a first-level guest room that’s easily accessible, if you are able.

, Discuss ahead of time when your guests will arrive and depart. You can save yourself a lot of hassle by knowing their plans; it’d be a shame to plan an extravagant dinner for the next night only to find out they are leaving in the afternoon.

, If you tend to sleep late or need to be up and out in the morning, let your guests know before you head to bed. This will help if you need to coordinate using a single bathroom and early risers will appreciate knowing whether or not they should wait for you for breakfast, and if not, where they can find something to eat and how they can get a cup of coffee or tea.

, If someone is a vegetarian or vegan, you’ll want to know ahead of time. Be sure to ask about any allergies or dietary restrictions before your guests arrive so you can stock your kitchen accordingly. This goes for beverages as well."

Be flexible.",How to Protect Your Home when Guests With Small Children Visit," Anything they get their hands on will end up in their mouth. (magnets on the fridge, Christmas ornaments,push pins, coins....);
, This will prevent them from opening it and harming themselves with chemicals.

, Choose the room in which you will receive your guests and within that room, put all the breakables up high, out of sight or in another room. Removing temptation is the most important step.

, These will keep the toddlers away from dangerous areas. (basements, stairs) Also, split level houses with steps down into another room can make for a dangerous fall for little feet.

, You never know how a dog might react to new children. Often children are terrified of dogs and cats can scratch when rubbed the wrong way.

, This creates barriers that you can then enforce by telling the children politely but firmly not to enter. Should you discover them opening any of these doors, you are perfectly within your rights to raise this directly with the parents. Remind them you are happy for their children to enter those parts of the house that you have left open.

, These are easy to break and are attractive to children of all ages. If you have children's DVDs and you do not mind the children sitting in the TV area, make them available by having them pre-loaded in your DVD player. Just let them look at the covers and choose what they want to watch from those.

, If this means leaving the living room to go to the dining room for snacks and afternoon tea, then this may well have to be the price that is paid for your sanity. Alternatively, you might like to set up a children's corner in your living room, covered by a blanket to create a boundary.

, Sometimes parents are so relieved to think someone is else is looking out for their kids that they forget to stay vigilant themselves. Gently remind them that you aren't very good with kids and that your house is not very child-proofed. Also add that it would be appreciated if the parents could take care in keeping an eye out for possible dangers to their kids around the house.

, We were all kids once. Sometimes we have to let go and just accept what kids do. And move on to the stain manual afterwards. There are some great wikiHows under Cleaning to help you.

If your jacket only needs a minor cleaning, the pre-cleaning alone might be sufficient, and you might not need to fully wash or hand wash.;
, Down-filled materials can rip easily when wet,so it’s important to take care of anything that could catch or pull during the washing process.


Do up zippers
Button buttons
Close hook and loop fasteners
Secure flaps
Remove items from the pockets and secure the pockets

, With a clean, dry cloth, wipe away any dirt, debris or loose mud from the jacket. This will make the cleaning process a little easier, because you won’t be dealing with large clumps of mud or dust., To clean and spot clean a down jacket, use a pure soap or a special down soap that won’t strip the feathers of oil and make them brittle.Pour a small amount of soap on affected areas, such as stains, tough-to-clean grime, and patches of oil or sweat. Let it soak for about 15 minutes.Good soaps to use include:

ReviveX Down Cleaner

, Fill a bath tub, wash basin, or sink with warm water. Place the jacket into the water and gently agitate it with your hands. Let the jacket soak for 10 to 15 minutes.Soaking the jacket before washing helps to remove excess dirt, debris, and soap from the spot cleaning.
After soaking, move the jacket away from the drain and empty the tub. Gently squeeze the excess water from the jacket.

Clean out the detergent compartment before adding soap.,
Place the jacket in the washer and set the cycle.,
Run a second rinse cycle.",How to Clean a Down Jacket2," Even the residue from regular soaps and detergents can damage down feathers. Before using the machine to wash your jacket, wipe the dispenser with a cloth to remove leftover detergent.When the dispenser is clean, add the amount of down-safe soap as recommended by your soap manufacturer or washing machine.
To clean your down jacket, use the same down-safe soap that you used for spot cleaning.
When down feathers are stripped of their oil, they can lose their loft, or fullness, which is related to their ability to insulate., Wash the jacket alone, to prevent the material from catching or pilling. Before pressing start, set the machine to cold wash, delicate, hand wash, or wools, and a small load size.Only use a front-loading washing machine or a high-efficiency top-loader that doesn’t have the center agitator.

You can use a large sink, laundry tub, or bath tub to wash your down jacket.

, Press the jacket down into the water to get it saturated with soapy water. Using your hands, gently agitate the jacket back and forth in the water to release dirt. Then, let it soak for 15 minutes.


When your jacket is wet and heavy, avoid picking it up to prevent damage., After 15 minutes, push the jacket away from the drain and drain the soapy water from the tub. Without picking the jacket up, rinse the jacket and tub with clean water.

Run the jacket through multiple spin cycles.,
Tumble dry on low.,
Fluff the jacket as it dries.,
Hang the jacket to air.",How to Clean a Down Jacket4," The drying process for a down jacket takes quite a long time, but you can help it along by removing as much moisture as possible from the coat.


Run the jacket through two or three additional spin cycles after the second rinse is complete. If possible, increase the speed of the spin with each cycle.Squeeze the jacket by hand to remove excess moisture if you don’t have a washing machine. Don’t wring the jacket, as this could damage the feathers. Then, lay the jacket to hang on a radiator or hang it to dry.

, After the spin cycles, place your jacket into the dryer along with two or three clean tennis balls. As the tennis balls bounce around in the dryer with the jacket, they will fluff the feathers inside. This fluffing will prevent the feathers from clumping together, and help return their loft.Be warned that the drying process can take up to three hours, but do not increase the heat above low. Higher heat can damage or melt parts of the jacket.Tumble drying is the recommended method for drying down jackets, because air drying can take so long, and eventually the jacket can start to smell. However, if you don’t have a dryer, dry the jacket over a radiator if possible, or hang it to air dry.

, As the jacket dries, remove it from the dryer every 30 minutes to shake the jacket vigorously and break up feather clumps. You know the jacket is dry when the feathers stop clumping together,and when it feels light and fluffy again.


Even if you're radiator or air drying your jacket, be sure to shake it out every half hour to break up clumps.

, When the jacket is fully dry, give it a final shake. Hang it somewhere to air out for a couple hours before wearing or storing the jacket.Never compress a wet down jacket, as this can destroy some of its ability to insulate properly."

Learn about what hosting an exchange student means.,
Find a reputable hosting agency.,
Understand your responsibilities and benefits clearly.,
Talk with other hosts.,
Apply to become a host.",How to Host an Exchange Student1," The United States Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs is a good place to start. While specific requirements may vary between programs, you will need to be able to provide a safe, secure, and welcoming place for your exchange student to live. You must be able to provide transportation and food while the student is with you. You should be able to offer support, guidance, and encouragement for a young person who may feel uncomfortable or frightened by a new culture (at least at first). Most of all, you should be interested in the sometimes-challenging adventure of representing your country and your culture to others.


Exchange programs are usually split into two categories. Long-term programs usually run for longer than eight weeks. They may even be a full academic semester/term/quarter or a year. Short-term programs are usually eight weeks or less.Some programs have specific requirements for who may be a host family. Many programs do not. For example, the US State Department has had host families who were single adults, same-sex couples, military families, and senior couples with grown children.;
, Several government agencies run foreign student exchange programs. Many schools operate their own foreign exchange programs with schools in other countries. There are also private and nonprofit agencies that arrange for foreign exchange students to stay with host families. Whichever route you choose, do some research to make sure that you will be participating in a reputable program. The Better Business Bureau rates many exchange programs.


The US Department of State runs several Youth Exchange Programs.These include exchanges with students from Germany, Eurasia, South and Latin America, and several countries with large Muslim populations.
The Council on Standards for International Educational Travel (CSIET) is a not-for-profit organization that helps ensure quality standards for exchange education in high school. Programs listed with CSIET are likely to be responsible, reputable, and trustworthy. You can also find CSIET hosting opportunities at their website.ASSE International Student Exchange Program is a major sponsor of foreign exchange programs and has many affiliated programs. They might be a good place to start your search., Becoming a host family is a lot of responsibility, but it is also a wonderful learning experience for you as well as the student you host. You are taking on the responsibility for the well-being of your exchange student. Make sure that you are ready to take on that challenge. Having a good support network in place, such as connections within your community, can help you manage this responsibility.


You must provide at least three meals per day for your student. You must also be able to provide transport (or access to public transport), as exchange students are not allowed to drive. Your student’s parents or sponsors will pay for their personal travel, health insurance, and program fees. In many cases, they will also give the student a spending allowance.Most programs require at least one member of the household to be 25 (or 26) or older.Some programs may require host families to have at least two members.You will not be the student’s legal guardian, and you will not be legally responsible for the student’s actions. However, you are expected to set a good example for your student and help them learn about local customs and laws.
The US State Department does not allow hosts to receive reimbursement or a stipend.They do allow you to claim a flat-rate tax deduction of $50USD per month.

, The best way to learn about what it will be like to be a host family is to talk with other people who have done it. If you know people who have been hosts for exchange students, ask them about their experiences! Many programs also have video blogs and online forums where you can learn about the hosting experience., The application process may vary depending on the program you have chosen. Once you’ve completed your application, you will probably have an interview with a program coordinator. When that is complete, you will have a representative to help match you with a student.The State Department requires that you complete a criminal background check as part of the application process.Many programs will allow you to choose your student, or at least set preferences such as the student’s home country, age, and gender.

"
"
Learn about them.,
Prepare a room for your student.,
Provide a study space.,
Offer meals that represent your home culture and traditions.,
Give the student ways to contact home.",How to Host an Exchange Student2," The program should give you the student’s contact information prior to their arrival. Begin communicating with them before they arrive! The sooner you get to know the student, the better.Ask about any allergies or dietary restrictions they may have so that you can provide appropriate food.
Ask about birthdays and other special events. Celebrating these in your home will help your student feel more at home.

, If you have the space, give your exchange student his or her own room. S/he may feel more comfortable having his or her own space, especially in the beginning as s/he adjusts to her new home.


Exchange students do not have to have their own rooms. However, you must provide your exchange student his or her own bed. If s/he must share a room with your own child, your child must be the same gender as your exchange student. The children must also be within 4 or 5 years of the same age., Your student will need a quiet space to study and work. Attending school is an integral part of the student exchange program experience, so give them the resources they will need to do well.Many students will have spending money to purchase things they need. However, providing some basic school supplies, such as pens, binders, and paper, will be a nice way to show your support of the student’s academic goals.

, One of the reasons students from other countries participate in foreign exchange programs is to learn about a new country and culture. Providing meals that represent your cultural background will give the student a “taste” of their new culture.


Make sure that you’ve gotten information from the student about any allergies and dietary restrictions.
Respect your student’s traditions. For example, if the student is an observant Muslim, avoid serving pork and other restricted foods.If you do serve a food that is prohibited by your student’s traditions, make sure that they have options they can eat.
Encourage your student to share their food traditions with you! You will discover some delicious new foods and they will get to feel like they are contributing to their new home life., Students may feel homesick, especially at first. Giving them ways to contact their family and friends back home will help them feel connected to their loved ones. This will make it easier for them to adjust to their new home with you.


Skype and other internet services offer ways to place video and phone calls, even overseas, at affordable rates (or even free).
Give the student access to the internet so that s/he can email home.

"
"
Ask what s/he would like to be called.,
Let your student know about your home’s rules.,
Be open to learning.,
Bring the student along, even on mundane errands.,
Involve the student in local sports and activities.,
Show the student around.,
Make yourself available for questions.,
Don't talk down to them.,
Be kind and welcoming.,
Make them part of the family.,
Recognize signs of trouble.",How to Host an Exchange Student3," Ask your student how to pronounce his or her name, and try to say it that way. Your student may even have another name they wish to go by, so asking what to call them up front can ease their transition.


For example, many Asian students choose to use “English” names. These may sound similar to their home-language name (e.g., “Jenny” for “Zhenni”) or may be a name they just like the sound of.
You should also tell the student what they should call you and your family. Many students come from cultures that place a high value on respect for elders, so they may feel uncomfortable calling an adult by their first name unless you tell them it’s all right.
You could even have the student offer names or nicknames for you and your family in their native language. This could be a great opportunity to learn something about your student’s language and cultural traditions.

, It is perfectly acceptable for you to enforce reasonable ground rules for your exchange student. For example, if your own children must be home by 10PM on school nights, you should let your exchange student know that s/he has the same responsibilities. Participating in a family’s home life is a big reason why exchange students choose an exchange experience.Students on exchange programs are usually told that they must follow their host family’s rules and expectations. Other common areas for rules and expectations might include:household routines
policies about inviting friends over or having sleepovers
phone and internet use


Remember that your student may be coming from a family with very different rules and traditions. Be patient and accept that your student will probably make mistakes just as your own children will. Remember, they’re just kids too!, Your exchange student has come to your country to learn about your culture and country. However, the learning experience runs both ways -- this is one of the most exciting things about being a host! Never assume that you know everything about your student’s culture. Encourage your student to share their experiences and traditions with you, just as you are doing with them.


Even if you are fairly familiar with your student’s national culture, you don’t necessarily know what their individual and home life is like. Be open to asking questions and learning.Ask open-ended questions, such as “What do you like to do for fun at home?” This will encourage the student to share their experiences with you., Part of the reason the student has chosen to participate in an exchange program is to learn how people in your country live their daily lives. A run to the local supermarket or department store might seem humdrum to you, but it could be an enjoyable new experience for your student. Doing everyday things will also help them feel more at home, rather than feeling like a tourist.


This is especially true if you are an American hosting a foreign student. American grocery stores and supermarkets are often excitingly huge to international students, who may be used to more compact shops., If your family has children, they can offer to introduce the exchange student to some of their own activities. It’s a good idea to encourage your student to get involved in school activities, such as sports and clubs. This will help them build a network of friends.


If your community offers fun activities, let the student know about these opportunities too. Don’t push the student into anything they don’t want to do, but let them know what options are available.

, Your exchange student is in your country to be more than a tourist. S/he wants to learn about a new culture and get experience interacting with new people and new customs. However, it’s a good idea to show your student around your hometown. Let them get to know the community they will be living in.If you have local attractions or landmarks, take your student to visit! Student exchange programs aren’t a vacation, but getting to see local places of importance are a big part of getting to know an area.

, Your student may have many questions about the new culture they’re immersed in. Foreign customs and social matters can be very difficult to figure out as an outsider. Make sure that your student knows they can ask you any questions they have about school, daily life, culture, or anything else.If your family has children, encourage them to share their own experience with the student. There’s no better way to learn, for example, how to deal with social cliques in a foreign high school than to hear all the details from a student who deals with them every day.
You might want to consider visiting with your school’s counselor to make sure your student is adjusting to school., Exchange students must be able to speak their host family's language with basic proficiency. There’s no need to talk painfully slowly unless they request it. Don’t assume that they don’t understand what you’re saying.On the other hand, be aware that your student’s understanding of your language may be limited, especially at first. S/he may not understand everything you say. Don’t condescend to them, but be willing to repeat and explain things.

, You shouldn’t treat your exchange student like a pampered guest with no responsibilities. That isn’t why the student has come to your country on an exchange program. However, you should always try to be kind and supportive of the student.


Remember that politeness and etiquette can be very different across cultures. For example, your student might seem standoffish to you, while they might feel as though they are just being respectful. Talk with your student about his or her home customs.

, If you have chores or simple tasks in your households, let them be a part of it too. Chores could include dishes, taking out the trash, or even walking the dog. Most programs encourage you to involve your student in the daily responsibilities of your home life. This encourages the student to feel more like a family member than a visitor., Most exchange students report loving their exchange experiences. After the first few days or weeks, they will usually adjust to their new life. However, your student might have more difficulty adjusting. You should know what to look for in case your student is having trouble. Warning signs include:Continuing difficulty with the language. For example, the student’s language skills do not improve even though you are involving them in conversations and explaining new concepts to them.
No interest in activities or socializing. Your student should be making new friends. Hopefully, they will also find activities they enjoy. If you don’t hear anything about this, it could be a sign that the student isn’t adjusting well.
Excessive isolation. If your student spends most of time in his or her room and doesn’t seem interested in making new friends, this could mean they are not happy.
Constant calls home. Too many calls and emails home can be a sign that the student is dealing with severe homesickness.
Behavior changes. If the student seems more anxious, depressed, or irritable than usual, they may be having trouble.
School performance. A big part of the exchange experience is academic. If your student isn’t performing well in school, they could be having trouble with the language or the school culture.
Talk with your student if you see any of these things. Offer to help find them assistance, such as a language tutor. Encourage them to see a school counselor. Notify your host program. Don’t let your student’s stay be marred because they have a few difficulties!

Check your lease and determine your rights and responsibilities.,

Allow them the allotted time to move out.,
Do not overstep your authority as a roommate or landlord.",How to Evict a Roommate," Before you do anything, you need to take a really good look at your lease. Study it carefully and determine what your rights are. Terms for eviction will always be laid out in the lease. Depending on your position as a tenant or as landlord, you will have different resources and options. Consider:


If you’re the landlord and your roommate is a tenant, you are in a much better situation than if you were not the landlord.
If you’re both co-tenants, your roommates’ violations of the lease might also put you in jeopardy of being evicted.
If your roommate is not on the lease and you allowed them to move in without permission form the landlord, your situation is a bit more precarious.
If you’re not on the lease and your roommate is, you probably have little recourse to have someone evicted.;
, Often times, you can’t just evict a roommate because you don’t like the person anymore. You have to actually have a legal cause that is covered in the lease agreement that the person signed. If there was no lease agreement, then you need to have sufficient legal cause to evict the person. Causes might include:


Your roommate is no longer paying rent under the terms of the lease.
Your roommate has been engaging in illegal activities at your home. This could include drugs or violence.
Your roommate has caused damage to your home and has not taken action to fix it.
Your roommate has broken other terms spelled out in the lease agreement and has taken no action to fix the problem., After you’ve taken a good look at your lease and know you’re position, you should talk to your roommate about him or her leaving. Most rational people will respond to this approach and leave, if they can. If you initiate eviction without talking to your roommate first, you’ll likely upset them and they might dig in just to spite you.


Ask your roommate to talk. At an opportune and calm moment tell them you have ""something serious to talk about.""
Instead of telling them you'd like them to get leave, explain to them your feelings and your position. Tell them that whatever they've done or is doing has put you in an ""uncomfortable position"" and that you are unhappy.
Avoid accusations and talk in terms of your feelings. Never make unsubstantiated charges.
Be polite and do not insult them. Tell them you'd really appreciate it if they would respect your position and help you remedy the situation. And explain to them that them vacating would be better for both of you. Talk in terms of a ""mutual benefit."", If you don’t own the property, you need to initiate communication with the landlord as soon as you decide to take action against your roommate. As the other important legal entity on the lease, your landlord has the right to initiate eviction if your roommate has violated the terms of the lease contract., Before you take any action to actually physically remove your roommate from the property, you need to consult your local and state laws regarding tenant rights. Many localities have laws that give substantial rights to tenants and to people residing in properties they do not own. If you violate these laws, you may give your roommate more leverage against you in your effort to evict them.


Tenant laws vary with each state. Your local courts will have information on the specific steps that must be taken to evict your roommate.
Some cities and states are much more sympathetic to tenants than others. If you’re in one of these jurisdictions, you’ll have a much harder time evicting your roommate.
Contact an attorney if you have any questions about local and state laws protecting tenants., In order to aid your eviction effort, you should gather any information or evidence you can about what your roommate has done to warrant his or her eviction. If your roommate is doing something illegal or dangerous in the home, document it. If your roommate has failed to pay rent or contribute to utilities, make sure to save receipts and record any amounts that they have not paid.


Don’t violate your roommate’s personal space while gathering evidence.
Don’t spy on your roommate or violate their personal privacy.
Avoid any activities that might induce your roommate to exhibit violent behavior., Hiring a lawyer might be your best recourse if you’ve talked to your roommate about leaving and he or she still refuses to leave. A lawyer will take the stress off of you and make sure that your effort to free yourself of an unwanted roommate is legal and goes as smoothly as possible.


You can choose to pursue legal routes to eviction on your own, but it might be time consuming.
The cost of hiring a lawyer might be prohibitive, so shop around.
If you choose not to hire a lawyer to take over the eviction process, you might want to do a 1-time consultation with a lawyer so they can educate you about what you need to do to. , Put together an eviction letter to formally give notice to your roommate to vacate the property. This letter will serve as a legal and official representation of your intent. There are several things your eviction notice must say:


It should include the grounds for eviction and specific lease violations.
It should outline the amount of time your roommate has to leave. This is typically 30 days depending on the laws of your city or state.
The eviction notice must include your name and the roommate's name.
The eviction notice must include the address of the home and a room description he or she used (i.e. ""2nd bedroom on right, 2nd floor"").
It should include the date the notice was given and the date the roommate is to be out of the house. , As landlord, you’ll now have to serve your roommate with the eviction notice. This means you’ll present the eviction notice to them. Depending on the local laws, you can do this in several ways. They might include:


Hand the notice to your roommate.
Post the notice on your front door or on your roommate’s door.
Send your roommate the notice via certified mail.
Some states may require hand delivery of the eviction notice and that you get a written acknowledgment that the roommate has received it. Check your local jurisdictions before serving the notice.
Depending on your state or local laws, even people who are not landlords have the right to serve an eviction notice., After you’ve served your roommate with an eviction notice and they have not chosen to leave, you’ll wind up in front of a judge. Here the judge will review your lease, hear your complaint, and listen to your roommate’s side of the story. The judge will then make a decision and rule in favor of you or your roommate.


In court, you might have the opportunity to present the evidence you gathered about your roommate's lease violation.
Very often judges decide in favor of the landlord or owner, if they have cause.
Following the law, documenting your case, and doing everything properly will greatly increase your chance of a happy outcome in court.
Judges will often provide a certain amount of “reasonable” time for a tenant to vacate after being evicted., After you’ve served your roommate with an eviction notice and a judge has ordered your roommate to leave and they’ve still refused, you’ll have to call the police to enforce the eviction.


Do not try to physically remove your roommate on your own.
Oftentimes, people usually have 72 hours after a court ruling to vacate the premises.
It might be best to avoid your roommate or at the very least avoid prolonged conversations after a judgement is given by the court., Although you might think you’ve won this whole process, it’s not over until your roommate is gone and you’ve changed the locks. Horrible things can happen in the 72 hour period between a court ordered eviction and the time the person is compelled to leave by law enforcement (unless they leave on their own accord). Your roommate could:


Damage your home.
Take your personal property.
Try to slander you to your neighbors.

, After you’ve done everything you can to get your roommate evicted legally, you need to also give them the allotted time to vacate the premises. In most situations, someone who is evicted has a certain amount of time to gather their belongings and leave the property on their own accord. Consider:


In many places, people have 72 hours after eviction to leave the property.
If you compel the person to move without allowing them their allotted time, you may open yourself up to a lawsuit.
The time a person has to leave after formally being evicted will be outlined by local or state laws or the presiding judge in the case., All tenants of a residence, whether they are on the lease or are not, are afforded some rights. Most jurisdictions protect people from being thrown out of their residence or being denied use of their residence without proper review by the judicial system. In many cases there are a number of things you should not do:


Don’t change the locks. While it might seem like a good idea to simply change the locks, there is a good chance that this will be interpreted by the law as an illegal activity.
Don’t mess with their stuff. You might be tempted to just throw all of your roommate’s stuff into the street. Don’t do this. It’s illegal in many jurisdictions.
Don’t turn off the utilities. You may want to try to force them out by turning the power and water off. In many jurisdictions this is illegal.
If you are in doubt about what you should not do, consult local laws and regulations and/or call an attorney."

Open the washing machine lid.,
Open the front door of the washing machine.,
Remove the dispenser.",How to Clean a Fabric Softener Dispenser1," If you have a top-loading washing machine, lift up the lid as if you were going to start a new load of laundry. The fabric-softener dispenser is usually located right under the lid, in one of the corners.The fabric softener dispenser is usually located next to the detergent dispenser and the bleach dispenser, depending on the structure of your washing machine.


If you’re struggling to find the dispenser’s location, check your washing machine’s manual. It should have a layout showing the location of all parts of the machine.;
, If you have a front-loading washing machine, you’ll need to look on top of the machine to access the softener dispenser. Most front-loading machines have a drawer or slot for fabric softener under a lid on top of the machine, next to the drawers for laundry detergent and bleach.If you can’t find the fabric softener dispenser there, it may be located just inside of the main door.


As with a top-loading machine, if you can’t find the fabric softener dispenser, check the washing machine manual for a display showing the location of the dispenser.

, Some washing machines have removable fabric softener dispensers, while others feature a non-removable dispenser.If yours is removable, reach in and gently pull the dispenser out of the washing machine. This will make the dispenser easier to clean. Since it may be clogged, the fabric softener dispenser will likely be gunky and covered with soap and fabric softener.


If your washing machine features a non-removable dispenser, it can still be cleaned while lodged within the laundry machine.

Create a cleaning solution.,
Submerge the fabric softener dispenser in the cleaning solution.,
Agitate the solution.,
Wipe the dispenser clean with a soft cloth.,
Re-install the fabric softener dispenser.",How to Clean a Fabric Softener Dispenser2," In a large bowl or a bucket, create a solution of 1 gallon (3.78 liters) warm water, ¼ cup (2 ounces) of liquid dish detergent, and 1 cup (8 ounces) of bleach.Since bleach is an abrasive and potentially harmful substance, wear rubber gloves while making and using the cleaning solution. You may also want to wear old clothes, in case any bleach splashes on them.


If you don’t already have any of the cleaning supplies around the house, you can easily purchase all of them at your local grocery store.

, Place the dispenser into the liquid gently, still wearing your rubber gloves, so that you don’t splash any of the bleach solution out onto yourself. You can let the dispenser soak for about 5–10 minutes so that the bleach and detergent mixture cleans the residue from the plastic., You can lightly shake the bucket or bowl holding the cleaning mixture so that it flows over the fabric softener dispenser and dislodges some of the gunk and grime stuck on the dispenser. When you do this, be careful not to splash any of the bleach solution out on your clothing or skin.


You can agitate the bucket once or twice during the 5–10 minutes you’re soaking the dispenser. More than this is unnecessary.

, Once you’ve waited 10 minutes and pulled the dispenser out of the cleaning mixture (still wearing your rubber gloves), use a clean rag or cotton cloth to wipe the dispenser clean.Remove all residue of soap and fabric softener, and fully dry the dispenser with the cloth.


If there are certain areas of the dispenser that you cannot fully wipe clean with the rag, find an old toothbrush. The toothbrush will allow you to scrub corners or other areas of the dispenser that are hard to reach., Now that you’ve removed and cleaned the dispenser, you can set it back in place in your washing machine. If the housing that the dispenser is set in also has a grimy buildup, you can clean this off by dipping your cloth in the soapy cleaning mixture and wiping the area down."

Fill a bucket with a mixture of warm water and liquid dish detergent.,
Pour the mixture into the fabric softener dispenser.,
Run at least three warm rinses with detergent.,
Try vinegar.",How to Clean a Fabric Softener Dispenser3," Pour a small capful of your regular laundry detergent into a bucket or large mixing bowl, and then fill the bowl with warm water from your kitchen tap., Being careful not to spill any of the water and detergent mixture, slowly pour the liquid into the soap and laundry softener dispensers. Then run the washing machine on the “warm rinse” setting to run the detergent through the machine and the fabric softener dispenser.If your laundry machine does not have a “warm rinse” option but only has a “cool rinse,” you can follow roughly the same cleaning procedure. However, you’ll need to pour hot, sudsy water into the fabric softener dispenser between each rinse. This allows the water and detergent to break down and clean whatever’s clogging the dispenser.

, Repeat the rinsing process at least three times, so that the detergent solution can clean out grime and build-up from the fabric softener dispenser. Each time you’ll need to pour another bucket full of warm water and laundry detergent into the fabric softener dispenser.You may need to reach inside of your washing machine’s fabric softener dispenser using a damp rag in order to wipe out any gunk or grime that has not been cleaned with the detergent and water mixture.

, Many cleaning sites also recommend using a vinegar mixture clean your fabric softener dispenser. If your dispenser is not fully cleaned by using liquid detergent and water, you can run vinegar through the dispenser to remove the clog.Vinegar—especially when coupled with baking soda—will clean the interior of your washing machine from any buildup that has accumulated over time, and will also clean out your fabric softener and soap dispensers.

Dyed sheepskins should be dry cleaned because washing will most likely remove too much dye coloring.",How to Clean a Genuine Leather Sheepskin Rug," That way, the wool will not mat up more during the washing process.;
, Larger sheepskins can be washed in a bath using luke warm water (38°C/100°F) and using a small amount of sheepskin woolskin wash. Single sheepskins can be washed on a gentle wool cycle in a washing machine if you don't want to hand wash.

, But not so much movement that the wool mattes up like felt. Swish the water gently for three to five minutes.

, Repeat the rinse until the water stays mostly clear.

, After this, transfer the rug to a washing machine (if it fits) and a pin out most of the excess water gently. You could use a laundromat to spin out the excess water for larger sheepskins. You may also let it drip dry, but this will take a lot longer.

, Use a clean towel to lay it on and pull the leather into shape making sure it is laying flat, leave it this way for 24 hours.

A low heat setting is OK in a tumble dryer for a single sheepskin. For larger sheepskins a dehumidifier can help speed up the drying time without damaging the leather.

, Don’t be tempted to speed up the drying process.

, If it is a warm day the wool will dry very fast. Give the sheepskin wool another good brush as it dries and a final brush once completely dry. The end result should be fluffy and knot free. Don't worry if some wool comes out in the carding brush, this is normal.

, If you do wash a dyed sheepskin rug use table salt in the water to help fix the dye and to stop too much washing out.

Remove the exhaust vent louver on the outside of your house.,
Clean gum or candy out of your dryer.,
Remove crayon from your dryer.,
Remove ink from your dryer.",How to Clean a Clothes Dryer," It is not uncommon for the exhaust hose on the back of your dryer to be full of lint and debris. This lint is extremely flammable and can be a fire risk. It also dramatically reduces the efficiency of your dryer.Remove as much of the debris from the dryer’s hose exit as you can by hand.
Use a vacuum cleaner to remove the last small bits of lint and debris from the opening that connects to the dryer hose.;
, You probably remove lint from the lint catcher regularly in the process of doing laundry, but it needs an occasional thorough cleaning to help maintain the level of efficiency your dryer was designed for.Take the lint catcher out of the lint trap and remove any lint built up on it.
Vacuum the screen and the lint trap that holds it using a narrow nozzle on the end of the vacuum hose.
Wipe the trap and screen down with a damp cloth. Ensure the lint trap is completely dry before running the dryer again.

, The drum of the dryer is where you place the clothes that you want to dry. While you probably only put clean, wet clothes in the dryer, things can get caught in the drum or fall out of your clothing that make it necessary to clean the drum occasionally.Vacuum the inside of the drum to remove any lingering dust or debris.
Wipe out the drum using an all-purpose cleaner and a cloth or paper towels.

, You can clean the exterior of your dryer with a number of off the shelf all-purpose cleaners or with mixtures of common household items you make yourself.Use a half vinegar, half warm water mixture to clean the exterior of your dryer without chemical cleaners if you choose.
Spray the dryer or rag with your cleaner of choice and wipe down the exterior completely.
Pay close attention to the area around the dryer's base and the lid as they are the most prone to gather grime and lint.

, You may choose to clean out the hollow body of the dryer that you cannot easily access. This is not required and will not increase the efficiency of the dryer, but may be appropriate when moving or selling the appliance.You may be able to simply lie the dryer on its side and vacuum out any escaped lint from the bottom.
Completely enclosed dryers will have small bolts on the back or along the bottom that hold the outer metal housing onto the frame of the dryer. Removing those bolts will allow you to slide the body of the dryer off the frame and vacuum any escaped lint from inside the body.

, The dryer vent that leads from the dryer to the outside can become clogged with lint, dust and debris. Clogging this hose can dramatically reduce the efficiency of your dryer and even cause fires.Pull the dryer away from the wall to make the hose easy to access.
Most exhaust hoses are held on with a hose clamp that will loosen by using a flat head screwdriver to unscrew the clamp.
Once the clamp is loose, simply slide the hose off of the dryer and slide the dryer further out of the way.

, Insert the toilet brush into the flexible hose section and use the bristles to scrub any debris loose that is still present.Use a vacuum cleaner to remove any debris you scrub loose and to clean out any remaining dust or lint from the hose.
Do not use a coat hanger or other pointy object to scrape the inside of the hose as it may puncture the hose. A punctured hose will have to be replaced.

, The flexible hose section connects the dryer to the wall, then from the wall there is a tube that allows the exhaust to pass to the outdoors. This area is also subject to clogging with lint and debris and will require cleaning.Wrap a towel around a broomstick or piece of wood and insert it into the mouth of the vent.
Move the towel around to remove any immediate blockages and scrape the lint in the tube loose.
Look into the tube to see if there are any obstructions blocking the passage of exhaust to the outdoors.

, The exhaust vent will have a decorative cover on the outside of your house that prevents lint and debris from escaping the tubing. Locating and removing the louver will allow you to remove the last of the lint from your vent.The louver is usually held in place with one or two screws that you can remove with a Philips head screw driver. Many others simply pop on and off without fasteners.
Remove large chunks of lint or debris with your hand and inspect the tube for obstructions.
Use the same broomstick and towel to scrub excess lint from the inside of the exhaust exit and knock out any obstructions you may notice.

, If gum or candy has melted in your dryer it can be extremely difficult to remove, but failing to do so could lead to ruining your clothes on future loads.Use a hair dryer to heat the candy or gum until it is pliable, then scrape it off using a credit card or scraper.
Spay a small amount of all-purpose cleaner onto the candy to remove any excess material that did not scrape off.
If there is still some residue left, use warm water to wet a washcloth and leave it on the candy for a few minutes. Scrub the gum or candy again when you return and repeat the process until it is all gone.
Dry the interior of the dryer before using it again.

, If you have children, a melted crayon in your dryer may be an inevitability. Be very careful when following these steps as WD-40 is flammable and could cause a fire if improperly used:Use a credit card or scraper to remove any chunks of crayon that are present.
Spray a small amount of WD-40 on a rag and use that to scrub the remaining crayon material out of the drum. It should come off fairly easily.
Do not spray WD-40 into the drum of the dryer. The WD-40 could seep through the holes of the drum and cause a fire the next time you turn it on.
Wet a rag with water and use it to wipe down the areas of the drum you used WD-40 on and ensure it is completely dry before operating the dryer again.

, Having a pen explode in your dryer can be extremely frustrating. Some inks do not dry readily, so you may run the risk of ruining any further clothes you put into the dryer.Try using soap and water to remove the ink that remains in the drum. Some inks can be scrubbed off with relative ease.
If the ink stain persists, try using an all-purpose cleaner. This will work for most other kinds of ink.
If the all-purpose cleaner fails to remove the ink, blot some rubbing alcohol on a rag and use the rag to scrub away the remaining ink. Rubbing alcohol is flammable, so never apply it directly into the dryer drum.
Wipe the dryer out with water again then ensure it is completely dry before operating it.

Find a large area to sort clothes.,
Gather all the laundry into this area.,
Prioritize sorting into piles.,
De-prioritize the following into piles: Clothes that don't fit, off-season clothes, clothes that need repair, clothes you wear only when nothing else is handy.,
Place all these piles into manageable bags that each contain only enough clothes to fill a washing machine.,
Do it now!",How to Catch Up on Dirty Laundry," Move furniture out of the way, if you must. If you can take over a bed or table for sorting, do so.;
, This includes bed and bath linens, dishtowels, slip covers, etc.

, Start with underwear, socks, and work clothes as top-priority items. Then come favorite items that you wear frequently. If you don't have clean linens for bed and bath to replace the dirty ones, go ahead and prioritize them too.

,


Don't forget to come back to these piles. Mend an item if it's a favorite. Get rid of it if it doesn't fit or flatter. If you have a lot of things in this category, chances are that they're just getting in your way, jamming up your drawers and closets, making it harder to put away and find what you do wear. Throw away underwear and socks if they have holes or hopeless stains.







, You may need to prioritize the ""priority bags,"" depending on how many piles you have.

, The sooner you start, the sooner you'll finish. The laundry task isn't finished until you've put away the clean clothes. If something doesn't fit or doesn't make you feel great to wear it, then don't bring it back in the home. Or even try a yard sale!

Determine if your fabric will receive dye.,
Prepare your workspace.,
Fill your bucket or stainless steel sink with very hot water.The hotter the water, the deeper the color result.,
Pre-dissolve your powder dye in a separate container in very hot water.,
Pour the mixture into your dye bath (the bucket/sink).,
Submerge your garment in the dye bath.,
Remove the clothing from the dye bath and rinse it in warm water first.,
Hang or machine dry the clothing.",How to Brighten Faded Black Clothing1," Fabric dye works best on natural fabrics such as cotton, linen and silk. Synthetics such as rayon and nylon are also good candidates. There are a couple of fabrics that won’t accept dye well – 100% polyester and spandex. Avoid attempting to dye those.


It’s recommended that you don’t attempt to dye the fabric of any garment labelled “dry clean only”.
The different fabrics absorb dye differently from one another, with results that vary in appearance. If you are concerned about a particular garment, test a swatch first.;
, Cover your entire workspace with plastic or newspaper before you begin. Make sure to have sponges and paper towels within reach in case of spillage. Use plastic buckets, stainless steel buckets or a stainless steel sink to create your dye bath.


Don’t use bath tubs made of porcelain or fiberglass for any part of the dyeing process because they will stain.
You will need to be wearing rubber gloves during the entire dyeing and rinsing process., 140°F/60°C is the maximum temperature you can use and will result in the deepest black color. Make sure you use enough hot water to completely submerge your garment.If you want the deepest black and your tap water doesn’t get hot enough, use a stove, teakettle or microwave to heat the water.

, Be sure to dissolve it thoroughly and use a chopstick or any other handy tool you don’t mind staining to stir the mixture until well mixed. If you’re using liquid dye, all you need to do is shake it well before adding it to the bucket.


Check the dye packaging to make sure you are using enough dye for the amount of clothing you’re dying. The amount needed varies from product to product, so consult the packaging or insert for exact measurements.

, Make sure that the mixture blends well into the hot water. There needs to be enough water in the bucket so that your garment can move around freely and be stirred while in the dye bath. This is so that your garment will get evenly dyed.Add one tablespoon of laundry detergent to the dye bath. This will help promote dye absorption. Make sure that you stir the laundry detergent into the dye bath until it is well dissolved.
When dyeing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add 1 cup of table salt to the dye bath. This will intensify the color.
When dyeing nylon, silk and wool, add 1 cup of white vinegar to the dye bath to intensify the color., The longer your garment is left in the dye bath, the darker the result will be. Garments can be left in the bath for up to 1 hour. You will need to constantly agitate and stir the garment while it’s submerged in the bath.


Try to keep the temperature of the water as consistently hot as possible, so have a stove top, microwave or tea kettle nearby to heat water up to use to refresh the dye bath.
Another option would be to use a large stainless steel pot for the dye bath and go through the process with the pot being heated on the stove to keep a consistent temperature.If you soak your clothing in plain hot water for a few minutes before putting them in the dye bath, it will smooth them out so that they can accept dye even more easily., Warm water removes the dye on the surface of the garment more efficiently. After the warm rinse, then rinse in cold water. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.


When you remove the items from the dye bath, they will be wet and appear darker than the final result will be.
Turn your items inside out and place them in the washing machine.Wash them alone in warm water with a mild detergent. Use the gentle cycle.

, You can dry your items either way, but hang drying clothing preserves their dark colors, so it’s probably a better idea to get in that habit. Once dry, your clothing is ready to wear.


For the first 3 times you wash your newly dyed clothing after wearing, wash the items alone in cold water using the gentle cycle and mild, non-bleach detergent.
After that you can wash the dyed items with other items of the same color that haven’t been dyed, but make sure it’s always in cold water and using a mild detergent."

Put your garments in the washing machine.,
Brew up a pot of very strong black coffee.,
Add 2 cups of the freshly brewed coffee to the washing machine when the rinse cycle begins.Close the lid of your washing machine and let the machine and coffee do their work.,
Hang your clothing to dry.",How to Brighten Faded Black Clothing2," If you are darkening multiple items, make sure they are all similar in color. Start your normal wash cycle using cold water.


This method is most effective when used on cotton fabrics, like faded black t-shirts. The effects aren't as ideal on other types of fabrics.
If you want to restore clothing to a very rich black color, coffee is less effective than black fabric dye. Coffee will have more natural-looking results.

, The stronger the coffee, the darker the final outcome will be, so keep that in mind when brewing. You will need 2 cups of coffee for this so use a full sized coffee maker, not a single serve or smaller coffee maker.


You can also use 2 cups of black tea instead of the coffee for similar results, if that's your preference.
It doesn't matter how you get the two cups of coffee, as long as they are fresh and dark. If you're an instant coffee drinker, it's perfectly fine to make your coffee with that. Being brewed by a coffee maker isn't a requirement.

, Allow the rest of the cycle to finish up just as it normally would.


If you've used commercial fabric dyes on your clothing before, you'll notice that this method smells much better during the process and after.
The coffee method is also non-toxic, and you don't have to worry about coffee staining the basin of your washing machine.

, Machine drying dark garments can lead to fading, so get in the habit of always hanging up your black clothes after washing them to preserve their color. Once dry, the garment is ready to wear.

Wash dark clothing only when necessary.,
Sort your clothes by color and weight before washing them.,
Hand wash your delicate items and fragile fabrics.,
Turn your black clothes inside out before washing them.,
Wash your clothes in cold water using the gentle cycle.,
Use a detergent made specifically for black or brightly colored clothing.,
Hang your clothes to dry.",How to Brighten Faded Black Clothing3," Each wash cycle contributes to additional fading, so the less you wash them, the better. This is especially true of denim, which fades the most easily.


To get away with washing your dark clothes infrequently, take them off and let them air out after wearing them instead of washing. Put the item on a hanger and hang it somewhere by itself for a day before putting it back in the closet.
After wearing the item and air drying 2 or 3 times, go ahead and wash it.

, Always wash your dark colors together, otherwise the colors may bleed and stain any lighter colored items being washed. Also sort your clothing by fabric type and weight.


If you wash delicate items with garments made of heavier fabric, the delicates can get damaged and the heavier fabrics probably won’t get as clean as they should., The agitation caused by your washing machine during a cycle is far too harsh for your delicates. Hand wash these items in cold water to preserve their color and to prevent the items from being damaged.


If you really want to avoid hand washing your laundry, the next best thing is to get a small mesh bag for your delicates. Put them in the mesh bag prior to putting them in the washing machine. This will cut down on damage to your delicates.
If you have any garments that you are unsure how to launder, dry clean them.

, This protects your black clothing by guarding it against the agitation caused by your washing machine. The wash cycle distresses the fibers of black clothing, which causes them to break down and then fade.

, Warm and hot water can lead to fading and using any other cycle besides gentle when washing dark colors can also lead to fading. These cycles are much rougher on your clothing and the gentle cycle will protect and preserve garments.


If your washing machine also has a soil setting, always use the light-soil setting (unless your clothes are really dirty). The light-soil setting is far gentler on dark color than the other settings., Never use regular laundry detergent with bleach or bleach alternatives. Several companies make detergents that are specifically for use with dark colored clothing, so use that if you can find it.


Use the minimum amount of detergent necessary to get your garments clean. Excess detergent can lead to fading.

, Don’t machine dry your black clothes any more, since the dryer can contribute to additional fading. Pull the items from the machine, shake them out and immediately hang the items individually on a rack so that they can dry.


Once completely dry, they are ready to be stored in your closet with the rest of your wardrobe.

Determine the location of your laundry hamper.,
Assess the level of moisture in clothes that will go into the hamper.,
Think about the volume of laundry you have.,
Consider the style of hamper you want to buy.,
Shop for your laundry hamper.",How to Buy a Laundry Hamper," Your strategy for laundry sorting will depend on the type of laundry you're washing.


Sort by colors, such as whites, brights and darks, to ensure that like items are washed in the appropriate temperature, using the appropriate detergents and laundry additives. Some hampers come with 3 separate compartments, and even have labels to denote what color laundry they hold.
Sort by type, such as machine washable, hand washable and dry-clean only, to make sure items are not ruined by improper cleaning methods. Depending on the volume of laundry you have for each category, you may want to choose different sizes of laundry hampers for each one.
Sort by person in your household to encourage individual responsibility for laundry. Different styles or colors of laundry hamper work well for this, and some laundry hampers can be labeled or embroidered with the owner's name.;
, You may need to transport laundry up or down stairs, or even to your car. The conditions under which you plan to move your hamper will determine whether you need one with wheels, handles or a curved shape to balance on your hip. Transport needs may affect the size of hamper that works best for you, since a fully-loaded hamper can be heavy.

, The appearance of your hamper will matter more if it is in a place visible to guests than if it is hidden away. Additionally, if you're short on space, a compact design might be the best choice.

, If you'll frequently fill your hamper with damp items like towels or workout clothes, you should choose one with substantial ventilation. This will help prevent odors and mold.

, A hamper that holds large bath towels will need to be larger than one that only holds hand-washable undergarments. If you do laundry once a week, you might need a smaller hamper than someone who does laundry once a month. Babies (especially newborns) can go through a great deal of laundry in a week, and might actually need larger hampers than school-aged children.

,


Choose a plastic hamper if you want something relatively inexpensive, durable and easy to clean. Plastic hampers are lightweight and easy to carry, but they are not always attractive.
Pick a cloth hamper if you want a hamper that is lightweight and breathable. Prices can vary widely depending on the design, but generally cotton fabric hampers are cheaper than canvas ones. Cloth hampers can be embroidered with the owner's name or the type of laundry that they're intended to hold. Some cloth hampers can be machine washed.
Select a wicker hamper or bamboo hamper if you want a range of attractive styles to choose from. These hampers tend to be more expensive than cloth or plastic, and most cannot be easily cleaned.
Choose a wooden hamper if you want something to match other wooden accessories in your home or to create a designer look. Wooden hampers are generally the most expensive options, and you must make sure they aren't exposed to wet laundry, since damp wood can warp.

, Discount stores, department stores, home furnishing stores and stores that sell organizing items are all places that usually have multiple types of laundry hampers in stock. Prices generally range from $10 to 100, depending on the style and brand of hamper.

Store sweaters dry.",How to Care for Sweaters," Don't ever hang them because hanging sweaters will result in a larger sweater than the last time you put it on, or a misshapen profile.;
, Pilling is caused by rubbing during wear and is more apparent around the elbows, under the armpits and on sleeves but can occur anywhere on the sweater. Purchase a hand-held depiller or a small electric shaver made for depilling. Or pick them off by hand in front of the TV.

, Purchase a baby's or child's soft hairbrush from a supermarket or drugstore. The softness of this brush will enable you to quickly brush off these sorts of unattractive sweater companions.

, If a button falls off or a small hole appears, repair the sweater the moment that you discover it. If not, the hole may get bigger or you might just shove the sweater to the back of the wardrobe, dismissing it as unwearable for its minor fault.

, Wearing it everyday even though you love it will cause it to lose shape or build up hard-to-remove perspiration stains. Alternate it with other sweaters or jackets.

, Unless the instructions tell you to machine wash a sweater, never do so. Woolen sweaters should always be washed by hand in a gentle soap solution. You can either run lukewarm water and turn a favorite scented soap around and around in your hand under the water to make the water soapy, or you can add soap flakes. If possible, turn sweater inside out to wash and try not to wring a sweater; let it drip dry or roll excess water off in a towel. Wringing can cause it to lose its shape. Be extra careful of sweaters with attachments such as beads, embroidery work etc.; use cool water to prevent the colors from embroidered labels running.

, Cashmere is lovely but its appealing softness makes it prone to pilling and touchy to care for. Other delicate fibers include mohair, angora and lambswool. Wash is in a very gentle solution such as Woolite or Lux Flakes etc. Do not wring - instead roll in a large, moisture-loving towel to remove excess moisture and then leave out flat to dry on a towel. If you have access to a flat sweater drying device, use it.

, Do not use moth balls - they smell very bad and are very unhealthy for human beings. Use cedar balls, cedar sawdust in little calico bags, mixed herbal sachets or dry bay leaves between clothing layers or ask at your health food store for a safe alternative to moth balls. Keep wardrobe clean - dust out and vacuum at the end of each season.

, This is very important to avoid providing a free meal for moths. They will accept the invitation!

, Whether you are storing your sweaters for a season or for a few days, never put the sweater away damp. This will encourage the growth of mildew or mold and this cannot be removed. It may also spread to surrounding clothing and will smell bad.

Use a humidifier.,
Treat your carpets with an anti-static chemical.,
Rub upholstery with dryer sheets.",How to Remove Static Electricity1," Static electricity is more active when the air is dry, especially in the winter months when people heat their houses, further reducing humidity in the air. Increase the humidity in your house and workplace by using a humidifier. The moisture in the air can help reduce static charge from building up.Having plants around the house or workplace can help increase humidity as well.
You can create your own humidifier by simply boiling water on the stove. You can add spices like cinnamon or citrus rinds give off a nice scent while you humidify your house.;
, Most carpet retailers or carpet companies online offer spray treatments to treat rugs and carpets. There are also some carpets that are specifically made to with an anti-static component.Lightly spray your carpet with an anti-static spray, and wait for it to completely dry before walking on it. This will greatly decrease the amount of static electricity you experience after walking on the carpet.


To make a static reducing spray at home, you can mix 1 capful of fabric softener in a spray bottle of water, shake the mixture, and lightly spray over the carpet., Rub upholstered furniture or your car seats with dryer sheets to reduce the static buildup on those surfaces. Dryer sheets help neutralize the electric charge.You can also try spraying these areas with a static reducing aerosol or spray.

Re-lace and wear those ""like new"" shoes!",How to Wash Shoes1," You will want to wash your shoes, laces, and insoles separately as this will cut down on the drying time later.


You can, however, wash your laces with your shoes in the washing machine, but doing so with your insoles will leave them water-logged for days.;
, If your laces are real scuzzy, you may want to buy new ones, but you can always try cleaning them by scrubbing them with a soapy brush or putting them in the washing machine with your shoes. Then allow them to air dry completely before putting them on your shoes again.Another way to clean your laces is to simply put or pin them inside a pillowcase, or tie their ends together, and throw them in the washer. This will keep them from getting stuck in the washer's drainage holes.If the laces are white and the shoes are colored, to get the laces as bright as possible you could wash them separately in a normal wash along with other white laundry.

, Using a slightly soapy mixture of liquid detergent and warm water, gently scrub your insoles with a soft brush or rag. Afterward, soak up any excess soapy water with a sponge and allow them to air dry completely before placing them back in your shoes.








If your insoles still smell, enclose them in a bag with baking soda, shake it around evenly, and leave them overnight.If your insoles still smell, soak them for a few hours in a 2:1 mixture of vinegar and water. Then soak them a while in a mixture of warm water, baking soda, and an essential oil, such as tea tree or pine oil., Using a dry toothbrush or a soft brush (e.g. a shoe brush), brush away any surface mud or dirt from the shoes.









Clean off other marks (e.g. from plastic areas) using a brush with warm water, and/or cream cleaner on a cloth or paper towel.
If a brush doesn't clean all the nooks and crannies, you may need to use a toothpick or cotton swab (Q-tip)., Then pin the opening of the pillowcase half-shut with about 3 safety pins, so water can still flow in and out.









To wash your laces in the washing machine at the same time, tie the ends together and put them inside the pillowcase with your shoes.
You can also substitute a mesh bag in place of a pillowcase.

, They will prevent the shoes from banging around inside during the cycle, which could damage the machine or your shoes.








Make sure the towels are old because new towels have lint and dye that might stain your sneakers!Most sneakers are durable enough to be put in the washing machine, but be sure to check the manufacturer's instructions, as companies such as Nike recommend hand-washing only., Powdered detergent can get stuck in your shoes, so use liquid detergent. You can also add some vinegar to remove odors and some pine oil to disinfect them.If you add pine oil, the product should be at least 80% pine oil., Set your washing machine to the delicate setting, cold temperature, slow or no spin, and no tumble drying. Warm temperatures can warp your sneakers, and the fast spin or tumble dry setting can damage your shoes or washing machine., Once the washing machine has stopped, remove your shoes from the pillowcase and set them aside to air dry. Putting them in the dryer is not advisable, as the dryer can warp the soles of your shoes.Stuffing your shoes with paper towels or newspapers will help them dry faster as well as maintain their shape.Place your shoes (and laces and insoles) in a moderately lit place to dry. Do not put them somewhere hot (e.g. near a radiator) or in direct sunlight, as this may damage the shoes.
It may take several hours or even a couple days for your shoes to dry completely, so plan ahead!If you're in a rush and need to use the dryer, wrap your shoes in a towel and set the dryer to ""delicate,"" checking periodically to make sure your shoes are not getting too warm., Once they are completely dry, replace the insoles, re-lace your shoes, and slip 'em on! They should look and smell much better now!

Keep your skin moisturized.,
Change your clothes.,
Wear shoes that dissipate static.",How to Remove Static Electricity2," Rub lotion on yourself when you get out of the shower and before getting dressed, or rub it on your hands intermittently throughout the day.


Dry skin contributes to static electricity and static shock, so lotions and moisturizers help to prevent static electricity from accumulating on your body., Switch from wearing synthetic fibers (polyester, nylon) to wearing natural fibers (cotton), which are low static materials.If your clothes are still affected by static electricity, you can rub dryer sheets on your clothes, or spritz them with a little bit of hairspray.

, Wear leather-soled shoes, which are excellent for reducing static shock, rather than rubber-soled shoes, which accumulate and create static electricity.Try experimenting with different kinds of shoes to see which shoes create the least amount of static shock. If you can, walk barefoot in the house.
Some shoes worn by those why work with electronics have conductive strands woven into the soles of their shoes which discharge static electricity as they walk.

Add baking soda to the wash. Add ¼ cup of baking soda to your clothes before starting the washing cycle.,
Add vinegar to the wash.,
Add a damp washcloth to the dyer.,
Shake your clothes.",How to Remove Static Electricity3," Baking soda creates a barrier between positive and negative charges from building up and creating static.


Depending on the size of the laundry load, you may need to adjust the amount of baking soda you add in. For bigger loads you can add about ½ cup of baking soda, and for small loads you can use 1 or 2 tablespoons of baking soda.Baking soda is also considered a water softener and a fabric softener.

, When your wash machine is transitioning to the rinse cycle, pause the machine and pour in ¼ cup of white distilled vinegar. Restart the machine to continue the rinse cycle.Vinegar serves as both a fabric softener and static reducer in the laundry.

, For the last 10 minutes of the drying cycle, turn the dryer to the lowest heat setting, and add a damp washcloth to the machine. Allow the dryer to carry out the rest of the drying cycle.The damp washcloth helps add moisture to the air, preventing electrical charges from building up in the dryer.

, As soon as your clothes are finished drying in the dryer, take them out and shake them. This prevents static electricity from setting in.Alternatively, to reduce static even more, you can air dry your clothes and hang them on a clothesline to dry.

Attach a safety pin to your clothes.,
Run a metal hanger over clothes.,
Carry around something metal.",How to Remove Static Electricity4," Attach a safety pin to the seam of your pants or at the back neck of your shirt. The metal of the pin discharges the electrical build up in your clothes, preventing static cling and electrical shocks.Attaching the pin at a seam allows you to hide the pin, but still reap its static reducing benefits.

, Run a metal hanger on the surface (front and back) and inside of any article of clothing. This will reduce the electrical charge of the item of clothing, by transferring the electron charges on the clothes to the metal hanger., Always keep some piece of metal on your person, whether it’s a coin, a thimble, or a keychain. Use any of these items to touch the grounded metal surface before you touch it with your skin.This is also know as grounding yourself, so you never accumulate electrical charges, but the charges are instead transferred to the metal object.

Use a dryer sheet.,
Add a few dryer balls.,
Hang your clothes to dry.",How to Remove Static from Polyester Clothes1," The fabric softeners are positively charged, so they will bond with the negative charge found in the polyester clothes, which helps balance and neutralize static buildup., The friction created when garments rub together in a dry environment, like a tumble dryer, can cause electrical charges to cling to the fabric, which creates static electricity.To help minimize static, add a couple of dryer sheets to your tumble dryer. As the sheets heat up, they release and oil that then lightly coats the polyester clothing. This lubrication helps minimize the amount of friction, which reduces static cling.Be sure to dry polyester garments at a low temperature., When added to the dryer, wool dryer balls can help clothes dry more quickly and help reduce static cling by preventing the clothes from sticking together. As they move around, the balls help separate the clothing and expose them to the dry air.This separation also reduces friction, thereby minimizing static.


Dryer balls aren’t as effective if they are added to a large load of clothes. Make sure you only add them to small and medium loads so they have room to move around.Add three large dryer balls per load.If you don't have a dryer ball, add a tennis ball or two to your tumble dryer to get the same effect.

A CO detector should be able to emit at least an 85-decibel sound that can be heard within 10 feet. If you or someone in your house has hearing problems, you may want one that has a louder horn.Some detectors come in sets and can be connected with each other. When one goes off, the others will as well. This is ideal for a larger domicile.Check the lifespan of the sensor as they can wear away. Your unit’s sensor filament should last at least five years.Some detectors offer a digital display that will give you an exact readout of the CO measured in the air. This feature is not necessary but may help you detect harmful accumulations more quickly.

, For a small apartment, you can use only a single detector but if you have more than 3 rooms, you’ll want multiple detectors. You’ll want to place them strategically in areas where CO accumulates.


CO is lighter than air so it will rise toward the ceiling. Place the detectors on the wall as close to the ceiling as possible.If your home has multiple stories, you should have at least one on each level. Place one detector near each sleeping area.Don’t place them in the kitchen, garage, or near a fireplace. These rooms will experience short-term spikes in CO that aren’t harmful and will set the alarms off unnecessarily., The display and sound settings vary greater from brand to brand and model to model so you will need read the manual thoroughly. Most digital displays will provide a number that tells you the amount of CO in Parts-per Million (PPM) and some include a timer to specify the length of the testing time. Many will include a volume adjuster, a backlighting option, and auto power-off feature.

, The unit should come with instructions to install. Make sure you have the necessary tools while you are out shopping for the detector so you don’t need to make multiple trips.


Make sure you have a sturdy ladder to place them up high on the wall.
You’ll probably also need a power drill. The screws will likely come with the unit.

, Some units are hardwired or plugged in but most run on batteries. The unit should emit a noise when the batteries are low. Make sure you also have at least one spare pack of the necessary battery type at all times.

Put the vent cover under some running water to remove dust and then wipe it down with a paper towel. Dry it with another paper towel before placing it back on the vent., Clogged chimneys are one of the primary causes of CO accumulation. Even if you only use your fireplace once or twice a year, you’ll need to get the chimney cleaned once per year. If you use your fireplace at least once a week, have it cleaned every 4 months.You won’t be able to adequately clean a chimney without the proper tools. Unless you own an extended scrubber and know how to use it, hire a professional.It’s also a good idea to remove noticeable soot from the fireplace itself to prevent CO accumulation. Use a heavy-duty cleaner like ammonia to spray down the inside of the fireplace and then scrub it with an abrasive scrubber. If you’re using a corrosive chemical, purchase a surgical mask to wear while you’re cleaning., Cooking devices, especially ovens, can also emit CO. If you use it regularly, check your oven for soot buildup at least every other week and clean it with ammonia and an abrasive scrubber when it’s dirty.If you notice that soot is building up easily, you may want to have an electrician look at the oven.Smaller devices like toaster ovens can also emit harmful amounts of CO. Check for soot around the heating filament and clean it if necessary., If you are a tobacco smoker, smoke outside. Continuous and prolonged smoking indoors, combined with poor ventilation or other risk factors, can lead to a serious CO accumulation."

If the smell in your room is very strong, and keeps returning no matter how much you clean, there is a good chance that it might be trapped in the filters., Ozone generators produce O3, which oxidizes organic molecules (a common cause of smells). Many people find this an effective way of getting rid of smoke smells. Place the generator inside the room and set the timer. Make sure that all of windows in the room are closed. Vacate the room and close the door behind you. This will allow the ozone to fill the room. After the generator shuts off, wait at least one hour before going back into the room.


Ozone generators may irritate the throat. They are not recommended for those with asthma. They can actually make things worse.Turn on the fan in the air conditioner in the room, if possible. This helps to circulate the air as well as clean out the air conditioner.The stronger the smell, the longer you will have to set the timer. For example, if the smoker used the room for a few days, you'll need to run the generator for a few hours. If the smoker lived there for several years, you'll need to run the generator for a few days.
Ozone generators can only remove the smoke smell to some extent. If the smell has sank into the walls, floors, curtains, and furniture, you may not get the smell out all the way."

You can swipe a microfiber cloth over all sides of these surfaces to remove dust. If there is any dust in cracks and crevices of larger machines, use a long-handled dusting wand to remove.
In addition to dusting off the surface of these devices, check for dust around them. Vacuum dust from along cords and vents, as a lot of dust tends to gather in these places.
Some people may use compressed air to get dust out of electronics. This may be safe for some electronics, but you should always read the manufacturer's instructions first. Compressed air may be too strong for certain electronic devices., If you have kids, or collect plush toys as hobby, these can be a major source of dust.

See if your vacuum cleaner has a ceiling fan or dusting attachment.,
Extend the vacuum handle to reach the fan.,
Run the attachment along the fan blades.,
Look for stray dust.",How to Clean a Ceiling Fan1," Many vacuums come with a dusting attachment that allows you to affix a brush over the vacuum’s hose, making it easy to dust surfaces without having to worry about scattering dust everywhere. You’ll need a dusting attachment if you choose to vacuum your ceiling fan. If your vacuum doesn’t have one, they can usually be purchased for around $10.For best results, use a dusting attachment that is wide and flat, not circular.;
, Stand slightly off to the side below the ceiling fan and hold the vacuum handle at arm’s length. You may need to be elevated to reach the top of the fan blades if you’re short, have high ceilings or if the dusting attachment on your vacuum doesn’t have a curved structure. Make sure you’re able to move the vacuum hose along the length of the fan blade from where you’re positioned.


If need be, find a crate or step-stool to lift you closer to the fan. When standing on an object for support, be careful that the sweeping motions you make to clean the fan don’t sway you off balance.

, Turn on the vacuum cleaner and begin brushing the fan blades. The brush attachment loosens the settled dust so that the hose can promptly suction it up. Complete a full sweep of each blade, moving the hose slowly in a single direction first, then going back over the blade to catch any dust that you missed.Make each pass with the vacuum smooth and straight, rather than jerky back-and-forth motions, which can send dust flying.

, Even with the vacuum method, you may have knocked some dust off the fan and sent it drifting down below. Make sure there isn’t dust on the floor or on any furniture in the immediate area below the ceiling fan. If there is, this dust can also be vacuumed up, or you can quickly wipe it up by hand.

Acquire a long-handled duster.,
Give your magnetic duster a charge.,
Make sure the dusting head or pad is clean.,
Slowly dust from one end of the fan blade to the other.,
Replace the dusting head or pad as needed.",How to Clean a Ceiling Fan2," A magnetic duster or Swiffer duster will be perfect. Magnetic dusters make use of static charge to attract and hold dust, while a Swiffer duster’s specially designed material grips and locks in dust so that it doesn’t go flying. Magnetic dusters are typically a couple of feet in length, so they’ll work well for a person of average height (though you might still need a step-stool). If you go with a Swiffer duster, you’ll also need a handle extender which is cheap and can be bought alongside the regular duster at any home goods store.An extendable duster handle and pack of disposable heads can be purchased for less than $15., In order to attract dust, your magnetic duster needs to build up the proper static charge. To accomplish this, take a simple plastic shopping bag and grip it around the head of the duster, then rub it back and forth to fluff the dusting fronds and create static electricity. Your duster should now be able to “magnetize” nearby dust without even touching it.Watch out when touching metal surfaces after using a magnetic duster. Any time you work with static electricity, there’s a chance of a slight electrostatic shock, which can startle and sting.

, If you’re using a Swiffer duster or another kind of long-handled disposable duster, start by attaching a fresh dusting head or pad. Used pads that are clogged with dust won’t hold the new dust that they come into contact with, and you might even lose dust and make a new mess. Fit a new pad or dusting head onto the end of the extendable handle and you’ll be ready to take on fresh dust.

, Hold the handle of the duster overhead and drag the duster over the top of the fan blade. The grippy material should capture even thick coats of dust in a single pass, making the fan a breeze to clean. Repeat this process of the remaining blades.


Go slowly so you don’t sweep dust onto yourself!

, The fan may be especially dirty or the dusting head or pad may run out of usable area before you’re finished. Should this happen, pause long enough to switch out the dusting head. If you don’t you may just end up sweeping dust off the fan and into the floor. Duster replacements are inexpensive, so it should be no problem to make sure you’ve got more than one to get the job done right.

Use a cloth or hand dusting glove.,
Set up a ladder or step stool to get closer to the fan.,
Apply some dusting spray.,
Wipe each blade clean.",How to Clean a Ceiling Fan3," Dusting gloves easily slip onto your hand and allow you to wipe away dust using multiple contoured projections, but a simple cloth will work if you’re dusting by hand and don’t want to go to the trouble of shopping for new supplies. A dusting glove will be ready to use right out of the package, but you’ll want to slightly dampen the cloth before getting started as this will allow it to hold more dust.Softer materials like cotton and composites like microfiber will do a better job of collecting dust, especially when damp., You’ll need to get level with the ceiling fan in order to clean it by hand. Using an indoor ladder or step-stool, carefully position yourself under and slightly to the side of the fan. One of the advantages of manually cleaning your ceiling fan is that you can grab hold of the blades to stabilize them, and once you’ve finished cleaning one blade all you have to do is rotate the fan and you’re ready for the next.Be extremely careful when using a ladder for household tasks. Have someone hold the ladder for you, if you can, and never climb to the highest step. If no one is around to help, use conservative motions while on the ladder to prevent it from rocking.

, It’s recommended that you use a dusting spray like Pledge or Endust for best results; these sprays provide a layer of moisture to hold the dust in place and leave surfaces with a polished shine. Spritz a small stripe of dusting spray on each blade. You may not need to dampen your cloth when using a dusting spray.Some dusting sprays contain wax that can build up on surfaces and may not be good for them over time. Obviously, these are not recommended for use on certain materials. Make sure you look the product over to know exactly what you’re buying.

, Go over each fan blade with the cloth or dusting glove using straight, linear strokes. Thicker coatings of dust will likely require multiple passes when cleaning by hand, so you may have to periodically wring out the cloth before continuing. Apply the dusting spray a second time if you prefer, and look for dust that has escaped the fan once you’re done.

Purchase an oxygen bleach product.,
Find the right size container.,
Fill the container with hot water.,
Add oxygen bleach as directed by product label.,
Soak the fabric.,
Wash the item.",How to Remove Set in Stains1," There are many to choose from, but OxiClean is probably the most easily recognized. The specific product you buy is your preference, but you should look for a powdered formula that contains sodium percarbonate and sodium carbonate. Other fillers will reduce the efficacy of the product.Some other recommended brands are Biokleen’s Oxygen Bleach Plus, Oxo-Brite (which is supposed to be earth-friendly), and Vaska’s Oxygen Brightener.;
, You need a container than can fit the piece you need to clean, plus enough water for the piece to soak in. For small items, a sink or bucket works well. For something large like sheets or a comforter, you might need to find a clean trash can or large plastic tub.


For large items that are only stained in one particular area, you could place it so only the affected area is soaking in the container.

, Although it is sometimes recommended that you use cold water to avoid setting the stain, oxygen bleach requires hot water to work. For most items, you’ll want enough water to fully submerge the piece in the water., You want to follow the product use instructions because different products have different concentration levels. Following the label closely will ensure you use the right amount. Also, stir the bleach around to help it dissolve. The water should be cloudy and slightly grainy.

, The length of time needed depends on the type of stain and how bad it is. You may only need to leave the piece soaking for 30 minutes or so. For best results, let the item soak for about 5-6 hours, as this is the length of time the oxygen bleach will stay active. Check the piece of fabric every hour to see how well the stain is fading.Occasionally stir the clothing around and try to mix up any oxygen bleach that has settled at the bottom. You can also add more hot water as it cools.

, After the item has soaked and the stain seems to be mostly gone, wash the item as you regularly would. You can also add a little more oxygen bleach to the wash cycle to give it an extra boost.Always check the stain again before drying the item, as drying can set the stain worse if it is not yet removed.
If the stain remains after the soak and wash, either repeat the process or try another stain removal method.

Remove grass stains with vinegar.,
Remove ink stains with hairspray.,
Remove sweat stains with crushed aspirin and water.,
Remove blood stains with meat tenderizer.,
Mix baking soda and water.,
Use dish soap for grease stains.",How to Remove Set in Stains2," Soak the stained portion of the fabric in undiluted white vinegar for 30 minutes. Depending on the size of the stain and the size of the garment, fill a large bowl or wash basin with enough vinegar to cover the stain and allow the fabric to soak. Then launder the garment as you usually would. If the stain remains after washing, do not dry it. Treat it again., Place a paper towel under the stained portion of the item. Spray a liberal amount of aerosol hairspray on the stain. Lightly dab at the stain with another paper towel. The paper towel under the cloth is to keep the stain from soaking through to other portions. This can take some time depending on the amount of ink in the cloth, so repeat the process of spraying and dabbing until the ink is removed.Another option is to spray the stain with enough hairspray to soak it, and then wash as you regularly would.

, Crush three uncoated aspirin with the back of a spoon and mix into ½ cup of room temperature water. Allow the stained fabric to soak in this mixture for 2-3 hours. Then wash the garment as you usually would., If you are trying to clean protein based stains, especially blood, meat tenderizer is a great choice because it breaks down the protein. The amount you use will depend on the size of the stain, but for stains that are less than 2 inches wide, use 1-2 tablespoons of non-seasoned meat tenderizer powder with 1-2 tablespoons of water. Let a paste form and spread it over the stain. Let it sit for at least 5 minutes giving it time to break down the stain.You can rinse the spot clean with water and if the stain remains, apply the meat tenderizer paste a second time and allow to sit for longer.

, Combine four tablespoons of baking soda in ¼ cup of lukewarm water and mix into a paste. Apply this liberally to the stain and rub at it with your finger or a toothbrush. Let the paste sit for a while to work fully., If you work in the automotive industry, you’re likely to get covered in grease daily. Standard detergent is not formulated to fight greasy stains, but dish soap is. Put the item in a gallon size zip bag, fill with hot water and squirt a liberal amount of dish soap in. Shake the bag for a while and then let it soak. You can repeat as necessary if the water becomes too dirty."

Act quickly.,
Assess the damage.,
Determine what kind of stain you have.",How to Remove Stains from Paper1," This is the most important step for proper stain removal. The faster you begin cleanup, the better your results will be. Stains left alone for a long time begin to ""set,"" becoming harder to remove.If a stain has dried and set in a valuable or irreplaceable item, restoration is still possible! However, the methods are fairly complicated and possibly dangerous to the inexperienced. If the methods outlined here are not enough, consult a professional archivist.;
, Is your item salvageable? Stain removal is typically reserved for relatively small areas of discoloration. You can clean a splash of tea, but nothing can be realistically done for a paperback soaked by a whole pot.

, Before you do anything, keep in mind the type of substance on the paper. The type of stain will determine your method of cleanup. This article explains how to take care of the three most common stains:



Water-based stains: This group is probably the most likely. It includes most types of beverages, including coffee, tea, and soda. These liquids act as a sort of dye, leaving pigment behind as a stain once dried.

Oil or grease stains: As their name suggests, these are stains caused by oils, such as those used in cooking. These stains are generally more difficult to remove than water based stains, as grease leaves behind oily clear spots in paper.

Blood stains: Whether from a paper cut or a nose bleed, blood can often find its way onto a book. While blood is technically water based, special consideration during cleanup must be made to prevent a permanent yellow stain."
"
Mop up as much of the staining liquid as you can with a dry, folded paper towel.,
Wipe down and dry a waterproof surface and spread the page onto it.,
Moisten a clean paper towel and once again carefully dab the stain.,
Prepare a dilute vinegar solution.,
Moisten a cotton ball with the solution and carefully dab a small word on the document.,
Dab the cotton ball on the stain.,
Dab the area where the stain once was with a dry paper towel.",How to Remove Stains from Paper2," If the towel soaks through, use a fresh one to mop up the rest. Careful dabbing will minimize the size of the stain by not spreading the liquid around.Press lightly up and down with care so as to not damage the paper.

, Be absolutely sure your work area is clean or you will have a second stain to remove! Hold the paper down at two or more corners with clean, waterproof objects. This step is to minimize the possibility of wrinkling the page.

, Repeat this with fresh paper towels until you stop seeing color come off onto the towel. With water based stains that haven’t been left to dry, most pigment will be removed using just this method. If your stain persists, move on to the next step., In a bowl, mix a half cup of white vinegar with half a cup of water. Most other types of vinegar will themselves stain paper, so be sure the vinegar you use is completely clear. This step should be done away from the paper to avoid spills and further damage.

, Check to see if any ink has come off onto the cotton ball. Some printing methods produce ink that will not run, but others will. In case it does, be sure to select the smallest, least conspicuous part of the paper to test.


If ink has come off of the document, further attempts at removing the stain may ruin your paper.If the cotton ball is clear, proceed to the next step.

, Any remaining pigment should be dissolved by the vinegar and be lifted from the page.If the stain was large or dark, you may have to repeat this step with a fresh soaked cotton ball as the first becomes dirty. Using fresh cotton balls ensures you don't inadvertently spread the stain across the page.

, Allow the paper to air dry. If the item you just cleaned was the page of a book, leave the book open to that page. Use weights to hold down paper towels on the pages on either side of the freshly cleaned page.

"
"
Soak up any excess oil with a paper towel.,
Fold a paper towel so that it is at least two sheets thick and wider than the stain.,
Place the paper on top of the paper towel.,
Fold a second paper towel and place it over the stain.,
Put a heavy book on top of the second paper towel.,
Remove the book after a few days.,
Place enough baking soda onto the paper so that it completely covers the stain and leave overnight.,
Remove the baking soda and check the stain.",How to Remove Stains from Paper3," As with water-based stains, do this as quickly as possible. Oil stains generally don't set in the same way that water-based stains do, but they can still spread quickly. Wash your hands before moving to the next step to make sure they are free of oil.

, Place the towel on a clean, hard surface. Make sure to pick a surface that won't be damaged by the oil just in case it soaks through the paper. The best places for this are the kitchen counter, a glass table, or a metal workbench. Avoid wood furniture.

, Make sure that the stain is over the paper towel. It is best to center the stain so that there is roughly an inch of paper towel also covering the clean part of the page on all sides. The extra space is there in case the stain spreads a little over time.

, As with the first paper towel, make sure it is at least two sheets thick. Again, make sure the paper towel is around one inch wider than the stain on all sides. This is especially important to avoid getting oil on the object in the next step.

, The best books to use are hardcover textbooks and dictionaries. Any flat, heavy object may be used instead of a book. If the stain was inside of a book, close the book with the paper towels inside and place a second book on top.

, The stain may be completely removed at this point. If the stain is still visible, try replacing the paper towels and put the book back on the paper for another night. If any oil still remains, proceed to the next step.

, The baking soda should be in a relatively tall pile. If you can still see the paper through the baking soda, add more! Other non-staining absorbent powders will also work for this step.

, Repeat Steps 7-8 with fresh baking soda until the stain is completely gone.If after a few tries the stain is still visible, you may need to take your paper to a professional restorer. However, keep in mind their services will most likely be expensive.

"
"
Soak up as much blood as possible with a clean, dry cotton ball or a paper towel.,
Moisten a cotton ball with cold water and carefully dab at the stain just enough to wet the area.,
Mop up the moistened stain with a dry cotton ball.,
Repeat Steps 2-3 until blood fails to come off the paper onto the cotton ball.,
Buy 3% hydrogen peroxide solution.",How to Remove Stains from Paper4," If the stain is not your own blood, exercise caution and use gloves for this and all subsequent steps. Some bloodborne pathogens can remain infectious for days outside the body. Dispose of all soiled cleaning supplies with care.

, If possible, chill the water in a bowl with ice cubes. Never use warm or hot water to clean blood! If you do, the heat may set the stain and make it permanent., Carefully dab the area until dry. Tamp gently up and down. Do not dab at a dry stain, as that may damage the paper.

, This will likely need to be done a few times. If the stain was fresh, this may be all that's necessary to remove the stain. If the stain persists, go on to the next step.

, Repeat steps 2-3 using hydrogen peroxide instead of water. Repeat as necessary. Do not be tempted to use bleach on a blood stain! Bleach can break down the proteins found in blood, leaving behind an unsightly yellow mark."
"
Dissolve 2 cups (408 grams) of borax in 2 quarts (2 liters) of warm or hot water.,
Add your mildew-stained fabric into the solution and let it soak for 5 to 10 minutes.,
Gently brush your normal detergent into the fabric.,
Wash on the highest setting allowed for your fabric.,
Air-dry the item, and repeat the cleaning process if necessary.",How to Remove Mildew from Fabric1," This method of removing mildew from fabric uses a borax soak to pre-treat your laundry before washing it. To start, make a mixture of borax and water with a ratio of about 1 cup (204 grams) of borax per 1 quart (1 liter) of water, then add more borax and water if needed. Use a clean bucket or tub to hold your mixture.


Borax is a cheap, readily available laundry additive. You can find it in more grocery stores alongside the other laundry detergents.
If you can't find any borax, use an ordinary detergent or non-chlorine bleach that's safe for your fabric.
In general, hot water cleans stains (including mildew) better than cold water, making it a good, default choice for laundry.However, not all fabrics may be safe for hot water cleaning. If your fabric can't be washed in hot water, allow the mixture to cool first. Don't mix borax into cold water; it will most likely clump up.;
, Use a stick or spoon to agitate the fabric. Make sure all of—not just the mildewed portion—gets a chance to absorb the solution.


If your fabric won't stay under the solution, you can weigh it down with a jar.

, Once your fabric has had a chance to soak, remove it from the solution and gently squeeze it over a sink or drain to remove the excess water. Next, apply a small dot of normal detergent to the mildew stain and use a soft-bristled brush (such as an old toothbrush) to scrub the stain away.


It's a good idea to scrub the stain from the opposite side of the fabric when possible. Doing this can work the stain away from the fabric, rather than driving the stain further into it. It also reduces the appearance of wear-and-tear on the article.

, Your fabric is now pre-treated and ready for the wash. In general, hot water and a long, high-powered wash will be most effective at cleaning your fabric. However, these conditions can damage some fabrics, so obey all instructions on your item's care label.


Unless your item is seriously soiled, you can safely do an entire load of laundry at this point without fear of harming the other clothes, so don't be afraid to toss in similar fabrics with your soiled item.
For whites, you may add bleach to the wash. For colored fabrics, use only colorfast bleaches or similar detergents that won't cause them to bleed.

, When your wash is done, hang the clothes up on a clothesline to dry. Don't put them into a dryer, as heat will set in the stains—including mildew. Once the clothes are dry, inspect them; if you notice any mildew, repeat the cleaning process.


Try to dry your clothes in the sun. This will help further kill any mildew.
If you must use a clothes dryer, use the no-heat setting.

Start by vacuuming the affected area.,
Gently scrub with rubbing alcohol and water.,
Let the solution sit for 30 minutes.,
Rinse, blot dry, and repeat if necessary.,
Be ready to discard badly soiled items.",How to Remove Mildew from Fabric2," This method for treating upholstery uses the cleaning power of rubbing alcohol to eliminate mildew colonies that have taken root in your furniture. To begin, first use a vacuum cleaner to remove as much of the mildew as possible. Most vacuums should come with a hose or similar attachment which should make it easy to remove mildew even in tough-to-reach cracks.


If possible, move the furniture to an outdoor area with good ventilation before beginning to reduce the danger of inhaling mildew spores.
It might be a good idea to wear a dust mask for this step, so as to avoid breathing in any microscopic mildew spores.

, Next, mix 1 cup (240 milliliters) of rubbing alcohol with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of hot water. Soak a sponge in this solution. Wring most of the liquid out of the sponge, then gently rub the solution into the affected area of the upholstery. Avoid using too much moisture. hen you're done, the fabric should be damp, but not soaking.


Note that rubbing alcohol can damage some fabrics. To make sure your upholstery can stand the rubbing alcohol used in this method, try dabbing a little of your solution in a hard-to-see spot on your upholstery, then letting it sit for 15 minutes. If you observe any discoloration or damage, use one of the alternate cleaning solutions in this article (like the borax soak above or the home-made remedies below.)

, When you've thoroughly applied your water/alcohol mixture to the mildew-affected spots on your furniture, give it a chance to do its work by leaving your upholstery alone for about 30 minutes (or longer). Over time, the alcohol will gradually soak into the fabric and kill the mildew colony.

, Dampen a sponge or rag with clean water and dab it onto the affected area to partially rinse the alcohol solution away. Next, use a dry paper towel to blot up as much moisture as possible. If the mildew appears to be completely removed, allow your furniture to dry. If not, you may need to re-apply your cleaning solution and repeat the cycle.


If possible, dry your upholstered item outside in the sun. If not, open a window and/or use a fan to circulate the air in the room. Good ventilation is important while the furniture dries—without it, it's more likely for mildew to re-appear.
If there is a lot of moisture in the fabric, you can try using a wet-dry vacuum cleaner to soak up the excess moisture.

, Unfortunately, not all mildew is treatable. If the mildew in your upholstery is so bad that it's made its way deep into the padding or has left a permanent stain, it may be impossible to get your furniture back to normal. In this case, you may need to throw the affected furniture away to keep your home's air free of dangerous mildew spores. While professional cleaning services are also an option, these are seldom cheap.

Sweep the affected spot with a broom.,
Vacuum.,
Dab with soapy water.,
Vacuum once again.,
If possible, run a dehumidifier while the carpet dries.,
For serious mildew, consider removing the carpet.,
Use a carpet shampoo or a vinegar spray to remove lingering odor.",How to Remove Mildew from Fabric3," To start treating a mildew-infected carpet or rug, remove as much of the mold from between the tightly-packed fibers as possible by sweeping or beating the carpet with a broom. Make sure to wear a dust mask and, if possible, perform this task outside away from children and pets; inhaling mildew can be hazardous to your health.


For a deeper clean, you can also use a hand brush rather than a broom. Carpets and rugs are typically tougher than the fabrics listed above, so you can get away with using slightly stiffer bristles, but your should still take care not to scrub too hard or you may damage the carpet fibers.

, Next, use a vacuum cleaner to suck up all of the of the mold you've just dislodged in the last step. Any standard hose attachment should work, but for extra cleaning power, you may want to use a vacuum head with mechanical rollers or brushes.


It's a good idea to empty your vacuum after using it to treat mildew. If you don't, mildew spores can be blown into the air the next time you vacuum.To reduce the health dangers of inhalation, empty your vacuum outdoors in a well-ventilated area.

, Soak a sponge or a small rag in a mixture of soap and warm water. Wring the soap or rag out, then dab at the formerly mildew-y spot to let the cleaning solution soak in somewhat. Don't scrub or grind the sponge or rag into the carpet, as this can force mildew spores deep into the fibers.


Avoid using excess water. If you soak your carpet, you'll be creating the sort of moist conditions that led to the growth of the mildew in the first place. Your goal here is to gently clean the carpet fibers, not give them a bath.

, After you apply soap and water, to remove any excess moisture, give the affected section of carpet another quick vacuuming. It will probably be impossible to remove all of the moisture, but the more water you're able to suck out of the carpet before you leave it to dry, the better.

, Mildew, like many molds, thrives in dank, dark, wet conditions. By removing these conditions, you can make it less likely for mildew to set in. For example, if you have a dehumidifier, running it after you apply your soapy water can help decrease the ambient moisture in the air while the carpet dries. The less moisture in the air, the less likely mildew will be able to survive in the long run.


Dehumidifiers can be expensive. The best time to buy them is towards the end of summer or fall, when they are the cheapest. Remember to take advantage of sales and coupons as well.
If you live in a dry place, you can open up some windows. If you live in a humid place, keep the windows closed and turn on a fan. This won't decrease the ambient moisture, but it will give the carpet much-needed ventilation.

, If you're having a hard time removing mildew from your carpet with conventional methods, it may be necessary to take drastic measures and remove the carpet itself for a professional cleaning or disposal. For wall-to-wall carpeting, this may require special tools like a pry bar and/or carpet knife. See our article on taking out carpet for detailed instructions for this task. In most cases, you will want to wear a dust mask for safety.


For rugs, on the other hand, you should be able to roll up the rug and hang it outside in a well-ventilated area without much difficulty. Here, you can give the rug a deep cleaning without fear of encouraging further mold growth.
Be sure to check any padding under the carpet for the presence of mold. Dispose of any padding with signs of mold growth—leaving it can encourage mildew growth on future carpets that are laid over it., Even once you remove troublesome mildew from your carpet, its dank odor may remain. There are a number of ways to deal with this. The simplest is to buy a bottle of carpet shampoo and follow the manufacturer's instructions for use. Usually, you'll need to scrub the shampoo into the carpet, let it sit, and then vacuum it up, though this isn't always the case.


An alternative homemade solution is to put a little white vinegar in a spray bottle, spritz the affected area, wait 10 minutes for it to set, then sprinkle baking soda on top and vacuum when the solution is done reacting. See below for more information on this home remedy."

Use lemon juice and salt for a natural cleaning rub.,
Mix hydrogen peroxide with water for a mild bleach.,
Try a foamy baking soda/vinegar mixture.,
Dry fabrics in the sun for a natural stain-removing effect.",How to Remove Mildew from Fabric4," Though the methods above should work well for most cases of mildew, there are a wide range of alternative home remedies that may also work well. For instance, lemon juice, which is sometimes used as a natural fabric cleaner, can be paired with ordinary salt to make an effective yet gentle abrasive cleaner. Follow the simple steps below:


Mix 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) of undiluted lemon juice with enough salt to form a loose paste.
Pour or scoop your lemon/salt paste onto the affected fabric.
Scrub gently with a soft-bristled brush.
Wash and dry your fabric in the laundry machine or use a vacuum to remove excess paste and air-dry.

, With dealing with white fabrics, you have more cleaning options available to you than with colored fabrics because you don't have to worry about causing your fabric's dye to bleed or fade. For a natural bleach solution that's great for removing old mildew stains from white fabrics, try using hydrogen peroxide (which should be very cheap at most grocery and department stores) with the following steps:Use a cotton swab or a clean rag to dab hydrogen peroxide directly onto the stain.
Allow the hydrogen peroxide to set for 15 minutes.
Wash as normal. For extra stain-fighting power, add about 1/3 to 2/3 cup (80 to 160 milliliters) of hydrogen peroxide to your laundry in addition to your normal detergents.

, As noted above, vinegar can be a potent natural cleaning agent and odor-fighter. However, if you use this method, it's important to remember only to use white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and so on are colored liquids that can cause stains. Use the steps below to treat your fabric with vinegar:


Make a half-and-half mixture of vinegar and warm water in a small bowl.
Dab this mixture into the affected fabric with a clean rag or add it to a spray bottle and spray it onto the fabric.
Let the vinegar set for 10 minutes, then generously apply baking soda to the wet spot to neutralize the vinegar.
For clothing, wash and dry as normal. For upholstery and carpet, vacuum and allow to dry.

, If you're lucky enough to enjoy clear, sunny days where you live, you have an opportunity to remove pesky mildew stains from your fabric with minimal effort. The simple act of drying your fabrics in the sun (rather than in a mechanical dryer) after washing has been proven to have a noticeable lightening effect on stains.Use a drying rack or a hanging wire for best results.


Use caution with colored fabrics, however; leaving them in the sun for long periods of time can cause their dye to fade.

Press or stand on the paper for a few minutes, allowing the liquid to be pulled out of the carpet.After you’ve soaked up as much urine as possible, leave the soiled papers in your dog’s bathroom area. For example, place the papers right outside in an area of your yard that your dog normally urinates. This will reinforce the expectation of their bathroom habits.;
, Fill up a drinking glass with water. Pour a quarter of the water on the area at a time. Allow each pour of water to seep into the carpet before pouring more.

, Evenly disperse the drops throughout the wet area.

, Do not reuse any paper towels from earlier in the process. Doing so will replace the urine you’ve already removed from the area.

, To create the mixture, mix 2 cups of warm water, 2 cups white vinegar, and four tablespoons of baking soda into a spray bottle or bowl and disperse on the wet area. Let it sit for five minutes., This will remove excess water from the fabric and prevent mold from forming underneath it. Blot the area until the area is only slightly damp.

, Excess water from the process will be left either way, but using a vacuum or hair dryer to remove more water will speed up the drying process.

Make sure to wear gloves while cleaning up the urine. This will prevent your hands from smelling like urine after cleaning.

, Using new materials is important in this step, so you’re not mixing other cleaning products and chemicals with the ones you’re using for this clean-up.

,


Surfaces and finishes react differently to products. Test a hidden area of your surface before applying to the affected area if it is in a high-traffic area. This will let you see if the solution reacts poorly to your surface in a place that others will not see it.

, Enzyme cleaners continue cleaning long after application, so make sure to keep pets and family members away from the area for a few hours to allow the cleaner to take full effect., Make sure to dispose of the used towels or rags in a place your pet will not retrieve them. If your pet smells remnants of urine in another area, they may think it is acceptable to urinate in that area.

Allow your item to air dry.",How to Remove Dog Urine4," Make sure you wash this item alone and not with other clothing or household items. It could potentially transfer the odor to the other fabrics.

,, Smell the item to see if the urine smell persists. Take the item into a space with good lighting to inspect if there are any stains present after the first wash.

, Not doing so could result in more unwanted stains on the item.

, If you machine dry the item, it will slow the cleaning process of the enzyme cleaner and set in the odor and stain of the urine further.Set the item out of reach of your pet. As previously stated, leaving items that could have the remnants of urine may influence them to urinate in unwanted areas.

Pat the peels dry with a clean towel, and carefully chop the peels into half-inch (1.3-cm) cubes. The pieces have to be small enough to fit into the opening of a pop bottle.


You can use a variety or mixture of citrus peels to make your homemade enzyme cleaner, including lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange.
It’s important to use fresh citrus peels that aren't dried out or rotting. Dried peels won’t contain enough citrus oil for cleaning, and rotten ones will cause the mixture to mold.;
, Insert a wide-mouthed funnel into the mouth of a clean 2-liter (67.6-ounce) pop bottle. Pour the citrus peel chunks in a handful at a time until they’ve all been added to the bottle. Add the sugar, yeast, and water. Remove the funnel and screw the cap on tightly. Shake the bottle vigorously for a few minutes, until all the sugar is dissolved.Its important to use a pop bottle for this recipe, because they're designed to hold liquids that are under pressure.

, After the sugar has dissolved, unscrew the cap to vent any pressure that’s built up inside the bottle. Screw the cap back on. Repeat this process at least three times a day for two weeks to prevent the bottle from exploding.


After two weeks, reduce the venting to once a day, as most of the sugar will have been converted, so less carbon dioxide will be produced.As the yeast eats the sugar in the mixture, it will convert the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide. This gas will build up in the bottle when the lid is on.
It’s important to leave the cap on and tight during this process, because the yeast needs an oxygen-free environment to ferment properly. Oxygen will also allow bacteria and mold to grow in the mixture.

, The optimum temperature for yeast fermentation is 95 F (35 C), so you have to keep the mixture somewhere warm while it ferments.A good place for the mixture is on top of a refrigerator.


The yeast will take about two weeks to ferment, but you can leave the cleaning mixture for up to three months for a stronger solution.

, Over time, the solids in the mixture will sink to the bottom. Every day, vent the gasses, screw the lid back on, and shake the mixture gently to stir up the contents. Vent the gas again before screwing the lid back on.Continue swirling daily until you decide that the mixture is ready.

, After two weeks, the mixture will become opaque, and this means it’s ready to use and strain. You can also leave the mixture for another two and a half months if you have the time and want a stronger cleaner. When the mixture has fermented for long enough, pour it through a strainer and into a bowl to remove the solids.


Discard the citrus peels once they’ve been strained.

, Transfer the strained cleaning liquid to an airtight container for storage. Exposing the mixture to oxygen will cause it to lose its potency, and it won’t clean as effectively.To make ready-to-use cleaner, store small amounts of the cleaner in a spray bottle and keep the rest in an airtight container.

, In a spray bottle or other container, mix one part enzyme cleaner with 20 parts water. Shake or stir to combine. This mixture can be used to wash cars, wash floors, and for other jobs around the house that don’t require a super-powered cleaner., Measure ½ cup (118 ml) of enzyme cleaner and transfer it to a clean spray bottle. Mix in 4¼ cups (1 L) of water. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake the mixture to combine the water and cleaner. Shake before each use.


This all-purpose cleaner can be used on all surfaces to clean bathrooms, carpets, kitchens, for minor stains, and other cleaning needs., For a stronger all-purpose cleaner, mix one part apple cider vinegar with four parts homemade enzyme cleaner. Transfer the mixture to a spray bottle and use to clean kitchens, bathrooms, and tough stains., For tough stains, caked on grime, odors, and built-up dirt, apply the homemade enzyme cleaner directly to the affected surface. Let the cleaner sit for a couple minutes, and then wipe the area with a damp sponge or cloth.


Enzyme cleaners are great for cutting grease, and this cleaner can be used undiluted around the kitchen and the garage.
You can also try this method for removing scale and lime buildup on things like dishwashers, kettles, shower heads, and other appliances and fixtures., You can use the enzyme cleaner as a replacement for laundry soap or as a booster that you add to your regular detergent. Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of enzyme cleaner to your washing machine drum or detergent compartment. Set and run your washing machine as normal."

Let the water stream onto the stain until the stained area is completely saturated.Flushing the garment with water helps prevent the stain from setting.;
, After you flush the clothing item with water, create a cleaning solution in a large bowl that comprises of four cups (950 ml) of cool water, one tablespoon (14.79 ml) of ammonia and ½ teaspoon (2.4 ml) of liquid laundry detergent.Make sure that the laundry detergent doesn’t contain chlorine bleach, as ammonia and chlorine breach create harmful fumes when mixed together.

, After you create the cleaning solution, drop in the garment and completely submerge the stained portion in the liquid. Let the fabric soak for about half an hour.If your item of clothing is non-washable, spot clean the stain instead of soaking the garment. To spot clean, dip a clean cloth in the cleaning solution and dab at the stain gently to remove it.

, After around half and hour, take the garment out of the bowl of cleaning solution. Wring the garment out to release excess liquid, then wash the garment in the washing machine using your normal settings.Check on the garment before drying. If the stain is completely removed, dry the clothing item in the dryer. If the stain is only partially removed, keep treating the garment instead of putting the item in the dryer.

, If the iodine stain is especially old or saturated, the ammonia and dishwashing solution may not have been strong enough to remove the stain. To create a stronger solution, combine one cup (240 ml) of cool water with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of sodium thiosulfate in a small bowl., Dip a clean white cloth into the small bowl of sodium thiosulfate solution, then gently dab the spot with the cloth. Instead of rubbing, use soft sponging motions to help lift the stain.


You should notice that the stain lifts and transfers onto the white cloth.

, After you have lifted the stain, flush the stain again with cool water so that the cleaning solution is removed. Then launder the garment as usual."

Stir to integrate the dishwashing liquid with the water., Wet a clean white cloth with the dishwashing liquid solution, then dab at the stain with the cloth. You should notice that the stain starts to lift from the upholstery., Once the stain is completely wetted by the solution and you aren’t lifting any more stain from the fabric, let the solution soak into the stain for about 30 minutes.Check from time to time to make sure that the solution hasn’t dried out. If it is getting dry, dab on a little more dishwashing solution.

, If the stain has not been completely removed, repeat steps 2 and 3, blotting the stain with solution, then letting it set for a half hour.


After a couple repetitions, the stain should be gone. If it has been removed, wet a clean cloth with water, then blot at the place where the stain was to remove the soap solution.
If the stain is still present, you will need to try a more potent cleaning solution.

, For particularly stubborn stains, blotting with dishwashing solution may not be enough. Create a more powerful cleaning solution by combining one cup (240 ml) of cool water with a tablespoon (14.79 ml) of sodium thiosulfate., Because sodium thiosulfate solution is very powerful, you need to apply it sparingly and only on the stained portion of the upholstery. Use an eyedropper to drop several drops of the solution onto the stain., After you apply the drops of sodium thiosulfate solution, use the eyedropper to apply a couple drops of ammonia onto the stain as well.Ammonia is another powerful cleaning ingredients that will help separate the stain from the fabric.

, Use a dry cloth to blot at the area of the stain. The cloth will absorb the liquid and lift the stain that the ammonia and sodium thiosulfate help to dislodge from the fabric., Blotting with the dry cloth should have worked to completely remove the stain. After you lift the stain, wet a clean cloth with cool water, then dab at the area of upholstery you were working on. This will remove any traces of cleaning solution. Then use another clean cloth to blot the area dry."

Instead of pouring the solvent directly on the carpet, first pour some on a clean, white cloth., Gently dab at the stain on the carpet with the cloth that you wetted with the dry cleaning solvent. Keep blotting the stain until no more of it is being removed.


If you didn’t successfully remove all the stain using the dry cleaning solvent, you will have to try another method. Before you do so, wet a cloth with water and dab at the stained area to absorb any dry cleaning solvent that may have been soaked into the carpet. Then pat the area dry with a dry cloth.

, Create the same dishwasher solution that was recommended to remove iodine from upholstery in Method 2, then dab the dishwasher solution onto the stain using a white cloth. Keep dabbing until you are no longer lifting any more stain.You don’t need to clean off the dishwashing solution before trying the vinegar solution.
Don’t throw away the leftover dishwasher solution.

, If the dishwashing solution alone didn’t remove all the stain, create a vinegar solution in a small bowl using ⅓ cup (80 ml) of white vinegar and 2/3 cup (160 ml) of water. Then dip a clean white cloth into the solution and dab at the stain the same way as you did with the dishwashing solution., If the stain is still present, create an ammonia solution made of 1 tablespoon (15 ml) ammonia and ½ cup (120 ml) of water. Then dip a clean cloth into the solution and dab at the stain.

, Once more, dip a clean cloth into the dishwashing solution you used before and use it to blot at the stain. This will help to pick up any remaining stain and also lift up the remnants of vinegar and ammonia solution., Once the stain has been removed, wet a clean cloth with cool water, then dab at the area of carpet you were working on.

By removing extra grease or oil, you’ll ensure that the stain does not spread and you’ll make it easier for the cleaning products you use to fight the stain.


Take a razor blade or another thin object and slide it between the oil and the object you’re cleaning. If you’re cleaning a fabric, you may want to substitute the razor for a thin piece of plastic or a thin piece of cardboard.
When you scrape excess oil off, make sure you do so slowly so you don’t spread it and make the stain bigger.;
, After removing excess grease or oil, you’ll need to blot the stain. By blotting the stain, you’ll gently remove any grease or oil you didn’t already remove when you scraped the object. Bunch up clean paper towels or an old cloth and:


Gently dab or blot it on the stain.
Don’t mush the fabric down.
Avoid smearing any residual grease or oil left after you scraped it., While you’ve probably already removed a substantial amount of grease or oil from the item in question, you can remove even more by sprinkling baby powder or cornstarch on the stain. This is important, as baby powder or corn starch are very absorbent and will help remove even more oil or grease.


Take your baby powder or cornstarch and lightly sprinkle it on top of the stain. ‘
If you’re cleaning a stain off concrete, you may need to use more.
If you’re cleaning a stain off fabric, make sure not to use too much – it might cause problems when it comes time to launder the fabric.
Carefully remove the baby powder or cornstarch with a scraper, vacuum, or paper towel., After you’ve removed excess oil or grease, you can apply cleaning products to the item. Your choice of products will vary depending on the type of item you’re cleaning.


Follow the directions of the cleaning product and pour or spray the recommended amount on the item you are cleaning.
If you’re washing fabrics, you’ll probably want to use something that is not very caustic and won’t harm the fabric during the cleaning process. For example, you may want to use a stain remover formulated for fabric. You may also consider using Dawn or a similar dish detergent. However, be aware that harsh detergents may damage some fabric products.
If you’re cleaning concrete, wood, or plastic, you may be able to use commercial or industrial products. However, you may also have a lot of success using regular household dish detergents like Dawn., Make sure to provide enough time for the cleaning agent to sit on the item and soak in before rubbing, scrubbing, or laundering it. This is important, as the product needs to be able to attack the stain before you work it.


If you’re cleaning concrete, many people recommend letting the cleaning product sit for 15 minutes or more.
Follow the directions of whatever cleaning item you are using. Some products, like Spot Shot, recommend you let the item sit for 3 to 5 minutes, others recommend more time., Depending on the item in question, you’ll have to take different approaches to rubbing or scrubbing the stain once you’ve applied a cleaning agent. Be careful, as some items are more delicate than others.


Employ a toothbrush or a small scrubber for tough fabrics, like denim.
Find a larger scrubber or a coarse cloth to clean concrete or other hard materials.
Use a microfiber rag and dab or massage cottons or synthetic fabrics. This works especially well with car seats or dress shirts., If you’re planning on laundering the item after you’ve applied your cleaning agent, you should soak it in warm water first. By soaking the item, you’ll enable the water to loosen the stain before the laundering process.


Avoid hot water. Stick with water below 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius).
Check the care tag of the item to verify that your detergent and water temperature is appropriate.
Make sure you use a lot of water, relative to the size of the fabric. For instance, if you’re soaking several oil-stained rags or shirts, you should do so in a large sink or in a washing machine, rather than a small bathroom sink., When it comes time to launder your fabrics, you’ll want to follow the directions of the care tag and to use detergent that is appropriate for the fabric. Make sure to:


Use warm or hot water, if it is okay for the fabric.
Wash the item by itself if possible, you don’t want other fabrics to be stained by the grease., While your odds of removing an oil stain are best during the first attempt, you may have some success removing or lightening a stain on a second attempt. In the end, if you’re not successful the first time, you may want to try again.


Consider using different cleaning products. This is important, as some cleaning products are particularly effective against some stains but not others. For example, standard laundry detergent might not work on engine stains that have sat for a while., After preparing the surface with a cleaning product, take a pressure washer and clean the spot and remove leftover engine oil. This works best with concrete and wood. Power up the pressure washer and:


Wash the oil stain systemically. For instance, start at the bottom of the stain and move from left to right, slowly moving up the stain.
You may need to slow down and spend more time on certain areas than others.
Feel free to rewash the spot if you need to."

, Take a strip of heavy-duty tape, such as duct tape, and wrap it around your index and middle fingers with the sticky side facing out (away from your fingers). Press the tape firmly against the adhesive, and then quickly pull your fingers away to rip the tape off.Repeat with different sections of the tape to remove as much leftover residue as possible.


Skip this step if you are trying to remove adhesive from a delicate surface like paper or books.

, To tackle any remaining sticky residue, you will need an oil-based substance, alcohol-based substance, or solvent. An oil-based product will help lubricate the surface of the adhesive and work to remove it, an alcohol-based product will dry out the adhesive, and a solvent will work to dissolve the glue.Alcohol and Goo Gone have had the most success removing adhesive residues, but if you try one product and it doesn’t work, don’t be afraid to try another.Other popular products include:Cleaning products, such as Windex, Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, furniture polish, vinegar, or PVC pipe cleaner
Beauty products, such as nail polish remover, toothpaste, hand lotion, hair spray, mineral oil, perfume, non-acetone nail polish,and aftershave
Oil-based foods, such as margarine, cooking spray, peanut butter, and mayonnaise
Eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, and vegetable oil
Household products such as kerosene, paint thinner, petroleum jelly, and lighter fluid
For paper products and books, you will need a pencil or art gum eraser

, Using a clean cloth, cotton ball, or paper towel, apply your removal agent of choice to the affected area. Let the cloth and cleaning agent sit on the adhesive for five to ten minutes (or a couple hours if you're using vinegar or mayonnaise).


After the removal agent has had time to sit, use the cloth or a soft toothbrush to gently rub the area. As paper and glue are removed, use a clean towel to wipe them away.To remove adhesive residue from paper products or books, use the eraser to gently rub at the glue.

, Once the adhesive has been removed, you must clean away the excess cleaning product that you used. Use a clean cloth and hot, soapy water to wipe the area clean, and then rinse it with a clean cloth and plain water.

, If there is any paper or sticker left on the fabric, peel off as much as you can with your fingers, and then remove more with tape. For fabrics, don’t use duct tape; instead, try something less heavy duty, such as scotch tape.Duct tape could adhere to fabrics and cause pilling, warping, or pulls.

, You typically want an oil-based substance for fabrics, so it’s important that you only use this method on fabrics that can be laundered in the machine or by hand afterward. Perform a spot test on an inconspicuous area before trying the product on the adhesive. For clothing, popular removal agents include:Rubbing alcohol or Goo Gone
Dish soap
Peanut butter or vegetable oil
WD-40
Avon Skin-So-Soft
De-Solv-It, Crystal Wash, or Un-Du, Use your fingers to saturate the adhesive with the cleaning product. Massage for several minutes, until you feel the adhesive starting to loosen.For stubborn marks, use a soft toothbrush to work the cleaner into the adhesive. As the glue loosens, use a clean cloth to wipe it away, making sure not to spread the cleaner around too much.


For fabrics that can't be laundered (such as upholstery), saturate a clean, undyed cloth with nail polish removeror rubbing alcohol. Lay the cloth over the affected area and let it sit for several minutes. Gently rub the area with the cloth to loosen and remove the adhesive. Remove any excess cleaner and glue with a clean cloth and water.

, Be sure to use a grease fighting stain remover or laundry detergent to cut through the oil-based cleaning product.Let the stain remover or detergent sit for 10 minutes, or as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Either hand wash or machine wash the fabric as per the instructions on the care label. Do not put the garment in the dryer until you are sure the adhesive is completely gone.

, They say prevention is the best medicine, and this is also true of sticky adhesive residues: it’s better to get the sticker and glue off in one shot than it is to peel off the sticker first and tackle the glue later. If you're in the middle of peeling off a difficult sticker, stop and take a few extra precautions before proceeding.


Grab a blow dryer and set it to high.Hold it a safe distance from the surface (you don’t want to melt anything other than the glue) and apply a stream of hot air to the sticker for 45 seconds. Once the glue is nice and hot, try peeling a corner of the sticker. If there's any resistance, repeat the heating for another 45 seconds., Another method you can try is soaking a cloth with hot water and laying it over the sticker for 10 to 15 minutes. This will help loosen the glue and wet the paper, which should help lift the sticker right off., If you have a sticker that isn’t coming off nicely and is still leaving glue and paper bits behind after heating it and wetting it, pull out the scraper now while the adhesive is still attached to the paper, and while the glue is still hot and wet.


Scrape at the sticker at a 45-degree angle to remove whatever’s left of the paper and adhesive.

Use your fingers to roll the adhesive into balls.,
Scrape the residue with scissors, an old credit card or a knife.,
Wrap masking tape around your fingers and press it against the residue.,
Rub the remaining residue with a wet wipe.",How to Remove Sticker Residue1," This is more effective if the residue is fresh and not too resilient. Run your finger along the entirety of the residue, applying constant pressure. The residue will roll into balls that you can easily pluck off the surface.;
, If you’re using something sharp, make sure to align the blade flat against the surface. Otherwise you risk cutting grooves into the surface you’re trying to clean. Using a credit card allows you to scrape at the residue more liberally without risking damage to your surface.


Be careful using a knife or scissors on a glass or metal surface. These could easily get scratched. Try using one of the other methods for removing residue on glass or metal.Be sure to scrape away from you to avoid possible injury.

, Ensure the tape makes a tight ring around your index and middle finger with the sticky side facing out. Press it against the surface and pull away. Notice the residue sticking to the tape, and repeat until you’ve lifted off as much residue as possible.


If the tape loses its stickiness before you’re finished, you can either rotate the ring or use a new length of tape.

, You can either use wet wipes from the cleaning supply aisle or sanitizing wipes. Rub until you no longer feel any stickiness. You might have to let the surface dry and rub a few more times to completely rid it of residue.

Pick a container, like a large bowl, which can hold your item along with a few cups of water. Combine dishwashing detergent with hot water and fill your container.


Don’t fill the container to the brim, or it will overflow when you insert your item.

, Using the example of a glass jar, make sure the sticker and residue are completely submerged. Over this half hour, the glue will dissolve and the residue should come off easily., After soaking for half an hour, whatever residue is left shouldn’t be particularly difficult to remove. Dampen a cloth or rag, then rub until the residue comes off.

, If there’s still some residue tenaciously sticking to your surface, add vinegar to the bowl of water. Whatever residue remains will already be softened after soaking, and will easily come off with vinegar.Don’t use vinegar on marble, stone, aluminum or cast iron. It can corrode and damage these surfaces."

Remove residue with mayonnaise.",How to Remove Sticker Residue3," Some of the household products used in this method might irritate the skin. Make sure to wear latex gloves to avoid this. If you’re working on a table or countertop, make sure to cover it in newspaper before proceeding.

, The right product depends on the surface you’re cleaning as well as the amount of residue you need to remove. Avoid using oily products on porous surfaces, and be careful about using corrosive products such as vinegar on metals and stone. Some household products are much more effective than products specifically designed for removing sticker residue., This is likely your best choice, as it doesn’t leave any residue, dries quickly and it’s best at neutralizing sticky residue.If you don’t have rubbing alcohol, you can use vodka. Avoid sweet alcohols like rum as they can leave their own stickiness behind.


Moisten a rag or cloth with alcohol and rub the surface vigorously.
After about 15 seconds of rubbing, check the surface to see how much residue is left. Continue rubbing until the surface is clear.

, Letting some cooking oil soak into the sticky residue will allow you to remove it more easily. Because it lacks strong chemicals, it can be ideal for more sensitive surfaces. However, some will absorb the oil and cause a stain; avoid porous surfaces such as wood or cloth. If you’re unsure, test the oil on a small, inconspicuous spot of your surface. If it wipes off without a trace, you can go ahead.


Dab oil onto a paper towel and lay it over your surface.
Wait a few minutes for the oil to soak into the sticky residue.
Remove the paper towel, and scrape or rub the residue away., While it requires a bit more effort than alcohol, dabbing sticker residue with vinegar will make it easier to rub off.Make sure you dilute the vinegar in a bit of water to get the best solution. Avoid using vinegar on marble, stone, aluminum or cast iron. These surfaces can be damaged by vinegar.Moisten a rag or cloth with vinegar and rub the surface vigorously.
After about 15 seconds of rubbing, check the surface to see how much residue is left. Continue rubbing until the surface is clear.

, A safe alternative to many acidic products, the oiliness of peanut butter is great for removing sticky residue.If you’re not sure what product to use on a particular surface, peanut butter is a safe choice.


Spread peanut butter onto the sticky surface and let it sit for 15 minutes.
Wipe off the peanut butter; the majority of the residue should come off with it., This product is specifically designed to remove sticker residue. It’s safe to use on many surfaces, but tends to leave an oily residue behind.Follow the instructions on the packaging. They’ll tell you what surfaces the product is safe for in addition to how to use it.

, Since mayonnaise contains both vinegar and oil, it’s well suited for removing sticky residue. However, you should make sure to avoid using it on porous surfaces, like wood, plastic and cloth, as it could stain these.Spread mayonnaise onto the sticker residue.

Try a less traditional cleaner.,
Wash in cold water.,
Air dry in the sun.",How to Remove Tomato Stains1," The longer a stain is left to set, the more difficult it will be to remove. If at all possible, remove the stained clothing item immediately. If clothing cannot be removed immediately, at least try to remove excess food immediately, and coat the stain in cool water.Be careful while removing the offending item, as you do not want the stain to transfer to multiple areas. To prevent this, you can cup your hand over the stain as you remove it.;
, Once the garment has been removed, blot the area using a clean, white rag. Gently dab at the stain, avoiding a wiping or scraping motion, as these can bury the stain deeper into the fibers.Your rag can be damp or dry, but for this step, avoid an extremely wet rag. The goal here is not to transfer water, but to remove any lingering tomato residue.

, Fill a sink or small basin with fresh, cold water, and place the stained article of clothing into the water. If the stain is small, you can place the stained area into the cold water, instead of the entire garment.If you are using the sink, make sure to clean it thoroughly before using it for laundry. Stains transfer to fabric easily, so you do not want any debris left in your sink.

, Place a dab of laundry detergent onto the area and rub it in using your fingertip, making small circles. After 5 minutes have passed, rinse the area in cool water. If the stain is persistent, you can reapply the detergent and try again until the tomato stain has been eliminated.

, If you want to try using household items to get rid of tomato stains effectively, you can use any number of remedies found in your kitchen cabinets. Typically, the best way to go about this is to make a paste and rinse in cool water.Create a paste of water and cream of tartar. Apply this paste directly to the stain, then rinse with cool water.
Baking soda and water. Similar to cream of tartar, create a baking soda and water paste, then apply directly to the stain. Let it sit for ten minutes, then rinse with cool water.
Blue Dawn dish soap can be used. Apply an eraser-sized amount of Dawn soap to the stain, rubbing it in with your finger. Rinse the stain in cool water until the water runs clear and no more soap bubbles are visible.

, After applying your stain treatment, place the garment in the washer, using the cold water setting. If it is a large stain, you may want to place the garment in the washer on its own to prevent transferring the stain to another garment., After the wash cycle has finished, remove the clothing item and place it in the sun to dry. This will speed the drying process and help remove any residual staining."

Rinse the area using a small cup of water.,
Dry using a towel and pressure.",How to Remove Tomato Stains2," The difficulty of removing a stain will depend largely on your carpet pile. A high pile may require more than a knife or spatula to remove sauce, and may require a small rag, while a low pile should be just fine with a knife.Make sure all large pieces of food and piles of sauce are gone before moving to the next step, as blotting with a lot of sauce intact may make the stain worse.

, Take a damp, clean white rag and dab at the stain, pressing firmly into the stain. Do not wipe or scrape with a rag, as this can force the food particles further into the carpet and make them extremely difficult to remove.Make sure to use cold water while blotting. Warm or hot water can encourage food particles to set.

, Carpet is not quite as versatile as clothing in terms of stain treatment. Stick to the basics here: peroxide, Dawn dish soap, or a dedicated carpet cleaning product.Apply a capful of peroxide to the area, working it in gently with your fingers. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes.
Place a pea-sized amount of Dawn dish soap onto the stain, and gently rub the soap in circles, using a small toothbrush or laundry brush.
To use a carpet-cleaning product, simply follow the product’s instructions after removing additional liquid.

, While you cannot rinse carpet under running water, you can flush the area out using a small cup of cold water. Gradually pour cool water onto the stain, blotting up excess moisture as you go, and lifting the stain and spot treatment.For a small stain, 1 C (8 oz) of water will do. For larger stains, double the amount.

, To dry your carpet, place a clean towel atop the stain and press down using firm pressure. Continue this process until all of the moisture has been lifted.


Once the stain has been removed, you can turn on a ceiling or floor fan to speed up the drying process.

Blot dry with a clean towel.",How to Remove Tomato Stains3," Using a spatula or putty knife, wipe up any sauce or tomato residue that has been left behind. Make sure you use an item with a clean, straight edge to wipe, as wiping with cloth or a jagged edge could set the stain further., Dampen a clean white rag with cold water, and blot the stain, going over it several times until the stain has grown light in color.Using a colored rag could result in the transfer of color, so avoid colors or patterns.

, Apply a small drop of dish soap to the stain, and rub it in small circles using a brush or your finger. Be careful to only rub directly on the stain, as rubbing outside of the stain’s diameter could transfer the stain to a larger area.Some fabrics such as wool may react poorly to dish soap. Check your furniture’s cleaning instructions to avoid damaging the fabric.

, Blot the stain with a damp rag to remove soap bubbles. You can use a gentle wiping motion if the soap bubbles are stubborn, but be sure to wipe carefully and lightly, without putting any undue pressure on the fabric.


If your first blotting rag does not have a significant clean space, use a new rag. You don’t want to transfer the stain back onto your fabric.

, If the stain is still visible, repeat the process, applying a small amount of dish soap, rubbing it in, and removing the remaining soap with a damp rag.

, Once the stain has been lifted, blot the area dry using a clean, white towel. Place the towel directly over the area and apply firm pressure, repeating this process until the fabric is dry to the touch.


Avoid pouring water onto the furniture, as this could wet the pad beneath the fabric and result in mold or mildew. Stick to a damp rag for removal.

But if you’re working on a table or countertop, you’ll want to make sure to prevent spillage, as oil can stain some surfaces.;
, This will prevent the oil from spilling. Be careful when placing the surface flat. If it’s an appliance, such as a toaster, you’ll want to make sure it’s not balanced on a protruding piece. If balanced in such a way, it might shift as you work and cause a spill.

, You don’t want your material entirely soaked through, only enough to allow for a good spread of oil.You can use a cloth or a paper towel. If you use a paper towel, you’ll want to fold it over a few times to ensure proper absorbency.

, Make sure to cover the sticker thoroughly. It’s especially important for the oil to seep in at the sticker’s edges, where the adhesive is strongest. Allow the oil to sit on the sticker for a few minutes; no more than five. The time should depend upon the size and strength of the sticker., The seeping oil will have dislodged the sticker and its adhesive. You should now be able to rub the sticker away.Follow the ""grain"" of the shine on the stainless steel. If you do not wipe with the grain, you can damage the surface's finish.


To find the grain, angle the steel away from you until it catches the light. You should then see vertical or horizontal lines shining. Follow them when you wipe.

, Wait for five minutes, then wipe again with the oil-covered cloth. This should only be needed for particularly tenacious stickers.

Rub the sticker with lacquer thinner.,
Lift the adhesive with rubbing alcohol.,
Spray a degreaser onto the sticker.,
Soak the sticker in nail polish remover.",How to Remove a Sticker from Plastic1," This is a stronger solution, so you will only need to soak the sticker for 5-10 minutes. After you've let it soak, scrape up the sticker with a broad, flat item for an adhesive-free clean up. Some specialty products, like Goo Gone, function similarly., Get a carton of isopropyl alcohol—preferably a 90% solution. Pour a small amount on an old rag and begin wiping the adhesive. The adhesive should begin to lift after a minute or so of scrubbing.







, You can use a degreaser like WD-40 to wipe away the sticker. First, test the WD-40 on a patch of the plastic to make sure that it won’t harm the sticker if you plan to keep it. Then, spray degreaser on a clean cloth or directly on the sticky label or glue residue. Rub in a circular motion with a towel until the sticker pulls away.







, Soak the sticker in a container of nail polish remover. If you don’t have enough nail polish remover, you can apply the remover with a cloth and scrub away the sticker. The sticker will be easier to remove if you give it a few minutes for the remover to react.

, Putting the item in the dryer on high heat for a few minutes will heat the adhesive and possibly loosen it a little., The transfer should be on the inside. You should locate the area of the transfer and place your garment so that the inside of the shirt with the transfer behind it is facing up (so that if you could see through the shirt, you would see the back side of the transfer).







, Before applying solvent all over the garment, test a discreet area to be sure that the chemical does not damage the garment.








, Apply the solvent liberally to the areas of the garment that have the transfer on the other side. The idea is that the solvent will soak through the fabric and loosen the adhesive between the fabric and the transfer.








, Stretching and wiggling the fabric will help the solvent soak through the fabric and penetrate the adhesive. After stretching, you may want to apply more solvent. 







, If the solvent has worked, you should be able to peel the transfer off of the garment. You may need to encourage the transfer to peel off by using a knife to scrape it up or by applying additional heat with a hair dryer.








, After the transfer has been removed, you may find some adhesive left over. You can try removing it with rubbing alcohol or an adhesive remover such as Goo Gone. Be sure to check a discreet corner of the material for reaction before using any chemical on the fabric.








, Wash the garment alone, either by hand or in the washing machine. Washing it with other garments may cause the solvent to damage other items of clothing. Be sure to wash the garment well, using extra detergent, before wearing to avoid skin contact with the solvent.

Soak the label in cooking oil.,
Put peanut butter on the sticker residue.,
Use mayonnaise.",How to Remove a Sticker from Plastic2," Submerge the plastic in a container of cooking oil for 12-24 hours. Canola, vegetable, and other oils will soak into the sticker and loosen the adhesive. This will make it easier to remove later. You can try the method again if it doesn’t work the first time and then gently peel the sticker off with a razor blade.







, The oils in peanut butter will break down many adhesives. Cover the sticker in a thin layer of peanut butter—any type of peanut butter will do. Let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it off with a sponge and warm, soapy water.







, The oil in the mayonnaise breaks down the sticky residue leftover from the sticker. Any type of mayonnaise will work for removal. Rub some mayonnaise over the residue. Allow it to sit for fifteen minutes. Then, wipe it off with a dry cloth.








You may have to repeat this process if the residue is thick or does not come off the first time.

, Placing a small towel or rag inside the shirt may help prevent any damage to the other side of your garment. If the towel is making your work surface difficult because it is too soft, try a piece of cardboard or very thin plywood instead.








, Heating the garment beyond recommended settings may cause damage to the material. Some materials, such as polyester, may actually melt if overheated.

, A hairdryer on its hottest setting, held very close to the letters, may heat the adhesive on the back of the transfer enough for it to become malleable and be removed.







, Alternately, you can use steam to treat the transfer. Place a wet towel over the transfer and put a very hot iron on top of it. The steam may heat the adhesive on the back of the transfer enough for it to become malleable and be removed.








, Once the transfer has loosened with the heat, scrape a sharp knife along the edge to pry up the iron-on transfer. Once part of the transfer has been pried up, it should be easier to continue pulling up the transfer a little at a time.








, You may need to do one very small area of the transfer at a time to keep it very hot in order to keep scraping it away.








, This method may take a long time. Put on some of your favorite music and challenge yourself to stick with it until it is all finished.








, After the transfer has been removed, you may find some adhesive left over. You can try removing it with rubbing alcohol or an adhesive remover such as Goo Gone. Be sure to check a discreet corner of the material for reaction before using any chemical on the fabric.

, Heating the garment beyond recommended settings may cause damage to the material. Some materials, such as polyester, may actually melt if overheated. This method involves direct heat and runs a higher risk of damaging the garment than other methods.

, The iron should be as hot as possible. This may mean that the iron will be hotter than the care instructions for the garment allow. If you are worried about damaging the garment, you may want to try a different method. You could try starting with a medium heat and slowly turning the iron hotter to find the right temperature that will remove the transfer but not damage the garment.








, If the transfer is made of vinyl, place wax paper over the letters and iron directly on the wax paper. The vinyl transfer will essentially melt and stick to the wax paper, and you can peel the letters away from the shirt by removing the wax paper. This only works with vinyl transfers.








, The heat from the iron should essentially melt the transfer away. Start with a corner and work your way across the transfer.








, Once a corner has come off, make quick movements with your iron in the direction of the transfer. It should continue to peel up and possibly burn off as you go.








, Repeat the strokes of the iron directly on the transfer until it has been completely removed. If you garment appears to be getting damaged, you may want to turn down the heat a bit.








, After the transfer has been removed, you may find some adhesive left over. You can try removing it with rubbing alcohol or an adhesive remover such as Goo Gone. Be sure to check a discreet corner of the material for reaction before using any chemical on the fabric.

Assess the material the sticker is on first.,
Scrape and soak the sticker residue first to get off what you can.,
Use masking or duct tape on the residue.",How to Get Sticker Residue Off1," The type of product used to remove the label will depend largely on the product you are removing the label from.


Hard surfaces are easier to remove labels from than clothing and furniture. When selecting your product, take into consideration any side effects. You can use chemical-based products with less risk on glass and washable surfaces, such as mason jars. Generally, try natural products for clothing and painted surfaces.
For example, do not spread peanut butter on your furniture because you’ll never get the grease out. But it’s great for clothing because you can work it into the glue and then machine wash any remaining residue.;
, Before you try applying product to it, see how much of the residue you can get off without taking that step.


First try lifting a corner with a fingernail and pulling the sticker off in one piece. If this doesn't work, soak it overnight in dish washing liquid.
If the sticker doesn't come off by itself, scrape with a metal sponge or knife. For persistent glue, try applying heat from a blow dryer.
Test a small spot first. In some cases, it may take some trial and error to find the right product for your particular label situation.

, Cut a piece of tape and connect both ends together to have the sticky side exposed.Slide 2 fingers into the space in between the connected tape ends, and press the tape against the sticker residue. This will work especially well for sticker residue on glass.
The masking tape will pull the sticky residue off. If using duct tape, take a small strip, about 3-8 inches of it, and stick it to whichever surface has the residue. Pull the tape up and lay it back down repeatedly until all residue is gone.
The tape is sticky, and the residue is sticky, meaning that the bond between the tape and the residue will be stronger than the bond between the residue and whatever surface you are trying to remove it from.

"
"
Apply rubbing alcohol to the sticker residue.,
Purchase a commercial product for removing tough residue marks.,
Apply nail polish remover.,
Try applying lighter fluid to the residue.,
Attempt to remove the sticker residue with WD-40.",How to Get Sticker Residue Off2," If it is a glass surface or other surface that is not sensitive to alcohol, soak the sticker residue in rubbing alcohol.


This can be done by spraying the alcohol if you have it in a spray bottle, pouring it directly on, or soaking a paper towel in the alcohol and placing it over the sticky residue to saturate it.
Using a razor blade, exacto knife, or box cutter, carefully wedge the blade underneath the sticker or residue and scrape away.

, The best way to get sticker residue off is by using a product like “Goo Gone” or a similar product.


These products are not very expensive and are easy to use. You just open the bottle and use a small piece of paper towel, or kleenex, and dab a bit of the product onto it, and then rub the area until the residue is removed.
You can also use “Goo Gone” and some other commercial products to remove sticker residue from clothing.Check the instructions to see if it is advisable to use it on the product with the sticker residue. You could also apply baby oil and let it stay on the surface for a minute or so and then wipe with cloth or paper towel.

, To remove sticker residue, one of the most effective cleaning products is nail polish remover. Before you use it, though, be sure your surface can stand it.For example, leather, dyed things, or wood with varnish, will be negatively affected, so avoid using nail polish remover with these things. Anything that is easily flammable, shouldn't be used with nail polish remover.
Once you're sure your surface can withstand it, just put a little nail polish remover onto a cotton ball or paper towel, and scrub it on the residue until the residue can no longer be seen, nor feels sticky to the touch. You may have to rinse your surface with water once finished, to be sure no excess nail polish remover or residue remains.
If used carefully, nail polish remover can also help remove sticker residue from clothing., Use the lighter fluid to dampen a rag. Use the rag to wipe off the sticker residue, and rub a little if needed.


Remember to clean the surface with water, and wash the rag out. Ensure that there are no naked flames around as you clean.
Take great care with this method because lighter fluid is flammable. So you need to make sure you get all of the lighter fluid off after you’ve removed the residue.

, Simply spray some WD-40 oil on the residue and wipe it off. WD-40 releases the bond on the adhesive and the sticker and sticker residue is easily wiped away.


It is safe to use on metal, rubber, wood and plastic. It can also be applied to painted metal surfaces without harming the paint.
This method doesn't always work immediately; sometimes you may have to leave the solution on the residue to soak for a couple of minutes.

Try a natural oil, such as peanut oil or peanut butter.,
Use cooking or olive oil.,
Try hot water.,
Apply vinegar to the sticker residue.",How to Get Sticker Residue Off3," Any type of oil base will help remove the sticky residue. Then use soap to remove the oil base. Smear the peanut butter on the residue, let it sit for a bit, and then wipe it off.If it's available, use some eucalyptus oil to weaken the glue, then just scratch it or wipe it off.You can also try applying mayonnaise to the residue. Mayonnaise is great for removing sticker residue. Take mayonnaise and gently caress the sticker. It will come off with a decent amount of pressure., Using your fingers, cover the area with vegetable or olive oil, and let it sit for about 1 and a half hours.


Use a warm (not hot) hair dryer to soften the glue, and wipe the residue off. Use hot soapy water and cloth for a final clean.
You could also add a little grit by mixing some baking soda into the oil before rubbing (using a 2:1 ratio of baking soda to oil)., First you need to peel as much of the sticker as you can. Then put the object in hot water; it does not have to be boiling.


Leave it in the water for a few minutes, and then take it out. Some of the sticker should have come of in the water but not all.
Scratch off the remaining parts of the sticker. The hot water will have heated up the glue used to keep the sticker in place.

, Vinegar is especially a great choice if you’re trying to get the sticker off of glass, including car windows.


You can use apple vinegar, which is a natural way to get off the sticker residue. Apply the vinegar to a dry cloth, a cotton pad or a sponge and rub at the sticker.
This works on most stickers and isn't unhealthy. You can even rub the sticker off with your fingers and vinegar. You could also mix ½ tablespoon of olive oil with a drop of vinegar.

Spray the WD-40 onto the tape without trying to remove the tape first.,
Spray it and let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes.,
Try it both ways and decide for yourself.,
Understand that if you sprayed the tape with WD-40 first, this will probably go a bit easier.,
Use your razor scrapper at a very shallow angle to the wood, and gently peel the tape off.,
Go slowly.,
Stop and work from the other direction, always with the grain of the wood.

,
Understand that the first pass at removing the tape, with or without WD-40, will leave tape adhesive on the wood.,
Keep in mind that the razor scrapper can be used on the softened adhesive residue very effectively.,
Use a soft cloth, like a terry washcloth.",How to Clean Tape Adhesive from Wooden Furniture," After a year or so of storage, the tape will not just pull off easily and a ""preconditioning"" of WD-40 will loosen it right up.;
, If you are careful, it may go faster if you use a single-edged razor blade as a scraper before you shoot the adhesive reside with WD-40.

, For the single-edged razor you need to have a blade holder so you have a grip of some kind to ensure that you can control the angle of the blade. That will cost you less than $2 if you have to buy one.

, However, it will work if you don't ""precondition"" the tape with WD-40.

, Work with the grain of the wood, rather than working across the grain.

, Keep the razor at about a 2 to 4 degree angle to the wood. You don't need to get obsessive and measure the angle; just don't dig into the wood. If the blade starts to carve wood, you will feel the resistance to motion instantly.

,, It may be very soft and ready to wipe off, or you may need to shoot it with WD-40 again. If you cannot wipe it off with a cloth, shoot it again and wait another 10 minutes.

, Use the same method: work with the shallow angle slowly, and with gentle motion.


You will be amazed at how easy this is. The WD-40 softens the tape goop and lubricates the blade, so it is less likely to dig into the wood. It is smooth as silk, but it will still leave a very thin layer of tape goop behind.







, Wipe the remaining very thin, almost invisible, and with the layer of adhesive off.

, If you forget to bring a tote bag, backpack, or basket to the store, and need to carry your items home in a plastic or paper bag, save these bags for reuse. They’re good for storing partially-used produce in the refrigerator, protecting fragile or potentially leaky items in a suitcase, and for general carrying around.


Use a plastic shopping bag for small trashcans, instead of buying small garbage bags.

, Fabrics, papers, cardboards, metals, and plastics can all be easily used for arts and crafts. For example, try transforming old magazine photos into a collage. Or make a scarecrow for your garden out of old clothes, packing materials, cds, aluminum pans, and colorful plastics.

Shop for recycled products.,
Sort your recyclables.,
Take advantage of your local recycling center.,
Check local restrictions.,
Recycle old electronics.,
Compost your food and yard waste.","How to Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle3"," Check the labels of paper, plastic, and metal products to see if they were made from recycled materials. Look for a phrase near the barcode that says something like, “This product was made from 50% post-consumer recycled material.”, Near your kitchen garbage can, arrange a separate waste bin or bag to hold glass, plastic, and metal recyclable materials. And place another container nearby to hold newspapers and cardboard, if your city requires these to be disposed of separately.

, If curbside pickup up of recyclables is not available in your area, locate the recycling facility nearest to your residence. Be sure to note the hours of operation, since some centers have limited access times.


For example, do an internet search for “municipal recycling facility.”

, Take a look at the FAQ webpage for your city or county’s recycling facility, which should list which materials that are and are not accepted for recycling. Materials such as styrofoam and some plastics are commonly turned away by recycling centers.


On the bottom of plastic containers, look for a number surrounded by three arrows--the universal recycling symbol. The number is an SPI Resin Identification Code, which indicates the type of plastic.The lower the number, the more likely it will be accepted., Computers, cell phones, tablets, stereo equipment, and similar devices contain toxic metals and other chemicals. It’s best to have these recycled to reduce their environmental impact. Check with your local recycling center about drop-off times for electronic devices. Or donate your equipment to a local non-profit, such as a community center or veterans’ association.Some computer companies, such as Dell, offer to pick up your unwanted computer free of charge for recycling.Hewlett-Packard recycles ink cartridges, laptop batteries, and cell phones, among others.Apple offers a gift card in exchange for your old computer., Instead of throwing away what you don’t eat, and tossing your landscaping trimmings, why not put them towards a compost heap for your garden? This way you’ll save on fertilizer, and spare your city some change in reduced waste pickup. You can buy a plastic compost bin at most garden centers.


Commonly composted materials include vegetable and fruit scraps, egg shells, straw, hair and fur, coffee grounds, tea bags, horse manure, grass and plant cuttings, and leaves.
Avoid composting dairy products, meat and fish, cooked foods, weeds, tissues, treated or colored paper, and coal ash."

Use reusable water bottles instead of plastic bottles.,
Stop using plastic bags.,
Try not to buy food that is packaged in plastic.,
Consider making food that you cannot find without plastic packaging.,
Pack your lunch in reusable containers.",How to Stop Using Plastic1," Get a tumbler, mason jar, or a bottle and use those to put your smoothies and other drinks in instead of new plastic containers every time. Some places even offer a discount if you do this.


Plastic water bottles are one of the best examples of how simple changes can create a big impact in your life. Not only is the water being sold not regulated as strictly as municipal drinking water sources, but the plastic mostly ends up in landfills. The product itself has also been proven to exceed 2,000 times the cost of tap water.
Put a reminder on the fridge where you you keep your shopping list, on on the bathroom mirror, or any other place where you will see the note everyday. It doesn't need to be long or elegant or poetic. It just needs to say something like, ""No plastic bottles of water today—remember your water bottle,"" or ""Bring your water bottle."" The biggest part of the plastic bottled water problem is convenience.;
, Use reusable bags whenever possible. Take cloth bags with you when you go shopping. Use biodegradable bin bags for your rubbish. Store your food leftovers in ceramic or glass containers.


Many grocery stores sell sustainable cloth bags for grocery shopping. However, these can be costly. Any bag will do: purses, backpacks, duffel bags.
Before accepting the standard plastic bags, ask the clerk for paper, or even better, a cardboard box. Most grocery stores have left over banana boxes, which are large but also have handles for easy transport.

, Buy only the fruit and vegetables not packaged in plastic. Purchase food in glass containers and avoid food packaged in plastics. Reuse containers for storing leftovers or shopping in bulk. Bring your own container for take-out or for your restaurant doggy-bag, since many restaurants use styrofoam.


Purchase food like cereal, pasta, and rice from bulk bins, and fill a reusable bag or container. You can save money and unnecessary packaging.
Even metal cans and cardboard boxes often have plastic coating, so if you have an option, buy food packaged in a glass jar instead. For instance, tomato sauce usually comes in both a can and a jar, so buy the jar.

,



Make fresh-squeezed juice or eat fruit instead of buying juice in plastic bottles. It may be healthier for you and better for the environment.

Make your own yogurt in Kilner jars. It’s easier than you think!
Buy milk in paper cartons.
Only buy bread from bakeries that wrap in paper. Consider making your own bread.

, When you are packing lunches, don't use Ziploc bags. Use Tupperware containers or a stainless steel lunchbox instead. Opt for fresh fruits and veggies and bulk items instead of products that come in single serving cups."

Take personal responsibility for all of the items you purchase and seek to understand the life cycle of each product.",How to Stop Using Plastic2," Buy beverages that come in glass containers, glasses that don't have plastic frames, non-plastic pens, and non-processed/packaged food.


Keep in mind that it may be hard to stop using all plastic. You will need to spend a lot of money or dramatically alter your way of life to stop using plastics completely.
Keep an eye out for new innovations. There are lots of innovators around the world that are working on plastic alternatives and plastics made using more sustainable methods. Keep an eye out, and you might at least be able to buy better plastic, even if you can't get rid of it immediately.

, Buy bars of soap, not the liquid stuff, unless it's in a glass jar. Buy boxes instead of bottles. Products like laundry detergent are often available in cardboard boxes, which are more easily recycled than plastic. Consider making your own cleaning products, which may be less toxic and eliminate the need for multiple plastic bottles of cleaner.


Don’t use air fresheners. Use essential oils, candles or incense instead.

, Use a reusable bottle or mug to hold your beverages, even when ordering from a to-go shop. Buy stainless steel sippy cups to children.

, Even those that appear to be cardboard are coated in a thin layer of plastic. Plus you'll be eating fewer processed foods!

, Don't use plasticware at home, and be sure to request restaurants do not pack them in your take-out box. Exchange plastic cups, plates, and utensils for ones made of higher quality material: for example, glass, metal, or ceramic.

, The EPA estimates that 7.6 billion pounds of disposable diapers are discarded in the US each year. Use biodegradable or reusable diapers to reduce your baby's carbon footprint and save money over time.

, Consider all of the products that pass through your life, and avoid the products that contain plastic. Over time, you can develop the habit of avoiding plastic on principle.


Stop using plastic straws, even in restaurants. When ordering a drink, don’t accept the straw. If you need a straw to drink something, purchase a reusable stainless steel or glass straw.
Give up chewing gum. Gum is made of a synthetic rubber, aka plastic.
Use matches instead of disposable plastic lighters, or invest in a refillable metal lighter.
Use rechargeable batteries.
Use a wooden cutting board, not a plastic board.
Use a razor with replaceable blades instead of a disposable razor.

, Avoid single-use items. Take advantage of refillable water bottles. Research the things you incorporate into your life and consider the consequences. Be informed.

Remember the 3 R's.,
Reuse your plastic bags.,
Reuse water or soda bottles.,
Reuse plastic containers.,
Reuse your junk mail.",How to Stop Using Plastic3," Reduce, reuse, and recycle, in that order! First, reduce and consume less plastic. If you must use any plastic at all, reuse products whenever you can. Until you cut plastic completely out of your life, recycle.If your community offers a curb pick-up recycling service, be sure to recycle everything that you can.
Bring your recyclables to a recycling center or bin drop-off. If there is no recycling center nearby, try storing your plastic items instead of throwing them away, then taking them to a recycling center in the nearest city the next time that you go.

, Look around you and check if there are any recyclable bags that can be used for your needs. If you already have plastic bags stored up, you can keep on reusing them over and over again until they break. Once they break, you can take the ripped-up bags to your local grocery store, which may be able to reuse them.


Line small household bins with paper bags.
Consider washing out Ziploc bags and reusing them.

, You can refill them with liquid, use them as storage, or fill them with water and put them up in your windows for passive solar heating.

, Ask your local grocer to take your plastic containers (for berries, tomatoes, etc.) back. If you shop at a farmers market they can refill it for you. Use your plastic to grow plants or to store other things.

, Use your junk mail to line fragile gifts to post, rather than plastic bubble wrap.

Take the jar out of the water and peel the label off.,
Rinse the jar using clean water and pat it dry.",How to Remove a Jar Label1," The water needs to be deep enough to completely submerge your jar. If you are remove the label from more than one jar, the water needs to be deep enough to cover the largest jar. The hotter the water, the better it will dissolve the glue under the label., If you can't find any dish soap, you can also use ordinary hand soap. This will help loosen the label and make it easier to remove.

, White vinegar is somewhat acidic, which will help dissolve the glue holding the label to the jar. It will make removing the label and residue easier., Take the lids off the jars, and lay them down on their sides so that they fill with water and sink to the bottom.

, The longer you wait, the more time the vinegar will have to dissolve the glue under the label. About 30 minutes should be plenty for stubborn labels, but you can check your jars after 10 minutes.

, It should slide off easily. If you get any residue, try to scrape it off using a scrubby sponge.

, Once the label is off, rinse the jar off, and dry it using a clean towel. Your jar is now ready to use!

Look for bulk items made of recycled content, especially for products such as toilet paper, tissues and napkins.
Be aware of double packaging, even for bulk items. Some “bulk packages” are individually packaged items that are packaged again and sold as “bulk.”;
, Look for items that will last for years, rather than disposable or cheaply made products.


This could mean going for a more expensive clothing item, rather than fast fashion items that will fall apart in a few weeks. Skip disposable razors, a big waste culprit, and invest in a reusable shaving razor. Go for rechargeable batteries, or plug-in appliances, and reusable items.
Avoid buying individually packaged items, such as candies, chocolate bars or even to-go snacks. The amount of waste these products create outweighs their convenience.
Try not to shop spontaneously for items you may not need. Before you buy an item, consider how often you will use it and how long it will last. Investing in quality products means less waste and less trips to the store., One person’s waste could be someone else’s treasure. Second-hand stores are a great way to purchase household items free of packaging or wrapping. You can also find great used and unused clothing at a low cost to you and the environment.


Look in your closet for clothing you haven’t worn in the last year. Rather than throw the clothes away, donate them to second-hand stores or thrift stores.
You could also throw a clothing swap party with friends to encourage some friendly barter and trade for used goods.

, Whenever possible, look for reusable options before you buy anything new. This could be borrowing tools from your neighbor or renting tools or supplies from a store, rather than spending money on a new item., Keep a few cloth bags in the back of your car or stashed in your purse so you have them ready when you go shopping.

, If you already own an item but it's in need of repair, bust out your toolbox and give it some tender loving care. Replacing the item means the broken item will become waste and end up in a landfill.

, Take-out containers are often made of styrofoam or plastic, waste that is hard to break down and can't be recycled. So skip the take-out meals and take your lunch to work in Tupperware. Not only will you cut down on waste, you will also save money on lunch every day.

, Use cloth dishrags instead of paper towels or swap paper napkins for cloth napkins.Create a recycling area in your kitchen. Rather than throw out your bottles, cans and plastics, set up blue and green recycling bins in your home, next to the garbage. This will encourage members of your household to recycle on a daily basis.
Look for ways to reuse empty jars and bins in your kitchen. Rinse out empty glass jars from your mustard or your pickles and use them to hold kitchen utensils or dry food items.
Replace hazardous household cleaners and products with safer alternatives. Make your own household cleaners using baking soda, water and vinegar. Olive oil with lemon juice is a good alternative to furniture polish.Scented candles, especially ones made from soy, are a good alternative to plug in air fresheners.

, Food and yard waste account for about 11 percent of the garbage thrown away in most mid-sized U.S. cities. Composting scraps and waste is a great way to dispose of them in an eco-friendly way.Find a dry shady spot near a water source. Add brown and green materials, such as leaves, twigs and grass clippings, to the spot. Shred or chop any large pieces.
Moisten the dry materials with water as they are added to the pile. Alternatively, you can use a round or square bin if your backyard isn't big enough for a large pile. Be sure to add dirt to the bin first before you add brown and green materials.
Once your compost pile is established, mix more grass clippings and green waste, such as fruit scraps and coffee groups, into the pile. Bury fruit and vegetable waste under 10 inches (25.4 cm) of compost material.
You can also cover the compost with a tarp to keep it moist. When the material at the bottom of the compost is dark and rich in color, your compost is ready to use. This usually takes anywhere between two months to two years.
If you have a wood-burning fireplace in your home, save the ashes in a tin rather than throwing them out. Cold wood ashes can be mixed into your outdoor compost heap and add valuable nutrients to your garden.

, If you don’t have the outdoor space for a big compost pile, compost indoors using a special compost bin. Look for this bin at your local hardware store or gardening supply store, or make one yourself.Make sure you have an even amount of green material, such as vegetable waste, fruit scraps and coffee grounds, in the compost bin. Add water to keep the compost moist.
Tend to the compost and keep track of what you throw in there. A properly managed compost bin will not attract pests or rodents and will not smell badly.
You should be able to use your indoor compost in two to five weeks.

, The average American resident receives more than 30 pounds of junk mail per year. That’s a lot of waste! Sign up for a mail preference service for $1 every five years to reduce the junk mail you receive from advertisers.Sign up for e-billing with your bank, credit card company, internet provider and utility companies. Avoid getting paperless bills when possible, especially if you can use online banking to pay for these bills.

, Appliances that operate on batteries will likely have a short life span, and disposable batteries will be discarded after one use, adding more waste to your local landfill.


Rechargeable batteries, while more durable, are the largest source of cadmium in municipal waste streams. So stick to plug-in appliances, rather than appliances that use disposable batteries or rechargeable batteries, whenever possible.

Rinse the jar off using clean water, then pat it dry.",How to Remove a Jar Label2," Make sure that the water is deep enough to completely submerge your jar on its side. If you are removing the label from multiple jars, make sure that the water is deep enough to completely submerge the largest jar.

, Swish the water with your hand to help it dissolve., Let water get inside the jar so that it weighs it down.You don't have to wait exactly 30 minutes, but you have to wait long enough for the water to soak the label and dissolve the glue.

, The label should slide off easily. If you see any residue, try to rub it off with your finger first. If it doesn't come off easily, move on to the next step.

, If there is any residue, put some washing soda onto a scrubby sponge, and gently buff the residue.

You will have some residue, but that is fine.Avoid using nail polish remover or acetone if your jar is made from plastic. They may distort or discolor the jar. Rubbing alcohol may be safely substituted but it may not be very effective.

, If there is a lot of residue, stick with a scrubby sponge. Acetone will also work for this method. Rubbing alcohol may work, but it will not be as effective as nail polish remover or acetone; it is best reserved for light residue.

, The chemicals in the nail polish remover or acetone will dissolve any glue and make it easier to scrub off. You may have to reapply the nail polish remover or acetone.

, This is especially necessary if you plan on using your jar for food storage. Once the jar is clean, pat it dry with a clean towel and use it for your project.

Sell or donate used office furniture and equipment.,
Carpool to the office, ride your bike or take public transit.",How to Reduce Waste2," Talk to your boss about reducing paper. Or, if you are a manager, figure out ways to reduce the amount of paper used in the office.Encourage the use of both sides of paper when printing and copying. Many office printers have a default setting to print on both sides of the paper, unless otherwise specified.
Encourage everyone in the office to adjust the fonts, margins and spacing of their documents to fit more text on a standard sheet of paper. If someone needs to copy documents, tell the person to reduce the size of the documents so they require less sheets of paper.
Keep a bin for waste paper and encourage people in the office to use the waste paper as scrap paper. Attach several sheets and cut them into post it sized pieces. Then, staple them together and hand them out to everyone in the office to use as “recycled” post it notes.
Switch to chlorine-free paper products and use soy or other agri-based inks for printers and fax machines.

, Take advantage of the accessibility and efficiency of electronic communication and electronic data storage to reduce the paper use in the office on a day-to-day basis.


Programs such as Google Docs and AtTask are great ways to share files and information online, without having to print documents or use fax machines to send documents to people.
You may also want to move the company’s files to an electronic data storage system to reduce the amount of paper in filing cabinets and in storage rooms.

, This will prevent the distribution of individual copies of announcements to everyone in the office and cut down on paper use.

, Many businesses receive mounds of unwanted mail, such as catalogs, advertisements and flyers. Unlike households, businesses can't simply register for a mail preference service to reduce junk mail. Instead, businesses must contact the mailers directly and ask to be removed from their mailing lists.You can email or call the mailers and request to be removed for their mailing list. Be polite when you contact them. Most mailers will comply with your request.
You should also forward any mail for employees who no longer work for the company and inform those individuals that they need to update their contact information.If your office receives multiple mailings for the same person, ask the person to contact the mailer and update his/her information.
Your office should also keep mail lists up-to-date so no duplicates are sent to the office.

, Many newer machines have built in energy-saving features that can really reduce the amount of electricity used by your office. So if you’ve been using the same Dell computer for 10 years, it might be a good idea to upgrade to a new version that has energy saving features. Not only will this promote energy savings, it will also show up as savings on the company’s electricity bill.Most computers have a sleep mode that comes on automatically after a period of inactivity. You should also make sure the power management features on your computer are turned on. The procedure to do this will depend on the operating system on your computer. Click here for specific details based on operating system: http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_users.
Remind everyone in the office to turn off their computers, as well as copiers, lights and other electronic equipment when they’re done for the day or when they are not using them.

, A busy office should have simple sort recycling bins, divided by material, so everyone can recycle properly. It’s important to empty the bins once per week, at the same time as the garbage, to prevent the buildup of materials., Order coffee cups with the company logo and stock the lunch room with metal utensils, reusable plates and reusable glasses. This will prevent the use of disposable cups, plates and utensils.


The lunch room should also have a microwave, a refrigerator and a dish-washing area to encourage everyone to bring in their lunches and eat together, rather than go out for lunch and create more waste.
The lunch room should also have a coffee machine and a kettle for hot water for tea to encourage employees to bring in their own coffee and tea bags, rather than head to Starbucks on their lunch break.

, An organics compost in the lunch room is a great way to prevent compostable items, such as coffee grounds, fruit peels and paper napkins, from ending up in the garbage.Be aware of any guidelines the office must meet to establish and maintain an organics composting program. Contact your county environmental officer for more information.

, Rather than get rid of old chairs and desks, look for charity organizations that take used furniture and equipment.

, Cut down on greenhouse gas emissions in the air by carpooling with co-workers and keeping one more car off the road. Or invest in a bike and cycle to work every day.Public transit is also a great way to limit your carbon footprint. Many city buses also run on eco-friendly fuel.

Look for copper in your home.,
Understand the consequences of copper theft.",How to Sell Copper," Scrap copper can fall into one of six different categories. The different categories each have different values. If you sort the copper yourself, you can be sure that the scrap yard purchasing it is giving you the appropriate price. Otherwise, they are likely to lump all of your copper into one pile and give you the lowest overall price.Copper solids are the the most valuable. Copper solids are further categorized into three grades, depending on how pure they are.
Copper non solids include dust and trimmings.
Copper wire is generally found in electronics.
Copper breakage is copper that has been recovered from items like motors and transformers.
Copper alloy is copper mixed with other metals. This includes brass and bronze.;
, Copper solids are the most valuable kinds of copper to sell. They consist of pure, unalloyed copper. Unalloyed means that the copper is not mixed with any other kind of metal. The purity of copper determines its value because any added alloys interfere with the conductive properties of the copper.Copper solids fall into one of three categories.


Scrap copper number one is clean copper that is not less than 1/16-inch thick.Bare bright copper wire falls into this category. Bare bright copper wire can be distinguished from the less-valuable tin-coated copper wire by its reddish color all the way through.Some copper tubing can also fall into this category. The tubing must be free of solder, corrosion, paint and brass fitting to be considered number one copper.Scrap copper number two is defined as unalloyed copper that is at least 96 percent pure.Copper tubing that falls into this category includes burnt copper and copper with light tin coating, solder or brass fittings still attachedScrap copper number three is light copper. Light copper solids are any copper sheeting that is less than 1/16-inch thick. Roofing copper generally falls into this category. It is found on roofs and gutters, and it may have tar or nails still attached., This category includes dust, chips and turnings. It is generally not very valuable, and can fetch as low as 25 percent of the spot price of copper. If you have access to this type of copper, save it up until you get at least 10 pounds or more and then melt it down into nuggets before trying to sell it.To melt copper dust, turnings or scraps, you will need materials specifically made for melting and casting metals. The melting point of copper is 1,981 degrees Fahrenheit,so you need a kiln or furnace that can withstand that kind of heat. A potter's kiln can get hot enough to melt copper, but the oxidation process required to maintain that kind of heat will burn away a lot of the copper. Also, it will heavily contaminate the kiln. Look for bronze foundry casting tools and an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non-ferrous metals.Artists often melt brass and copper for sculpture, and many have posted detailed tutorials for building a homemade furnace. Visit the Foundry Handbook for an example of a detailed tutorial for a DIY furnace using an oxy-acetylene torch for welding and a disposable helium tank or empty freon tank.Be aware, however, that the cost of powering the furnace with propane or electric will eat up about half the value of the copper. Therefore, it might not be worth investing in this process unless you have a steady, reliable source of a great deal of copper non-solids.Exercise caution when melting metal. For your safety, have safety gear such as protection goggles or face shield, dark welding goggles, oven gloves, a large flat iron pan to put the mold on, and running cold water., While copper wire can technically be segregated into five grades, most scrap yards classify all wire as either high grade or low grade copper wire. High grade wire has a single layer of insulation, and low grade has a double layer. The five grades of copper wire range from 85 percent to 10 percent.85% wire is a thin wire with a diameter close to that of a pencil.
70% wire can generally be found inside electronics or appliances. An example is Romex machine wire without any attachments.
50% wire is found in extension cords and appliance cords.
35% wire is thinly gauged wire with many attachments. This wire is generally used for communications in VGA cables or telephone wires.
10% wire can be found in Christmas lights.

, Copper breakage is anything with copper winding.Transformers, motors, alternators and magnetrons are all examples of copper breakage.Disassemble parts to separate the copper from the steel in order to get the best price for the copper. Otherwise the scrap yard will lump the less valuable steel and copper together and you won’t get as much., Common copper alloys are brass and bronze. Technically, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. But scrap yards lump them together and sell them at the same price. They refer to them both scrap copper alloys., Before bringing your copper to the scrap yard, first sort your copper yourself into its three different grades. Sort tubing and wire into their different categories. This will give you an approximate idea of the overall value of your scrap copper. Unsorted and uncategorized lots of copper tend to sell for lower prices., Before purchasing an expensive wire stripper, decide if you are going to be selling enough copper wire on a regular basis to make the investment worthwhile. A general rule of thumb is that if you are stripping more than 1,000 pounds of wire per month, then you should purchase an electric wire stripper.If you are stripping less than 1,000 pounds per month, you do not need to invest in a wire stripper.
If you decide not to buy a wire stripper, warm the wire first. Place it in the oven on low or put it inside a black box and leave it in the sun. This makes the insulation softer and easier to remove with a handheld stripping tool.
Never under any circumstances should you burn the insulation off the wire.

, Scrap yards will not purchase dust or turnings. Many sellers don’t even bother saving these because they are not valuable. If you have these materials, consider saving them until you have at least 10 pounds and then melting them down into nuggets with an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non-ferrous metals. A scrap yard may give you something for the nuggets, but be prepared to accept a price of up to 75 percent below market value for copper. It might not be worth the cost of the electricity or propane to run the furnace.If you do decide to melt down copper dust and trimmings to sell it, invest in the right materials for melting copper. Copper melts at a temperature of 1,981 degrees Fahrenheit. Purchase metal casting materials that are specifically designed to withstand this kind of heat and melt copper and other non-ferrous metals. Typically, artists use these materials for casting bronze or copper sculpture. You can find a furnace and other materials for melting copper at a bronze foundry. Or, you can use an artist's tutorial, such as this one to build a furnace yourself.Exercise caution. Equip yourself with safety gear such as googles, face masks, oven gloves and running water. If using a homemade furnace, carefully check all gas couplings for leaks. Keep all flammable materials a safe distance away from the furnace.Be environmentally conscious when melting metals. Use as much exhaust to heat the flame as possible so you are not wasting gas or electricity. Dispose of any waste from the process at a recycling center for hazardous materials., Some scrap yards will purchase transformers and motors that contain copper at a special “breakage” price. But you should take them apart and separate the copper to get the best value.When taking apart transformers, don’t bother trying to cut the steel because it is too hard. Instead, cut the copper. It is softer and more malleable.Try heating transformers in a bucket over a fire for 20 to 30 minutes. After heating, fill the bucket with ice water. The transformers will become very weak from the sudden change in temperature and be much easier to take apart.Exercise safety precautions. Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. Wear heat resistant gloves to protect your hands. Handle hot pieces with tongs to avoid having to touch them.

, Check commodity trading prices on NASDAQ or CNBC.com to find the latest price for high-grade copper. Other trade service websites, such as specialty metal sites or investment sites, list the daily prices for metals including copper.Prices for commodities, including copper, are affected by market forces and change every day. Between 2004 and 2009, copper surged in value from approximately $1 per pound to close to $4 per pound. The value dipped dramatically in 2009 during the recession to approximately $1.50 per pound. But the price rebounded by 2012 to an all-time high of approximately $4.50 per pound. Since then, the price of copper has decreased. As of September, 2015, the price of copper per pound is about $2.43 per pound., Consult a website like 1-800-Got Scrap, Recycler Finder or iScrap. These websites let you search by location and by material you have to sell. They also tell you the price the yard is offering for scrap.


You can also find local scrap yards by looking in the phone book or doing a search on the internet. Call ahead to find out the price they are offering.
Look for a scrap yard with a good reputation for customer service. Some scrap yard owners may try to take advantage of you. Find someone whom you can trust and with whom you can see yourself doing more business., If you have done your research about the current value of copper, this will help you assess whether the scrap yard is offering a fair price. Call several scrap yards and find the one with the best price. Try negotiating with them if you can to get the best price. If they won’t offer you a fair price, look elsewhere. , Some scrap yards will come to you to pick up your scrap. But they may charge you for the service. Compare what they are charging you with the cost of delivering it yourself, which includes your time and gas. Decide if having it picked up is worth the price., If you decide to deliver it yourself, you can use whatever vehicle you choose. However, if you are going to be delivering lots of heavy loads, consider using a sturdy pickup truck. A pickup bed allows easy unloading. If you haul your copper in a closed vehicle like a car or SUV, it might be more difficult to unload., Many scrap yards weigh your fully-loaded vehicle when you arrive. They use a large, accurate, pressure-sensitive plate to weigh your vehicle. After unloading the copper, they weigh your vehicle again. The difference is the weight of your scrap., Since copper is a non-ferrous material, the yard cannot use a mag crane to remove it from your truck. Other ferrous materials like iron and steel can be removed from truck beds by the magnet on the mag crane. But since copper is not magnetic, the scrap yard will likely use a forklift instead., Since copper theft has become such a problem, the government now requires the use of security systems to try to catch copper thieves. When you sell copper at a scrap yard, you will likely be required to register in a database that links a photo and a description of the copper you sold with your personal information. In addition, your thumbprint is recorded. Authorities can review these records to link sellers to reported copper thefts., Some scrap yards may pay you with cash. However, if the scrap yard is participating in the government's security database system, they may be prohibited from paying you in cash. In this case, they will likely have an automated teller machine that pays you. The scrap yard will give you a slip of paper with the specified payment. You can input this into the automated teller machine, and it will give you your cash., Most people who sell scrap copper don't rely on finding it by chance. They have sources on which they rely to find a steady supply of copper to sell. For example, you might be able to set up an agreement with an appliance repair store to pick up damaged goods you know contain copper. They might be happy to allow you to recycle what would otherwise wind up in a landfill., Cut wires off the outside. Wire can be snipped off of TV’s and monitors with scissors. Cut off the plugs from the end to add to your brass pile. The small black boxes on charging cables can be cut off and put in your transformer pile. Search inside for insulated wires and connectors.Thinner insulated copper wires can be found throughout old laptops, VCR’s and DVD players.
Take apart desktop computer towers to find the ribbon wire and insulated connectors in the board and hard drive.
Large appliances are often sold for steel. But don’t forget to look inside for copper wiring.
Small appliances such as coffee makers, AC units, fans, blenders and toasters may all have copper wiring inside.
Small electronics, such as cell phones, cameras and hand-held games are good places to search for copper wire.

, Electricians scrape up electrical wire for scrap during demolition. Plumbing materials also contain copper and brass. Always check with the owner or a construction supervisor before taking copper away from a property that you do not own. Even if you are being paid to clean a demolition site, that does not give you a claim to the wire or any other materials you find there. , Look for old statues or décor. Old garden gnomes, statues and other lawn ornaments may contain copper. In addition, sometimes roofing material is made from copper sheeting. Roofing copper is recyclable and environmentally friendly., Unless you have permission to remove copper from a property you do not own, it is considered theft. Copper theft has been on the rise since the value of copper started to increase in 2004.


CNBC refers to copper theft as an epidemic that is sweeping the United States.The FBI states that copper theft is threatening the infrastructure of the United States. Thieves are targeting electrical sub-stations, cellular towers, telephone land lines, railroads, water wells, construction sites, and vacant homes. Delivery of electricity, water, telecommunications, transportation and security and emergency services is disrupted. This poses a threat to public safety and national security.Businesses are taking steps to protect themselves from copper theft. They are installing security cameras, securing metals in locked areas, installing alarms, limiting access to buildings and increasing lighting.In many states, the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony has to do with the value of items stolen. Since copper is so valuable, copper thieves are often charged with a felony when caught. Also, since copper thieves can knock out traffic lights or disrupt 911 services, other felony charges such as disrupting public service may be filed."

Find a drop-off site for Styrofoam in your area.,
Take Styrofoam to Publix.,
Set up your own local program.,
Make sure all EPS to be recycled is clean and free of contaminants before recycling.",How to Recycle Styrofoam1," Contact your local recycling program to find out about Styrofoam recycling programs or drop off sites in your community. Because Styrofoam needs to be recycled at specialized facilities, you need to find a drop-off location rather than setting it out with your regular recyclables.


You can also get in touch with the Alliance of Foam Packaging Recyclers or independent organizations like Earth911 to search for Styrofoam recycling programs in your area. You can find the drop-off station nearest to you by searching the AFPR website.
AFPR also allows you to mail back Styrofoam if you live in an area without a reliable drop-off site. While this can be somewhat challenging if you've accrued a considerable amount of the stuff, it's an option for packing materials or loose-fill ""peanuts."";
, Common throughout the American South, the Publix chain of grocery stores will often have drop-off options for Styrofoam, making it a reliable option in many areas. In other regions, check out whether or not grocery stores, recycling centers, and other commercial zones have Styrofoam drop-offs set up for regional recycling.

, If recycling EPS is frustratingly complicated in your area, consider starting your own program in conjunction with business owners and consumers to bring change to your community. Working with a recycling company like AFPR for pick-up service is best, especially if you work for a business that receives massive amounts of EPS, or if you can collect a large volume of EPS, to make it easier to coordinate. Requesting a new pick-up spot is a lot easier if you can guarantee a large quantity.


Most companies require storage containers to remain outdoors in a bin where EPS is kept clean, dry and unexposed to the elements. Check with AFPR to see whether stacking, bagging, or bundling loose Styrofoam will be appropriate for pick-up, then organize a regular pick-up on behalf of your company.
EPS compactors are also available for use in some commercial spaces, to condense and make more portable a supply of EPS for pick-up. This can seriously cut down on the fuss of a large quantity of Styrofoam products in the meantime before it can be collected., Tape, labels, and other kinds of film can ruin the recycling process, making it important that EPS is free of other types of contaminants before it's picked up to be recycled. Take some time to clear off all other packing materials before recycling it, otherwise it'll just end up in the landfill.

Ask companies to take them back.,
Find a drop-off center.,
Send them to a recycling center.",How to Recycle Packing Peanuts1," If you receive a package with packing peanuts, inquire as to whether the company will take them back. They are likely to agree as they will be able to reuse them for another customer, saving the company money.;
, Though you likely cannot recycle packing peanuts in your bins at home or at the local drop-off center, there are places you can drop them off for recycle.


The Alliance of Foam Packaging Recyclers has a list of places to drop-off packing peanuts by state (U.S. only) on the AFPR website: http://www.epspackaging.org/images/stories/Drop_Off_Recycling_Locations_512.pdf.
The Plastic Loose Fill Council also lists drop-off locations by state (U.S. only). See their website for more information: http://www.loosefillpackaging.com/search/default.asp


, Though you may have to pay for shipping, many companies, such as the EPS Industrial Alliance, will take your packing peanuts for free."

Miscellaneous.",How to Recycle Plastic1," Recycling type #1 is most often used for soft drink bottles, water bottles, plastic beer bottles, plastic peanut butter jars, salad dressing and vegetable oil bottles and food trays. When recycled it gets made into polar fleece, tote bags, furniture, carpet and new beverage containers.;
, Recycling type #2 is used in milk and juice jugs, cleaning product bottles, yogurt tubs, some trash bags and cereal box liners. Recycled back into bottles, pens and building materials.

, Recycling type #3 is found on some window cleaner, detergent and shampoo bottles, as well as clear food packaging, siding, windows, piping and medical equipment. Occasionally recycled by plastic lumber makers back into building materials.

, Look for Recycling type #4 on squeeze bottles and plastic shopping, dry cleaning or bread bags. Recycled into trash can liners, shipping envelopes, and lumber.

, Recycling type #5 comes in straws, some yogurt containers, syrup and ketchup bottles, pill bottles, and caps. Turned into rakes, brooms, batteries and trays.

, Recycling type #6 is used for disposable plates and cups, compact disc cases, egg cartons, carry-out containers, and aspirin bottles. Recycled into foam packaging, insulation and more egg cartons and carry-out containers.

, Recycling type #7 includes multi-gallon water bottles, 'bullet-proof' materials, sunglasses, DVDs, iPod cases, nylon. Not often recycled, but sometimes turned into lumber.

Never set out Styrofoam with other recyclables.,
Never use Styrofoam as insulation.,
Never burn Styrofoam.,
Learn what EP can’t be recycled.",How to Recycle Styrofoam2," Different versions of plastic require different recycling streams to process the materials, which means that you'll have to take special care to recycle your Styrofoam. It cannot be recycled with your plastic bottles, newspaper, and your aluminum cans, so don't try to set it out with your regular recycling, or drop it off at the regular recycling center. Doing so might result in all of your recycling being thrown out.

, While Styrofoam has insulation properties that make it an attractive packing material, using Styrofoam in your home as heat insulation is extraordinarily dangerous and illegal.


Styrofoam can be used to regulate coolers, and drink coffee from, but it's also extremely flammable, which makes it dangerous to as an insulation in a home, trailer, or other environment.

, While EPS can be incinerated at very high temperatures in specialized incinerators, producing no more harmful chemicals than carbon and water, it cannot be burned at home. Burning in a regular fire, the type of which you’ll be able to do at home, releases harmful carbon monoxide and black carbon into the atmosphere, making it dangerous. Dispose of your Styrofoam in other ways., Make sure your Styrofoam is really Styrofoam. Identify products made from Styrofoam by looking for the number 6 inside a recycling triangle. Typically, food containers and egg cartons cannot be recycled, even at the appropriate drop-off locations. These are a slightly-different variety of expanded-polystyrene, which cannot be recycled. Avoid buying and using these types of Styrofoam.


Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF) looks and feels similar to EPS, but with a slightly more plastic-like texture and a glisten to it. It feels slightly different than regular #6 EPS, and can’t be recycled in the same way. Avoid any Styrofoam with a sheen on it.

Use biodegradable packing materials.,
Purchase post-consumer recycled materials.,
Ask for aluminum foil at a restaurant, instead of a take-out box.,
Use a reusable coffee mug.,
Buy eggs in recycled paper cartons.",How to Recycle Styrofoam3," The vast majority of Styrofoam is produced because of packing purposes, padding and securing things for shipping. While it can be difficult to avoid receiving Styrofoam when you make a purchase, you can always cut down on your own use of Styrofoam when sending packages by avoiding the use of loose-fill packing ""peanuts"" and using other kinds of biodegradable packing materials.


Use newspaper, or other recyclable plastic materials to pad your packages. If it's not super-breakable, there's probably no need for Styrofoam.
Using corn and soy-based packing materials is becoming more and more common. If you work for a business that regularly sells things that require packing protection, consider making the alternative to biodegradable alternatives to Styrofoam.
A company called Ecovative has recently developed a mushroom-based product that can be grown to fit any space, much like Styrofoam, but with completely biodegradable materials. It's just as lightweight and customizable as Styrofoam, but with none of the environmental impact., When you're making consumer purchases, try your best to only purchase things packaged in and made from post-consumer recycled materials. It can be difficult to know if something you buy will contain styrofoam included in the packing materials, but if you're buying with an eye for companies that make recycling and reusing a priority, you can be fairly certain that the packaging won't include any.

, Take-out boxes are tough to get rid of and almost impossible to recycle. If you're a foodie, get in the habit of avoiding those Styrofoam take-out boxes and instead asking for the kitchen to wrap up your leftovers in aluminum foil so you can take it home. You can also simply eat there if you have the time. The restaurant will likely use formal(kind of) plates, bowls, and other eating tools and containers, but if you don't have the time, use aluminum foil., If you make regular coffee-stops throughout your week, try to invest in a reusable coffee mug that you can travel with, instead of collecting ""to-go"" cups at home and not being able to easily recycle them.

, Egg cartons are the other big offender when it comes to non-recyclable Styrofoam materials. How best to approach these Styrofoam traps? Avoid them entirely. Only buy eggs from recycled paper cartons, or other recyclable materials.


If you end up with lots of Styrofoam containers, you can reuse the cartons if you buy eggs in bulk, or donate egg cartons at the farmers’ market, or to farmers with lots of chickens who'll need to hold their eggs.

Donate Styrofoam to local businesses.,
Save loose fill for repacking shipping materials.,
Use Styrofoam for craft projects.,
Use polystyrene floaters for fishing.,
Use EPS around the house.",How to Recycle Styrofoam4," Check with local shipping businesses to see if they can reuse Styrofoam shipping materials such as peanuts in their shipping. There's a lot of Styrofoam in the world, so it might be hard to find people in desperate need of used Styrofoam, but it's worth a shot.


UPS, USPS, and mail-order companies in your town might be open to the idea. You'll never know until you ask.

, If you regularly get packing peanuts, don't get rid of them. Save them back for packing new boxes and reusing them for packaging. There's no need to buy new packing peanuts.

, Styrofoam is lightweight, easy to paint, and easy to carve up for art projects with kids. It's a perfect medium for youngsters. Check with local daycare centers and other after-school programs to find out about art classes that might use free materials.Styrofoam is great for creating sets for theatrical productions, building up model train communities, and using as the base for holiday decorations. There are lots of uses for Styrofoam.

, EPS is commonly called “unsinkable,” because of its light weight and the fact that it’s up to 96% air. This makes it perfect for use in fishing. Try carving little Styrofoam bobbers, attaching Styrofoam to your lines to help you keep an eye on your lures. It's free, easy to use, and super-reliable.

, If you save Styrofoam, you'll be surprised at how useful it can be around the house. Lining a potted plant with a bit of Styrofoam can help it drain more effectively, while you can also use shaved Styrofoam to re-stuff old bean-bag chairs, pillows, or stuffed animals. Be creative instead of being wasteful.

Donate them to shipping companies.,
Give them to friends.,
Post an ad online.,
Give them to a nearby school or community center.",How to Recycle Packing Peanuts2," If the company who sent them to you won’t take them back, inquire at businesses that do lots of shipping if they will take your packing peanuts. Moving companies might also agree to take them. UPS stores in many areas will gladly take these peanuts off your hands., Ask your friends and family if they have any use for packing peanuts. If anyone you know is moving or ships a lot of items, they may need these peanuts for their own uses.

, Sites like Craigslist are great for getting rid of things you don’t need. Post an ad saying you have free packing peanuts for whoever will come pick them up. Just be wary of scams; you may wish to meet the person who’d like to get the packing peanuts at a location other than your home.

, Schools and centers are often grateful to receive free items. Ask a local school or community center if they could use packing peanuts for craft projects or even for shipping.

Store your packing peanuts.,
Put them in the bottom of a planter.,
Keep your keys from sinking.,
Make pillows or cushions.,
Sew packing peanuts into costumes at Halloween or other holidays.,
Decorate your Christmas tree with packing peanuts.,
Make a craft project.,
Insulate coolers or lunchboxes.,
Pin things to packing peanuts.,
Turn them into stamps.,
Cover sharp-pointed tools.",How to Recycle Packing Peanuts3," You may one day have a use for these packing peanuts, so store them until you do. They are lightweight and like to blow around, creating a mess, so try storing them in a box, garbage bag, or even an old pair of pantyhose to keep them contained.

, They will allow your plant to drain properly and are hidden from view. Because they are very light in weight, they will also make the planter easier to move and lift., When you are out on the water, thread a few polystyrene packing peanuts through your key chain. They will help keep your keys afloat.

, Stuff a zippered pillowcase with packing peanuts to make a cushion for your pet. It will provide a lightweight, cool place for your pet to rest. You can also use them as fillers for bean bag chairs., Use them to make a fat belly, rippling muscles, or to stuff a scarecrow. The light weight makes them easy for children to wear., Instead of using popcorn, string packing peanuts together. You can even add glitter or color to make them more festive.

, If you have children, they could make a snowman, a snake, or any other creation from the peanuts. Simply glue them together and decorate them how you wish., Fill a zipper-locked plastic bag with packing peanuts and stick it in an ice chest. The ice in the cooler will last longer and the contents will stay cold longer. Use a small zip-closure plastic storage bag filled with packing peanuts and ice as a way to keep food cool in a lunch bag.


Avoid using packing peanuts for building insulation as they are not treated with flame retardant.

, Glue a small magnet to a packing peanut and attach it to your refrigerator. Use a pin to attach notes and lists.

, Stamp pages of scrapbooks or homemade cards with packing peanuts dipped in paint. Many of the peanuts already resemble letters or you can cut them into shapes. For example, some come in an “S” or “C” shape, but you could cut them in half to make a half-moon stamper. You could also cut them to resemble squares or triangles, or even glue two pieces together to make circles., Use packing peanuts to cover sharp tips, such as those on needle-nose pliers or even screwdrivers. This will keep someone from accidentally getting jabbed or poked when rummaging around in the toolbox."

Find out about your community's recycling program.,
Order a recyclables bin for curbside pickup.,
Leave your recycling at a drop-off point.,
Take your plastics directly to a local recycling center.,
Know what your facility can handle.",How to Recycle Plastic2," Many cities and towns now have recycling drop-off points or even curbside municipal recycling collection. However every community is different, so call your local government and ask what facilities and options are available in your area.

, In some communities you can set your recycling out just like your trash—all you need to do is sign up for the program and get your recycling bin.


Sometimes, like garbage collection, this will require a one-time or annual fee, but it makes recycling so easy the expense is usually worth it.
If you live in an apartment, you may have building recycling bins already. Ask your super.

, In areas that don't have curbside pickup, there are often large recycling dumpsters around town, usually at public places like schools, churches or municipal buildings.

, Search online or call your local officials to find the centers in your area. If a center accepts plastics, you can pretty much always bring your recycling directly to them.


Some recycling facilities will pay a couple cents per item that you drop off. You can make a few extra bucks by collecting recycling from your friends and neighbors and bringing it in.

, Some recycling centers will do the sorting and cleaning for you, so you can just dump cans, plastics and papers all together. With others you will need to separate different materials and potentially remove paper labels. Follow the rules as best you can.

"

Get a number of recycling baskets for your home.,
Sort your recyclables by type.,
Sort your plastics by number.,
Make sure your plastics are clean.,
Take out your recycling once a week.",How to Recycle Plastic3," Place them near your regular main garbage bins, so you won't be tempted to just trash recyclables out of laziness.


If have to sort your recyclables, you can save time by getting multiple or sectioned bins so you can sort as you throw each item away.

, If your facility requires it, separate paper and cardboard, plastics, glass, and cans. This can be annoying, but like any household chore it gets easier if you make a weekly habit of it.

, Many recycling programs no longer require this, but you may need to separate out the seven different categories of recyclable plastics.

, You may not need to do this for your program, but it helps to wash out residue and remove labels.

, This way the bottles don't build up and the task of sorting them doesn't become too intimidating.


If your recycling center is out of the way, try sorting recycling once a week but storing it for one big drop every month or so.

Refill containers.,
Organize your knick-knacks in pill bottles.,
Get a second run out of plastic bags around the house.",How to Recycle Plastic4," Just because you finished the fluid, doesn't mean you have to be done with the bottle. Many plastic soap bottles can be refilled from a larger bulk-sized container of hand soap or dishwashing liquid. You can reuse plastic bottles for all sorts of things.


Be careful about drinking repeatedly from the same plastic bottle. Harmful chemicals can leak out of some plastics over time. Better to use your old plastic bottles to store non-consumables.

, From coins to loose screws to craft supplies, these small, hard plastic bottles are perfect for keeping track of all kinds of tiny objects.

, Plastic shopping bags make fine trash bin linings, packing materials or lunch bags.

Grow small plants in the coffee mugs.,
Make a candle inside of the mug.,
Crush the mugs and use them as drainage rock.,
Give the mugs to your kids for crafting projects.",How to Recycle Old Coffee Mugs1," They are for good growing small houseplants like herbs, cacti, and succulents. All you need to do is add a little soil and add the plant or seedling. Put the mug in a place where it will get a lot of sunlight, like your windowsill.mugs_b_1324295.html</ref>


Try to avoid watering it too much because the mug doesn’t have a drainage hole.;
, Candles also seem to accumulate all over the household through the years. Get rid of some of those candle holders and glasses while reducing the amount of mugs in your cabinet by combining the two! All you have to do is melt some wax inside of the mug, add a wick, and then you’re good to go. Light up the candle and relax. Just make sure not to grab the mug for coffee in the morning.Making candles on your own is also a great way to save money.

, Let out some frustration by crushing up mugs for a useful purpose. Put the mugs underneath a thick cloth and crush them using a mallet or hammer. Don’t get too crazy, but crush them enough so that you end up with small pieces. Then, use the pieces as drainage stone at the bottom of flower and houseplant pots. The small bits of ceramic work as well as gravel for encouraging soil drainage., Let your kids release some creative energy by giving them coffee mugs to craft with. This is a cheap and easy way to let your kids develop the artistic talent you know they have. Allow your children to decorate the unwanted mugs with acrylic paint, construction paper, or other decorative materials. When finished, the mug can be used as storage for colored pencils or other small objects.

Use the mug as a gift holder.,
Use the old coffee mugs to store pencils and pens.,
Store your toiletries in a mug.,
Make a storage unit with three mugs and a piece of wood.",How to Recycle Old Coffee Mugs2," This works best with a mug you don’t want that isn’t stained or too personal. No one wants to receive a coffee stained mug that is labeled with your name (unless they share the same name). Put candy or some other gift, like a gift card, inside of a clean mug. Wrap a ribbon around the mug and give it as a small gift to someone from work, school, or to a friend., Maybe you received that mug that says #1 Dad twenty years ago, but you can’t bear to part with it. A coffee mug also makes a great pencil or pen holder for your desk. Enjoy the sentimental value while organizing your office space.If you have a lot of mugs that need reusing, you can store office or crafting supplies like staples and paperclips inside of them.

, Never use your partner’s toothbrush by accident again by using an old mug to separate toiletries. You can also store your toothbrush and toothpaste in one mug and keep things like your hairbrush and razor in another. Be sure to put the mugs in a place where they won’t be easily knocked over by a sleepy person early in the morning., Use your old mugs for something practical and decorative. You just need three mugs, an adhesive, and a piece of wood. This works especially well if the three mugs match, but it’s not definitely not necessary. Evenly space the mugs on the wood, attach them, and hang up your work wherever you’d like. You can store things like towels, keys, or whatever you want in them.Make sure the coffee mugs are secured really well before hanging the piece up, or you may accidentally end up with material for a mosaic.

Donate the old coffee mugs to a thrift store.,
Ask your recycling program if they accept ceramic.,
Hand over your coffee mugs to an artist.,
Sell the mugs in a garage sale.",How to Recycle Old Coffee Mugs3," If your mugs are perfectly fine but unwanted, donating them is a good option. Thrift stores that sell housewares will usually accept donations of unwanted mugs, but it doesn’t hurt to ask any local thrift store. Then your old mugs can be enjoyed by someone else until they’re broken or ready to be recycled again., More and more recycling facilities are accepting materials outside the usual aluminum, glass, and plastic categories. Do a quick search online to see if any recycling programs in your area accept ceramic for recycling. Keep in mind that many programs that recycle ceramic exclusively mainly accept large bathroom fixtures like toilets and sinks, so make sure they accept coffee mugs before traveling there for no reason.

, Mosaic is a popular and super cool style of artwork where images are pieced together from bits of broken glass, ceramic, or other materials. Local artists may be interested in crushing your coffee mugs for use in environmentally friendly mosaic art. Plus, art supplies are expensive, so this could be a big help for a talented artist.Advertising the mugs on a classifieds site like Craigslist or Freecycle is an ideal way to get in touch with artists.

, Get rid of your old mugs, along with other unused items, and make a little cash at the same time. Just be sure that the mugs you’re selling are clean and unstained. Slap a price tag on them for a cheap price and wait for them to sell."

Use the K Cup.,
Remove the lid.,
Dispose of any remnants.,
Wash and Rinse.,
Allow to fully dry.",How to Recycle K Cups1," Since a K Cup is a single-use beverage maker, use it once. You will want to clean the K Cup regardless of its final destination to prevent bacterial growth.
, The foil lid on top is punctured but not removed during the brewing process, so completely remove it., There may be solids or liquids still inside the K Cup which need to be removed., With soap and water, clean out the K Cup to prevent bacterial growth. Then rinse to remove soap residue., Let air dry overnight to prevent bacterial growth."
"Follow the cleaning steps.,
Purchase a separator.,
Follow the directions.,
Rinse off the layers.,
Recycle.",How to Recycle K Cups2,", These can be found online and in some stores. Due to the K Cup's three layers, it cannot be recycled without being separated., The most common K Cup Recycler, the Recycle A Cup, is very simple to use - just attach to the top, rotate, and pull up. Other Recyclers work almost identically., K Cups have three layers that protect the mix from the environment and are sometimes adhered together. A quick rinse in hot water should remove any adhesive that may be present., Now the fun part starts! There are a few options you have now;"
"Follow the cleaning steps.,
Get Creative.",How to Recycle K Cups3,", Here are some ideas of ways to reuse a K Cup;"
"
Wash out the can.,
Place a knife against the can’s top.,
Tap the knife with a hammer.,
Decorate the can.",How to Reuse Empty Aluminum Cans1," Add some of your dish soap to the can and rinse it out well with water. This helps remove any of the sticky residue from the can’s contents. After you cut off the top of the can, you’ll have a chance to check for any leftover food or drink and wash the can again.;
, To make the candle, you need to remove the top part of the can. One way to do this is with a pointed or sharp kitchen knife. If it’s a drink can, place the point in the groove between the rim of the can and the opening.Keep the can on the table and the knife pointed into it to avoid getting poked. Children should have an adult do this for them.
Larger aluminum cans are often open enough that you can fit in the candle and avoid cutting.

, Use a household hammer to gently tap the knife and force it into the aluminum. Repeat this around the edge of the can until you can remove the can’s top. If there are sharp edges, use the edge of a knife or sandpaper. Rub the knife or sandpaper over it to smooth down the edges.


Another way to cut the can is to make a slice on the outside using an x-acto knife and then cut around with scissors, but beware of sharp edges.

, A can used for a candle can be decorated in many ways. One way is to first poke holes in a pattern using a nail and then coat the can in spray paint. You can then drop in a small candle to get a patterned light. Another option is to cut the can into a large circle and smaller petals, gluing them into a flower. This kind of decoration can be used as a base to hold a candle.Use a tea candle or LED light to avoid heating the can while in use.
Cans with the tops cut off and decorated can also be used as pencil holders.

"
"
Clean the can.,
Cut off the top and bottom.,
Cut down the seam.,
Glue the square to a tile.,
Varnish the edges.,
Add felt pads.",How to Reuse Empty Aluminum Cans2," Wash out the inside of the can with soap and water. Remove any leftover liquid from the can. You can check and wash the can again after you cut it open.

, The part of the can you want to save is the flat middle. To cut the can, take craft scissors designed to be used on tin. You can also make a cut with an x-acto knife and then cut around the can.


Be careful of sharp edges.

, Find the seam on the middle portion of the can. This is where the metal was soldered together to create the can’s shape. In a soda can, it will often be by the ingredient section on the label. Once you have found it, cut down it through the length of the can. Unroll this portion and flatten it against a surface., The tiles can be found for cheap at a home improvement store. The size you need depends on the size of your coasters, but four by four inches (10.16 cm) is a standard size. A good glue, such as a silicone glue, can be bought at any craft store. Rub the glue over the back of the metal, then press the metal flat over the top of the tile. Let the glue settle overnight.

, The next day, use a brush to apply varnish over the metal to protect it. Dip the brush into the varnish and spread an even coating over the top of the coaster. This prevents the metal from peeling after use. Another option for this is to stitch or glue fabric over the edges of the metal., Find packs of small felt pads at the craft store. Peel them off from their protective backing and attach the sticky side to the bottom of the tile. The felt will protect your table from scratches.

"
"
Cut off the ends of the can.,
Cut down the seam.,
Punch out shapes.,
Make a small hole for hanging.,
Run a chain through the hole.,
Attach the chain to an earring back.",How to Reuse Empty Aluminum Cans3," Jab in a sharp pair of scissors or make a cut with an x-acto knife to start. Scissors can then be used to cut around the can until the end is removed.

, Examine the remaining part of the can for the seam where the metal was welded together. Cut down the length of the seam until you can lay the aluminum flat.

, Consider the design you want the earring to be. Lay out the leftover piece of metal, then use a hole punch to make the shape. Keep the metal against a flat surface as you work. Simple shapes include butterflies and flowers.The hole punch dulls the edges, but use sandpaper or an emery board to file down any sharpness.

, Imagine how the shapes will hang as an earring. Where you put the hole for the chain determines this. Once you’ve decided, use a pushpin to poke a small hole through the aluminum., A small length of chain or jump ring from the craft store are useful here. Use small pliers or tweezers to open one end of this connector, then push an end through the hole. Close the loop when you are done.

, Pull open the earring back, using pliers if necessary. Run the chain or jump ring through it, then close the loop. Your earrings will be ready to wear.


Chains, rings, and backs can be recycled from old jewelry you have around the house.

Gather soda tabs.,
Tie a loop in the center of a chord.,
Put on the first tab.,
Cross over a second tab.,
Add a third tab below the second one.,
Continue alternating tabs.,
Tie shut the belt.",How to Reuse Empty Aluminum Cans4," The amount of tabs you need depends on how big the belt will be. Plan for about three tabs per inch (2.54 cm). A waist size of 25-30 inches (63.5-76.2 cm) amounts to about 110 tabs., Get nylon cord from the craft store, making sure it’s long enough to double around your waist. In the center of the cord, tie a knot as big as a pop tab, leaving a loop on the outside end. This loop will be used to secure the belt during use.

, Work from the backs of the tabs. Thread one end of your cord through the top. Thread the other end through the bottom. Push the tab all the way back to the end of the cord.

, When you add the second tab over the first tab, the cords should be reversed. The bottom cord should go through the top hole and the top cord should go through the bottom hole. When you push the tab next to the first one, the cords should form an X., The third tab should be below the second one. String the top strand of cord through the top hole and the bottom strand through the bottom hole.

, The fourth tab should go on top of the last one and the cords should cross over again to form an X. The fifth tab should go under the fourth tab with straight cords again. Repeat this pattern until the belt is long enough.

, All you have to do now is tie the free ends of the cord together. Make a couple of knots to keep it secure. You can also run it through a button first. Trim off excess cord. To wear the belt, put this end through the loop made earlier.

Use a milk jug as a watering can.,
Use a milk jug as an irrigator.,
Make a milk jug trowel or scoop.,
Use a milk jug as an electric cord reel.",How to Reuse Milk Jugs in the Garden1," The easiest way to reuse a milk jug in your garden is to turn it into a watering can. All you need to do is poke around 20 small holes into the lid. Use an awl, metal skewer, or big needle to poke the holes.Use a milk jug with a lid that screws on instead of a pop-on cap.;
, An irrigator waters a planter or soil bed gradually, so it’s great to use if you’re out of town for a few days and can’t water your garden. Simply poke at least five small holes in the bottom of a milk jug. Then bury the bottom of the jug so soil covers all the holes.Fill the jug up with water through the jug's stem using your garden hose. Keep the cap on to prevent the water from evaporating. The water will slowly flow out of the holes and irrigate your plants’ roots.
Be careful not to harm your plants’ root systems when you bury the jug. For larger plant beds, use one jug at least every three feet (one meter).

, Use a marker to draw a line under the handle. The line should make a semicircle and trace half of the jug’s circumference, with the handle at its center. Make two more lines from each end of the semicircle to the jug’s bottom, then connect them by drawing a scoop-shaped line through the bottom.You can make the shovel shape sharper if you need a trowel or make it round if you just need a scoop.
After tracing your desired shape, use box cutters or scissors to cut out the opening and create your shovel.
Make sure to keep the cap on the jug to hold in whatever you’ll be scooping. Using a jug with a screw-on lid will hold soil and other materials better.  

, Cut out the section of the jug opposite its handle. Cover the raw edges of the cut section with electrical tape to prevent any nicks to your cords. Hold the jug by the handle and wrap the cord around, using the cut section to hold the cord in place.If you have an electric leaf blower, edger, lawn mower, or any other corded garden tools, you can use the jug to keep your wires from getting tangled.

Make a simple cloche.,
Make milk jug seed starters.,
Create a labeled planter with a milk jug.,
Make a self-watering planter.",How to Reuse Milk Jugs in the Garden2," A cloche fits over seedlings or grown plants to keep them warm as they mature or during colder weather. Cut around the jug one inch (two centimeters) up from the bottom. Cut jagged edges all the way around the jug so you can anchor it into the soil when you place it over your plant.Keep the cap on during colder nights, take it off when it’s sunny to avoid overheating the plants.
Instead of throwing away the cut bottom, you can use as a base for potted plants.

, Cut around the jug about a third up from the bottom. Poke at least five drainage holes in the jug’s bottom. Fill it halfway with soil, plant your seeds, then cover it with another half inch (one centimeter) of soil (or however much your seed package suggests).You can leave the top of the jug connected to the bottom on one side to create a mini-greenhouse for your seedlings., Cut your jug in half, but leave a section opposite the handle two or three inches wide (five to seven centimeters) uncut. Cut vertically on either side of this section and at the top where the jug starts to curve and form the stem. This will create a labeling strip that extends up from the bottom of the container.Poke drainage holes in the bottom and plant your seeds or seedling. Use a marker to write on the vertical strip. You can label the plant’s species, the date you planted your seeds, or care information.

, Cut your jug in half, keeping the handle intact, and cut the stem (where the cap attaches) off of the top section. Hold the top section upside down, so the end where the cap used to be faces down, and line it with a coffee filter to hold soil. Fill it with soil and plant your seeds or seedling, then place it into the bottom section.Water your seeds or plant, and keep a half inch (one centimeter) of water in the bottom section at all times.
The self-watering planter is great for seedlings and for moisture-loving herbs like mint.

Cut small holes on opposite sides of a milk jug.,
Run a wooden dowel through the small holes.,
Cut larger holes just above the dowels.,
Use electrical tape to cover the holes’ raw edges.,
Use nylon string to hang the bird feeder.",How to Reuse Milk Jugs in the Garden3," Use an awl or skewer to cut small holes on opposite sides of each other near the bottom of the jug. If necessary, use a pen or a Phillips head screwdriver to slightly widen the holes so they can accommodate a wooden dowel.Make sure to line up the holes neatly so the dowel will fit in straight.
You can create a pair of holes for one dowel if you plan on making openings for birds to access seeds on two sides of the milk jug.
If you want to make openings on four sides of the jug, poke two pairs of small holes for two dowels. Make sure one pair is slightly above the other in order to fit both dowels.

, Find a thin wooden dowel at your local home improvement or craft store. It should be long enough to stick through the jug with two or three inches (five to seven centimeters) extra on both sides.The extra lengths of dowel on each side will provide perches for birds.
Run a second wooden dowel through the other pair of holes if you’re making four openings instead of two.

, Use a box cutter or a pair of scissors to create larger holes from just above the dowels to the part of the jug that starts to curve to form the stem. These openings will allow birds to access the birdseed you’ll place inside the feeder. You can make two openings or cut one on each of the jug’s four sides., Choose electric tape in your favorite color to cover the raw edges of each opening. The cut plastic edges can be sharp, and you wouldn’t want any birds to get hurt. The tape also provides decoration and adds a personal touch to your bird feeder. Try making stripes or other patterns with the tape.

, Use the awl or skewer to poke two small holes at the top of the bird feeder where the cap would attach. Thread nylon string through the holes, fill the bottom up with birdseed up to the dowels, then hang the bird feeder in your garden.

Use an artificial fiber like nylon or string made of metal instead of twine. Weather will wear and weaken down a natural fiber like twine, and your bird feeder could fall.
You can coat the string with petroleum jelly to help deter squirrels.

Prepare your empty pill bottle for use.,
Keep your office items in empty pill bottles.,
Hide a spare key in the container.,
Store jewelry and cosmetic items in the pill bottle.,
Place your cotton swabs in the pill bottle.,
Fill your empty pill bottles with lotion for traveling.,
Stash your earbuds in an empty pill bottle.,
Store seeds in your empty pill bottles.,
Organize your piping tips.,
Craft a portable sewing kit.,
Carry matches in the pill bottle.,
Make a coin container.,
Make a fire starter.",How to Reuse Empty Pill Bottles1," Before you reuse your pill bottle, heat up some water to boiling, pour it in the bottle, and wait 60 seconds. Peel the label off, then rinse and dry the empty pill bottle before using it., Many people keep loose items like paper clips, thumb tacks, and so on in their desk drawers. But these items can be hard to find unless they are collected properly. Empty pill bottles offer a great solution to storing these office supplies. If you wish, you could label the top of each empty pill bottle with permanent marker to indicate what is in it.

, Stick a spare key in the pill container. Plant it in the lawn near the back of your house or somewhere out of the way. Don’t bury it too deeply. The white top of the pill bottle should be parallel with the surface of the ground. Place a fist-sized rock over the pill bottle in a location where it would not seem out of place.This will allow you to hide a spare key outside your home. In the event you’re locked out, you can get back in by using this key.
Hiding the key in the pill bottle protects it from rain, which could cause it to rust.

, Bobby pins, hair ties, and other small fashion accessories are often difficult to store properly, since they get lost in regular drawers and storage containers. Empty pill bottles make perfect containers for these items. Use one for bobby pins, another for earrings, and so on. If you wanted, you could tape a label on each so you know what’s inside.If you have a taller empty pill bottle, you could store your eyeliner and makeup brushes in it.

, Cotton swabs are great for cleaning small tubes and fine objects. But their small size also makes them hard to store. Most people just keep them in the box they come packaged in, but if you wanted to keep them somewhere more accessible, you could just store them in an empty pill bottle.If you are not able to seal the pill bottle with the lid, that’s okay. You can just leave the pill bottle on your bathroom counter and recycle the lid, or place it somewhere for safekeeping (in the event that you ever want to put your empty pill bottle to a different use).

, If you’re traveling, you are often unable to bring regular containers of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. You could buy travel-sized versions of these products – or you could be thrifty and just pump a bunch of these hygienic plasmas into an empty pill bottle., Stuffing your earbuds in your backpack, handbag, or pocket could cause them to become tangled or damaged. Instead, extend your earbuds to their maximum length and untangle any knots. Fold them in half three or four consecutive times, then place them in an empty pill bottle. Your earbuds will then be safe and ready for use the next time you want to use them., If you have a green thumb, you might want to store some seeds away for next season. Place your dry, cleaned seeds in empty pill containers. Place the containers in a cool, dry location. This will keep them safe and ready to use when the seasons change., If you spend a lot of time in the kitchen and have a large collection of frosting piping tips, sort them by size. Label a corresponding number of pill bottles with the various piping tip sizes or descriptions. For instance, if you have three piping tips that excrete a star shape, write “star” on the bottle cap and stick the piping tips in the empty pill bottle., You can make your own little sewing kit inside an empty pill bottle. Pack it with two needles, a spool of white, navy, or other common colored thread, and a few buttons. On the inside of the cap, glue a small pin cushion., Matches have their own proper place – the matchbook or the matchbox. But if you’re taking matches out camping and get caught in a squall, your matches could be ruined. Carrying your matches in a waterproof pill bottle means you won’t have to worry about that anymore.Don’t forget to cut the striker off the matchbox or matchbook and tuck it into the pill bottle along with the matches.

, Instead of keeping coins in your cup holder, center console, or just rolling around in your wallet, place them in an empty pill container. Put the container in your vehicle and use it to pay at parking meters, drive through restaurants, and toll booths., Dab a cotton ball with petroleum jelly. Work the petroleum jelly into the cotton ball by pushing it across the surface with your fingers. Wad the cotton ball up and stuff it in an empty pill bottle. Take the pill bottle on your next camping trip. Cotton coated with petroleum jelly will burn longer than will regular cotton, so it’s a good way to get your fires started.You should be able to fit three or four such cotton balls into your empty pill bottle.

Make a nail polish remover tub.,
Make some jumbo crayons.,
Make a candle holder.,
Write a love medication for your partner.",How to Reuse Empty Pill Bottles2," When you’re ready to take off your nail polish, stuff the empty pill bottle with cotton balls. Sprinkle some nail polish remover over the cotton balls. Dip your finger in the in the bottle and twist. Repeat for each digit you wish to remove nail polish from., Take a bunch of crayons of a single color and strip them of their paper covers. Drop them in an empty tin can. Place the can in the oven on low heat. Check the oven intermittently. After about 10 minutes, the crayons should be melted into a colorful goo. Pour the melted crayons into an empty pill container.After two to three hours, the crayon should be cool. You could try to ease it out of the pill container, but you’ll probably have to crack it open with a hammer.
For extra fun, melt crayons of many colors, then add different colors to your empty pill bottle in successive layers. Then you will have a multicolor crayon that changes color as you use it.

, Glue a small tealight candle to the top of the empty pill bottle. You could also turn the empty pill bottle upside down and use the wider top as a more stable base, then glue the tealight candle to the bottom of the empty pill bottle instead.You could glue two or three empty pill bottles together to make a taller candle holder.
To give your candle holder a pleasing appearance, dip it in a glossy paint. You could remove the cap before doing so and paint it a different color.

, Turn your empty pill bottle to its original purpose – with a twist. On your anniversary or Valentine’s day, fill the pill bottle with red chocolate-covered candies or candy hearts. Use your home printer to create a professional-looking medication label with your name, followed by “M.D.” Write a clever prescription on the label, like “Take twice daily. For best results give your partner a kiss just before and just after use.” Give it to your partner."

Give the caroler a head.,
Create the figure’s arms.,
Clothe the caroler.,
Place a songbook in the caroler’s arms.",How to Reuse Empty Pill Bottles3," Turn the pill bottles upside down. Obtain a small wooden ball with a diameter equivalent to that of the pill bottle’s top. Paint the ball a flesh tone, then glue it on the top of the pill bottle using a glue gun. The ball will represent the caroler’s head.After the flesh-toned paint has dried, use a fine-tipped black brush to give the caroler eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

, Fold a pipe cleaner in half and twist it tightly around itself. Glue the pipe cleaner to the area just beneath the rim of the pill bottle using your glue gun. Bend the pipe cleaner around the pill bottle and clip it using wire cutters to a proportional length. Usually, you won’t need the pipe cleaners to be longer than 2.5 times the diameter of the pill bottle., Cut a tube of cloth from some old cloth scraps. Cut enough cloth to cover the pill bottle caroler on all sides. Cut a hole the center of the upper portion of the cloth you’ve selected for the caroler’s cloak. The hole should have a diameter just slightly smaller than that of wooden ball you situated atop the pill bottle. Wrap the cloth around the caroler and glue or sew it securely in the back.Take care to gently cover the pipe cleaner arms and arrange the hole you cut in such a way that leaves visible a portion of the ball’s surface.

, Cut a small piece off an old songbook (a caroling songbook, preferably) and fold it in half so that it resembles a miniature songbook. Glue this songbook scrap to the miniature caroler’s outstretched arms."

Confirm the bags have a #2 or #4 plastic symbol on them.,
Collect the bags in one large garbage bag.,
Bring them to a bag collection bin.",How to Recycle Old Plastic Bags1," Check that all the bags are free of debris. Shake them out to confirm they are empty., The symbol should be printed on the front or bottom of the plastic bag. This confirms the bag is made of recycled material.If there is no #2 or #4 symbol, the plastic bag may not be recyclable. If this is the case, you can reuse the bag in other ways around the house.

, Aim to fit 50 to 100 plastic bags in the garbage bag. Press the plastic bags down to remove any air in them so you can fit lots of plastic bags in the garbage bag. Collecting the bags in one place will make it easier for you to transport them., Most national grocery retailers, such as Safeway, Target, and Walmart, will have a bag collection bin in the store. The bins are usually at the front entrance of the store, labeled “bag recycling.” Put the plastic bags in the collection bin to be recycled."

Create a hanging wall layer.CDs can be linked together and hung from a wall in a large pattern.",How to Reuse and Recycle Old CDs and DVDs1," Draw patterns on the disc itself or glue on glitter to complete the decoration.


Stick CD labels on your discs to lend more space for decoration.;
, Breaking them up, you can create a number of different shapes and increase the reflective surface of the disc. Snap the CD into multiple shards and glue onto a surface for a striking mosaic.


If you're breaking CDs, keep the sharp edges in mind. Be careful when you're snapping the discs. Use a hammer to break up smaller pieces and pick up broken sharps gently, as if they were glass.

, They will bear the heat and save your kitchen surfaces from damage. You can paint or draw on the discs to give them some ornamental appeal as well.

, If you snap a CD in half, you'll have a nice decoration to line a flowerbed with. Due to the likelihood that you'll have a lot of CDs to go through, you shouldn't be surprised if you're able to transform your entire garden in this manner.

, If you have enough CDs, you can conceivably cover a wall in this way. Chain links through the CDs and secure the highest CD of each row to the wall by looping the highest link through a nail to the wall.


You can create holes in the CDs by using a drill. Drill it with an old piece of wood underneath.

Create a phone dock with a CD stack.Because phones have largely replaced CDs in terms of media, there's a certain poetic irony in creating a phone dock from CDs.,
Attach CDS onto a threaded rod for a makeshift dumbbell.Although individual discs don't weigh much on their own, adding a bunch together can amass a decent weight.,
Make a mini photo album.,
Glue together a desk organizer.,
Write up a quick DIY disc postcard.",How to Reuse and Recycle Old CDs and DVDs2," To do this, glue 5 or 6 CDs together, and run your phone charger cord up through the bottom. Tape the charger cord to the bottom of the CD stack to hold it in place. Done in this way, you'll always have a proper place to rest your phone overnight.

, Stack an equal number of CDs on either end of a threaded rod and secure them in with nuts on both sides. Leaving a space open in the middle, you'll have your very own dumbbell to lift for bouts of mild exercise.


150 CDS (75 on either side of the grip) should make a 10 lb weight.

, CDs are a perfect size to make a small album with. Glue construction paper onto each disc you want to use and place photos on them. Next, place a larger piece of construction paper that overlaps the backside of the disc and punch a coil binder through the protruding paper.Because CDs are thick compared to paper, you'll only be able to string a few of them together.

, If you have a lot of disc cases left over, you can turn the cases into a working organizer for your desk. Take a long stretch of cardboard as wide as a CD jewel case and superglue pairs of cases together in intervals.Leave the cases some time to sit, then organize your desk folders within each interval according to their type.


Paint or colour over the cardboard to make it look more professional. Aim to make the foundation colour similar to the colour used on the jewel case's album art.

, If you have no use for your discs, you can try writing a short letter on one and sending it off.This is especially clever if it's a CD-R and you burn something to the disc that's applicable to the letter or invitation.

Digitize your library.Before you give away your physical collection it is a good idea to create a digital backup.,
Set aside rare collectible items.,
Burn material to your CDs.If you have blank or rewritable CDs, you can effectively reuse them by replacing the material that's on the discs.,
Sell off your collection.Whether via social media like Facebook or message board sites like Craigslist, it's a common thing for people to sell their collections to interested buyers.,
Gift your collection to friends.,
Get in touch with a media resale broker.Even if it seems like a lot of people are trying to get rid of their collections, there's still a large market for the purchase of CDs and DVDs.,
Dispose of your CDs at a recycling center.Because there are so many people looking to get rid of their collections, and because discs aren't biodegradable, there are lots of recycling centers that specialize in processing unwanted CDs and DVDs.",How to Reuse and Recycle Old CDs and DVDs3," This will limit the time and money spent rejuvenating your collection via digital downloads. Put each CD in individually and rip the files to your computer drive or a cloud folder.

, If you're giving away or selling a collection, it's a good idea to peruse through what you have, setting aside the items that are worthy to keep. Although CDs don't yield a high value in the digital age, certain limited run items may be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.


This applies to DVDs as well, albeit to a lesser extent.
Bootlegged items are seldom seen as valuable, unless the bootleg itself has acquired a certain level of notoriety of its own. Exceptions would include Mayhem's Dawn of the Black Hearts live bootleg.

, If there are albums you haven't heard much of before, having a physical copy at hand can make it easier to listen to them in certain cases. Burning CDs is also helpful if you want to show someone new music.


Notice that copying material and giving or selling without permission from the creator is illegal.

, This way, you'll be able to get some money back from your original investment in the collection.


Sites like eBay are perfect for selling large collections. You can either sell items individually or the entire collection. Selling items individually will give more profit since there are more buyers and much more competition, but the process of organizing and selling the items is more complex.Don't get your hopes up when it comes to making money off your collection. Because CDs aren't in such high demand anymore, you probably won't get more than a few dollars for each item, with exceptions made for rare discs.

, If you don't want to go through the trouble of handling money, you might transform your existing collection into an open gift for your circle of friends. Post up a list of what you have, and ask people what they might want from the pile. Set aside items that people are interested in and have already contacted you about them. Not only will this make sure that people are still getting enjoyment out of your old collection, it will boost your overall feeling of happiness and your reputation.


Keep in mind that the less desirable items in your collection might not get someone interested, even for free. If this is the case, you can even have it recycled, or ask someone to take them off your hands in exchange for giving them the better discs.

, Companies like 'Declutter' specialize in buying unwanted items and selling them at a markup cost. You can get rid of some or all of your collection this way.


For most of these outlets, the money you make on each item will depend on their rarity and desirability.

, If you don't want to sell or donate your CDs, check to see if a recycling center near you processes discs. If one does, you can take your collection over and have them take it off your hands.

, Buttons, sequins, pins, needles, thread etc. can all be arranged neatly in an ice cube container and slipped into the sewing basket.

, Mix up the cookie dough, then freeze and store pre-measured, but unbaked cookie dough in the compartments of the ice tray. Remove the cookie dough cubes for baking as needed.

, An ice cube tray represents a low-tech, old-school cash register that is more organized than a jar of change. Great for bazaars!

, Pierce a small hole in the base of each cube mold and presto, you have a seedling tray.

, Have your children create toys from them. Have an adult cut them into various shapes. Kids can then paint them, apply stickers or sequins to them, drawn on them, etc. and turned into a range of interesting pieces.

, If you are having a tasting party, these can make great containers for food items being tasted for comparison or quality.

, Beans are fun to watch and make great science projects, and small herbs like oregano and thyme look beautiful and smell wonderful.

Find two, clear plastic bottles that are the same size and shape.,
Take the caps off, glue them together, and let the glue dry.Draw a ring of glue around the top the first cap.,
Punch a hole through the middle of the glued-together caps.You can use an electric drill to do this, or a hammer and nail.,
Screw the cap onto the first bottle, just like you normally would.,
Make sure that the sand you are using is very dry.,
Start filling the second bottle with sand.,
Screw the empty bottle onto the sand-filled bottle.,
Test your sand timer.,
Make any necessary adjustments after the sand has finished flowing.,
Wrap some tape around the neck seam.,
Use your timer.,
Trace two large squares on a sheet of cardboard.,
Cut the squares out using a box cutter or craft knife.,
Find four wooden dowels that are the same height as your sand timer.,
Paint the cardboard and dowels and wait for the paint to dry.,
Glue the cardboard squares to the top and bottom of your sand timer, and let the glue dry.Cover the bottom of your sand timer with glue, and press it into the middle of the first cardboard square.,
Glue in the dowels between the cardboard squares.,
Decorate your finished sand timer further.",How to Make a Sand Timer from Recycled Plastic Bottles," The shorter the bottles are, the more stable your timer will be. For a more realistic hourglass, try to use bulb-shaped bottles, such as Method or Orangina.


Make sure that you take the labels off. Use soap and warm water to clean off any residue. Wipe the bottles clean with rubbing alcohol afterwards.;
, Be careful not to get any glue in the middle, or you won't be able to make the hole. Place the second cap on top of the glue. Make sure that the tops of both caps are touching. You should only see the underside/inside of each cap.


Use a strong glue, such as super glue or epoxy glue. Regular school glue or hot glue will not be strong enough.

, Experiment with different hole sizes. The larger the hole is, the faster the sand will flow through. The smaller the hole is, the slower the sand will flow through.If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.
Some caps have a plastic disk inside them. This can make drilling the hole difficult. Use a flat screwdriver to pop this disk out before you drill the hole.

, The only difference is that now, you will have a second cap on top of your bottle. Don't worry about this one just yet.

, If you use damp sand, the sand will clump up in your bottles. Even if you bought your sand from the store, it might be a good idea to spread it out on a baking sheet, and leave it out in the sun for 1 hour.


Try using colored sand. You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop.
Add some fine scrapbooking glitter to your sand to make it look more magical. Plain sand and gold glitter will look great together. White sand and iridescent glitter will also look pretty.

, If you don't care how long your sand timer takes, fill the bottle two-thirds of the way with sand. If you want your timer to run for a specific amount of time, then time yourself filling the bottle using a stopwatch.For example:


If you want your sand timer to last 1 minute, fill the bottle for 1 minute.

, Keep the sand-filled bottle on the table. Turn the empty bottle upside down. Align the cap with the neck of the sand-filled bottle. Screw the cap unto the bottle until it is tight.

, Turn your sand timer upside down. The sand should be flowing smoothly from one bottle to the next. If you have a specific amount of time for your timer in mind (such as 1 minute), pull out a stopwatch and stop timing it.


Be careful when handling your sand timer. The glue holding the caps together will not be very stable. Hold your timer by the seam/neck.

, Unscrew the bottles first, and keep the sand-filled one standing upright. If the sand is not flowing smoothly enough, make the hole larger. If the bottom bottle is taking too long to fill, empty out some sand. If the bottom bottle fills too quickly, you will need to add more sand. Once you have made the adjustments, screw the bottles back together.

, Once you are happy with your timer, you will need to secure the necks together. Get some sturdy tape, such as duct tape, and wrap it tightly around the necks of the bottle. Start at the bottom neck, work your way up past the seam, and finish at the top neck. You may want to do this a few times for extra durability.

, Turn your timer so that the empty bottle is on the bottom. When the sand flows all the way down, the time is up. Flip your timer over if you'd like to use it again.

, The squares need to be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) larger than the base of your bottle. Use a ruler to make the squares even.

, If you are a child making this project, ask an adult to help you with this step.

, If you need to, trim the dowels down. If you can't find any dowels, glue three wooden skewers together; this counts as one dowel. You will need 12 skewers total., You can use acrylic paint or spray paint. They can all be one color, or even different colors. Make sure that you paint the edges of your cardboard squares as well.

, Cover the top of your sand timer with glue, and press the other cardboard square on top.


You can use any type of thick glue for this: school glue, wood glue, hot glue, or epoxy.

, Place a drop of glue on the bottom of the first dowel. Press the dowel into the corner of the bottom square. Place a drop of glue on top of the dowel, and slide it under the top square. Make sure that the dowel is as straight as possible. Repeat this step for the other three dowels., You can leave your sand timer plain, or you can decorate it further. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Wrap some ribbon around the dowels.
Cover the edges of the cardboard squares with glitter glue.
Draw designs on the top and bottom cardboard square using glitter glue. Let the glue dry before you do the other side.
Glue one some plastic rhinestones or jewels along the dowels.
Add on some glow-in-the-dark star stickers on the top and bottom cardboard squares.

Finished.

",How to Turn a Plastic Soda Bottle Into a Coin Purse," Use clear ones for a basic, go-with-anything look or feel free to use a colored bottle if it's likely to match your usual clothes. Things to consider when choosing the bottles:


If you do think of changing the sizing of the bottles suggested here, at least keep the sizes of the bottles the same, to avoid mismatching and be aware that the zipper size will also be impacted by any size change.






Make sure the bottoms are new and not damaged. This will ensure the purse closely snugly, as well as looking decent when completed.





;
, The supplies needed are listed below. When purchasing the items, consider how you'll decorate the purse as this will impact what you purchase or find from the craft box. There are lots of possibilities such as:


Decide if your coin purse will have a “personality.” Give your purse a face using googly eyes, a big felt smile and fake hair.






Bedazzle your purse with fake jewels, rhinestones, charms and other dazzling elements.






Paint the purse. In this case, either paint additional designs over an initial coat of paint or stick additional decorations over the painted surface.







, Empty and clean the bottles by filling with warm water and sloshing around a little mild dish detergent. This will lift off any sticky soda residue. Allow the bottle to dry, tipped on its side for a few hours.

, Hold the bottle on its side on a non-slip surface (such as a silicon mat). Keeping your precious fingers well out of the way, cut or saw off the base of each bottle. Cut more rather than less, as you can always shape it down but you can't add more back once cut. Try to cut each base the same height; you might need to mark each bottle to manage this evenly. Take care when cutting!


Trim off any rough edges or jagged pieces using sharp scissors. A nail file is handy to smooth rough parts that won't improve with cutting.







, To do this:

Measure the circumference of the cut base to check that the zipper is the right length (it should be if you used the measurements in this tutorial––if not, get a different zipper that will fit).






Cut two lengths of paper the same height as the bottle base, long enough to wrap right around each base without overlap. Make sure the lengths are dead straight on at least one side of the length.






On the dead straight side of this length, mark evenly spaced holes the entire length, about 1⁄2 centimeter (0.2 in) from the edge. You could follow a ruler or rule a straight line for exactness or use your instinct if you're good with this sort of thing. (A ruled line is easiest, especially for the direction-challenged crafter.) Repeat for the second paper length.






This is now your sewing guide for the zipper.







, Wrap the guide around each base, with the dotted line edge flush with the top of each bottle base. Don't overlap it––tape it together exactly where it joins. Check that it is straight––if crooked, your zipper sewing will also be crooked!

, If this is tough on your hands, you can hold the needle with a small pair of jewelry pliers or wear lightweight leather gloves to stop chafing. A thimble can also be helpful for the powerful shove that you'll need to give the needle through the plastic each hole. Once completed, pull away the paper patterns. The bottle bases are now ready to have the zipper stitched in place.

, Although this may seem like a daunting task, the prepared holes will actually make it a lot easier than faster than you might expect. To do this:


Unzip the zipper.






Assess how comfortable it feels to work with the zipper free or whether you need it to be supported (in the same fashion as pinning fabric pre-sewing). If you find the zipper difficult to hold while stitching at the same time, consider attaching the zipper in place around each base using adhesive tape. Be sure that no part of the zipper has wrinkled though––you want a smooth finish.






Thread the same needle used to poke the holes through the plastic. Embroidery floss is probably the best pick for this, although you could use woolen yarn, twine, etc. provided it fits through the holes and needle's eye.






Start sewing 7.5""/3 centimeter (1.2 in) from the start of the zipper. Sew around the first bottom, then do the same for the next bottle base.






Overlap the fabric end of the zipper on each bottle base.







, Once you're happy with it, you have the option of decorating it (see suggestions above). Otherwise, it's good to go as is.

PETE Plastics


Polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) plastics used in soda and water bottles, polybags, medicine containers, and other common consumer product containers are easiest and the most common plastics to recycle.,
HDPE Plastics


HDPE or High Density Polyethylene plastics are used in heavier containers that hold Mobil, refined oil, milk, etc.,
Plastics numbered 3 or above are hard to recycle and acceptable at very few recycling centres.,
Recycling common items.",How to Curb the Use of Plastics in Day to Day Life2," Once recycled, PETE plastics can be used as fibrefill in winter coats, sleeping bags, and life jackets. They can also be used to make bean bags, rope, car bumpers, tennis ball felt, combs, cassette tapes, sails for boats, furniture, and of course other plastic bottles.
When you buy a PETE plastic packed article you can sell it after use to the government or private recycling centres, like selling a plastic bottle with labels on it will help the environment and earn money at the same time.

, They are hugely acceptable at recycling centres and are recycled into pipes, toys, plastic lumber, etc.

, These plastics include sandwich bags, baby bottle nipples, medical tubing, etc.

,


Cellular Phones - Mobile phones contain toxic substances, so sending them to landfills is not a safe option. It is estimated that recycling a cell phone can earn you around $200.







Printer Cartridges - Printer cartridges are easily recycled by simply refilling them. Never send used printer cartridges to landfills.







Batteries - Batteries constitute a huge chunk of toxic wastes and are pretty hard to recycle. Using non-lead batteries in cars and rechargeable batteries in gadgets is one way to control toxic pollution.







"
"
You can use modified plastic containers as dustbins or plant pots and other creative ideas.

,
Plastic rubbish can be used as foot covers for various metallic or wooden furniture as they are corrosion proof.

,
Plastic Bottle caps are not acceptable in many recycling centres so one way to use it is using it in craft works.

Use a BPA-free bottle.,
Determine whether your bottle was meant for reuse.,
Wash your bottle thoroughly.,
Dry your bottle.",How to Reuse Empty Water Bottles1," If you plan on refilling your empty water bottle to drink from it again, using a BPA-free bottle is your safest bet. Water bottles are made from a variety of plastics, and these plastics, like BPA, can leach. Exposure to BPA has been linked with diabetes and cardiovascular disease in humans.A more suitable alternative for a refillable water bottle would be a stainless steel or glass bottle. These do not leach.;
, A bottle meant for reuse will typically have a wide opening that will allow you to clean the bottle easily.Refrain from drinking from a refilled, disposable plastic water bottle. Disposable plastic bottles are hard to clean, so they can easily host bacterial growth. They also contain chemicals which could cause cancer or reproductive health problems., You should use hot soapy water to clean your bottle. Do this at least every two days to minimize bacterial contamination. As long as you clean your bottle, you should not have to worry about chemicals from a non-BPA bottle leaching into your water., Let your bottle air dry. You can also use a dishwasher to dry your refillable water bottle as long as the bottle does not contain BPA, since heat will increase the rate at which chemicals leach from the plastic."

Make an Earring Holder.,
Design a candle holder.,
Make candy dishes or desk organizers.,
Create food containers.,
Make a watering can.",How to Reuse Empty Water Bottles2," Glue the bottle caps together with a hot glue gun into a design of your choosing, like a flower or a star. Then, use a small nail and a hammer to punch two holes in each cap. A ball-point pen, if pressed hard enough into the plastic, can also be used to create holes in the caps. Secure the hooks of the earrings in the holes.


Never leave a hot glue gun unattended, especially if you have children or pets.

, Cut the base of a 2-liter empty water bottle with a utility knife and fill it up to the top with sand, pebbles, or gemstones. Nestle a small votive candle in the middle of this container for your personalized candle holder., This works best with a 1 liter water bottle. All you have to do is cut off the bottom of the bottle with a utility knife so that the bottom is only an inch or two tall. Line the part you cut with felt so that you don’t accidentally cut yourself with the sharp plastic, and decorate away. Fill the dish with candy or with office supplies like push pins or rubber bands., This works best with a 1 liter water bottle. To turn your empty water bottles into food containers, simply take two bottles of different heights and cut them through the middle with a utility knife. Then, fill up the longer base with rice, beans, sugar, or any non-perishable food and cover it with the base of the other bottle.You can cut water bottles with scissors or a utility knife. Keep a steady grip on the bottle and rotate it slowly. Be careful not to injure yourself.

, This will work best with a larger bottle that has a handle, such as a gallon bottle. All you have to do is poke about 10-15 holes in the bottle cap, fill up the bottle with water, and tightly seal the cap. You can use a nail and a hammer to make the holes."

Create a plastic bottle cap mosaic.,
Make a flower vase.,
Make plastic light covers.",How to Reuse Empty Water Bottles3," First, choose a design you would like to create. Then, collect bottle caps. Most water bottle caps are white, so you can paint them different colors to have variety. The last step will be to glue the caps to a large sheet of paper. Hang the design where you wish for a colorful decoration., This is a great way to decorate your home, and it also makes for a fantastic DIY gift. To create a flower vase, cut off the top part of the bottle with a utility knife. Glue colorful wrapping paper, white paper, or felt to the bottom half. Decorate the bottom with stickers, markers, or other supplies if you wish. Fill the bottle up with water and place flowers inside.

, These can illuminate your home or backyard in fun ways and are relatively easy to create. To make these, simply cut off the bottom portions of several (5-10) empty 1 liter water bottles with scissors or a utility knife. Paint the top halves of the bottles with acrylic or transparent glass paint or decorate with washi tape in a design of your choice. Remove the caps and slip the bulbs of string lights into the bottle openings, one bulb per bottle. Using the knife, poke a small hole near the opening and pass craft wire through it. Twist the craft wire with the string light wire to hold the light in place."

Create a “bristle bot.” Attach your toothbrush’s head (removed from the “stick” of the toothbrush) to a vibrating pager motor and watch as it crawls around.",How to Reuse Old Toothbrushes," If your toothbrush is beginning to fray at the edges, it is no longer fit to brush teeth, and is ready for a new life. Fraying means that the outer edges of the bristles have splayed outward. If the bristles have only a slight outward curve, your toothbrush probably still has some life as a toothbrush left in it., Some toothbrushes are equipped with a small line (usually blue) that will gradually fade and disappear as the lifespan of your toothbrush deteriorates. If your toothbrush has a fading line to indicate when it is time to be replaced, pay attention and set it aside for other uses once this line has disappeared.

, While reusing old toothbrushes is wonderful, your mouth is known for harboring quite a lot of bacteria. Before reusing a toothbrush, make sure you submerge it in boiling water for 3-5 minutes to sanitize it.Stick around while your toothbrush boils; plastic can break down quickly, and you don’t want to come back to a mess of melted plastic.
If you are not comfortable boiling your toothbrush, you can also run it through a dishwashing cycle.

, Just as you would with a toothbrush for your teeth, make sure your old toothbrushes are dry before giving them a new purpose; if they are left wet, mold and bacteria are invited to grow. Drying a toothbrush is simple. All you have to do is store it in an upright position and allow the water to drain from the bristles.Because you are not using the toothbrush on your teeth, you could expedite the process by first drying the bristles with a towel or cloth.

, To avoid mixing up your cleaning toothbrush with one you are currently using for oral health, label your toothbrush. You can make a mark with a permanent marker on the back of it, or place it inside of your cleaning supply bucket--just make sure it is clear that the brush should not be used in your mouth.

, Whether it is the grout surrounding your kitchen sink or the metal stopper in your bathroom sink, toothbrushes are excellent for cleaning small, hard-to-reach areas such as grout lines, seals, and the crevices of sinks and faucets.When you clean grout and sealant, take care not to press down too hard; toothbrush bristles can be extremely coarse, so pressing down too hard risks removing sealant and grout. Aim for firm but gentle pressure.

, Toothbrushes are a great way to scrub stains and spots with a bit of spray cleaner or detergent. Simply spray or pour your cleaner onto the spot, and gently scrub in circular motions with your toothbrush.It is particularly important that you make sure your toothbrush is clean before taking on this particular reuse, as depositing any debris onto a stain will make the stain worse. Before using, make sure no dirt or debris has accumulated.
This upcycle is better for soft-bristled brushes, as hard bristles could snag or otherwise damage fabric.

, Your computer screen and keyboard need regular cleaning to function properly. With your computer turned off, run a dry toothbrush over and in between each of your computer keys, then gently tease the dirt and debris from the corners of your computer’s screen.Do not press too hard, as toothbrush bristles are quite firm and could scratch your screen if you are not careful.

, Rather than going out and purchasing a dedicated vegetable brush, use your old toothbrush! It is small enough to get into the crevices of items like apples, while broad enough to make long strokes against larger vegetables such as potatoes.


This use is best for fruits and vegetables with tough skin, such as apples, squash, and carrots. Softer-skinned fruits and vegetables might tear or bruise.

, Toothbrushes are the perfect size and shape to get into all of the nooks and crannies of your cheese grater. Keep an old toothbrush by your sink, and pull it out when your grater needs a helping hand., Using a toothbrush, you can remove debris from the vent of your hair dryer, keep your brow brush is good shape, and keep your hairbrush free of extra hair and dirt.If you are using your toothbrush for beauty products, be sure to clean the brush in between uses, as you don’t want to transfer bacteria or debris to your eyes or skin.

, Baseboard can be difficult to clean, as a rag often seems to leave a lot of dirt behind. Using a toothbrush, make broad, smooth strokes across the top of your baseboard (either with soapy water or without, depending on how difficult the dirt is) for clean, dust-free walls., Cars have countless tiny crevices in need of some extra help. You can keep your head and tail lights sparkling clean using a toothbrush and some soapy water, or you can keep your dashboard, music player, and speedometer all looking shiny and new.If your headlights are particularly dirty, you can use toothpaste and a toothbrush to remove some of the grime.
When cleaning your dash, use a dry toothbrush versus a wet one, as there are delicate electrical components that should not get wet within the dash.

, Metal items have a way of trapping dirt and residue--especially metal items with small, hard-to-reach crevices. Using a toothbrush, however, you can polish your metals until they look brand new.Using baking soda, water, and a toothbrush, you can remove old dirt and oil stains.
Toothbrushes are excellent at cleaning bike chains, as well.

, Planting a garden? Break or cut off the bristled end of the toothbrush, write or paint the names of the plants you are sowing, and place your markers in the soil. This way, you’ve reused an old toothbrush, and you’ve identified each of your plants.


If you are leery of plastic in your soil, you can either use bamboo or wooden toothbrushes, or you can attach the toothbrushes to the outside of your garden bed in the same order as your plants.

, Although gallon and larger paint cans warrant the use of a full-sized stirring stick, sample-sized cans, and quarter-gallon cans don’t do as well using a full-sized stick. Toothbrushes make excellent paint stirring tools for small cans.


Make sure you either remove the bristle first, or hold the bristle in your palm as you stir. Placing the bristle into the paint may result in wasted paint, as it would become trapped in the bristles.

, Left wholly intact, an old toothbrush can double as a backscratcher, as the bristles are firm enough to provide consistent, steady contact to ease the irritation of an itch.


If your brush is going to be used in this way, make sure it is cleaned or sanitized regularly, as contact with skin could result in bacterial growth on the bristles.

, If you are an artist or you love to paint, you can use a toothbrush to introduce a new and unique texture into your work using your toothbrush as a paintbrush. This can be done with watercolors and acrylics.,


You can take this one step further and create a large-scale needle by sharpening the end furthest from the hole.

, You could even make several bots, and conduct races with your friends or family."

Choose foods that are naturally low in phthalates.,
Avoid foods known to be very high in phthalates.,

Store food in plastic containers that have the 2, 4, or 5 recycling codes on them.,
Avoid heating or cooking food in plastic.,
Read the labels on all items.,
Check out EWG's Skin Deep Database.,
Only purchase items with natural fragrances.,
Be careful with baby bottles.",How to Avoid Phthalates," In all the studies that were done on foods, scientists were able to determine a specific list of foods that are low in phthalates. These are foods you should focus on in your diet to help you reduce your exposure to this chemical.Dairy products like low-fat milk and yogurt have low levels of phthalates as do eggs. Avoid high fat foods such as creams, whole milk, and fatty meats as much as possible.
Among the grain group, pasta, rice and noodles consistently ranked lower in phthalates.
In conventional fruits and vegetables, phthalates levels were very low; however, this is not true for conventional canned fruits, vegetables and pickles. Avoid canned or processed foods.
Bottled water and other canned/bottled beverages were found to have low levels of phthalates.
Although these foods are found to have low levels of phthalates, they are not completely free of them.;
, In addition to focusing more on foods that are lower in phthalate levels, it's best to be aware of the foods that have high levels.Stay away from these foods to reduce your overall exposure:


Studies have shown that phthalates were detectable at high levels in beef, poultry and pork. Specifically in poultry, levels were high in the skin. A few studies showed the phthalate level was lower in frozen meat and poultry.High levels of phthalates were detected in fats like butter, margarine, cooking oils and animal fats (like lard).
Dairy items like heavy cream, ice cream and cheese had high to very high levels of phthalates.

, Studies have also shown that phthalates are particularly high in some packaged foods. Try to avoid these foods, especially for children, as you may be surprised at the concentration levels of phthalates.Studies have shown that children get exposed to the highest concentration of phthalates from common packaged goods.Since these chemicals have serious effects on infants and children, its important to avoid these foods.
Scientist believe that part of the reason packaged foods in particular are so high in phthalates is that these chemicals are already present in the food in addition to the packaging. The phthalates can be transferred from the packaging to the food itself.
Try to avoid packaged and processed foods (like cereals, crackers, and even infant formula). Make your own versions of you and your child's favorite items from scratch at home.

, Since studies have shown that phthalates are unfortunately found in many foods, the best way to avoid this chemical may be by purchasing and eating 100% organic items.100% organic foods are strictly monitored by the USDA. The farmers and manufactures have to follow a very specific set of guidelines to make sure foods are not exposed to a variety of different pesticides or chemicals — including phthalates.Since many synthetic pesticides that are sprayed onto fruits and vegetables contain phthalates, make sure to look for produce that's labeled 100% organic.
Also consider purchasing 100% organic dairy and meat products. Phthalates seem to be attracted to fat and are found in high quantities in dairy products and meat products; however, DEHP, a toxic phthalate, has been found in certified organic dairy products.This may be because, even on small farms, milk is collected from cow's udders using plastic tubing., Not surprisingly, phthalates are also found in water. Since we cook with water and regularly drink it, it's important to find a method of removing or reducing the amount of phthalates in water.


Studies have shown that phthalates can be removed from drinking water by filtration with a water filter or filtering system.A basic water filtration device — like a water pitcher or a twist-on for your faucet — should be able to remove most phthalates from your drinking water.
However, some claim that they cannot remove all phthalates. A nano filtration system, which is more expensive, can remove all phthalates from your drinking water.

, Since phthalates are in high concentrations in plastic bottles, it's important to avoid using plastic bottles when transporting water or other liquids.Consider looking for BPA-free and phthalate-free reusable water bottles. Many of these water bottles are now made in stainless steel which is a great alternative.
Also, make sure you do not heat up plastic water bottles or put hot liquid into plastic bottles.
Other options include containers made of ceramic, glass, or wood to hold and store food and water instead of plastic.
If you need to buy bottled water, look for one that distinctly says phthalate-free on the label or use your own filtered water.

, There is a neat little trick to make sure the plastic item you're using is indeed, phthalate-free. Make sure to review the whole package to look for these special codes.There is a little triangle label on all plastic items. Many times, this is found on the bottom or side of the item. For example, it's typically listed on the bottom of plastic water bottles.
If you see numbers like 3, 6, or 7 listed, this product contains phthalates. Do not purchase this, use this or drink from it.
If the numbers listed are 2, 4, or 5, then you can be certain this plastic container or bottle does not contain any BPA or phthalates.
You may also want to consider using glass or porcelain food storage containers instead. This takes the guesswork out of finding a phthalate-free container.

, Phthalates and even BPA that are found in plastic containers or bottles can leach into foods or beverages at higher concentrations when they're heated. Avoid heating up these types of plastics.Take foods out of plastic containers they come in from the store when you get home. Repackage them into phthalate-free containers or cook them immediately.
Purchase food storage containers that do not contain phthalates or use porcelain containers to store foods.
Do not heat up foods in plastic tupperware or other plastic containers — don't place plastic in the microwave or oven. Take the foods out and put them on a plate to heat up.
Also avoid using plastic wrap to cover and store foods. Use aluminum foil or put foods in a phthalate-free storage container.

, Whether you're buying make-up or laundry detergent, it's important to read the labels on these items. You may be able to figure out whether or not they contain phthalates.


Although companies are not required to list phthalates, many companies do promote when they do not use phthalates. Look for wording that says ""phthalate-free"" on your products.
Also look for wording like ""synthetic fragrance"" as these are sure to contain phthalates., Phthalates are very widespread and found in many foods, plastic products, cosmetics and other household items. This can make it difficult to figure out how to avoid them. However, the EWG's Skin Deep Database is a useful resource to help you figure out where these harmful chemicals may be hiding.This website reviews a variety of chemicals including phthalates and lists what they are, what they're used for, products that contain them and possible side effects from exposure to them.Take a look at this website to see what products you use or currently own that are listed as containing phthalates.
Also review the list of items that are phthalate free. You can use this to replace products you've previously purchased that did contain this harmful chemical.

, An easy way to avoid phthalates when it comes to scented items, is to choose natural or fragrance-free items. This will help limit your exposure to phthalates.Look for wording like: ""made with only essential oils"" or ""non-synthetic fragrance."" These will not contain phthalates.
Also consider purchasing items that are fragrance-free. Soap bars, hand soap, body wash and lotions can be purchased without any fragrance.

, One of the most important places to avoid phthalates (and BPA as well) are baby bottles, pacifiers, teethers and other plastic items. You do not want your child being exposed to high levels of these harmful chemicals.Although a law passed in 2009 has banned some types of phthalates from baby products, if you have older toys or products or are getting hand-me-downs, they could still contain some of these chemicals.
Glass bottles are recommended for infants and babies that cannot feed themselves yet.
Also, consider using silicone bottle nipples. The plastic and latex nipples do contain phthalates and shouldn't be used to feed your child.
Read the labels on all other plastic products your child may come into contact with. Look for phthalate and BPA-free.

Done.",How to Make a Felt Treasure Box from a Baby Wipes Box," If you are pink-happy, then choose a range of pinks. If you're into blues and greens, then err on the side of those hues.;
, It can be as simple as sticking plain felt panels to the box but for something more interesting, add layers and objects in different colors of felt. Some ideas include:

A beachside scene: Blue background with yellow sand, shell designs, a beach umbrella and a beach ball






A nature scene: Green grass, blue sky, a tree, some birds, a squirrel and a pond with ducks






A floral theme: Pink background with purple and orange flowers placed here and there






A car theme: A red background with cars in blue and yellow dotted here and there






And so forth!

, These are the background pieces of felt that cover the entirety of the box edges and lid. Measure the lid and side edges, then transfer this to paper. Cut out templates for the felt.

, If you're adding anything else, such as geometric shapes, animals, trees, beach balls, etc., draw these on the paper first, then cut out the templates.

, Use pins to keep the paper templates in place.

, Set aside to use shortly.


If you want the backing to have fancy edges, use pinking shears or decorative edged scissors.

, Set aside to use shortly.

If the designs have layers, pin them together for now, so as not to lose any of the pieces.







, Place glue on the box and a little on the felt, then press each piece in place, covering both the lid and the sides of the box.


Adjust as needed while the glue is still wet; straighten up any crooked edges.
Let dry before proceeding.

, Depending on your original design plan, place the design pieces wherever you wish them to be.


For example, you might have a flower in one corner of the lid and in a corner of each side panel.
Let dry.

, Although you could leave this part of the box bare, it is nice to dress it up too. Ribbon, braid, lace or yarn could be glued around the lid edge, in a complementary color.


Let dry before using.

, This step is optional but is ideal if you want it known to whom the box belongs or what it contains. Simply cut out a small geometric shape (square, rectangle, circle, etc.) in another color of felt. Write a person's or item's name on this using a fabric pen (use dots if it's hard to write on the felt), then glue in place on the lid or front side of the box.

, The felt treasure box is now ready for use.

Examine plastic products for labeling.,
Identify polycarbonate products.,
Discard older plastic products.,
Choose non-plastic food and beverage containers.,
Limit the use of high heat or harsh cleaning with plastics.,
Find plastics alternatives for products that make mouth contact.,
Worry more about cavities than possible BPA in your dental sealants and composites.,
Learn more about BPA.,
Weigh both sides of the debate over BPA safety.,
Question whether BPA-free plastics are necessarily safer.",How to Choose Safe BPA Free Plastics," Many plastic products, and especially those used for food or drink or children’s toys, contain a number label that can tell you if they contain BPA. Look on the bottom of the product for a number from one to seven (1-7) surrounded by a triangle made of three arrows (commonly known as the “recycling symbol”).Items with numbers 3, 6, and especially 7 are most likely to contain BPA. Items with 1, 2, 4, or 5 generally do not contain BPA.
A “BPA free” label on the product or packaging, in combination with one of the “safer” recycling numbers, is your safest bet for avoiding BPA.;
, BPA is used to provide some “give” to rigid plastics in order to reduce cracking and breaking, and rigid plastics are usually made of polycarbonates. If the plastic item has a recycling number “7” and/or has the marking “PC,” it is a polycarbonate and more likely to contain BPA.If a plastic product is rigid and transparent — for instance, a reusable food storage container — the odds are good that it is a polycarbonate that may contain BPA.
Softer, flexible, and opaque plastics are usually not polycarbonates and less likely to contain BPA. But always look for labeling.

, BPA has been in use since the late 1950s, so there’s a distinct possibility that your childhood “sippy cup” or your grandma’s vintage plastic food storage containers contain BPA. Older products are less likely to have identifying labeling as well.


Many people are particularly concerned about BPA exposure in babies. BPA was banned in baby bottles and kids’ sippy cups by the FDA in the U.S. in 2012, and earlier in Europe. If you have older plastic baby bottles, assume they have BPA and discard them.Scratches, general wear and tear, and repeated heat exposure cause the release of greater amounts of BPA from plastic products. This is another reason to consider discarding older, well-used products that may contain BPA., Before the widespread adoption of plastic, everything from baby bottles to mixing bowls was typically made of materials like glass, ceramic, and stainless steel. As concerns over BPA and other chemicals in plastics has grown, so too has the market for food and beverage products made from these alternate containers, which do not leach potentially harmful materials.If even BPA-free baby bottles concern you, for instance, there are newer glass options that include a silicone sleeve on the outside to limit the chance of shattering.
Be aware, however, that many metal cans used for foods and beverages (like beans and beer) contain a lining resin that contains BPA. Regular consumption of food from such containers does appear to at least temporarily increase blood BPA levels.Cans usually have no markings indicating the use (or absence) of BPA linings, but you can find lists of manufacturers that at least claim not to use BPA., Even if your plastic products are advertised as “microwave safe” or “dishwasher safe,” high temperatures weaken the plastic and facilitate the release of chemicals like BPA. Harsh chemicals or scouring and scrubbing that causes scratches can cause the same issue.If you want to limit possible BPA exposure: Use microwave-safe glass or ceramic dishes to reheat foods in the microwave. Don’t put hot foods or beverages directly into plastic containers. Wash plastic items by hand, with gentle soap, warm water, and non-abrasive brushes or rags. Discard scratched, discolored, faded, or misshapen plastics, or plastic food containers that have been in use for long periods of time.

, Especially if you have small children around, you know that food and beverage containers aren’t the only plastics that make mouth contact. Sucking, chewing, or — yes — swallowing plastic items like teethers and toys can possibly cause BPA exposure.Once again, the increased public concern about what may lurk in their plastics has lead to a resurgence of baby items, toys, and other products made of traditional, non-plastic materials. Untreated, uncoated wood blocks are just as much fun as plastic ones.
Especially for small children, look for toys made of uncoated wood, cotton, wool, etc. Try a frozen washcloth as a baby teether instead of using plastic. Don’t let your small child chew on TV remotes, cell phones, etc.

, BPA is not used directly in dental sealants or composites, but it can occur as a trace material left over from the manufacturing process or be created in minute amounts by the degradation of other materials in the sealants. All evidence indicates that any BPA exposure will be temporary (usually less than three hours) and 50,000 times below the threshold for an acute exposure event.The bottom line, at least as far as the current research indicates: You may well be exposed to minute amounts of BPA for a short period after having dental work done. However, the demonstrated health risks of leaving cavities or other dental problems untreated should far outweigh concerns about trace amounts of BPA.

, Without getting into a chemistry lesson here, it is perhaps sufficient to say that bisphenol-A (BPA) is an industrial chemical additive. It adds flexible strength to a wide range of polycarbonate plastics, as well as epoxy resins in items like can coatings and dental sealants.Unfortunately, when ingested in sufficient quantities, BPA has also been shown to be a “hormone disruptor” that mimics estrogen.The real questions are “How bad is BPA for us?”, and “How much BPA is needed to cause potentially negative effects?”

, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is clear on the issue: “current approved uses of BPA in food containers and packaging are safe.” And, just to be extra clear: “Is BPA safe? Yes.”Basically, the FDA (and plastics manufacturers) contend that while BPA can cause health problems, the amount you can ingest from products is far below the threshold for concern.


Anti-BPA campaigners and some researchers are not so sure about that, however. Because BPA mimics the hormone estrogen, they claim, even smaller amounts can impact brain, behavioral, and reproductive development, especially in fetuses, infants, and small children. BPA exposure may also have links to obesity and possibly even some cancers.Basically, anti-BPA advocates contend, BPA is not approved by the FDA because it has been proven “safe”; it has simply “not been proven unsafe” to a degree sufficient to convince the organization.

, In response to consumer pressure, many plastics manufacturers have rushed to remove BPA from their products. Often, BPA is replaced by bisphenol-S (BPS) or similar chemicals. Unfortunately, there is growing evidence that BPS (and other similar chemicals) may also cause similar effects on the human body as BPA.One study of 455 plastic products found that nearly all of them, including those labeled “BPA-free,” had some amount of estrogen-mimicking chemicals inside.
Basically, if you believe that you should be legitimately concerned about BPA and avoid it, you should probably try to limit your contact with all plastics (especially polycarbonate plastics). Again, study the issue and make the best decision for yourself and your family.

Find any old or new cheap, clear plastic toothbrushes.,
You will need boiling hot water to heat the toothbrush to a soft stage.,
If you boil your water in the microwave, be aware that it may not bubble like it would on a stove.,
While you're waiting for the water to boil, cut the bristles as short as you can, or pulling the bristles out with needle-nosed pliers works very well too.

,
When the water is bubbling rapidly remove it from the microwave or off the stove burner.,

To prevent being burnt pick up the toothbrush using the dish towel.,
Fill a bowl with ice water.,
The bristle holes will widen in the heat, so now you can use tweezers to pluck out the bristles.

,
Enjoy wearing your new toothbrush bracelet!

",How to Make a Toothbrush Bracelet," The ones with patterns for little kids work great. It's better if they are all plastic, and there is no rubber gripping. It should also be about the same width from the top to bottom. Thicker toothbrushes don't bend as easily.;
, Boil water in the microwave or put a half a pot of water on the stove and turn it on. Make sure that when you boil the water you leave the toothbrush in there for 8-12 minutes. You may need to leave it in for a longer period of time depending on how hot the water is and the thickness of the toothbrush.

, If that is the case stay clear of the water and let it cool down, as it is very hot and may explode if bothered. Put a chopstick or other wooden item in the cup to 'break' the water up. This way it will not 'explode'.

,, Drop in the toothbrush. Wait until the plastic starts to soften. This will take more or less time depending on how wide your toothbrush gets at the end, but 5 minutes is a good ""base"" time to work from.

, Let it cool from boiling hot to warm, but don't let it cool off completely.

, Bend it into the shape of a bracelet. An easy way to do this is to press it around the outside of a glass or jar with the same diameter as you want your bracelet to be.

, Slip off the toothbrush and submerge it. After about 5 seconds, the plastic will be hard again, and you can try it on. If it doesn't fit, or it doesn't look right, put it back into the hot water for a minute, repeat the shaping steps until it turns out the way you want it.

Line A Cloak.",How to Reuse Old Shower Curtains," Put the shower curtain through a cold, gentle wash cycle to remove soap scum and mold. To use less water, you can also try soaking the shower curtain in a bleach solution, then scrubbing it with a brush as needed. A moldy shower curtain will not store well and can easily infect other items. Hang out to dry.


An easy way to clean your dirty shower curtain is to run it through the washing machine with small and soft items like hand towels, wash cloths, socks, etc. Use cool water and plenty of soap and agitation. After the spin cycle, remove the shower curtain and re-spin the cloth items to remove trapped water. (The little items will ""scrub"" away the soap scum and residue, leaving a nicely clean plastic liner.) Allow to air dry before storing, as stated above.
After doing this, you may also want to consider re-using the shower curtain. If it looks worn, you can cover it up with a fabric shower curtain.;
, Old shower curtains make excellent drop cloths for quick decorating fixes and for small decorating jobs. Lay down the shower curtain to catch paint drips, sawdust shavings, drilled masonry dust etc.

, Lay down the shower curtain on the floor, then place newspapers on top. Let your little ones enjoy their finger painting on top of the paper, and you can rest easy in the knowledge that paint seeping through the paper is caught by the shower curtain layer underneath.

, During summer, peg down the shower curtain on a small slope in the garden. Run the hose down it and have the kids slide down for some homemade water fun. Naturally, only do this if you live in an area that allows use of water in this way.

, If you have a cane chair or a special teak chair that you wish to protect from the rain, a shower curtain is likely to be just the right size. Wrap the furniture item and tuck underneath the legs or base of the item if possible. String or elastic ties can also be added to prevent it blowing off.

, A plastic shower curtain can make a useful barbecue cover if you don't have a customized one. Be careful it doesn't look too tacky when the guests appear for a barbecue though! (This also works for covering the lawn mower to protect it from the weather.)

, Create collages from the curtain if it has delightful images on it. Cut out the images and glue them onto the canvas of your choice using appropriate craft glue. Canvases might include cork boards, painting canvas, cardboard, paper, a wall space etc. You might even be able to use cut out pictures and patterns from your shower curtain like stickers in your scrapbook!

, If there is a sewing pattern you like to use but don't like using the paper pattern pieces or want to make it last longer make plastic cut-outs of the pattern pieces. Lay your pattern pieces out on the shower curtain and pin them to the curtain (so they don't slide out of place), then using a large marker or Sharpie outline the pieces and any notations you need, then just cut them out. Unpin the tissue pattern pieces and fold them up for safekeeping and the plastic pieces fold up easily into a large Ziploc plastic bag for storage. They unfold without wrinkles or ripping as easily as the originals. Make sure you have all the pieces and any notations you need (writing them on a piece of paper for each piece and sticking it in the baggie is useful) and write the name of the pattern on the Ziploc.

, Carefully cut strips in the curtain and hang it above a garage or shed door to discourage the entry of flies and other insects into a workspace area. You could also do this at the back door but it might spoil the look of the house to do this; it really depends on how nice your old shower curtain is!

, Next time you are at an outdoor event and want to sit on the grass, put down the shower curtain, then the blanket on top. The shower curtain keeps ground moisture from coming through your blanket.

, Pesky spills and chemicals can be quickly caught and wiped off before staining the driveway or garage floor.

, You now have a changing room (unless your shower curtain is clear!) or a small bathing room.

, Try using it as a tarp for a tent.

, When you water your plants the moisture will stay in the soil instead of soaking into the wood.

, Go solo or have several people sitting in line like on a toboggan. Have the front person pull some of the curtain up over their feet.

, You might want to do some cutting to fit, or just bunch up the excess and fill in spaces, if needed. Those bungee-like straps with a hook on each end can be used to wrap around to hold the cover in place; it might take two or three to do it, depending on the size of the unit. Or you can use duct tape to hold where the straps aren't practical. The covers are probably good for one season and then use another the next year, when you decide it's once again time for a new shower curtain. If you tuck and fold carefully, and if the shower curtain doesn't have a giveaway design, you can make these look like they were made especially for the purpose of covering the AC.

, An old shower curtain makes an excellent, inexpensive mattress protector for a child who is being toilet trained. Simply place it under the bed sheets. You will still have to wash the sheets, but the bed itself will remain dry, and there is little to no chance that it can cause any form of choking, as it would be covered by the bed sheets.

, A shower curtain can be used as a waterproof, windproof second lining for a cloak or simple coat. Simply sew the shower curtain in between the outer layer and the fabric lining .

, After washing it out to remove residues of milk using hot, soapy water, rinse thoroughly to remove all soap. Then, let it dry before proceeding.


If milk residues are stuck on the sides, scrub off gently.
Peel off labels or stickers from the jug. Either scrape the label from the plastic jug or use hot soapy water and a scrubbing pad to gently remove it.

, Depending on how large you want your planter mouth to be, cut either a tighter or larger opening at the neck of the jug or just below it. To cut, use the end of the scissors to stab into the side of the jug before cutting. Once the scissors have a hold, cut around the jug. Cut to remove the top completely. Although you could cut straight around you could also create a wave pattern or even an up and down pattern around the top of the jug.


Make sure you are closer to the top of the jug opening so you leave enough room to hold the soil.
It might help to mark the are you wish to cut around the jug, to have an easy-to-follow line.

, Using scissors, poke small holes in the bottom of the jug. This will allow for drainage and keeps the plant healthy. Poke three to five small holes underneath––enough for drainage but not too large so that soil drops out of the bottom.

, While this is optional, it's a chance to be creative or to hand it over to the kids for some garden decorating fun. Get as creative as you wish when decorating your milk jug. You could even “bling” out your jug using faux jewels or cover the jug with fake money for fun. Use tempera paint for the best application if you plan to paint it or you could add on with papier-mâché. Perhaps create an animal face and then paint it.


Use care if applying charms or other items using a hot glue gun. Hot glue and plastic may slightly warp or bend, so use the minimal amount of glue if you plan to use a hot glue gun for application. Consider using Super Glue as an alternative way for application.

, Pour in the soil. Put a paper plate or newspaper underneath the milk jug before you do this in order avoid picking it up and leaving dirt on the table. Fill almost to the top of the opening.

, If you're adding a seedling, use a hand shovel to dig a nook inside the soil deep enough to cover the plant to its base. For seed placement, use your finger to push the seeds underneath the dirt.

, Add water to get the plant started. Be sure the planter is in an area that can receive water runoff (such as outside in the grass or you’ve placed a plastic tray underneath).

, Keep reusing milk jugs to make planters so that you have rows of them. These can placed on shelving, which can be recycled too, such as using an old wooden crate or pallet.

Decorate or personalize your booklet as you please.",How to Make a Booklet from Paper1," To start making this easy booklet, grab an ordinary piece of 8 1/2 x 11"" paper (the size used in most printers) and a pair of scissors. Fold the paper in half with a ""hamburger"" fold — in other words, your fold should make the paper shorter and fatter, not longer and skinnier.;
, Undo the fold you just made. Use a ""hotdog"" fold to fold the paper in half again the other way. Your piece of paper should be long and skinny after making this fold.

, Undo the fold you just made. Your paper should be divided into four equal quarters. If your folds aren't super sharp, take this opportunity to re-crease your folds before proceeding.

, Lay the paper sideways in front of you so that one of its long edges is facing you. Grab the right edge of the paper and fold it halfway across the paper so that the edge meets the center crease. Repeat for the other side. If done correctly, your folds should look like a set of double doors.

, Lay your piece of paper flat in front of you. It should now be folded into equal eighths. Once again, you'll want to take this opportunity to make sharp creases if any of your folds seem ""weak"" or shallow.

, Make the same hamburger (short and fat) fold as you did at the beginning. Next, grab a pair of scissors and make a straight cut along the crease that divides the paper horizontally. Stop at the midpoint of this crease.


To be perfectly clear, you want to make a cut from halfway up the folded side of the paper to the exact center of the paper. In other words, since your folded paper is divided into four quarters, your cut should go between the two quarters on the right side of the folded paper.

, Unfold the paper completely and lay it flat in front of you. Make the same hotdog-style (long and skinny) fold that you made near the beginning of the project. You should be folding along the cut you just made, which should be centered on the midpoint of the fold.

, Arrange your paper so that the folded edge with the cut in the middle is pointing up and the edges of the paper are facing down toward the floor or table. Carefully grab each end of the folded paper and push them together toward the center. The inside sections should fold outward in a rough diamond shape. Continue pushing until your diamond collapses and forms a cross shape. Strengthen any of the central creases as needed.

, You're nearly done! All you need to do is grab the left end of your folded paper and fold it across to the right end of the paper. The central folds should ""accordion"" to form eight pages, while the backsides of the outer sections should form the front and back covers. Press the left edge (the ""spine"") of your new booklet to make a strong crease.

, Now that you've made your new booklet, it's up to you to decide how to personalize it. Use any pens, markers, or other craft tools at your disposal to make your booklet uniquely your own! Below are just a few ideas for how you might want to decorate your new booklet:


Add flowery, old-fashioned trim work around the edges of the front and back covers.
Add page numbers and/or the booklet's title at the tops of each page.
Use stickers or glue-on decorations to give your booklet flair.
Keep things plain and dignified by simply writing your name and the title of the booklet on the front cover.

Grab three or more lunch bag-style paper bags.,
Lay one bag down with its flap on the left.,
Place another bag on top with its flap on the right.,
Lay another bag on top with its flap on the left.,
Add more bags for more pages.,
Fold the stack of bags in half book-style.,
Bind the pages.",How to Make a Booklet from Paper2," This method turns a few ordinary paper bags into a booklet that's a little bigger than the eight page booklet described above. The type of bag you'll want to use is the skinny, narrow paper bag with a ""flap"" at the bottom that's frequently used for packing lunches. White paper bags are easiest for writing and reading purposes, but standard brown bags also work fine. You'll also want to have a hole punch and some string or ribbon handy.


You don't specifically have to use lunch bags for this booklet — you're just looking for skinny paper bags with a ""flap"" at the bottom that allows the bag to stand upright when it's opened. As long as all your bags are the same size and shape, you can make a booklet using almost any of this type of paper bag.

, Take one of your paper bags and lay it on the table or work area in front of you so that the flap is facing up. Turn the bag so that one of its long edges if facing you and the square flap is on your left.

, Take another paper bag and put it on top of the first flap side-up so that its flap is on your right, rather than your left. Line the bags up so that they sit evenly on top of each other.

, Take a third bag and lay it on top of your stack flap side-up so that its flap is on the left, exactly as you did with the first bag. Once again, line this bag up so that it's even with the ones under it.

, At this point, you can continue adding bags as you wish, though you don't have to. The more bags you add, the more pages your booklet will have. If you want to add more bags, use the same alternating pattern you've established — your next bag should be flap side-up with its flap on the right, the bag after that should have its flap on the left, and so on.


If you stick with just three bags, your booklet will have a total of 10 pages once it's completed.

, When you've added as many bags as you'd like, take the entire stack of bags and fold it in half over itself. The smooth side of the bottom bag (previously touching the table or work area in front of you) should form the front and back covers of your new book, while the alternating bottoms and tops of the bags inside form the pages.


In your booklet, the bag flaps can function as ""fold-out"" sections. In other words, if you want to, you can put extra information under the flaps. Alternatively, you can tape or glue them down to give your booklet a more traditional feel.

, Next, to finish your booklet, you need to bind the pages together so that they'll stay together in the shape of a book without making your booklet's pages hard to turn. The easiest way to do this is generally to use a hole punch to put two or more holes along the folded edge (i.e., the ""spine"" of your book). Loop a short length of ribbon or string through each hole you make, then tie the ends together, leaving enough slack in each loop to allow the pages to turn easily.


If you're handy with a sewing machine, you can alternatively use one to stitch the folded edge of the booklet together. If you do this, be careful not to put your stitches too close to the book's ""spine"" or you risk missing some of the innermost pages.

Turn the paper over and fold the bottom of the paper up.,
Fold the top of the paper down to form a rectangle.,
Fold the outer edges of the paper in towards the ""pages"".,
If desired, glue your covers in place.",How to Make a Booklet from Paper3," This method requires trickier folds than the ones above, but leaves you with an elegant, professional-looking booklet if done correctly. To make your job easier, it's useful to use square pieces of origami paper for this project. Technically, any square piece of paper will work, but origami paper is usually thin and relatively easy to fold. Plus, it often has patterns or designs on one side which can create great-looking covers.


If you don't have any square paper handy, you can trim a standard 8 1/2 x 11"" piece of paper to make an 8 1⁄2 inch (21.6 cm) square piece by cutting three inches from the longer side. Be precise and use a ruler to aid your measurements. You're going to be making lots of intricate folds, so having a paper that's as close to perfectly square as possible will be a big help in the long run.

, Lay your paper flat in front of you (if you're using patterned origami paper, you want it white side-up). Fold the paper in half vertically, then fold the outer edges inward to the center and crease. When you're done, your paper should be divided into four tall, skinny, equal sections with three folds that point away from you (or ""valley"" folds).

, Next, make four more vertical folds to divide each of the tall, skinny sections of the paper in half. These folds should point toward you (""mountain""-style), rather than away from you. When you're done, you should be left with a piece of paper that's divided into eight skinny strips that fold together in an ""accordion"" pattern.

, Next, turn your paper 90 degrees so that the previously vertical folds run horizontal. Unfold these folds and make one new one to divide the paper in half vertically. Use a ""valley""-style fold (one that points away from you). Your fold should intersect the folds you've already made at perfect (or nearly perfect) right angles.

, Turn your paper once again so that your original set of folds are once again pointing vertically. Fold the edges inward, ""accordion-ing"" the paper along the vertical folds as you go. Don't make the final fold in the center of the paper — leave this unfolded. Your paper should look like a long, skinny set of double doors at this point. Your folded piece of paper should be one-fourth as wide as it would normally be.


If you're using patterned origami paper, the ""doors"" should have this pattern. If they're plain, you may have made an error in your folding.

, Here's where things get tricky. You may want to start following along with the video below if you get lost. Take the skinny top edge of your folded ""doors"" and fold it down so it reaches halfway to the center crease running through your ""doors"" horizontally. In other words, you'll want to put a valley fold one sixth of the way down the length of the doors.


Making this sort of fold is a little trickier than folding a section of paper in half or into quarters. There are a few different ways to do this — the easiest is probably to think of the top half of the doors as one single unit and fold the top edge down until it appears that the unfolded paper below is about the same thickness as the doubled-up portion, then fold and adjust manually until you get your proportions just right.

, Grab the top edge of the folded paper and fold it across itself diagonally. Line the crease you just made up with the central crease running down the center of the doors vertically and press to fold. Your paper should look like an upside down, rotated letter L.


Repeat for the opposite direction to fold an ""X"" shape into the top portion of the paper.

, Next, unfold your paper completely and lay it in front of you. If you're using paper that's patterned on one side, you want the white side facing up (if you're not using patterned paper, this is the side that was inside your ""doors"" earlier). If necessary, turn the paper so that the ""X"" folds run along the bottom edge. Fold the lower part of the paper underneath using the horizontal crease near the bottom of the page.


When you're done, your paper should be divided by vertical folds that form triangle shapes at the bottom.

, Fold each of the small triangles at the bottom of the paper inward to divide it in half. Start at one end and fold the rest of the paper around each fold as you go. Press the folded triangles together accordion-style until your entire piece of folded paper looks like a very long, skinny letter L.

, Take the long, skinny end of your ""L"" and make a 45 degree fold to bring it up and over itself. Leave a small gap between the lower part of the ""L"" and the fold you make. When you're done, your folded-up piece of paper should look like a backwards letter J. Fold the interior of the J shape in upon itself to give the bottom of the J 45 degree angles all around.

, Carefully open up the accordion-ed folds of the long, narrow part of the J shape to reveal a wide ""cape"" shaped section of paper. Fold this back over itself, turning it 90 degrees as you do so. Line your fold up with the paper behind it. Then, fold the upper section of the paper back over itself once more in the opposite direction.

, If you're working with patterned paper, after you flip it over, your paper should now look like a wide, fat cape or glider with patterned ""trim"" at its edges. Fold the bottom edge of the paper over itself with a narrow fold — you want to create no more than a quarter inch strip of doubled-up material at the bottom.

, Grab the top edge of the paper and fold it down over itself until it's almost (but not quite) level with the bottom edge. Your folded paper should now be in the shape of a long, skinny, horizontal rectangle. If you're using patterned paper, the entire rectangle should be patterned.

, Your booklet should now be starting to take shape. In the middle of your rectangle, there should be a small ""tab"" of tightly-folded square segments of paper that fan out from a central point where they all meet. These will form your booklet's pages. To make your booklet's covers, fold the outer edges of the rectangle in until they meet the base of the pages and fold to crease. When you're done, there should be a tab of paper at each end of the inner tab of pages that's slightly larger than the pages themselves.

, Congratulations! If you've made all of your folds correctly, when you're done, your tiny booklet should have ten pages and a front and back cover. If you want to, at this point you can carefully glue or tape the flaps that form the covers of the book down to secure them in place. Your booklet is now ready to use!


Alternatively, for true origami authenticity, try sliding the lower tab of each cover flap into the pocket along the back of the book. This secures each cover in place without the use of adhesives, which any origami master wouldn't be caught dead using.

Turn old paper products into crafts.,
Recycle paper you can't reuse.",How to Save Paper," One of the biggest culprits for creating paper waste is consumer packaging that’s used to wrap and label food, toys, clothes, and other goods. To help save paper, buy products that have been made with minimal or no packaging.


Many of today’s consumer items are wrapped multiple times, such as a candy that comes in an individual wrapper, within a bag that’s also placed inside a box. Instead, look for packaging that has a sticker instead of a full box, for instance, or a tag instead of an entire container. Similarly, buy items that haven't been wrapped multiple times.
Buying in bulk is a good way to reduce paper waste from packaging. Next time you or your family go shopping, make sure you take reusable bags, and buy what you can in bulk.;
, Unless consumers like you tell companies what you do and don’t like about their products and practices, they may not get the message. If it bothers you that certain companies waste too much paper, write them an email or call them to say you want them to join the fight to save the trees.


To get a company’s contact information, check their website for a phone number or email address.
For instance, if a company you like uses too much packaging and wastes paper, tell them you want to see more innovative and less wasteful packaging.

, Another large contributor to paper waste is takeout food containers, which are often made of paper products or packed in paper bags. Next time you and your family decide to eat out for a meal, request that you sit down in the restaurant instead of taking the food in to-go containers.


Most fast food restaurants use paper products to individually wrap all food, so ask your family if you can eat at a conventional sit-down restaurant for your next night out.

, At home, at school, and at work, you can save paper by cutting down on the amount of material you print off. Before you print anything, ask yourself if you really need a paper copy, and only print something if you must.


When you do need to print something off, reduce the font, increase the margins, and print on both sides of the paper so the project can be printed on fewer pieces of paper.If teachers and employers require that you hand in paper copies of projects and assignments, ask if you can instead submit them electronically.
Before you print off an assignment, letter, or personal project, proofread it on the computer so you don’t have to print off a second draft.

, Most documents these days can be shared and stored electronically, meaning you don’t have to print off paper copies for your records. For instance, if you need a copy of an electronic document, request that it be sent to you by email.


For sensitive documents that shouldn’t be emailed, ask if you can save a copy directly to a flash drive.
In the case where an original paper copy already exists and you need a record for your files, scan a version to your computer instead of making a photocopy.When you need to provide copies of documents to friends, family, teachers, or people at work, ask if you can transmit files electronically using sharing services, email, or other electronic methods.

, Many companies and organizations offer electronic correspondences that can replace paper copies they traditionally send in the mail.Whenever possible, sign up for paperless communications for items like:


Bills
Newsletters
Monthly mailings
Flyers and coupons
Newspaper and magazine subscriptions

, There are plenty of free calendars and schedulers available online that you can use to plan your days, keep track of dates and assignments, and schedule meetings and interviews. By using an electronic calendar, you can save the paper that would have been used on a calendar, organizer, journal, or other type of scheduler.


Both Google and Apple provide free calendar products.
There are also plenty of calendar apps that you can use on smartphones or tablets.

, In order to have an even bigger impact, you can also encourage friends, family, classmates, and coworkers to save paper as well. One of the best ways to reach the most people is to put up signs around the house, school, or office that inform people how they can help.


There are lots of signs that you can print off from the internet that will help raise awareness about the importance of saving trees. The WWF has signs you can download and print.
Make sure you print or draw your signs on reused paper (like the back of an old assignment).
Trash containers and recycling bins are a great place for signs.

, Around the house, a lot of paper is wasted every year on things like paper towels and napkins. And if you're using lots of paper products for cleaning, drying, and wiping your nose, you can save plenty of trees by switching to reusable versions.To replace paper towels in the kitchen and bathroom, use tea towels to dry dishes, old rags to clean, and sponges to wipe up spills.
To replace facial tissues, invest in a few handkerchiefs that can be washed and reused.
To replace napkins at the dinner table, purchase cloth napkins instead, which can be washed and reused as well.

, Paper plates and dishes may be convenient, but they aren't good for the environment. Most paper plates just end up in the trash, meaning the paper isn't even recycled properly. When you have a party or any time the paper plates come out, ask to use the real dinnerware instead.


If your family likes to go on picnics or camping trips, invest in reusable plastic dinnerware. You can get plates, bowls, cups, and utensils that are durable, unbreakable, reusable, and not made from paper.

, There are times when it’s simply not possible to avoid paper-like products. Luckily, there are tree-free paper products available that are made from alternative plant sources, and many of these have a lower impact on the environment.


Hemp is a versatile plant that grows much faster than a tree and produces more fiber. Hemp can be turned into fabric, writing paper, greeting cards, envelopes, and other paper products.
Bamboo is another fast-growing species of plant that can be used for alternative paper products. You can find bamboo bathroom tissue, paper, towels, and even disposable dinnerware., Disposable paper cups from cafes and restaurants are another way that lots of paper is wasted every year. Like paper plates, many paper cups end up in the trash, meaning they aren't properly recycled.


Any time you go to a restaurant or cafe for a takeout drink, take a reusable coffee mug or thermos with you for coffee, hot chocolate, or other warm beverages.

, Many grocery stores provide paper bags to pack groceries. You can help your family save paper by investing in reusable grocery bags. Similarly, if your lunches are normally packed in paper bags, ask about switching to a reusable lunch bag instead.


If your family is hesitant about switching, ask them to consider how much money they spend on paper bags and grocery bags every year. Then, compare that to the one-time cost of reusable bags.

, Lots of people like to send greeting cards for birthdays, holidays, and other events, and this leads to plenty of paper waste. Not only is the card itself paper, but it’s also sent in a paper envelope. Instead of sending paper greeting cards to all your friends and family in the mail, send electronic greeting cards for future celebrations.


There are lots of e-card services out there that allow you to personalize designs, messages, and graphics to suit your taste and the type of celebration.
E-cards are also great for sending out invitations to parties, weddings, and other events., Books are great resources for school and work projects, and they're great to read as a leisure activity. But printed books are still made with paper, so you can save paper by using public versions of books that are available at the library, or by reading electronic copies instead.


Buying used books is also a good idea, because you're reusing something that’s already been printed.

, School and work notebooks are a great way to keep track of things you're supposed to learn and projects you're working on, but you can save paper by keeping electronic notes instead. That way, you don’t have to rely on paper notebooks, and you can always have your notes saved to your computer.


If you're in school, ask your teacher if it’s ok that you take notes on a computer or laptop instead of in a notebook.

, There are paper products available that are made with recycled paper, which means that no new trees were cut down to make those products. When you do need to buy paper products, look for things that were made with “post-consumer waste,” including:Bathroom tissues
Printing paper
Greeting cards
Paper bags

, When you do have to print or write things down on paper, make sure you get the most out of that paper by writing on both sides. If you currently only use one side of each piece, you can cut down on paper use by half just by using the other side too!Writing or printing in a smaller size or font will also help you cut down on the amount of paper you need for notes and projects.
When writing in notebooks, always fill the pages completely, and don’t start a fresh book until you’ve filled all the pages.

, Everybody loves a well-wrapped gift, but that doesn’t mean you have to use brand new wrapping paper for every gift you give. Instead, when you get a gift, keep the bag or wrapping paper it came in so that you can use it again for another gift.


Newspaper can also be repurposed as an eco-friendly wrapping paper or tissue paper to stuff a gift bag., There are plenty of crafts that require paper, so instead of using fresh sheets, why not reuse old paper that was already bound for the recycler. You can use old newspapers, notes, cards, and other paper to make things like:Origami
Wreaths
Paper flowers
Paper mâché
Dolls

, When you do have paper that you can't reuse or repurpose, make sure you recycle it instead of throwing it in the trash. Paper that goes in the garbage just ends up in a landfill. But paper that goes into the recycling bin can be sent to a special facility and turned into something new.

Inspect the container for recycling info.,
Check with your local government.,
Clean your container.,
Separate your recyclables if needed.,
Drop off your container.",How to Recycle Ice Cream Containers1," Check the packaging for any labels that indicate whether or not it is recyclable. However, be aware that these only provide general information and do not reflect whether your community is equipped to process this container. Also keep in mind that a lack of labels does not necessarily mean that the container can’t be recycled. Labels to look for include:Widely Recycled: this type of container is recycled by at least 75% of municipalities.

Check Local Recycling: the container is recyclable, but fewer than 75% of municipalities do so.

Not Currently Recycled: although the container may be recyclable, very few communities will accept it.

Widely Recycled at Recycling Points (Check Locally for Kerbside): the container can be dropped off at a local recycling center in most areas.

Universal Recycling Symbol (also known as the Mobius Loop):this could mean that the container is recyclable, but it could also only mean that it was made from recycled materials.#1 through #7:these numbers are usually located within the Universal Recycling Symbol on plastic containers. They indicate the type of chemicals used to make this particular type of plastic.;
, Visit their website or call their offices. Ask if their recycling program includes your specific type of container.Specify whether it is a plastic container or a paper container in case they recycle one type but not the other.If it is a plastic container, include the number within the Universal Recycling Symbol (#1 through #7) in your search, since one type of plastic may be accepted, but not another.


Plastic containers may be more likely to be accepted. Some communities may even require that they be included with your recycling instead of your regular garbage.
Paper containers are much less likely to be recycled due to a plastic lining inside. This lining prevents freezer burn, but it also interferes with the recycling process and may contaminate other paper products that are processed at the same time.

, If your community accepts your container, clean it thoroughly before recycling. Since it contained food, scrub any remaining bits of ice cream from inside and rinse the container out. Be aware that food can spread bacteria through other products during recycling and spoil the whole batch., Remember that just because one community allows all recyclables to be combined in one can, the next one may not. If you have moved to a new area (or aren't quite sure of your current community's guidelines), visit their website or call the appropriate office to find out. If they require you to separate materials (such as paper from plastic) before curbside pick-up, place your container with similar recyclables.


Do the same if you need to drop your container off at a recycling center. The fact that it isn't accepted as part of curbside pick-up means that it needs to be sorted out from other products and dealt with separately., Follow your community's guidelines for recycling. If ice cream containers are accepted as part of your curbside pickup, simply place the container in the appropriate recycling can. If ice cream containers are only accepted at recycling centers, find the most convenient one for you to go to and drop it off."
"
Find out if the container is safe for composting.,
Search for a composting program.,
Contact the program.",How to Recycle Ice Cream Containers2," Since paper containers are unlikely to be recycled, determine whether they can be composted instead. Check the packaging for the labels “biodegradable,” “compostable,” or “degradable.”Do the same with plastic containers if your community does not recycle them.


Plastic containers marked as “#7” and/or “PLA” may be accepted by composters. These plastics are created from plant-based materials, so they are biodegradable., First, check with your local government to find out if they offer a program themselves in addition to conventional recycling. However, expect this to be unlikely, since fewer municipalities offer both. In that case, see if your government can refer you to a privately-run composter, or perform your own search online..


Helpful websites include http://www.findacomposter.com/ and http://www.harvestcollection.com/map.cfm.
Composting paper products at home is debatable. Although some people adopt the practice, others advise against it due to the inks used on the packaging, which may contaminate your compost and soil. Also, paper contributes very little nutrition to the compost, which means ice cream containers would just waste space in a small-scale compost pile., Visit their website or contact them directly. Find out if they accept your container. If it includes any features made from other materials (such as plastic or metal), be sure to mention it to find out if it is still acceptable.


If they do accept it, find out how to go about giving them your compostable materials. If it is a government-run program, they may offer curbside pickup.Other programs may require you to drop the materials off at select locations on select dates.

Make plastic pails your wash buckets.,
Use them to unspool yarn.,
Make them your bait box.,
Make decorative buckets.",How to Recycle Ice Cream Containers3," Use a drill, a hammer and nail, or a soldering iron to create holes through the bottom. Fill the container with soil. Plant flowers, herbs, or other plants inside., Store anything from wash cloths to pet treats to loose hardware, like random nails and screws that could be reused. Or, ditch the lid and repurpose them as pencil- or brush-holders.

, Mix your cleaning solutions and water inside. Then use the lid and handle for easy, mess-free transport through the house. If the solution can be used again once you are finished, simply seal the lid back on and store away for future use., Poke a hole through the lid that is wide enough for a strand of yarn to pass through. Place your ball of yarn inside the container and feed the end of the strand through the hole. Seal the lid and begin stitching with the free end of the strand, pulling more out through the hole as needed., Poke holes in the lid for air. Then simply place your live bait inside and reseal the lid., Repurpose plastic containers as Halloween buckets, Easter baskets, or simple household containers that don’t look like leftover ice cream containers.Remove any sticky labels by soaking them with nail polish remover and then scraping them off. Then either:Spray-paint the bucket and handle your desired base color. Then create stencils for your design, tape them over the bucket’s sides, and spray paint with a new color. For instance, for a Halloween bucket, use orange as your base color and black for your stencils to create a jack-o-lantern design.
Search for designs online or create your own on your computer. Print them out and trim the excess paper if needed (such as the square edges if you are covering the container’s circular lid, or along the design’s borders if you are using several to create a collage). Apply a layer of Modge Podge or other adhesive to the plastic, fix the printout to the bucket, and apply another couple layers of Modge Podge on top of it.

Call your recycling service to ask if they recycle envelopes with plastic windows.,
Research local recycling options, if you do not currently recycle.,
Place your envelopes with plastic windows with the other paper recycling, if your recycling agency suggests.,
Remove the plastic window from the inside, if your recycling agency cannot separate the plastic and glue from the envelope.",How to Recycle Envelopes With Plastic Windows1," If you have a service that picks up your recycling every week or month, you can call their number. If you take your recycling to a location, then check with the people inside the building the next time you take other recycling.


If you are in an office, ask your office manager how the company handles recycling. Some companies view envelopes as confidential materials and would prefer envelopes with plastic windows to be shredded.
You can offer to do research about local recycling agencies, if your office does not currently recycle. Some cities and states offer incentives to offices that are looking to become more ""green."";
, You can usually look in the local yellow pages to find recycling centers or call your local chamber of commerce. They may offer a booklet with trash and recycling information to residents.


Small towns usually have limited recycling options. You can drive to a local recycle drop off or call a larger city nearby that may recycle more. Medium-sized towns may have private services that offer monthly fee-based roadside pickups. Large towns and suburbs may have trash and recycling services as part of the city services. If that is the case, there is probably a list on the city website that will tell you what is recyclable.

, Most recycling centers have a way to filter out the plastic window from the envelope and paper.

, You will need to throw away the plastic and glue, and place the envelope with the other paper recycling.

Place seeds in an envelope and label them to store for the winter.






Use envelopes with patterned designs on the inside for art and craft projects.






Tape an envelope beneath a drill to catch falling dust.






Open envelopes with windows carefully and reuse them. You can tape them shut, and cover the window with a mailing label. The UK organization Friends of the Earth sells envelope reuse labels that go over the window or previous mailing address.






If your recycling center won't recycle any envelopes with glue on them, you can remove the plastic window, shred the paper and use it for compost. The glue is usually made from natural, biodegradable materials.

Clean the container.,
Locate a recycling center or program near you.,
Check with your local recycling program to see if your empty oil containers are accepted.,
Drop off or await pickup for your recyclables.,
Repurpose the empty oil containers if possible.,
Place your used oil in an appropriate container.,
Find an oil collection location.,
Do not pour oil down the drain.If you poor oil down the drain, you might clog your pipes.,
Do not try to compost your oil.,
Make fuel with your used cooking oil.,
Contact your local trash service.,
Contact your local auto shop.,
Dispose of motor oil properly.",How to Recycle Empty Oil Containers," Depending on where you live, you may or may not need to rinse your container out.If you do, turn the container upside down over a disposable napkin and let excess oil drain out. Dispose of the napkin in the trash. When oil has stopped dripping out of the bottle, fill it with hot water and a bit of liquid soap, replace the cap, and shake it several times. Empty the soapy water in your sink.;
, There are two basic options for recycling: drop-off centers and pick-up services. You’ll probably have to pay for pick-up service, but you’ll save time and won’t have to make a trip to a recycling center.


Use the Earth911 recycling search at http://search.earth911.com/?utm_source=earth911-header&utm_medium=top-navigation-menu&utm_campaign=top-nav-recycle-search-button to find a recycling program near you.
A similar tool is available at http://iwanttoberecycled.org/.

, First, identify what type of plastic your oil container is by looking on the bottom or side of the container. Locate the number inside the recycling triangle.Then, contact your local recycling program and ask for details about recycling containers of this type.


Many recycling programs offer explicit lists of what they accept and do not accept on their websites.
Most oil bottles are made from clear number one plastic. This is the most common kind of plastic, and empty oil containers are usually accepted along with the rest of your recyclable plastic and other materials.

, Pick-up services operate just like municipal trash collection does: a truck will come by on a designated day, usually once each week, and collect your recycling in a bin. The bin is usually provided by the collector, but there might be a small fee.Drop-off locations require you to load up your empty oil containers and other recycling materials and drop them in the appropriate bin. For instance, there might be a bin for number one and two plastics, another bin for paper and cardboard, and another bin for glass.


If you’re dropping off your recyclables, you’ll save time if you sort everything according to the categories of recyclables accepted at your recycling center. For instance, you might have one bin for newspaper and junk mail, another for clear glass, another for colored glass, another for number one and two plastic, and another for all other types of plastic.
Pickup services are typically single-stream. In other words, there is no need to sort glass, plastic, and paper into separate bins. Instead, drop all your recyclables into a single bin and place it in a location where the the recycling service can access it (usually near the foot of your driveway).

, An even more ecologically friendly option for handling your empty oil containers is reusing them. For example, you can cut the tops from the oil containers and use them to organize tools and hardware in your garage. You could also cut a clean oil bottle lengthwise, fill it with dirt, and use it as a starter bed for small plants.Make sure not to store anything that would be harmed by exposure to the oil residue.

, Add your oil to a large, sealable container. A plastic jug or glass flour container with a volume of about one gallon are good choices.


If your oil has solidified, throw the solid mass in the trash. Wipe the remainder out of the pan with a napkin and throw it out as well.The number of times you can reuse your oil depends on a number of factors, including the type of oil, the temperature you cook at, and the way you use it.For instance, cooking oil at a temperature above 375 degree Fahrenheit can lead to the accumulation of HNE, a toxic substance that can lead to negatively impact your health., Contact local restaurants to see if they recycle oil. If so, ask if you can drop your used cooking oil off at the restaurant for collection.Other locations you can investigate for the presence of oil recycling services include private waste collectors, government waste departments (for instance, your local municipal waste department), and your local Environmental Protection Agency.


Once you’ve located an appropriate agency or location, ask for delivery guidelines and bring your waste to the appropriate drop-off point.

, Even if your own pipes don’t end up clogged, you’ll be contributing to the congestion of your local sewer system. In high-density areas, especially, this can cause real problems.


Wipe greasy pans and plates off with disposable napkins before washing them in the sink. Throw the napkins in the trash.
If you accidentally pour oil down the drain, pour a couple cups of boiling water in after it.Add a spoonful of vinegar and baking soda to the water to make it even more effective.

, Most compost piles do not get hot enough to break down fatty oils. Keep oil and greasy or fried foods out of your compost pile or you might end up with rot in your compost., Vegetable oil -- along with animal fats -- can be used to create a renewable fuel that burns cleaner than fossil fuels.Depending on the kind of engine you’re using, you might need to mix your oil with regular gasoline to create biodiesel. Alternately, you might be able to convert your engine and feed it straight vegetable oil. Contact your local university or auto shop and inquire about how you can incorporate used vegetable oil into your vehicle.

, Ask your local trash service about options for disposing of your motor oil. Your local service might be a private waste collector or a government waste department (for instance, your local municipal waste department). You could also contact your and your local Environmental Protection Agency.


Once you’ve located an appropriate agency or location, ask for delivery guidelines and bring your waste to the appropriate drop-off point.
Some municipalities allow oil to be placed in clear, sealed containers for pickup along with the rest of the garbage.In some places, you might have to drop your old motor oil off., Many auto shops (especially oil change shops) offer used motor oil collection services.Check several shops if the first one you ask does not accept old motor oil. Once you locate a nearby shop that accepts used motor oil, ask them how they want it packaged.


These shops then sell the used oil to refineries so that it can be used again., Once you’ve located a site or program that will accept your used motor oil, follow the appropriate directions to ensure it arrives safely to where it needs to go. Whether you drop the oil off or arrange for pickup, place it in a container of an appropriate type. Usually, you will need to place your used motor oil in a clear, sealable container like a used milk jug.


Do not pour oil down a sewer or in the gutter, and do not pour it onto empty land. Oil that is improperly disposed of can poison aquifers and groundwater."

Ask for a budget to introduce office recycling.,
Search for city or state incentives for helping your office go green.,
Appoint someone to head up your office recycling program or elect to do it yourself.,
Tell the office by email or memo that a waste reduction program is beginning and all employees are required to take part in the program by abiding by the general list of rules you establish.

",How to Recycle Office Supplies1," While many domestic recycling programs are free, or at a very low cost, companies generally charge a higher price to recycle office supplies. This is because of the quantity, sorting, time and electronic recycling. Your company should be aware that a budget is required.;
, This may increase your budget, or allow you to do it at no cost to you. They may also provide free paper, plastic or cardboard pickup in local dumpsters.

, Understand that many purchasing, recycling and communication decisions will be up to this person. They should have authority to institute the changes and commitment to the program.


The person who heads up your recycling program should most likely also be the person who is purchasing office supplies. The program is more likely to be effective if it is implemented on both ends of the supply chain.

,"
"
Ask office employees to print only what is necessary.,
Stop using staples in the office.,
Devote a room to supplies that can be reused.,
Stop the use of colored paper or Manila envelopes.,
Reuse large envelopes and boxes whenever possible.,
Institute refillable ink and toner cartridges.,
Remove disposable water or coffee cups from the office.,
Buy and use rechargeable batteries for cameras and other devices.,
Buy recycled paper, recycled toilet paper and recycled tissue paper.",How to Recycle Office Supplies2," Also, request that they use double sided printing for messages that will remain within the office. A recycling program's budget can be significantly reduced by first instituting a waste reduction element to the program.


You can ask your office to place a signature on their emails that ask people receiving emails not to print their email if it is not necessary.

, Stapled paper can usually not be recycled. Encourage employees to use paperclips or fold the edges of paper. You can also invest in staple-less staplers that punch the paper to hold it together.

, This can include binders, pens, pencils, computers, paper, chairs and more. Encourage employees to check for their supply in the supply closet before requesting new office supplies be purchased.

, These 2 things can rarely be recycled. Envelopes containing bubble wrap should also be used sparingly because they cannot be recycled.

, Offices often buy these supplies and then throw away the boxes they receive. This can be easily avoided by placing a label over the previous label and securing it with tape.

, Look in the phone book to find a cartridge store that provides this service. You may need to take the cartridges to them once every month.


You can also choose to purchase ""recycled"" ink and toner cartridges. This means they have been refilled and they are ready to be used again. They usually cost significantly less than new, printer-brand ink and toner cartridges.

, Encourage everyone to bring their own mug to work or buy a large set of inexpensive white cups that can be reused and washed.

, Although they initially cost more, they save money in the long run because they last much longer and can be continually recharged.

, Recycled tissues and toilet paper are not considered recyclable. If your office wants to go green completely, then it will be important to ensure that materials that cannot be recycled are made from recycled material.

Check local guidelines.,
Rinse if required.,
Remove all non-glass parts.,
Sort the glass by color if required.,
Check the batch for other objects.",How to Recycle Glass1," Most recycling programs accept all types of glass containers for food and drink.But a minority will only accept certain colors, and many have extra sorting guidelines. Look these up before you begin:


Search Earth911 in the US for detailed information.
Your local government website may have information on curbside recycling programs.
Look for printed labels on your curbside collection bins.
If you have no curbside collection, search online for recycling centers nearby. Contact them to ask about glass requirements.;
, Many recycling centers ask that you give food containers a quick rinse. You never need to scrub them spotless. Even if it's quite dirty, it will usually get used — but it will earn the recycling center less money.This saves roughly 1–2 US pints (950 ml) (0.5–1 liters) of water compared to making a new glass bottle. More importantly, the energy savings and reduced pollution far outweigh the cost of washing., Take off all plastic or metal bottle caps, foil wine collars, and other non-glass materials. One stray piece could ruin an entire batch, or limit how it can be used.


Paper labels are usually removed by the recycling center. Check your local guidelines if you are unsure.
Ceramics are not recyclable. A plate or flowerpot can ruin a whole batch of glass., Many recycling programs ask you to sort glass by color. Each color contains different ingredients with different qualities. Mixed-color glass batches are in low demand, since it's hard to predict their quality.Almost any program accepts clear and amber (brown) glass. Most accept green. A few accept blue.
Some areas have ""single stream"" recycling pickup, combining all types of glass, or even mixing them with metal and plastic. One study shows that this reduces the percentage of usable glass from 90% to 60%.Switch to a more effective program if possible.

, Recycled glass is crushed into ""cullet,"" then reheated to fuse into a new object. The wrong type of glass can ruin an entire batch by melting or fusing at the wrong time. The following should never be recycled with ordinary glass containers:Drinking glasses and glass dishes
Frosted glass
Pyrex and other heat-resistant glass (cookware and laboratory equipment)
Window glass, mirrors, and windshields
Lightbulbs
Eyeglasses
Glass exposed to hazardous materials or biological contaminants (e.g. blood)
Broken glass (to protect workers)

"
"
Handle broken glass.,
Bag fluorescent light bulbs separately.,
Treat windows and windshields as construction waste.,
Donate old eyeglasses and intact items.,
Reuse.",How to Recycle Glass2," Almost no curbside recycling programs accept broken glass, in order to protect the workers handling these materials. Double-bag the glass or wrap it in newspaper, then bag. Dispose of it in the trash.


If you have a large amount, call ahead to a recycling center. Some will accept broken glass in person.

, Fluorescent light bulbs contain tiny amounts of mercury. Bag them and leave them outside or in a well-ventilated area until you can dispose of them. Contact your local government or recycling center. You may be required to take the bulb in to a recycling center or hazardous waste disposal facility. Otherwise, you may dispose of the bagged light bulb in the trash.Some stores, including Home Depot and IKEA, will collect compact fluorescent light bulbs to recycle the mercury.Incandescent light bulbs have no mercury. You can always throw them in the trash, but there is no market for them to be recycled.

, These types of glass have received chemical treatments that make them non-recyclable. You may be able to take them to a special construction waste facility.


Use earth911's construction search to find these facilities in the US.

, Many optometrists and community centers collect old eyeglasses to donate to people who can't afford them. Secondhand stores accept other intact objects, such as drinking glasses.


One study shows that many donated glasses are not usable.Your donation is most useful if the lenses are unscratched, the frames are intact, and the prescription is common.

, As you've just read, there are many types of glass that no one will recycle. Before sending them to the landfill, consider reusing them. Broken glass can turn into a glass mosaic vase. A broken wineglass can become a candle holder. Turning trash into treasure helps the environment in a satisfying, hands-on way.

Reuse old ink and toner cartridges.,
Use less ink and paper.,
Buy recycled cartridges.",How to Recycle Empty Ink and Toner Cartridges3," You can recycle ink cartridges on your own through simple reuse. Most office supplies stores will refill old ink or toner cartridges for a small fee. This is usually cheaper than purchasing new cartridges and allows you to cut back on your carbon footprint., You should also work on using less ink and paper in general. This can cut back on waste, and will result in your cartridges lasting longer. Try to read documents on screen. When possible, opt to fill out forms online. Go for electronic tickets when traveling, and have itineraries pulled up on your phone instead of printed on paper.

, You can purchase ink and toner cartridges that have been remanufactured online or at local outlets where they are sold. Many people prefer to buy recycled cartridges to reduce waste, and because they are often cheaper. Usually, recycled cartridges work well. However, make sure to take certain precautions before making a purchase.Read reviews of any company you do business with. It takes some work to repurpose cartridges, and some companies do so better than others.
See if there is a return policy or warranty. Companies invested in quality usually offer returns or warranties upfront.

Gather the spent coffee grounds and coffee filter.,
Place the coffee grounds onto your compost pile.,
Adjust the level of carbon-rich material in your compost pile.",How to Recycle Coffee Grounds From Your Coffee Maker1," If you have an existing compost pile, worm bin, or municipal compost service, adding your spent coffee grounds is easy.


Begin by gathering up the spent grounds as well as the paper filter if you use one. Paper coffee filters are also compostable.
You may want to keep a kitchen compost bucket handy for holding your coffee grounds until you take them to your compost pile. This will keep you from having to make trips to the compost pile each time you brew coffee.;
, Coffee grounds and filters are fully organic and can be placed directly onto a compost pile or buried in a worm bin.

, Coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen, which makes them a ""green"" composting material. Green materials must be balanced with carbon-rich or ""brown"" materials. If you begin adding a lot of coffee grounds to your compost pile, make sure to add more paper, dried leaves, or other carbon-rich materials to adjust the nutrient balance.

"
"
Save the coffee grounds for fertilizing your plants.,
Apply the coffee grounds to your plants.",How to Recycle Coffee Grounds From Your Coffee Maker2," Because coffee grounds are granular, relatively pH-neutral, and rich in nitrogen, they make a great fertilizer for houseplants and garden plants. You can save coffee grounds (while discarding the filters) in a small container for use as a fertilizer.

, When you are ready to use the coffee grounds, simply sprinkle them over your plant's soil or work them into the soil with your fingers. Adding spent coffee grounds directly to a plant's soil not only provides nitrogen to the plant, but also improves the water retention ability of the soil.

"
"
Collect coffee grounds for distributing onto the ground outdoors.,
Pour the coffee grounds over your outdoor soil.",How to Recycle Coffee Grounds From Your Coffee Maker3," If you do not have a compost pile and do not need much extra fertilizer for your plants, a third option is available for recycling coffee grounds. Begin by collecting the grounds from your coffee maker into a small container just as you would for the other 2 methods.

, Because coffee grounds work themselves into the soil so quickly, and because plants consume their available nutrients so readily, the grounds can actually be poured directly onto the ground outside.


This method of recycling coffee grounds is only appropriate if you own a piece of outdoor land. You should avoid dumping coffee grounds onto land that you do not own.
When doing this, avoid dumping the grounds so that they bury existing plant growth. Instead, consider pouring the grounds around the bases of trees, which are typically self-mulched and devoid of competing plant life already.

Use it as a natural de-odorizer.,
Use it to make coffee ice.,
Try making antique-looking paper.,
Marinate meat with it.",How to Recycle Coffee Grounds From Your Coffee Maker4," Just gutted a fish, cooked spicy food, peeled 4 heads of garlic and can’t get the smell out of your nails? Try rubbing some coffee grounds in your hands. The odor will be gone, and your hands will be left exfoliated and supple. Afterwards, wash your hands to get rid of the leftover grounds. Plus, you can get unpleasant scents in containers out by leaving a cup of coffee grounds in the area or even put some grounds in smelly shoes overnight.

, Ice cubes of frozen coffee can be used to make iced coffee later or even added to a protein shake for an extra kick of energy.

, Soaking white, office paper in leftover coffee or coffee grounds mixed with water can dye it and give it just the color for an antique look. You can then go on to use it to make cards or for scrapbooking.

, Acidic liquids help tenderize meat, and coffee has all the acid you need. Just add a small amount to your marinade and you’ll see some great results without an odd taste of coffee in your steak.

Consider keeping items in good condition.,
Keep bigger, pricier items in storage.,
Store clothing carefully.,
Wash bottles, nipples, and pacifiers thoroughly.",How to Recycle Baby and Kid Items1," If you plan to have more children, you may decide to keep your clothing and equipment for the future. Even if you do not have more children, you can save certain items for your future grandchildren – particularly special articles of clothing, like christening gowns, and favorite toys and blankets.;
, If you plan to have more children, it might be worthwhile to store larger items like cribs, highchairs, strollers, and infant furniture. If you have room in your house or garage, that’s great; if not, consider renting a small storage unit.

, Wash each article of clothing before storing, and then fold it neatly and sort it into a plastic tub or cardboard box, organizing by size and (if applicable) season.

, These items can carry bacteria, so it’s important to clean them thoroughly before storing.


Keep in mind that before you use these items again, you will have to inspect them carefully. Rubber can rot over time, and these items don’t always hold up in storage.

"

Choose items that are in good condition.,
Check local ordinances regarding garage sales.,
Advertise your garage sale.,
Arrange your items in an organized fashion.,
Consider secondhand stores.,
Try selling online.",How to Recycle Baby and Kid Items2," Reselling children’s clothing and equipment is a simple way to make a little extra money while passing useful items to parents who need them. Keep in mind, though, that you should only sell items that are in good condition – clean and functional, with no missing parts.


A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself whether you would buy the item, if you were in the market for it. If not, it’s probably best to donate or otherwise repurpose it.

, If you have a lot of clothing and equipment to sell, you might consider holding a garage sale on your own property. Before you do so, you should check the laws and guidelines in your area. Some neighborhoods require you to purchase a permit; others might restrict the days and times that such sales can take place.

, For the best possible turnout, you should advertise your sale at least a week or two in advance. Post clear, eye-catching signs in your neighborhood, or place ads in your local newspaper.


Keep in mind that buyers often plan their routes in advance, and they may show up very early to ensure they have the best opportunity to purchase your items. If you need to cancel or change the date of your sale, it’s polite to take down your notices and place an apology notice on your property.

, To make your items as accessible and appealing as possible, organize them neatly and attractively. A few suggestions:


Organize clothing according to size and gender.
Place a sticker on each item, marked clearly with the price.
Alternatively, use color-coded stickers, and have a printed price sheet handy that shows each color’s designated price.

, If you have only a few items to sell, or you have some items left after a garage sale, take your items to a secondhand store or consignment shop. You may have to try several different stores before you find one that will take your items. Store policies vary, but in general:


Consignment shops will take items likely to sell and have to fill out paperwork so that they can reach you if and when someone purchases them. You will only make money if an items sells.
Secondhand stores will often pay you a fair price up front, then sell the items at a higher price to make a profit.

, In addition to garage sales and secondhand stores, you can put your items up for sale online. Various sites, including eBay, function to connect buyers and sellers. A quick search for “sell baby clothes online” will generate a list of these sites.


Some people will meet in person to make the sale – this is often the case on sites like Craigslist. However, it can be safer, easier, and more convenient to let a site serve as the middleman, handling everything by mail and making sure no one is cheated.

Give your items to needy friends and relatives.,
Donate to a local charity.,
Find a child care center that can use your items.",How to Recycle Baby and Kid Items3," If you have friends or family members who are pregnant or have small children, consider passing your baby and kid items along to them. This way, the items can be used more than once.

, Another way to give a second life to your gently used baby and kid items is to give them away to a local charity. Consider local churches, food banks, and shelters, as well as the well-known national charity organizations.


One of the benefits of giving your items to a charity is that you can be sure they will go to a family in need. This is especially true after a national disaster or other emergency, when many people lose their homes or can no longer afford to purchase necessary clothing and equipment.
Contact organizations to find out what their policies are. Some will even pick up your items for you.
Don’t forget to get a receipt. When you donate valuable items to a charity, you may be able to claim a deduction on your tax return.

, Another alternative is to give your baby and kid items to a local preschool, child care center, or home day care. Depending on individual regulations, these places may want your clothing and equipment.


Many child care centers have a need for baby and toddler clothing, as young children often have accidents and need to be changed.

Make a patchwork quilt.,
Give outgrown clothing to your children to use for their toys.,
Sew new doll clothes.,
Clean the house.,
Use old baby bottles as measuring cups.,
Oil a squeaky door.,
Convert your crib to a cot.,
Turn your crib into a bench.,
Build a work table.,
Repurpose wheels from your child’s stroller.",How to Recycle Baby and Kid Items4," Cut rectangular pieces of fabric from outgrown clothing and blankets, and sew them together to make a quilt. Some children really enjoy touching the various textures and seeing all of the different colors and patterns, even if they don’t remember wearing or using the items themselves.


If parts of the clothes are too small – like socks – sew them onto one of the other patches.
These quilts make excellent heirlooms. Consider keeping a record of which patches came from where.

, Baby clothes make excellent clothing for larger dolls and stuffed toys.

, To make new doll clothes from outgrown baby clothes, simply measure the doll, cut a piece of fabric from the old clothing, and cut slits for the neck, sleeves, and pant legs. Then sew the parts together.

, Old cloth diapers, cotton blankets, and t-shirts can be used as cleaning rags.

, Bottles are marked with measurements, so you can easily use them for liquids during cooking and baking.

, Baby bottles can also be used to lubricate squeaky doors. Pour oil into an old baby bottle, and attach a nipple. Because it dispenses a small amount of liquid and easily fits into hard-to-reach areas, you can easily use this to lubricate door hinges. After doing so, move the door to the left and right to distribute the oil.

, If your child has outgrown the crib, you can repurpose it for a toddler. Remove the part of the crib with the bars, so that your child can climb in without any obstacles.


Be sure to remove excess parts and redundant screws, and don’t let your child use the bed until you have sanded it smooth and repainted it.

, You can also convert a crib into a bench. Remove only one side, and take out the mattress. Replace the footer with a stronger board, and repaint it all in one color.

, Another use for an outgrown crib is a work table. Check to make sure the crib is the appropriate height. Remove the mattress and footer, and replace it with glass or a stronger board.


If the table is too low, you can extend the legs of the crib and place the work surface above. Use the space beneath for storage.

, You can use the wheels of a stroller to build a trailer for your children to play with. Use planks to build the trailer in the form of a box. Attach the wheels with screws.


Keep in mind that the length of the trailer must be sufficient for the wheels to rotate freely. The width can be any measure.

Store crayons in old formula cans.,
Make a piggy bank.,
Use baby food jars for storage.,
Use wet wipes boxes to store various supplies.",How to Recycle Baby and Kid Items5," Clean, empty formula cans make excellent storage containers for crayons (or markers or colored pencils). If desired, you can cut strips of paper or fabric and use them to decorate the can.

, You can also use a formula can as a piggy bank. Cut a slot into the center of the lid for money, then secure the lid. Decorate as desired.

, Baby food jars are transparent, so they make great storage containers for small items. Use them for buttons, beads, thumbtacks, paper clips, and anything else you can think of.


Baby food jars work especially well for spices. Be sure to label them clearly.
Alternatively, use them to store paints.

, The boxes from wet wipes can be used to store makeup, hair accessories, first aid supplies, arts and crafts materials, and anything else that fits.


Since these boxes are made from plastic, which is waterproof, you can also use them to store family photos or important documents.

Use newspapers as stuffing.,
Cushion fragile objects when packing.,
Line the bottom of your pet's cage.,
Freshen up your fridge.",How to Reuse Old Newspapers1," If you run out of stuffing for a decoration, newspapers make a frugal alternative. To use it as filling, take an old newspaper and divide it into pages. Crumple each page into a ball, then stuff the item until full. Newspaper is not as soft as polyester toy filling: keep this in mind before refilling your item with newspapers.


Newspaper ink spreads. If your item is a lighter color or may get wet, use something else instead.
You can also use it in place of tissue paper when stuffing gift bags. Divide an old newspaper into pages and then cut them into smaller squares. Place your present into the bag, then stuff it with newspaper sections until full.;
, In lieu of bubble wrap, use newspaper when packing delicate items into boxes. Newspaper can be wrapped around an object for shock absorption and cushioning for fragile things.


Newspapers can also cover hard floors while packing. That way, if something falls, it is less likely to break.
Again, do not use newspaper when packing something that stains easily.
Use packing peanuts or styrofoam alongside newspaper for extra protection.

, Use newspapers to line pet cages to make clean-up easier. If you need to disinfect your pet's cage, the newspaper lining creates a layer for mess-free removal later on.


If your budget is tight, use shredded newspaper as kitty litter. Divide your old newspaper into sections and cut them into thin, vertical strips. Newspaper is absorbent and can be used as an alternative to storebought litter.Pet owners who recently bought a dog can use newspaper lining on dog beds while training in case your puppy has an accident.
Bird owners can use newspaper as daily removable lining on the bottom of its cage to avoid cleaning the base each day., Line old newspapers at the bottom of your fruit or vegetable trays.Newspapers absorb smells and liquids, and they can take care of bad odors without you cleaning fridge trays daily.


If you have any under-ripe fruits, wrapping them in newspaper can help them ripen faster.

"
"
Clean your windows.,
Create a weed barrier.,
Use newspapers as kindling.",How to Reuse Old Newspapers2," Separate your old newspaper into sections and crumple each page into a ball. Dip the newspaper balls into water mixed with vinegar (or a cleaning solution of your choice), which you can then use to clean windows like you would with rags.


The benefit of using newspapers instead of cleaning rags is that you can clean your windows without any streaks.Newspapers also won't leave lint on your windows for maximum visibility.

, If you're a gardener and have trouble with weeds overrunning your garden, use newspapers to introduce a weed barrier.When building a raised bed garden, lay out newspaper sections along the bottom of the bed before filling it with dirt. This will prevent weeds from invading your garden and allow your plants to grow without competition.

, Instead of a log or wild brush in a bonfire, take old newspapers with you while camping and use them as kindling. Newspapers make ideal kindling if you put them into the fire tightly rolled in tubes.

Wrap gifts.,
Use newspaper as origami paper.,
Create papier-mâché.,
Scrapbook or create a collage.",How to Reuse Old Newspapers3," Newspapers can make a cute and thrifty gift wrapping if in a pinch.Scour your newspaper for articles with intriguing images or words. The Arts and Travel sections make for especially creative sections.


Use the Sunday funnies (or daily comic papers) as gift wrap for a child's present.
If you dislike the newsprint style, paint on top of it with acrylics to create a classier look. Just make sure you put the gift in a box before wrapping to avoid paint staining the gift.

, Take old newspaper sections and cut them into squares for origami paper. Newsprint is good at holding folds, and you can create advanced origami while using it. Using newsprint in your origami provides an artsy, modern style.


Origami is a fun and relaxing way to create art. If you have never folded origami before, now may be the time to learn! Begin with simple folds such as an origami swan, then progress to more complex projects.If you live near a stream, create an origami boat and float them for afternoon fun. If with a friend, you can also have origami boat races.

, Use newspaper to create papier-mâché projects. Papier-mâché provides endless possibilities for crafts, from masks to piñatas


Tear old newspaper strips into long strips, then create either a glue or flour paste mixture.]Dip strips of newspaper into the paste, then lay them over the object you wish to papier-mâché. Repeat until your object is covered in the wet newspaper strips, then place it on a table to dry.

, If you scrapbook, use old newspapers as decoration. Save images or word clippings with personal meaning and add them to your family photos. If you're not a scrapbooker, you can also use the clippings to make a collage.


Newspaper ink can rub off on photos, so use a protective plastic layer when placing them in your scrapbooks.

Compost your old newspapers.,
Make a cup to start seeds for your garden.,
Recycle unused newspapers.",How to Reuse Old Newspapers4," If you garden, newspaper can make healthy compost.Shred your newspaper into thin strips and combine it with other carbon-rich compostable materials such as leaves or grass.


Fill your compost bin with with the shredded newspaper and carbon-rich materials, alternating layers with nitrogen-rich compostable materials (such as coffee grounds and vegetable food scraps).You cannot use newspaper bundles as compost. Without shredding it, the compost will not receive enough oxygen and will mold.

, Make a small newspaper cup to start seeds for your garden. Place the cup with the seedling directly in the ground, and the newspaper will degrade on its own.


To fold a paper cup, cut a section of newspaper into a square, then fold the square diagonally. Fold one corner from the center of the opposite side, then repeat this with the other corner. Fold the top flaps down to create an opening for your cup, and place your seeds inside for planting.

, If your local sanitation company offers recycling options, sort your newspapers into the paper recycling bin.


If your sanitation company does not offer recycling, take your old newspapers to a recycling center.Contact your local waste management center to learn what they do or don't take.

Check online for what can be recycled locally.,
Separate and look at the material of each product.,
Clean and take apart all items.,
Arrange recyclables into piles.,

Recycle caps or hard plastic with Aveda.,
Turn in empty makeup containers for a free product with MAC.,
Combine old lipsticks into a new color.,
Transform your compact into an emergency sewing kit.,
Turn old compact mirrors into wall art.",How to Recycle Beauty Products," Before you start going through your leftover makeup and beauty supplies, check online for the rules of recycling in your city. The laws for recycling can vary from place to place. While you may be aware of the standard recycling practices of your area, you should still check to see which materials are acceptable to be recycled with regular items like cardboard and plastic bottles.Many beauty products are made from plastics that are harder to recycle and are not accepted in some cities.;
, Check each of your items for a small triangle with a stamped number. This number refers to the type of plastic the product is made of and how it can be recycled. For example, while numbers one, two, four, and five are considered safe and can usually be placed outside with normal curbside recycling, numbers three, six, and seven are harder plastics and may require specialized recycling.Keep in mind that some smaller beauty products may not have a number indicating what plastic they’re made from. For these items, look the product up online. For example, if it's a Clinique product, go to the Clinique website and search for the item to see details regarding it.

, Once you’ve researched what’s acceptable in your area, start going through and cleaning your leftover products. Take apart spray bottles by removing the cap, and separating the tops, springs, and bottles. Try to clean out any leftover residue, as well. Rinse each product in warm water and dish soap, scrubbing with a kitchen sponge if necessary.


You can also soak bottles or makeup pots overnight.

, Generally, cardboard, glass containers, metal lids or caps, plastic bottles (one, two, and six) and steel/tin cans can be recycled with regular curbside recycling. However, for empty Aerosol cans, bottle caps, and three, four, five, and seven, plastics you will need to check with your local recycling. Also, if your product has a mirror, try to reuse it rather than tossing it away. For plastic wrap and waxed cardboard, place them into the trash to be taken to a landfill.If you have your own compost, any corn-based plastic can be thrown there.

, Once you’ve checked which plastics are accepted with your local recycling, you can place those items out with the rest of your recyclables. Depending on your area, you may be provided a blue bin or garbage can for recycling that will be picked up once a week. This may be with your usual garbage collection or on an entirely different day. You can also take your recycling directly to a local recycling facility in your area.

, For items that you aren’t sure on, for example, the ones without a number indicating the plastic used, try shipping to Terracycle. This is Garnier’s Personal Care and Beauty Recycling Program. All you need to do is clean up your used beauty products, put them into a box, and then go to the Terracycle website. From the site you can print out a free shipping label to attach to your package. Some areas even have local Terracycle collection facilities., Similar to Garnier, Estee Lauder also offers a place to turn in used beauty products. You can search locally for an Origins store in your area, or you can go the Estee Lauder counter in a department store to turn in your recyclables. They are willing to accept all cosmetic containers, even the ones you feel aren’t able to be recycled. Just make sure you have cleaned everything properly before you turn it in., For the thicker, harder to recycle plastic like the caps of makeup pumps or plastic soda bottles, try turning them into Aveda’s Full Circle recycling program. You can find these locations at any of the Aveda retail stores across the U.S. Simply pack your cleaned items into a box or bag and turn them in over the counter., If you commonly use MAC products, hold onto your empty items until you get six. The type of makeup product doesn’t matter, it can be an eyeshadow palette, a paint pot, lipstick, or primer. Once you have six empty ones, go to any MAC store or counter in a department store and turn them in for a free makeup product like a lipstick., If you've come down to the end of your lipstick, try reviving it by mixing it with another color. Simply take both lipstick stubs and place them into a large metal spoon. Then hold that spoon over an open flame until the lipsticks melt. Stir the mixture with a knife and then pour it into an empty lipstick tube. Place the new lipstick into the refrigerator to harden overnight.You can also take an old lipstick and turn it into a lip-gloss. All you need to do is mix the leftover lipstick with an equal amount of petroleum jelly.

, Take an old solid foundation or powder compact and remove any leftover makeup. Once clean, glue a small piece of felt or a sponge into the open area. Once dry, place a needle or two into the felt/sponge along with some thread. You can also store buttons in the compact if you have room., If you have a multitude of old beauty products with mirrors, use them to create a unique piece of art. For example, use small, circular mirrors to create a larger mirror. You can do this by separating the mirrors and spray painting their backs the same color. Then, simply organize the mirrors into a pattern and glue them to a piece of wood to hang on your wall."

Know what can and cannot be recycled.,
Recycle paper.,
Know what types of plastic are recyclable.,
Learn how to recycle metal.,
Recycle glass.,
Clean recyclables before sorting.",How to Recycle at Home1," In general, you can recycle paper, plastic, metal, and glass. Do not assume, however. There are exceptions and particular rules that apply to each material category. Read the recycling policies for your local recycling center to learn which items they'll take.;
, Assume that all paper products are recyclable unless they contain some attached metal or plastic component. Fill your paper bin with newspaper, magazines, cardboard, envelopes, egg cartons – anything made completely from paper.Paper products are shredded, mulched, and reformed into recycled paper. Create separate bins for your newspapers; your magazines, envelopes, printer paper, and glossy paper; and your cardboard.Look out for hidden plastic and metal components. A paper milk or broth carton, for instance, might be sealed with an interior metal (non-recyclable) lining to preserve the contents. You'll need to remove any non-paper components before giving paper products to a recycling program.
Consider making recycled paper at home. The process is relatively simple, and you can use it to dramatically reduce the amount of paper waste that flows out of your home!

, As a general rule of thumb: if it holds its shape, it can be recycled; if it doesn't hold its shape, it goes to the landfill. Thus, a plastic peanut butter tub or a plastic restaurant takeout box would be recyclable. You would not, however, be able to recycle an amorphous plastic bag or a six-pack soda can connector. Learn about the seven categories of plastic waste!1: PET (Polystyrene Terepthalate): This is one of the most common plastics used in consumer products. You can find it in most water bottles and soda bottles, as well as some packaging. PET is almost always recyclable.
2: HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene): This is the stiff plastic found in milk jugs, toys, soap bottles, and some plastic bags – even park benches and waste bins. It is the most commonly recycled plastic because the process is comparatively easy and safe.
3: PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride): PVC is not recyclable. This category of plastic is soft and flexible: it is used to make everything from clear plastic food wrapping to garden hoses to plastic pipes to children's toys. PVC contains a number of toxins that can leach out throughout its life cycle.
4: LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene): This category is commonly used to make shrink-wrap, squeezable bottles, grocery bags, and garment bags. It is safer and less toxic than many other plastics. LDPE is not often recycled, but more and more communities are taking steps to handle this material.
5: PP (Polypropylene): This is recyclable through some curbside programs, but it is rarely recycled in the U.S. PP is often used as a barrier against moisture in chemicals: in products like plastic liners, disposable diapers, yogurt containers, straws, and packing tape. Ask your recycling program if they recycle PP!
6: PS (Polystyrene): This cheap, lightweight plastic goes into egg cartons, styrofoam cups, plastic cutlery, ""packing peanuts,"" and laminate flooring. Polystyrene is carcinogenic, and it is one of the plastic types that most permeates the world's oceans and landfills. PS can be safely recycled, but most programs are not equipped to do so.
7: Other (BPA, Polycarbonate, and LEXAN): Category #7 is a catch-all for various polycarbonate and ""other"" plastics, which are usually not recyclable. Products containing #7 plastic include disposable coffee pods, baby bottles, and car parts. One notable exception is PLA plastic, made from bio-based polymers, which is compostable but still falls into category 7.

, The average recycling center is only equipped to recycle steel and aluminum. Thus, recycle your steel and aluminum cans: beverage containers, food storage, and aerosols. Be sure to wash and sort your aluminum food packaging, as well – pie plates, dinner trays, and foil., Be sure to recycle your used glass jars and bottles! Glass is recycled by color: brown, green, and clear. Sort your glass before you bring it to a recycling program. It doesn't matter if the glass breaks into shards – it is usually melted down and reshaped into new bottles. If you are able to keep the bottles whole, however, many U.S. states offer a small refund for each whole, empty bottle that you return to a local grocery store.Do not store your bottles in the same bin as used lightbulbs, mirrors, sheet glass, and pyrex. These products are made from a different type of glass than bottles, and they are usually not recyclable.

, Many recycling centers will not accept items that constitute more than 10% food waste. Rinse out your plastic containers, your glass bottles, and your aluminum food packaging before you try to recycle them. It won't take long, and you will make the job much easier for everyone else involved.

Sort your recycling at home.",How to Recycle at Home2," Some regions offer curbside pickup for recycling, while other communities feature municipal or commercial drop-off sites. Ask your neighbors, visit the website for your city or county, or run a web search for ""recycling in ."" Find out what you can and cannot recycle through these programs.


Find out if there's anything that your local recycling center will not recycle. Some centers, for instance, are not equipped to handle certain types of plastic. Every recycling program is different.
Find out whether you need to sort your recycling. Some centers require you to separate out different materials before dropping them off, while other centers will sort through mixed waste to pick out the recyclable items. As a general rule, drop-off sites require you to sort your recycling, while curbside pickup programs will take a mix., If your community features some sort of municipal recycling pickup, make sure that you have a city- or county-issued recycling bin. Place your recyclable waste into the ""recyclables"" bin, and place your non-recyclable waste into the ""garbage"" or ""landfill"" bin. Find out when your community's trash pickup day is. When you place your trash out on the curb, put the recycling bin out as well.


Some regions even offer a curbside compost pickup! Learn about the difference between composting and recycling.
If your recycling is not picked up on trash day, try to get in contact with someone from the city's recycling program. Call the city manager, or run a web search to find a contact number for the recycling center. Find out why your bins were not picked up, and ask about what you'll need to do to get them to the recycling center.

, If you plan to take your recyclable items into a commercial or municipal drop-off point, then you will probably need to separate the different materials from one another. Establish separate bins for metal, plastic, paper, and glass. This way, when you drop off the recycling bins, you won't have to do any additional sorting – and neither will the workers at the recycling center.


You can place the items into bags – but remember that plastic bags are not recyclable! You'll need to take the waste out of the bags before you drop if off.
Make sure that everyone in your household knows which items can and cannot be recycled. Try making an informational sign or handout to post near the recycling bin.

Repurpose before you throw out.,
Compost food waste.,
Donate.",How to Recycle at Home3," Consider how something might still be useful even after it has fulfilled its original purpose. Many consumer products are designed to be thrown away after a single use – but with a bit of care, you can learn to break the cycle.


Look for ways to recycle items into home decor: turn old boots into planter pots, sew clothing into blankets, and use old wine bottles as candle holders.
Think about how you can repurpose a ""used"" item into something functional. Wash out old condiment jars and use them for drinking or storage; use old clothes as cleaning rags; and consider rinsing out slightly-used Ziploc bags for a second use., You can ""recycle"" organic matter (paper, leftovers, coffee grounds) at home by mulching it together into a compost pit or compost bin. As the food waste decays, it will gradually turn into soil with the help of worms or other insects. You can spread the composted soil onto your garden, or you can donate it to a local farmer!

, Think carefully before you throw something away. Even if you don't know how you yourself will reuse an item, there is a chance that someone else will be able to use it. Consider taking loads of old clothes, media, and household ephemera down to a local Goodwill or community thrift store.


Try using community websites like Craigslist and Freecycle to find homes for unused items that you want to sell or give away. Before you throw something away, ask your friends, your family, and your neighbors if they can use it.Most Goodwill centers feature a drop-off point where you can bring your still-usable things, no questions asked. Look around: there may be other thrift stores or distribution centers in your area that offer a similar service."

Create a recycling bin for your home.,
Find out where your city’s large recycling centers are located.,
Earn money by recycling aluminum cans.",How to Recycle Aluminum1," Make it easier to remember to recycle aluminum by designating a bin for all of your recyclables. Place the bin in your kitchen so that it will serve as a reminder to recycle as you are cooking and eating. This bin can be a regular trash can that now only accepts recyclables, a plastic container, or even a brown paper bag. Place your recycling bin next to your trash can and make sure that your whole family knows what can and cannot go in it. Of course, aluminum products like soda cans and foil can definitely be placed in the bin.


If you need help remembering what items can be recycled, make a list of those items and tape it to your new recycling bin.;
, These recycling centers are where you can bring your recyclables, including aluminum. The center generally has separate bins where your aluminum, glass, and paper are separated. If you are not sure where your town’s center is located, run an internet search or contact your city government. In most cases, the recycling center will be operated by the Wastes Services Department.You can also go to www.earth911.org to look for aluminum recycling near you.

, Many recycling plants will actually pay for aluminum products that you bring to their on-site facility or to one of their recycling machines that may be located throughout your community. This is because aluminum is the most recyclable materials--in fact, 100% of an aluminum can can be recycled to create a new aluminum can. If you don’t know where your local recycling plant is, run an internet search to find its address.


If you bring in 20 cans, you will receive roughly $1.00 in the United States. Start saving up your aluminum cans.
In the United States, more than $800,000,000 is paid for aluminum cans brought to recycling plants each year.

"
"
Lobby for a curbside recycling program if your community doesn’t have one.,
Give your aluminum cans to charities.,
Start a recycling program at work.",How to Recycle Aluminum2," Most towns and cities provide their residents with a curbside recycling program that occurs on the same day as garbage day. Trucks come buy and pick up your recyclables, which should be placed in the large blue recycling bin provided by the program. As the most recyclable material, aluminum is always a part of curbside recycling. To get this program going in your community, you should:


Raise the awareness of other members of your community. Pass out flyers discussing why recycling is important and what a curbside recycling program could do for your community. For instance, explain to them that throwing away a single aluminum can, rather than recycling it, is like dumping out six ounces of gasoline.
Talk with leaders of your local government. Explain to them that you and other community members think it is very important that a curbside program gets implemented.Create a petition and get community members to sign in it to show your local government that you are serious.

, Many charities, school classes, and scouting programs pay for projects and services with money earned by recycling items like aluminum. All you have to do is bring a bag of your recyclables--including your aluminum cans--to the organization’s drop off point. To find any organizations that might be running a recycling donation program in your area, check out your community boards, contact local schools, or run an online search.


Habitat for Humanity, which is located in many different regions, often runs a Cans for Habitat program that will happily accept any recyclable donations., In particular, aluminum recycling is really important in the work place. In fact, employees average two and a half canned drinks each day--those cans are all made out of aluminum. Ask your boss to invest in some recycling cans that can be placed next to the trash cans in the office. If she or he is busy but gives you the go ahead, purchase some large trash cans in bright colors and label them as recycling cans. If recycling is really new to your office, send out an email or hang up a flyer next to the recycling bin informing the other employees about what can and cannot go into the recycling bin.

Know which states and countries have bottle deposit laws.,
Locate nearby deposit and recycling centers.,
Know what items are accepted at deposit centers.,
Look for labels showing that the can or bottle is a deposit container.",How to Recycle Aluminum Cans and Plastic Bottles and Earn Cash1," The first U.S. state to enact bottle deposit legislation was Oregon in 1971, at the direction of then-governor Thomas Lawson McCall. Bottle deposit laws place a value on each beverage container sold; consumers pay the deposit when they buy the beverage and can return the empty container to reclaim the deposit. In practice, however, many people discard the containers, so by collecting them, you can turn them in yourself for the deposit money.


For a current list of the states that have bottle deposit laws and what items they take, see http://www.bottlebill.org/legislation/usa/allstates.htm.
For a list of countries outside the United States that have bottle deposit laws, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_deposit_legislation.;
, Recycling centers, which pay for aluminum cans by weight, are usually located on the grounds of firms that deal in scrap metal or paper. (Those located on the grounds of paper dealers often pay for old paper, as well.) Deposit centers, which pay money for aluminum cans and plastic bottles by the number of containers, are found on or near the grounds of supermarkets and beverage stores, either within the store or adjacent to it.


Most deposit centers have a limit as to how many containers a person or group may turn in per day. Limits range from as few as 48 to as many as 500, with 144 to 150 being among the most common.

, All the states with bottle deposit laws will accept aluminum cans and plastic bottles used to hold carbonated beverages (beer and soda pop), while some states may take containers for such non-carbonated beverages as wine, liquor or bottled water. In addition, most store-based deposit centers will redeem only containers of the brands they sell at their location.


Recently, a number of deposit centers are also requiring that certain beverage containers bear a stamp indicating that the item came from that store or the distributor who wholesaled the beverage to that store.
Cans and bottles are usually required to be clean, empty, relatively intact and able to stand upright. It is possible to straighten bent cans by inserting a wooden or metal rod into the can and pushing out against the sides of the can. (Don't push hard enough to tear the can's sides, however.) Plastic bottles can be straightened in the same fashion or by blowing air into them.

, Aluminum cans are labeled as deposit containers either by having the label stamped into the container top or printed on the bottom. Bottles have the information printed on the neck or side labels and sometimes directly on the bottle or the side of its cap.


Because cans are stamped and bottles are labeled at the bottling plant, these deposit label identifiers identify all the states where the container can be redeemed for a deposit. The can or bottle may not necessarily be distributed to one of these states, however; it is possible to get a container with a deposit that's not valid in your state
Remember, if a can or bottle lacks a deposit identifier, you can still recycle it, either by taking it to a recycling center or through your city's curbside recycling program.

Gather a sufficient number of cans and bottles.,
Separate deposit from non-deposit containers.,
Separate deposit cans from deposit bottles.,
Organize your deposit cans and bottles by brand.,
Turn your cans and bottles in.",How to Recycle Aluminum Cans and Plastic Bottles and Earn Cash2," Turning in a few pounds of aluminum cans or a 6- or 12-pack of plastic soda bottles at a time won't earn you much money, and you'll likely spend more in fuel costs turning them in than you make. Try to gather at least the maximum number of deposit containers that a deposit center accepts and/or several garbage bags full of non-deposit aluminum cans; you can always visit more than one deposit center to turn everything in, if necessary.


While gathering aluminum cans and plastic bottles, you can store the containers in your garage or basement during the winter or outside in good weather. But be aware that the sugar in the soda residue in the containers will attract ants, bees and wasps.

, Aluminum cans and plastic bottles with deposit identifiers go to the deposit center, aluminum cans without a deposit identifier go to an aluminum recycling center and plastic bottles without deposit identifiers go into your recycling bin.


Non-deposit aluminum cans can be crushed so they take up less space and so you can turn more of them in at a given time in fewer bags than if you didn't crush them. Deposit cans will not usually be accepted if crushed, however.

, Most deposit centers require cans and bottles to be separated from each other. Bottles can be placed in cardboard boxes or plastic milk crates, while aluminum cans need to be placed on cardboard flats, the shallow boxes in which cans are delivered to the grocery store. These flats usually hold 24 cans apiece, which will help you count the number of containers you have and get a rough idea of how much money you'll get when you cash in.


Most deposit centers have a number of empty flats on which you can organize your cans before you turn them in. You can also get flats in advance to organize your cans before you go.

, Although not required, you can speed your time through the deposit center by organizing your containers by brand. (This also makes it easier for the center to return your boxes and flats to you if you want them back.) Grocery stores get different brands of beverages from different distributors, and just as you return your empty containers to the store, they return the empty containers to the distributor who sold the beverage to them, requiring them to sort the containers by product line before they can be sent off to the correct distributor. Most distributors deal in the 3 largest soda companies: Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Dr. Pepper/7-Up. Below is a partial list of products sold by each company:


Coca-Cola: Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Sprite, Fresca, Mr. Pibb, Barq's, Fanta, Tab
PepsiCo: Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Pepsi Free, Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew, Sierra Mist
Dr. Pepper/7-Up: Dr. Pepper, 7-Up, Diet 7-Up, Cherry 7-Up, A&W Root Beer, Crush, Diet Rite. Squirt
Store-brand deposit containers can be turned in only at the deposit center of the store that sells the product. Keep these cans and bottles separate from the national brands you turn in at another store's deposit center.

, It helps to know in advance how many cans and bottles you're turning in, as many deposit centers will ask you how many containers you have instead of counting them for you. Any cans or bottles the store doesn't sell will be returned to you, along (usually) with your emptied flats and boxes. You may either be paid at the center itself or given a receipt to take to the store to receive your money."

, If you spill any oil onto your work area, do not hose down the area to clean it up. Instead, spread an absorbent material like sawdust or cat litter on the spilled oil, and then bag the soaked material in a leak-proof bag for recycling.

, Saving the original container is the easiest method, but any clean plastic container with a tight-fitting lid will work. Use a funnel when filling the container to minimize spills.

Make sure the recycling bins are abundant and clearly marked. Place them in several areas in the office that are logical to the types of materials you are recycling. For example, put a paper recycling bin in the mail room and an aluminum can receptacle in the cafeteria and break room.

,


Let those who are truly invested help keep the program running, giving those who wish to participate an active role. The simpler it is for some, the more likely they will continue to participate.

Recycle drink cans.,
Get rid of metal hangers.,
Recycle food containers.,
Collect household hardware like brass and copper.",How to Recycle Metals1," Typically made of aluminum, soda, beer and other beverage cans are 100 percent recyclable.Check to see if your city or town has a cash for cans system.;
, While you can’t recycle metal hangers in your blue bin, you can bring them into a local dry cleaner, who will likely take them off your hands. Ask about any discounts or cash back for turning in metal hangers.

, Coffee tins, vegetable cans, aluminum foil and bakeware are all recyclable in your blue bin.Get rid of all the contents and rinse the containers with water before recycling.
Remove food scraps and oils as well.

, Sort out old home furnishings like keys, door handles, light fixtures and scraps from plumbing pipes, gutters, air conditioners and more.While brass isn’t the highest priced item at a scrap yard, the return can quickly add up because of how dense the metal can be.

Use a magnet and see if it sticks.,
Check recycling guidelines and regulations.,
Clean your metals.",How to Recycle Metals2," If a magnet sticks to the metal is is ferrous, and if it doesn’t it is non-ferrous. A standard magnet from your fridge will work perfectly for this test.


Non-ferrous metals include copper, aluminum and brass.
Steel and iron, which is a ferrous metal.
Copper, brass, aluminum, stainless steel and bronze are very valuable to recycling centers and scrap yards.

, Most recycling pick-up companies accept metal, so unless the metal you have is valuable, recycle it in your blue bin. You can make the most money on aluminum, brass and copper at the scrap yard.


Bronze, cast iron, steel and tin are all recyclable in the blue bin.

, Make sure that all the metals that you are recycling are thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed off debris and food particles. Empty out cans and remove labels if need be.


Cleaning will help you get more money at a scrap yard because that’s less labor that they have to do themselves.

Recycle wiring.",How to Recycle Metals3," Get pricing for the metals you have and ask how long each scrap yard will honor the prices. Be specific about the amount of each type of metal you have so you can accurately shop around.iScrap is an app and online directory where you can find the nearest scrap yards and their information.
Some scrap yards offer pick-up service at a cost. Ask ahead of time how much it will cost to have the materials collected as well as how much the materials are worth.

, Start by separating out ferrous from non-ferrous metals. Depending on the amount of metal you have, you can also sort out stainless steel, copper, aluminum, lead, brass and bronze.You cannot have other recyclable materials with your metals if you’re going to a scrap yard. Having paper, cardboard, wood, plastic or glass in your pile may result in the entire pile being rejected.

, Copper or aluminum insulated wiring doesn’t have to be stripped, but doing so will make you double or triple the amount of money if you’re taking it to a scrap yard. Purchase a wire stripper to get the job done.Wire strippers can cost anywhere from $10 to more than $100. If you have a small bundle of wire to strip, a less expensive tool should suffice, but if you have a large load a more sophisticated tool will help.

, This helps to promote recycling.

, Most things made from recycled products advertise this fact, so that you know you are helping the environment when you purchase them.

, Keep a recycle bin or bag in your home to place plastic, paper and cans. Carry these recycle items to your recycling station. Some towns offer curb side recycling.

, You can also use newspaper and other biodegradable items to make compost.

, Use these bags in place of plastic or paper bags that will be thrown away. Reuse the cloth bags each time you shop.

, Sometimes, 1 person's trash is another person's treasure. This is a wonderful way to recycle items.

, An example would be to wash and reuse plastic containers rather than using plastic baggies and throwing them in the trash.

, For example, make a pencil holder out of a metal can.

, Soft drink bottles sometimes offer a deposit for returning to the store. Computer ink cartridges can be returned and refilled.

, Avoid throwing items away unnecessarily. Borrow items that you might only use occasionally. Try to fix an item rather than throwing it away, or see if someone else can fix it for you.

, You will save money in the long run and keep these items out of landfills.

, Talk about reducing solid waste in the schools and at community events. Promote ways to reduce solid waste in public service announcements on the radio and television.

Donate your organic materials to local farmers or community gardens.",How to Recycle Biodegradable Waste," Collecting compostable material requires little additional work—you simply place organic items, such as food waste and scraps in a collection container separate from your trash can. While you may purchase a designated indoor compost bin, many people collect their food scraps and waste in repurposed plastic food containers, trash cans, or compostable bags. After preparing or eating meals, place your food scraps into a compost collection bin.


Acceptable items include table scraps, fruit, vegetables, and eggshells. These items are considered “green” waste as opposed to “brown” waste.
If you are participating in a public or private program, only place approved compostable materials in your bin.
If you are composting in your backyard, do not save meat and fish products for your compost pile—these items attract rodents and pests.
Store your collection bin under the kitchen sink, on the kitchen counter, in your fridge, or in your freezer.;
, If you are composting in your backyard, your pile should include about 50% green waste or manure. These items, which introduce nitrogen into your pile, serve as a catalyst to the compost process. Table scraps and food waste are just two forms of green manure. Other green waste items include:


Grass clippings
Clover
Buckwheat
Wheatgrass
Coffee Grounds
Tea leaves or tea bags
Store these items in an outdoor yard waste bin., Brown waste should make up the other 50% of your compost pile. The brown waste adds carbon to your compost pile. You may find brown waste items both inside your home and outside in your yard. These items include:


Shredded newspaper
Shredded paper
Shredded brown paper bags
Dead branches
Twigs
Leaves
Straw
Untreated sawdust, Cities across Europe and the United States have committed to reducing or eliminating their residents' waste. In an effort to achieve this goal, these cities have established curbside composting programs. For more information on your community’s public program or to determine if your city provides this service, call your city’s waste management facilities of visit its website.


Inquire about the cost of the service.
Ask if the city provides indoor and curbside collection bins.
Ask how frequently the city picks up compostable material. Do they collect it twice a week, once a week, every two weeks, etc.?, When you contact your city's waste management facilities or search its website, inquire about or look for instructions on signing-up for the service. Every city’s sign-up process will be slightly different. To join the program, you may need to fill out an online form or send in a paper copy of the contract.Before opting into the city program, renters, especially those in apartments, should contact their landlords.
If your building already participates in the city’s program, your landlord may be obligated to provide you with all of the necessary equipment and information. They may also be required to provide tenants with a central composting location.If your complex is not currently involved in the municipal composting program, head up the initiative to join the composting movement., Once you have joined the program, your local municipality may provide you with the equipment and educational resources you need to start composting. The equipment provided may include an indoor collection bin, an outdoor bin, and/or compostable bags. The city may also provide you with a set of instructions, a list of approved biodegradable materials, and a list of unaccepted organic materials.


The indoor collection bin is typically intended for your kitchen. Many people store this bin under the kitchen sink or on their kitchen counter. Line your inside bin with a compostable bag, newspaper, or a brown paper bag to keep it clean. If you are concerned about the smell or mess, you may also freeze or fridge all of your compostable food materials.The outdoor collection bin is emptied by city workers. If you live in an apartment building, you may be required to share this outdoor collection bin with other residents.
If the city does not provide an indoor composting bin, you can find composting containers at many kitchen supply stores or purchase one online. You can also use takeout containers, food containers, pails with lids, or lined trash cans with lids.
Read the guidelines for your city's composting program. Make note of the correct procedures and your city’s approved compostable materials., Throughout the week, place your organic materials into your indoor compost bin. You can also collect biodegradable materials in your home office, bathrooms, and bedrooms. When your biodegradable collection bins are full, add the contents to your outdoor compost bin. On your a designated compost pick-up day, leave your outdoor bin at the curb each week. Once the bin is emptied, bring it in from the curb.


Your city may have specific requirements regarding the placement of the pin.
If you live in an area that receives a lot of snow, you may have to shovel a path from the street to your bin.
Officials may contact you if you fail to comply with the city’s procedures and rules., In order to compost in your backyard, you need to build or purchase a composting container. This container should be placed in a shady location that is near a source of water. Types of containers include:


Homemade Containers: Construct your own round or square composting container out of fence posts and wire mesh siding, fence posts and lattice, or brick and wood. Build a structure that is at least three feet wide and three feet deep.Compost Bins: This product, also known as a compost digester, is enclosed on the top and sides. Its open bottom sits directly on the ground. While these bins are small and inexpensive, it is difficult to turn the compost pile inside of them.
Compost Tumblers: These rotating composting containers are the most effective and mobile bins on the market. The rotating drum makes it easy to turn and aerate the compost. The drum also serves as insulation, which keeps the composting materials at the ideal temperature year round. The center paddle helps to aerate the compost and prevents the materials from clumping., Begin your compost pile in late spring or summer when it is hot and slightly damp. Organic materials must be placed thoughtfully and carefully in the compost pile. A well laid out compost pile will promote drainage and aeration while deterring clumping and rotting. Place your biodegradable materials in thin, even layers.


Place brown waste, specifically twigs and straw, on the bottom of the pile to encourage drainage. This layer should be a few inches thick.
Add alternating layers of moist and dry green and brown waste. Keep this layers thin to avoid clumping. Moist items include food scraps, food waste, coffee grounds, and tea bags. Dry items include straw, twigs, leaves, and untreated sawdust., In order for the microorganisms to breakdown the green and brown waste into compost, the pile must remain moist, warm, and well aerated. Monitor your pile frequently.


Your compost should maintain the moisture of a damp sponge. If it is too dry, add water to the pile with a hose or let the rain water it naturally. If it is too wet, your organic materials may rot instead of compost.
Your compost pile should retain an interior temperature between 135° to 160° F. You can monitor the temperature with a thermometer. Covering your compost pile with a lid, carpet squares, wood, or a tarp will help regulate the temperature of the pile.In order for the compost process to work, your pile must have a sufficient amount of air. Add oxygen to your pile by turning it every two to four weeks. You can turn the pile with a pitchfork or rotate your compost tumbler., When your compost pile is well developed, you can introduce new green waste and green manure to the compost. These products add nitrogen to the pile. The nitrogen serves as a catalyst for the composting process.


Use a pitchfork to add and mix in green manure to your pile. Acceptable green manure items include grass clippings, buckwheat, wheatgrass, and clover.
Bury new vegetable, fruit, and food scraps at least ten inches below the top of the pile., Once the material at the bottom of your pile is a rich dark brown, the compost is ready for use. This can take anywhere from two months to two years.


Open up your composting container and empty its contents onto the ground.
Add the compost to your garden, vegetable patch, or orchard., If your city does not offer a public composting service, search for a private composting business in your area. Select a business and a plan that is within your price range, meets your needs, and fits into your schedule. Once you sign-up for the service, the business will typically provide you with a composting bin or bags.


Many services will take the full bin and leave you with a sanitized bin.
If you do not produce much food waste, find a service that will pick up your compostable materials every two weeks or once a month.
If you are interested in using compost in your yard, select a service that provides you with compost for free or at a discounted rate., Instead of paying for a public or private composting service, bring your organic materials to a designated biodegradable waste drop off site. These sites may be operated by the city, private organizations, or nonprofits. Before bringing your materials to one of these locations, make sure all of the items in your compost bin or bags adhere to the site’s standards.


Find these drop off sites through a quick internet search.
Instead of paying for your city’s composting service, you may be allowed to bring biodegradable materials to a drop-off site yourself., Giving your biodegradable materials away is an excellent ways to support the farmers and systems that produce food for your community. Contact farmers and community gardens in your area to see if they accept organic donations.


This is a great option for business and restaurants looking to cut costs while giving back to the community.
Some farmers and gardens may already have drop off boxes for composting donations."

Call your local collection center to begin a recycling pick-up service.,
Check if your city requires pre-sorted recycling.,
Research any specific laws or regulations regarding recycling in your area.,
Know the types of paper and cardboard that you can recycle.,
Know the types of plastic that can be recycled.,
Know the types of metal that can be recycled.,
Keep objects intact when recycling them.,
Collect and bring your recycling can to the curb the night before pick up.,
Save returnable cans and bottles to make some money back.,
Know the things that you can't recycle.",How to Recycle1," To find recycling in your city or town, you can check RecyclingCenters.org. Know, however, that most cities offer free recycling, including the can to hold it, which means all you have to do is start sorting. Ask a neighbor or call your city's waste department to find out what days collection occur.


If you don't have a recycling can, be sure to call your municipal waste department to talk over your options.
If you live far from town, you may have to bring your own recycling into a center for processing. Find one at RecyclingCenters.org.;
, Single-stream recycling is when all recyclables go into the same can and the city deals with sorting paper from plastic, glass, etc. However, many cities require that you separate your paper, plastic, and glass into separate containers before you give it to them. It is much easier to sort the recycling ahead of time instead of on trash day, so ask a neighbor or check online for your city's specific policy.


If your city allows single-stream, you likely have only one can for trash.
If your city requires sorting, you will likely need to have three separate cans for paper, plastic, glass, and metal.

, 95% of recycling laws are the same across each city, but there are sometimes small particulars. To make it easier, the site RecycleByCity.com has a breakdown of major rules and regulations for a variety of cities. Be sure to check in if you're unsure. If your city isn't here, search for your city's recycling laws online.


Note that most recycling cans have all the pertinent guidelines written on them. You can also find your city's waste department website for specific information.

, Almost all paper, as long as it isn't food soiled, can be recycled. This includes mail, newspapers, magazines, old books, egg cartons, cereal boxes, and gift wrap. When recycling paper, make sure any other materials, like strings or metal (such as found on high-end gift cards), is removed.

, If the plastic has the famous recycling triangle on it it can be recycled. This means empty bottles (caps removed), containers, cups, bags, plastic utensils, and more can all hit the recycling can. Furthermore, all-plastic toys, coat hangers, waste baskets, and takeout trays can all be recycled too as long as they are clean.


Styrofoam, a type of plastic, can also be recycled. However, packing peanuts must generally be recycled in a closed plastic bag to prevent a mess.
Many cities request that loose plastic bags be bundled, making them less likely to fly out of the truck and create litter.

, Metal can be a bit trickier to recycle, but all of the most common waste is easily recycled. Aluminum and steel cans, foil trays, old pots and pans, and completely empty aerosol cans are all game for recycling. Be sure to check about bigger things, like shower curtains or all-metal furniture.

, While everyone loves the shredder, shredded paper actually is less useful when recycled, as more of it becomes waste. With aluminum cans, crushing them flat can sometimes prevent them from being recycled at all. The safest choice is to just leave everything whole as it goes in the can.In some cities, like Los Angeles, shredded paper can only be recycled if it is collected in a paper or plastic bag and labeled, ""Shredded Paper."" This is why looking into your city's regulations is so important.

, If your recycling pick-up is on Monday, bring the recycling to the curb on Sunday night. Pick-ups are frequently early in the morning, and it's best practice to just get it out there to avoid missing collection., In 10 US states you can return aluminum cans and glass bottles for a few cents a pop at your local recycling center. If not, these bottles and cans can be recycled with your normal collection service.


Keep the bottles and cans in separate containers while collecting them. Most places require you to weigh out or turn in aluminum and glass separately.
The ten US locations that allow returns are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Guam., Obviously, you can't recycle food. But did you know that many places don't accept napkins or paper towels at all, especially if they are dirty or greasy? While most things are obviously trash or recyclables, there are a few tricky objects that seem recyclable but are not. The following can not be recycled:


Pyrex glass
Drinking glasses
Foil-lined bags (such as chip, candy, and coffee packages)
Diapers
Greasy or food covered cardboard (you can tear off the clean parts, however)
Light bulbs
Batteries and electronics
Paint
Cleaners, oils, solvents, etc."

, There is a wealth of reputable information about recycling available online, suitable for kids to adults. Do a little research and spend some time learning about what can and cannot be recycled (and why), where recycling occurs in the world, and the items that recycled products end up as.

The US EPA has an excellent collection of recycling publications.
CalRecycle has lots of freely available publications on waste and recycling at: http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/Publications/.
Many of the industries involved in manufacturing products that can be recycled will also have recycling information on their websites. Look especially for manufacturers of metals, paper, glass, plastic, batteries, and steel.
Look for posters, books, games, calculators, and quizzes as well as reading material at online sites. There are many fun, interactive ways to learn about recycling.

, You can register the event with America Recycles Day and let them know what you're doing. There are lots of amazing things you can do to get into the recycling spirit, including:

Have a garage sale or yard sale, arrange a community swap meet, ask offices to give away their unwanted furniture to people who can use it, hold a garden tools swap meet, go shopping at a thrift store, exchange unwanted household goods and clothing, etc.
Make crafts from recycled items, sell recycled crafts and artwork, decorate and improve old clothes and shoes, make bird feeders from old items, make this year's Christmas cards from last year's cards, etc.
Collect and donate items such as eyeglasses, clothes, costumes, stationery, computers, fire extinguishers, ink cartridges, construction materials, etc.
Hold a recycled art and craft exhibition. Encourage all local residents to enter something they've made from recycled items. Award recycled prizes for the best entries and try to get the media interested so that the winners get their names in the paper or online.

, The easiest way to get an answer would be either at your town/city hall or at a local recycling center. Have plenty of time available should you need to wait. Write down any questions you have beforehand to avoid any forgetfulness. Be sure to write down a quick answer, too. Ask about when you can drop off recyclables and what kind of recyclables your center takes.

If you're unhappy with the extent of recycling offered in your area after you've received your information, why not follow it up with letters to your local authority making suggestions on possible improvements. Some suggestions might include asking the local authority to collect more kinds of recyclables, to provide better recycling facilities and bins, to encourage their own staff to collect recyclables at work, to compost and mulch garden waste and Christmas trees, to run programs that show people how to compost, etc.

, Collect items such as newspapers, soda cans, bottles, and whatever else your recycling center allows. Don't just save up your own. Get your friends, family, and neighbors involved! You can even offer rewards, if you so choose.

Recycle the items you've collected. Whether you have recycled a bottle or 200 bottles, you will have made a difference in the environment.
Learn how you can recycle batteries, cell phones, and other electronic things legally. Most town recycle centers have special requirements for these kinds of items, so should you get one from a recycle drive, inquire about the item before dropping it off.
Download a widget that lets you know whether or not an item can be recycled. America Recycles Day provides a free widget for download that takes the guesswork out of it for you.

, If family members and friends aren't yet convinced of the value of recycling, pointing out its benefits can help to improve their attitude toward it. For example, recycling not only clears the clutter out of your life but it helps to protect the environment by reusing resources rather than always seeking new resources, it provides jobs for people in the recycling industry, and on the fun side, recycling can burn calories as you sort the items and toss them into bins!

Know that lowering your total waste output is even better than recycling.,
Donate or reuse old clothing instead of sending it to a landfill.,
Rinse and reuse lightly-soiled plastic bags and containers.,
Prioritize reusable products over one-time containers.,
Buy recycled products over non-recycled versions whenever possible.",How to Recycle3," Whenever you can get multiple uses out of an object, you're greatly diminishing the wasteful manufacture of new products. While recycling is better for the planet than trash, the best thing to do is not to throw things out at all. Instead, try to find ways to reuse things around the house. Wikihow has a large list of ideas to get you started:


How to reuse Styrofoam
How to reuse balloons
How to reuse paint rollers
How to reuse old DVDs and CDs

How to reuse old newspapers and How to reuse paper

How to reuse old school supplies
How to reuse old candles
How to reuse junk materials

, Clothes should only be thrown out as a last resort, when they can no longer be used or worn by anyone. Turn old shirts into cleaning rags, cut up nice sweaters and pillowcases for a quilt, and hand down clothes that don't fit you to younger relatives. Clothing is one of the most frequently, and unnecessarily, wasted products on the planet.


Clothes you have no use for should be donated to the Salvation Army, Goodwill, and local charity drives.
Unsure where to bring your clothes? Check out the non-profit Wear Don't Recycle for ideas on reuse and donation centers near you., Don't just toss the takeout package into the recycling when done -- use it to pack up lunch for the next day at work. If a snack bag had nothing but some pretzels in it, give it a quick rinse and use it the next day as well. These tips not only save the planet, they help you to save money.

, Instead of buying a water bottle every day, bring your own and fill it up. Bring your own travel mug to the coffee shop instead of taking a new Styrofoam cup each day. Use washable dish towels, cloth napkins, and rags instead of paper products. Whenever possible, make an effort to not even create the trash in the first place.

, Help the recycling industry to flourish by preferring the products that come out of it. Some commonly recycled products you can purchase include:


Recycled paper. Select the brands with the highest post-consumer waste (PCW) content, which refers to how much reused pulp has been used to make the paper.
Insulation. There are various types of recycled insulation on the market.
Clothing. Some brands specialize in turning PET bottles into new outdoor jackets, and second-hand stores have great clothes for great prices.
Pens and pencils.
Countertops. Look for great designs that include broken glass pieces––these can look absolutely stunning!

A large basket is an excellent choice for some items, especially if you like to shop at a farmer's market. There are European made canvas collapsible shopping baskets that can be purchased from stores that sell bags or carrying items.
Making your own bags is a great excuse to salvage beautiful prints from clothing and other fabric items that are worn out or no longer fit but that you'd like to keep as a memento. The fabric still gets to be seen and you've got a useful item again!

, This is key to helping you remember to use them. Put them in places such as: in the car, on the doorknob for the next time you go out, in your purse, briefcase, or backpack you usually take to go out.

Put a bag, or a reminder of one, where you will see it when you leave for the store and when you enter the store.

, If you haven't, make the effort to go back and get it.

When grocery shopping, one way of dealing with forgetting your bag is to ask for your groceries to go back into the cart; then you can either pack them into bags or boxes left in your car, or you can stack them in the trunk. You'll soon learn to remember the bags!

, If you use the same notepad every time, write it on the new page as soon as you empty the last batch of bags.

Attach bags to your purse, your shopping list, or anything else you already take with you into stores. Some bags come with little hooks that make it easy to attach them to something else, or perhaps you could sew a hook or Velcro onto a reusable bag for such a purpose.

, Make taking in bags a regular part of your shopping routine. Habits take a few weeks to ingrain but persevere and soon it will become second nature to take a bag whenever you leave to shop.,

Use collapsible bags or reuse plastic ones. Have a couple of bags that are a thin enough material to fold or roll and store them in your purse or wallet as a backup for when you forget the usual reusable bags. Check out how to fold plastic bags to make them very compact and pocket sized., If you have kids and you take them shopping, explain why you want to take back bags, and put them in charge of helping you remember to take them in and of helping you to remember them.

Many stores refund a few cents per bag. Offer to pay this amount to your kids if they remind you to take in the bags before you remember. They won't need to be asked twice!

, As soon as you empty them, put them back in the car, on the doorknob, or wherever they normally should be placed, so that they're already with you next time., If you already have a cart going back to your car or if you only have a few things, simply ask that your items not be bagged. You can also ask for no bags if items already have ample packaging. Milk and boxed cereal are excellent things to leave unbagged. You'll have to be quick, though – many clerks bag things automatically.

Put the bags in front of or on top of your order or groceries on the conveyor belt, so that baggers and checkers notice them before they have the stuff to put in them.

Buy quality items that last.,
Buy bigger packages of food.,
Look for products with less packaging.,
Buy from the bulk bins.",How to Reduce Household Waste1," You've probably heard the saying, ""quality not quantity."" That adage applies when you're trying to reduce household waste. Buying higher quality items, including dishes, pans, clothing, toys, and most everything else, will reduce your waste overall because the items will last longer. You won't need to replace them as often.For instance, when you can, spring for the higher quality pot. It's more expensive, but it will last many more years.;
, When purchasing items like food, choose bigger packages over smaller to help reduce trash from packaging. For instance, a large box of cereal creates less waste than several smaller boxes of cereal that add up to the same amount.If you prefer individual servings, portion the food out into reusable containers when you get home. For instance, if you like small portions of pretzels, buy a big bag and then use small sealed containers to create individual portions.
Also, be sure to look for packaging that can be recycled, so you aren't contributing to the landfill.

, Today's society has bought into excessive packaging. Some items have two or three layers of packaging. If you see an item that seems to have an excessive amount of packaging, try looking for a different brand to see if it uses less., Bulk bins are becoming more popular, particularly in health food stores. With these bins, you simply scoop out the food (such as rice, flour, sugar, etc.) into a bag, which usually produces less waste than standard packaging. However, you can also bring reusable containers from home to make the purchase even greener."

Repair broken items.,
Buy reusable items.,
Use a reusable grocery bag.,
Unsubscribe from junk mail.,
Buy less overall.,
Donate old items.,
Have a yard sale.",How to Reduce Household Waste2," In our society, it's tempting to just throw out items when they break. However, if you're trying to reduce waste, try to repair the items instead. That way, you aren't just throwing it in the landfill. For instance, if the sole comes off your boot, take it to a cobbler instead of just throwing it out. If your television has a problem, get it repaired instead of going out to buy a new one. As an added bonus, repairs are usually cheaper than buying a new item., Instead of purchasing throwaway items like paper plates, plastic zip top bags, and one-time use batteries, opt for reusable items. Depend on washable plates and reusable containers and bags. Invest in rechargeable batteries so you're not always throwing them away. As an added bonus, this tip will save you money in the long term., Plastic grocery bags seem to multiply, particularly if you go shopping often. Of course, you may reuse some of them in your house, but you likely throw away a good number, too. The best solution is to bring reusable cloth grocery bags with you to the store. In addition to being reusable, they hold more than plastic bags, and they are less likely to bust on you.Store your canvas bags in your car or leave them hanging right beside your door as a reminder to use them.

, If you're like most people, you receive a large amount of mail that goes directly into the trash. Take steps to reduce that mail. You can call catalog companies and ask to be taken off the list, for instance, if you're not interested in seeing the catalog.You can also use websites like https://www.catalogchoice.org/ and https://dmachoice.thedma.org/ to cancel junk mail. The site https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t will let you opt out of credit card offers.

, In a consumerist society, you may feel the need to buy, buy, buy. However, the next time you're eyeing that new thing you want to buy, step back and ask yourself, ""Do I really need this?"" More often than not, the answer will be, ""No.""Before you buy, think about if you own something that could serve the same purpose. You may be able to repurpose something you already have to fill a need.
It also helps to avoid temptation by taking fewer trips to the store.

, When you're not using something anymore, try to find a place to donate it. Furniture, clothes, and other household items can be donated to thrift stores. Old books and magazines can be donated to libraries or schools. Donating items will help you reduce the trash you produce., If you hate to just give something away (after all, you paid good money for it), consider holding a yard sale instead. You likely won't pull in the big bucks, but you can make a little cash and clean out items from your house at the same time. Plus, you can donate anything you have leftover.Advertise your yard sale online or in the newspaper to increase attendance.
Spring and early summer, when it’s warm but not too hot, are excellent seasons for yard sales."

Repurpose old items.,
Compost what you can.,
Make a compost pile or bin.,
Recycle regularly.,
Designate an area in your kitchen just for recycling.",How to Reduce Household Waste3," When you're about to throw something out, think about if it could serve another purpose in your household. Often, even if it can't continue to serve its original purpose, it can be put to use doing something else.Use old t-shirts and towels as rags for household cleaning.
Clean grout and other small spaces with old toothbrushes.
Reuse containers you are going to throw out. For instance, fill paper egg cartons or the bottom of plastic beverage containers with potting soil and use them to plant seedlings. Alternatively, store food, office or craft supplies, or other small items in leftover glass jars.

, Composting is a great way to keep extra trash out of the landfill. In addition, you can use what you make to provide nutrients to your yard and garden. Basically, composting is where you take organic materials and let them decompose to create a fertilizer. You can compost everything from food scraps, coffee grounds, and eggshells to other household waste like clean, shredded paper, grass clippings, and ashes from the fireplace. Collect the items in a small, lidded container in your home., Most compost piles are outside. You can just have a pile that you turn periodically, but you can also use a wooden, open-sided bin or a wire mesh bin.If you don't have much outdoor space, you can also compost inside. You can purchase ready-made indoor compost pails, or create your own using two garbage cans of different sizes. Place a brick at the bottom of the larger can and add dead branches and/or leaves. Drill holes in the bottom and sides of the smaller can, and place it within the larger can.Your compost will be ready to use when it is dark brown and crumbly, usually after about three or four months. Incorporate it into your garden, or use it as nutrient-rich mulch.
If you don't have an interest in composting, some cities offer composting and mulching for items like tree branches and grass clippings.

, At the end of the day, you're still going to have some waste. The best option for this waste is to recycle it instead of putting it into the landfill. Most communities have recycling programs now, and you can recycle items like glass, plastic, paper, cans, and cardboard., It helps to have a separate trash can specifically for recycling, so you can separate it out as you toss out items. If your community requires it, you may need to separate different types of recycling. In that case, try having a small bin for each type.


Labeling the bins clearly can help ensure everything is recycled properly.
Check for the recycling symbol on the package before sticking it in the recycling. Always rinse off items before recycling. Also, you can't recycle items like pizza boxes that are covered in grease.Additionally, you should remove the lids from plastic bottles, which are not recyclable (unless your community advises otherwise)."

",How to Avoid Creating Trash," Can you make do with something you already have? The more you buy, the more trash you will create, so if you can make the items you already own do double duty, you will create less trash in the long run.;
,


Avoid buying items packaged in individual serving sizes. Buy one larger bag or bottle instead of many smaller ones. Since you are paying for less packaging and shipping, you may also pay less by buying in bulk.
Ask your butcher to wrap your meat in peach paper only, then attach the price on top to keep the paper folded. Peach paper is a strong, water- and oil-proof beef or pork wrapping paper normally used to split stages of meat inside a Styrofoam tray. It is available in rolls or in sheet.
Buy fresh, unpacked, fruits and vegetables.
Buy grains, pasta and dried fruit in bulk.
Look at whether the package is recyclable in your area before you buy.

, Both paper and plastic bags do the environment little good.



Bring a canvas bag with you to the store.
Ask store clerks not to bag items that have their own handles (milk, bottled laundry detergent) or already have bags (produce) or packages (cereal). Often, the package an item comes in is at least as convenient as putting that package in another bag.
Ask for no bags if you only bought items that you can easily carry or if the items are going straight from cart to car to kitchen.
Pack your purchases yourself. You can pack them your own way and save time and bags.
If you cannot avoid getting a plastic bag from the store, reuse it as a trash bag for the bathroom, bedroom or kid's room.

, Paper makes up about 30% of average American garbage.


Don't print pages if you can see the information on the computer screen.
Use a note-taking or journaling app to collect information you wish to save.
Receive and process bank statements, pay stubs, bills, and many other documents electronically.
Read newspapers and magazines online if they are available there.
Avoid collecting brochures and flyers. Were you going to read them, anyway? If you do want to follow up with somebody, take a business card, or take a photo of their literature or sign.
Use reusable gift bags. You can even make your own out of fabric.

, A few phone calls or web page visits can work wonders. It will save you time, clutter, and possibly money, too.

, Try Freecycle, Craigslist, or your local charity.

, You'll save money and reduce the demand for new products. Buying used is a direct form of recycling.

,


Use fabric napkins instead of paper napkins or paper towels. Find two or three per member of your family (hint: thrift stores and garage sales are a great source). If they do not all match and they are not too dirty, family members can use them for more than one meal.

Pack a waste-free lunch. Use a lunchbox, not a paper bag.
Use reusable food containers instead of plastic bags or prepackaged drinks, both in your lunch box and at home. If you do use plastic zipper bags for food storage, you can wash and reuse them several times. Do not reuse bags that contained meat.
Avoid using paper plates, paper or plastic tablecloths, and disposable flatware.
Use a washcloth instead of a disposable face wipe.
Use fabric, not paper, towels, in the kitchen and bathroom.
Clean with terry towels instead of paper towels or wipes.
Use cloth diapers, at least when you are at home. Wash the diapers instead of throwing them away.

Use a menstrual cup or washable fabric pads.

,


Buy only as much of something as you know you can use before it spoils. Plan your menus ahead, and aim for a one-week supply of perishable foods.
Portion what you take. If you can do with less than an entire paper towel, tissue, or dryer sheet, consider cutting it into smaller pieces.
Empty the trash without replacing the liner, unless the liner is heavily soiled. Separating especially messy trash, such as vegetable scraps for compost, will keep liners usable for longer. Reuse grocery bags for trash can liners wherever possible.
Use only as much soap and detergent as you need. Open your washer during the cycle. If the water feels slippery, and (in a top-loader) looks sudsy, try cutting back just a bit on the detergent you use, regardless of what the cup says. See how little shampoo and dish soap you need, too. Many products have concentrated ingredients. Remember, beyond the amount necessary to do the job, more soap does not mean cleaner. It just means more rinsing.
Cook at home. Raw ingredients often come with less packaging than prepared, boxed foods.

, It will cut down your yard and vegetable waste (often around 15% of the waste that households produce) and it will improve your soil and your garden without the use of chemical fertilizer. If you can use mostly materials you were producing anyway, such as grass clippings and fallen leaves, you will also save many trips to the nursery or hardware store to buy mulch and soil.

, If you and your neighbor both do your own gardening, do you each need your own lawnmower? Could you rent a tiller, pickup truck, or cement mixer for the day or week when you need it?


Use your local public library. Borrow books, music, movies, magazines, newspapers and then return them to share with others instead of creating more, or storing them forever.

, Don't throw out your vacuum cleaner if it isn't picking up. Check the bag and the belt and make sure the hoses are free of clogs. Take it to a shop and ask if you can't repair it yourself.

, Whenever possible, choose a product that you will use for a long time and be able to maintain and repair should it be necessary. It may cost a bit more up front, but it will save waste and money in the end.


Durability goes for style and fashion, too. It is not always possible to tell before buying something how soon it will be hopelessly out of date. However, it is usually possible to buy simple, classic styles that you like and can wear or display in your home for a long time.
Search the web for ""buy it for life,"" or the abbreviation ""BIFL."" You'll find forums and product recommendations for exceptionally durable products of all sorts, from tools and utensils to things you might not expect, such as socks. If you're looking for something and don't find a ""buy it for life"" recommendation, ask for one in a forum concerned with the topic.

Transportation (car insurance/maintenance, gas, bus fare)
Food (groceries every week/month)
Utilities (electricity, heating)
Cellphone, internet
Going out (drinks after work, with friends, or special meals)
Be as detailed as possible. Focus on how many times a week you go out for lunch or dinner, or buy a coffee. Add up a rough amount for each category. Are you overspending on your food expenses? The average household spends $500 a month on groceries. Are you overspending on going out for drinks or on extra activities (like the gym membership you never use)?;
, Determine where you can start to spend nothing. Start with the more leisurely expenses first, like going out with friends, or spending money on clothing.Think about your eating habits. Is there a way to reduce your food costs so you’re only buying essential foods or using pantry foods you already own?
Consider your transportation costs. Can you reduce or remove your car expenses by using your car less or using a bike or walking? Though it may be difficult to imagine life without a car, think about how much you spend every money on this expense, especially on gas.

, Many people who have tried Buy Nothing experiments for a year, or who have participated in the Buy Nothing project adjust their lifestyle with a partner, spouse, roommate, or as part of a larger group. Doing this challenge with one other person can motivate you to stick to your limited means and have fun buying nothing.There are several Buy Nothing groups online that do group events and provide tips on how to buy nothing for an extended period of time.Many Buy Nothing success stories are also done by roommates or a family who all decide to commit to a purchase free lifestyle., Now that you have isolated leisure spending you can reduce or cut from your budget, track your lower spending for a month. Start a blog about your Buy Nothing project, or take notes in a journal. Note how much money you save just by cutting out leisure expenses and activities. Now, multiply this amount by 12 to determine how much you could save in one year without these expenses. Consider this amount your buy nothing goal.There is a theory that it take 30 days to change a habit or adopt a new habit. After a month of lower to no spending on certain items or activities, you should start to notice you perceive items in a store or socialize at a restaurant or bar differently. You may start asking yourself, “Do I really need this?” before you buy something. More often than not, the answer will be “No”."

Moving into an unoccupied home. Some cities or areas have vacant dwellings that need some attention and care. A landlord may be willing to allow you to live rent free in a vacant home in exchange for fixing and upkeeping the home. You should inspect the home to determine how extensive the damage is to the foundation and structure. Look for a home you can maintain with a few basic tools and some hard work. Once it’s in living order, you can now occupy it, rent free.House sitting. When homeowners go away for extended periods of time, they look for trusted individuals to occupy and maintain their homes. In addition to house duties, and sometimes pet duties, you will be paid an hourly wage to take care of the property, ranging from $15/hr to a fixed monthly rate for longer jobs. Look for house sitting opportunities online, and always sign a contract before taking on a house sitting job.Apartment management. You could also become a landlord yourself, where you get free rent in exchange for maintaining the building and responding to the needs of the building’s tenants. However, this could be a big responsibility in terms of time and energy.Moving in with your parents.

A zero rent, home cooked meal situation may not be so bad, and will bring you one step closer to buying nothing., Cut down on the need to buy any new items by thinking about the things you already own. This could be items of clothing, bottles of unused cleaning products, or stacks of goods that have been gathering dust in your garage.

Focus on creating a meal plan every week where you use pantry items you already own and vegetables from a local garden or your own backyard garden.Many people who commit to a buy nothing lifestyle invest in an aquaponics system, where fish help to fertilize a garden that can grow enough produce for one person. Aquaponic systems are self sufficient and require minimal upkeep. They can also produce a variety of produce, from herbs to tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, and other greens. Over time, this system will provide you with a free food source.There are several budget friendly food blogs and books with recipes that cost less than $10 to prepare and use pantry items you may already own., Soup kitchens and food banks provide free meals to people daily. There are also other practices, like dumpster diving, or food bartering, that require no money and can lead to some free food.


Dumpster diving is when you look in dumpsters and trash bins for items that may be edible, useful, or recyclable. Dumpster diving can also be profitable, as you can sell any valuable items you find in the garbage. However, you must always wear full body protection when dumpster diving and have a strong stomach for potentially gross discoveries, such as dead animals, hazardous weapons, and biohazardous items like used needles.Food bartering is when you trade one food item for another food item. For example, you may have a surplus of tomatoes in your garden, or too many loaves of homemade bread in your kitchen. You would then network with other people in your area to barter for other food. There are several food bartering groups on Facebook and online. Search for food bartering networks in your area., From home repairs to bike repairs to fixing old household items, doing it yourself means you do not need to pay someone for a service or task. Doing repairs or redecorating yourself also fills your time with activities that contribute to your buy nothing lifestyle, rather than put you in position where you may be tempted to spend money.There are many websites devoted to do it yourself projects that require a minimal skill level, with a variety of projects you can try on your own., Items like laundry detergent, toothpaste, deodorant, face wash, and soap can be made at home with a few basic pantry items. This is another great way to fill your time with an activity that leads to less spending and useful items around the house., Most large cities have free events every month to celebrate holidays. Check out the listings in your local paper to find out if any free festivals or special events are going on in your area.


Activities like hiking or walking in a local park or on local trails, as well as biking to remote destinations or areas, are all great ways to get out, have fun, and buy nothing.

Contact the Mail Preference Service and request that you be placed on a do-not-mail list and contact individual mailers to have your address removed. You can't go through the postal service, because the mail deliverer can't legally decide what mail addressed ""To Resident"" is undesirable. If you don't want it, contact them at the source. Advo, Pennysaver, Potpourri, and Redplum are common mass-market mailing services.
Contact companies that you've patronized in the past and request that your address be removed from their mailing list. Sign up for their email list instead, so you don't miss out on good deals., One of the great things about getting the newspaper, your favorite magazine, or a good paperback, is that you can tote it around with you. No one wants to sit and read at the computer all day. But you don't have to! Get an e-reader like a Kindle, a Nook, or an iPad and upload your favorite reading material onto an easy-to-transport and even easier-to-read interface.


If you're too in love with the feel of real books to use a cold stainless e-reader, you're not alone. But that doesn't mean you need to buy brand new hardbacks and contribute to paper waste. Visit your local public library and share books, magazines, and newspapers for free. Many libraries actually have e-borrowing, which will let you borrow e-books and read them on your mobile device or tablet for a limited period of time.

, Signing important documents is the one time you've got to print and deal with real paper, right? Wrong. Secure services offer the ability to verify signatures online more easily than ever, making it a breeze to stay paperless even when it comes to putting pen to paper.


PowerPad Lite, SignNow, DocuSign, and HelloSign are all services that offer digital signature options. It's easy and widely available.
One of the more DIY ways of doing this is to sign a piece of paper, then scan it into your computer. Crop the image around your signature and import it directly into a Word file, and save as a pdf. if you want. When you send your message, then, you can have your signature right on the file.

, Tissues and paper towels are quick and convenient, but can quickly add to your household waste. Instead of using paper products to clean up, make the switch to washable cloth towels and handkerchiefs to cut down on your paper garbage.

, Still got old term papers from high school? User manuals for old VCRs? Every issue of Pro Wrestling Illustrated from ’92-’98? It’s probably time to tackle the piles of paper you’ve already built up and cut down on the clutter. Just going through the piles that you've got lying around can be a good way of making yourself feel as if you've made some important steps in going paperless. Recycle the paper you're getting rid of and move forward into the paperless frontier, uncluttered."

Remove all obstacles.,
Sweep or vacuum the floor before mopping.,

Dip the mop in the cleaning solution.,
Lift the mop, letting it drip for a few seconds before slopping it on the floor.,
Mop the floor in small sections.,
Wring your mop out.,
Run the wrung out mop over the wet floor.,
Soak the mop in the cleaner solution and mop the next section.,
Work your way back towards a door.,
Let the mopped area dry completely.,
Replace any furnishings you removed from the area.,
Hang the mop up to dry.",How to Mop a Floor," Move whatever tables, chairs, throw rugs and other obstacles are on the floor you’re going to mop. Be careful not to drag furniture like tables and chairs to avoid scratching the floor.






If you need to clean any of these objects, clean them first. That way, if any debris falls on the floor, it'll fall before you mop, rather than after.
Make sure that anyone who’s likely to walk over your floor is aware they need to avoid doing so until it dries. In the case of animals, you might need to move them to a separate room until the floor dries.;
, It may seem redundant, but mops generally do a terrible job of picking up crumbs, dust, hair, and other solid debris. If you mop an unswept floor, you'll just end up pushing this stuff around. Moreover, dust and dirt can leave scratches on the floor if not removed first.





, You should add enough water to be able to completely submerge your mop. However, keep in mind that the water level will rise once you add the mop. If your bucket has an integrated wringer, make sure it’s not submerged in the water.






Always refer to the instructions printed on your chosen cleaner. Different cleaners are suitable for different floors; you don’t want to use the same cleaner on wood floors as you would on stone.
It is possible to use ordinary dish-washing detergent. Just a squirt added to the water is sufficient.
You can prepare a second bucket to wring out your mop. This will keep the dirty and clean soapy water separate., Let the mop absorb the cleaner solution thoroughly. Sometimes a stiff, dried-out mop will need to soak for a little while to loosen up.





, Keeping your mop wetter will make the mopping process more efficient.Letting the mop drip a few seconds before mopping will ensure there isn’t an excess of water spreading over the floor.





, A section should be about four to six square feet. You should only swish the mop three to four times to cover this area. You’re spreading the cleaning solution over the floor, rather than trying to scrub the dirt off.




For polyurethaned hardwood floors, run the mop with the grain of the wood.For textured floors, move the mop in small figure eight patterns., If you decided to use two buckets, make sure to wring your mop over your empty bucket. The mop should have little to no water left at this point., You should only swish the mop over a wet spot three to four times. If you pass the mop over more than this, you’ll just end up spreading dirty water around.Wring out the mop after this.






If the floor is still wet after you’ve passed the wrung out mop over, wring it out and do it again.

, Repeat these steps for each section of your floor. You might need to move the buckets, keeping them close enough to efficiently wring the mop.





, This will ensure you’re not stepping on parts of the floor you’ve just cleaned. Any fine dust clinging to the bottoms of your shoes will stick to the floor and become mud. If you do step on an area that is wet, run the mop back over it to clean up your tracks.





, Opening up doors or windows for circulation will speed this process. It's generally not necessary to dry a floor manually unless the surface shows streaks badly; just let the air do the job.





, If you haven’t cleaned the bottoms of chairs and tables, you may want to do so with a wet paper towel. Otherwise, you might track dirt and dust back onto the floor you’ve just cleaned.





, If you leave the mop in the bucket, dirt and grime will cling to the fibers and it will smell. Hang it with the wet end down; make sure to hang it somewhere where dripping water won’t damage the surface.






Dispose of dirty mop water in a toilet. Your kitchen sink is usually where you prepare food; you don’t want to get the grime that was on your floor in your sink.
While not strictly necessary, it's a good idea to rinse your mop and wring it thoroughly once more before hanging it up, so that the dirt and cleaner won’t stay on the mop.

Sign up to pay each bill online.,
Request online statements.,
File your taxes online.,
Ask about direct deposit at work.",How to Go Paperless2," Making insurance, utility, and and loan payments doesn't need to happen with paper checks. For the most part, online payment portals are extremely easy to use, free, and much quicker than sending your payments through the post. Start an online account for each of your monthly bills and request that you receive online updates for your account.


You can pay each of your bills separately, to each account, but some banks have it set up so that you can schedule your online payments with the bank, and automatically remind you to make those payments every month, or automatically make the payments without your authorization. If you know you're going to have to make the payments regularly, set it up to automatically debit and have one less thing to worry about.

, Ask that each account and utility remove you from its mailing list and opt for digital statements and updates instead. If you're paying your utilities online, you don't need to get payment updates and other mailers through the mail. Go ahead and switch all communications to online updates.


Some services won't send you an email every time your account is updated, making it important to take steps to check your account regularly and schedule payments accordingly, to make sure that your accounts are up to date.

, Printing out tax forms can be a huge expense and a big waste of paper. Instead of sending in a big packet of your tax information at tax time, invest in an online service, like TurboTax, and file your taxes online. While there's typically a small fee associated with receiving your tax refund online, most services will take the payment straight out of any rebate that you receive, making it–essentially–free to you. It's a good deal, much faster, and super-easy., If you're still getting a paper check at the end of every week, talk to your employers about the possibility of direct deposit. There's little sense in making employees run useless paper checks to the bank every couple of weeks, when the possibility of your hard-earned money going straight into your account is possible.

Invest in a good-quality scanner.,
Print to PDF.,
Stay organized.,
Back things up.,
Air gap important info.,
Consider cloud storage.",How to Go Paperless3," Digitizing important archives and documents will not only let you cut down on clutter and move forward in going paperless, but it will ensure the security of those documents for the long term.


Doxie and Neat are new brands of scanner that are specifically designed to make scanning lots of documents quick and easy. They’re hand-held and sleek, making it a good investment if you don’t already own a scanner. If you do, though, standard scanners on printers are fine for the job.
Scan at a quality low enough so that the files aren't huge, but high enough so that your printout will be useful as a copy of the original document. Usually 300dpi is adequate unless you're archiving photos. Use grey scale scanning to save even more memory.

, After you've scanned your important, sensitive, or personal documents, you don't have to print them to keep them secure or to keep them copied. Instead, choose ""Print to PDF,"" which will create a secure, high-quality file that can't be edited. Name the file and keep your important documents organized neatly.

, Name your documents something specific and keep them organized so that your computer desktop doesn't become as cluttered as your real desktop.


For every scan you add to your database, use keywords that mean something to you, like ""house payment July 08"" or ""laptop receipt 12/23/2008 Best Buy"" or ""car insurance statement 20090201."" This will allow you to do a search of keywords to locate a document if you need it for something.
If necessary, you might consider using a database program that uses keywords to help you organize your scans. Doxo, FileThis, and Neat all offer this type of service.

, Invest in an external hard-drive for your computer and back up your information regularly to keep a copy of the things you'd be heartbroken to lose. Make at least backups of your most important data, and keep one backup in a different location from your computer: a bank safe deposit box, a friend's house, and an online backup service are several options.

, If you're afraid of somebody potentially taking control of your computer and stealing all your digitized documents, then store them on an external USB hard drive or USB flash drive, keeping it disconnected from the computer. This is a process known as ""air gap,"" and it can help to keep your most sensitive information secure. However talented, no hacker has ever learned how to steal data from a drive that is not connected to anything.

, If you've got your info backed up to the great hard-drive in the sky, you don't have to worry about anything being corrupted, lost, or damaged in a fire. Upload your sensitive information to the cloud and you'll always have it.

Help your friends find all of their bits and pieces before leaving.,
Thank your friends for coming over.",How to Be a Good Host when Friends Come to Your House," When they arrive smile, and say ""hi"", then let them come in. Be polite and friendly, and make sure to ask them how they are.


Introduce your friends to people in the household they don't yet know.
Offer compliments on how they look and offer gratitude for any gifts that they bring with them.;
, If it is the first time at your house give them a 'house tour', to let them know where everything is. Be alert to the fact that it's better to show guests the bathroom and let them know where they can do such things as change a baby's diaper, grab a glass of water, etc. without having to ask you direct.


If there is somewhere your friends shouldn't go, such as a baby's room, an elderly person's room, etc., make this clear. It's better than having them embarrassed by wandering into baby's room and waking baby up when looking for the bathroom, etc.

, If possible, have a selection of drinks (water, orange juice, apple juice, coke, lemonade, etc.) to make sure that you have something they like. Always have fresh, clean water on hand, and make sure all cups and glasses are clean for your friend to drink out of.


If you don't have a lot of room or money to spare, ask what sorts of drinks they like before they come over. Remember this for future visits.
Keep an eye on the drinks during the time your friends are with you. Offer top ups as needed.

, Have a small platter set up in advance. Some good snacks include:


Chips
Cheese
Crackers
Dip.

, Have a couple of board games on hand to play, and some magazines to look at. If you have a garden, ask if they would like to go and play outside. If you have a pool, and it is warm, before hand ask your friend to bring their bathers so you can go swimming. Having a chat over the nibbles is also a great way to spend the time together.


If the friends are children, have things ready for them to do.

, If you noticed they were carrying something but seem to have forgotten it, ask about it.


If your friends brought food, see if they need the dish back. Either clean it now or offer to return it later if this is impractical.

, Say that you've had a wonderful time and hope that you can all get together again some time soon. Let them know that they are welcome again any day.

Find the pile direction of your rug.,
Vacuum perpendicularly to the pile direction.,
Avoid vacuuming the fringe.",How to Vacuum a Rug1," Woven rugs can either have heavy pile, thin pile, or no pile at all - it’s just the density of the vertical fibers protruding from the rug. The direction that those fibers naturally lay is called the pile direction.To determine the pile direction, brush your hand along the rug. If you are brushing against the pile, you will feel resistance.


Always dust or brush woven rugs in the direction of the pile. Stroking against the pile can cause softer wools to break.;
, If you vacuum with the pile direction, the fibers will cover and protect the dirt you are trying to remove. If you vacuum against the pile direction, this can provide unnecessary wear on the rug and can cause shedding and damage.







, While vacuuming along the edges, use a hand or foot to hold down the fringe. Vacuuming the fringe can cause damage to both the vacuum and the rug.Vacuums without beater bars are best for this task because the fringe cannot get tangled inside the vacuum.

Inspect the carpet.,
Ventilate the room.,
Sun the carpet if possible.,
Remove moisture with baking soda.,
Scrub with white vinegar.",How to Get Rid of Carpet Mold1," If the mold has reached the backing at the base of the carpet, it may take considerable effort to remove. Consider hiring a professional carpet cleaner in this scenario. If the mold has grown across a large portion of the backing, you may need to replace the carpet.;
, Open all windows and doors in the room with the moldy carpet. Air flow will reduce the humidity that encourages mold, and lessen associated odors. If you plan to use a chemical cleaning product, ventilation will reduce the chance of irritating your lungs and eyes.


If there are no windows to the room, turn on a fan pointing toward a doorway.

, If your carpet is removable, move it outside and hang it over a sturdy clothesline. 24–48 hours of direct sunlight will help kill mold spores, and remove moisture that encourages mold growth.


If the carpet is soaked through to the backing, not just the upper fibers, it may take much longer to dry. Leave it in direct sun in an area with good ventilation for several days.

, This step will absorb moisture and reduce odors, but further efforts will be required for all but the lightest mold problem. Sprinkle the affected area generously with baking soda, leave on overnight, then vacuum it up.


Talc-free baby powder may be used instead. Avoid baby powder that contains talc, since this can cause serious harm if inhaled.Cat litter may also be used as a substitute.

, Although vinegar does not kill every mold species, it is a cheap and often effective option. Using white vinegar to avoid stains, apply lightly with a spray bottle, and scrub it in with a stiff brush. Blow dry the carpet, or air dry in a well-ventilated area, to avoid leaving moisture that could replenish the mold.


Some people report success mixing their vinegar with an equal part of methylated spirits.

Check the underside for peeling.,
Find the pile direction of your rug.,
Vacuum perpendicularly to the pile direction.",How to Vacuum a Rug2," Tufted rugs are held together by a layer of latex glue that secures the tufts and prevents them from falling out. If your rug is particularly old, this layer of glue will show signs of cracking and crumbling, meaning that the tufts are no longer secure. If you notice patches on the underside of your rug that are missing glue, be extra careful when cleaning that portion of the rug. Being too aggressive will lead to fibers falling out and the creation of bare patches., All tufted rugs have a pile, it’s just the density of the vertical fibers protruding from the rug. They will also have a pile direction, which is the direction that the fibers naturally lay.To determine the pile direction, brush your hand along the rug. The rug will appear darker and you will feel resistance when you brush against the pile.









If your carpet is rectangular, the pile direction will be going lengthwise.
Regular traffic across a rug can change the pile direction in certain places. Rotate your rugs regularly so the pile stays uniform across the whole rug.

, If you vacuum with the pile direction, the fibers will cover and protect the dirt you are trying to remove. If you vacuum against the pile direction, this can provide unnecessary wear on the rug and accidentally remove tufts from it.








For best results, use a canister vacuum without a beater bar or a similar vacuum that only uses suction.

"
"
Vacuum frequently.,
Be careful with the fringe.,
Vacuum both sides.",How to Vacuum a Rug3," Flat weave rugs have no pile and are made from durable materials. Due to their thin but sturdy nature, they will appear dirty more often than other rugs because there is less room for dust and dirt to hide. Although excessive vacuuming can sometimes cause the rug to shed, the durable materials can endure quite a lot before this occurs., If vacuumed up, the fringe can wrap around the beater bar and cause damage to both the vacuum and the rug.For this reason, either temporarily turn off the beater bar when vacuuming the edges, or use a canister vacuum that relies only on suction. If you only have access to a beater bar vacuum, manually hold down the fringe as you vacuum past it.








, Flat weave rugs are reversible and both sides are susceptible to becoming dirty. By vacuuming both sides you are removing grit that may wear your rug out early.Flip these rugs occasionally to distribute wear evenly to both sides. This will increase their lifespan and decrease shedding.








"
"
Flip the rug and vacuum the underside.,
Vacuum the floor underneath the rug.,
Vacuum the topside with light suction.",How to Vacuum a Rug4," By doing this first, you will be able to dislodge dirt and dust that is clinging deep within the rug.This should be done using a vacuum with a beater bar. Stand on top of the rug and use your feet to prevent the edges from flipping up as you vacuum along them.









Alternatively, you and a friend can flip the shag rug upside down and shake it vigorously to shake off dirt and dust. Shag rugs are abnormally heavy, however, so this will be difficult for you to do alone.

, Roll the shag rug up and set it aside for a moment. There should be dirt and dust on the floor that you dislodged earlier. Vacuum these up then place your rug back where it was, this time face up.







, Unlike the underside, vacuums with beater bars are not recommended for use on the topside, as the long fibers will wrap around them and cause damage to the vacuum. Using a vacuum with high suction can also cause damage by pulling the tufts out of the carpet. Instead, use a smaller vacuum with low suction or use the crevice tool to gently clean the topside.

Use an anti-mold treatment.,
Try a carpet cleaning product.,
Apply chlorine dioxide products cautiously.,
Rent a steam cleaner.,
Hire a professional.,
Remove the affected area.",How to Get Rid of Carpet Mold2," Anti-mold or antifungal sprays are available at most drug stores and supermarkets. Check the label for instructions, and to make sure the product is safe for use on carpets. Antifungal treatments designed for kitchen or bathroom cleaning could potentially discolor or damage carpet.


Products that include an ""encapsulate"" treatment or ""mold barrier"" are designed to leave a clear barrier on the carpet fibers, preventing future mold growth. This is recommended for carpets kept in humid conditions.
A mixture of bleach and water can be used instead of a commercial solution. Mix half a cup of bleach with a gallon of water.You may want to use color-safe bleach and test it on a corner of your carpet first to make sure that it will not cause discoloration.

, Carpet cleaning products that contain deodorizers will remove the mildewy smell as well as fighting the mold itself. Follow the instructions on the product label, since products vary.


Some people report success with Vanish detergent products for carpets.

, Some mold removal products are based on chlorine dioxide, but be aware that this chemical can alter the carpet's color. Test first on a small area normally covered by furniture, following the product label's instructions. Depending on the product, you may need access to a wet vacuum to remove it from the carpet after use.


Work in a well-ventilated area while using chlorine dioxide products, as they can produce vapors that irritate the lungs and eyes. Move to a different room if you feel short of breath or start coughing., Specialized steam cleaning vacuums are available for homeowners to rent, and can be effective at removing persistent mold. Drying the carpet quickly afterward is vital, or the water used in this method will remain and encourage new mold growth. Use a blow dryer, or keep the carpet in direct sunlight and blow a fan over it.


Do not try to steam clean your carpet without a specialized machine. Applying steam or hot water can easily shrink or damage your carpet if done incorrectly.

, Professionals may have greater experienced identifying specific mold, as well as access to specialized machines and chemicals. If you have already tried steam cleaning, hire a professional to conduct dry ice blasting or another, different treatment.

, If faced with major mold colonies that have grown onto the carpet backing, you may decide that replacement is a more effective use of time and money. When cutting out the damaged carpet, cut an additional 12 inch (30 centimeter) border on all sides to ensure total removal.


If you do this, you may find that there is mold on the floor beneath the carpet. In this case, make sure that you thoroughly treat the area before replacing the carpet.

"
"
Treat possible sources of mold and moisture.,
Increase ventilation.,
Run a dehumidifier.,
Vacuum regularly.,
Leave the lights on.,
Use a HEPA vacuum after removing major mold colonies.",How to Get Rid of Carpet Mold3," Damp crawlspaces or subfloors may need anti-moisture polyethylene sheeting or professional treatment to prevent further mold growth. Check vents, closets, and the underside of upholstery as well, to make sure all sources of mold are located and eliminated. If possible, check beneath the carpet as well.


Most mildewy upholstery can be treated using the same methods as carpet, but test a corner first to make sure the color is unaffected.

, Air flow helps evaporate moisture, drying out damp areas where mold thrives. Leave the windows open or a fan blowing for at least two hours a day.


Open windows early in the morning if possible, to remove moisture that has built up overnight.

, If you live in a humid climate, or there is no easy way to ventilate the room, purchase a dehumidifier. Keep this running at night to remove moisture content from the air, before it settles on the carpet.

, Sweeping can be effective, but carpets can trap dust and mold spores deep in their fibers, making vacuum cleaning a preferred option. Shark vacuums may be more effective, but tend to be significantly more expensive.

, Mold grows well in the dark, and introducing more light can help reduce the spread of mold. You can try leaving on low-energy lights on for periods of time. You can even try using nightlights when you go to sleep.While average fluorescent light bulbs can prevent the spread of mold, special UV C lights can help detect and kill mold spores., After a serious mold infestation has been removed, renting a HEPA vacuum or filter is recommended to remove the last mold spores from the area. Seal vents and close windows before using, to minimize the amount of spores that travel to other areas of the house.


HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air. It is a rating used to describe various products, not a brand name.

Take guest preferences and food allergies into account.,
Clean house.,
Be welcoming.,
Have all of the food ready (or on the way) when your guests arrive.,
Offer an after-dinner drink.,
Engage your guests in conversation.,
Make your guests feel appreciated.",How to Be a Good Host1," Don't bother to invite people if they don't appeal to you or you have no intention of growing close with them. Choosing good guests may enable you to be a better host. Consider also how well the guests will get along with each other. Try not to invite people that you know won't mesh well, or that have a history of winding up at each other's throats.;
, It is important to know when to expect your guest/s. Make sure to give them plenty of advance notice – at least a week, and even more if the occasion is very important. Assume that they will also need to work around their own schedules. Don't tell them to come ""sometime"" if you really want them to show up. Tell them specifically when to come so that it feels more like an invitation. A range of times is also okay, but it should be no longer than a few hours.


If your guests show up late, try to make them feel welcome. Do not sulk for the rest of the evening, or you may compound the problem. Just continue laughing and ignore the fact they were late.
Telling your guests in advance is just a matter of courtesy. If they know what to expect, it will be much easier for them to plan their schedules around it.

, When you decide on the food you will be serving, consider your guests' food concerns. Always contact them beforehand and ask if they have any allergies or food specifications. Inviting a vegetarian over for dinner and preparing a roast would be embarrassing for both of you. Be sure to cook something that you're comfortable cooking.


Don't just say, ""Do you have any preference for the meal?"" Instead, ask your guests to name specifics. Say, ""I'm planning the meal for Friday night. Do you have any allergies or food restrictions that I need to be aware of?""
Don't go out of your way to prepare a main course which takes days to make. A good guest will appreciate any decent meal that tastes good.

, Before your guests arrive, tidy up the space to convey that you care. If they arrive in a messy household, it shows you do not care for your surroundings, and it may make them feel less welcome in your home. Put away toys, tools, and clutter. Remove allergens by vacuuming carpets, rugs, and upholstered furniture.


If you have a dog that tends to greet, bark at or jump on guests when they come through the door, put it in another room. Some people are scared of dogs and intimidated even by their approach. Some are allergic.
If you have pets, find out beforehand whether your guests have any fears or allergies. If they are allergic, give them a heads up so they can take medication to help better handle the situation.

, Once your guests arrive, open the door and show them where to put their things. Show them the bathroom on the way in before taking them to the living room and offering them a seat. Never leave them hanging at the front door; don't expect them to follow you if you don't say anything. If you still have things to prepare, engage with your guests whilst organizing what you have left. By now, you should have finished tidying the area, so that you have only the food to finish.


Have your family or a housemate engage the guests so that you can finish preparing the rest of the food. Keep finger food on the coffee table in the living room to whet everyone's appetites.
Ask your guests if they would like a drink. Offer them at least two options – whatever you think is most suitable for the event. The options could range between coffee, tea, water, beer, and wine.

, Don't rush. Move casually otherwise you will let your guests think they have become a burden for you.

, After you have finished dinner and are eating dessert, offer your guest something to wash down the meal. Depending on the mood and energy of the gathering, consider coffee, tea, or an alcoholic digestif. Sit and talk on the couch with a drink.

, Talk about things that they want to talk about. Ask questions about their work, their travels, their families. Don't complain about how your child was sick all week or how you are having family issues. Show interest in what your guest has to say. Build on the conversation and let it flow.


Business can be a good subject, but be careful with whom you bring it up. Many people like to separate their work from their social lives. Take cues from your guests, and don't try to force any topic.

, If they want to leave, ask them to stay a bit longer since you have enjoyed their company. Tell them it has been a lovely time, and you are keen to see them again. If you noticed that they enjoyed part of the meal in particular, consider giving a portion of it to them. Tell them you won't need it; say that it's a pleasure to see someone enjoy your food.

Start with high-quality towels.,
Launder the towels before use.,
Make a towel fan.,
Try a towel pocket.,
Make a swan.",How to Decorate Guest Towels1," The best towels are 100% cotton and feel heavy when you pick them up.If it’s important to you, pick out towels that echo colors in your bathroom, or add a pleasing pop of color. For instance, if the bathroom has black and white tiling, a leaf-green towel would stand out in a pretty way.;
, For all these projects, you want your towels to be as clean and stable as possible. Wash the towels to see if any fading or shrinkage occurs. Use warm water and mild detergent, and avoid fabric softener or dryer sheets.

, If you’re just getting started with decorative folding, a hand towel fan on top of a plain bath towel is easy and pretty. To start, fold the bath towel in half lengthwise, then fold it into thirds in the opposite direction. It should make a plump square shape. Next, take the hand towel and fold it lengthwise into one-inch accordion pleats. Crease the pleated towel in half so it makes a v-shape, lay it on top of the bath towel, and tease the ends apart to it to create a fan shape.

, If you have a towel rack in the bathroom, you can level up. Combine a bath, hand, and face towel into one attractive package by folding the hand towel into a pocket shape and placing the washcloth inside it.Start by folding a bath towel into thirds lengthwise.
Place it on the rack with the rod in the middle, so both sides hang down equally.
Lay a hand towel on the floor with the right side up and tag side down.
Fold the bottom up so it reaches halfway up the towel, then fold the bottom edge down again so it’s level with the first fold. This makes a kind of “shelf” shape.
Flip the hand towel over, so the shelf faces down.
Fold the hand towel into folds vertically. It should be in more of a sausage-shape now, with a pocket running along the bottom edge.
Lay the hand towel over the bath towel so the pocket hangs down in front.
Fold a face towel into a mini-fan, then tuck it into the pocket.

, Are you feeling fancy? Use origami techniques to fold a big bath towel into a swan. This is especially nice if you have two guests in the same room, as you can set the swans on the bed so that they are looking at each other.


Lay a towel so the long side is horizontal.
Take the top two corners, and fold them towards each other. Now the towel will be in a pentagon shape, with a point at the top. The short sides should lay against each other.
Roll each of the top diagonal edges towards one another. This should turn the towel into a rolled arrow shape.
Take the head of the arrow and bend it back towards the tails of the arrow. Then bend the tip of it down. In profile, this will look like a Z-shape.
(Opt.) Fold a washcloth into a fan and put it between the “wings” for a tail.

Show your guest around or give her directions.",How to Be a Good Host2," Most overnight guest-hosting is a matter of common courtesy; however, the level of access that you give your guests will vary depending who's staying. If you are hosting family or close friends—people that you know and trust—you may invite them to feel at home in your space. If you are hosting a stranger (say, through AirBnB or Couchsurfing.org), you should still be a courteous host, but it may a greater risk to give them the sort of access that you'd give your family.


If you're hosting an AirBnB guest, you may not be around the house when they're around. You may even be away on a trip. Make sure to leave plenty of notes around to help your guests understand the way you want things done.

, Make sure that there are plenty of clean towels, if possible. Provide a neutral-smelling soap for you guest to use in the shower, and consider setting aside a basic but neutral mid-range shampoo and conditioner for you guest to use.


If he/she has a private room, place all of these toiletries on a bedside table with a note saying ""If you need anything else, don't hesitate to ask."" If your guest will have a private bathroom, you can just leave the toiletries in the bathroom., You never know how someone will feel about the temperature in your home; some like it hot, and some do not. Do not assume that your guest will be comfortable just because you are. Consider leaving an extra blanket in a dresser, at the foot of the bed, or on the top shelf of a closet., Leave an iron and an ironing board in the closet or corner of the guest bedroom. Show your guests your laundry machines, if you own any, or tell them where they can clean their clothes if need be (say, there's a laundromat down the street). If your guests have traveled a long distance, they might want to freshen up their clothes, and they might need a wash.

, If you wake up early, leave a note on the bedside table saying that you eat breakfast at 7:00 am (or whatever time), and you'd be happy to have your guest join. You may also simply coordinate breakfast plans with your guest at night before you go to sleep. Make sure to mention what's on the menu for breakfast.If your guest doesn't like eating breakfast or doesn't want to rise early, you have several options: invite her to use your kitchen, give her a tip about a local breakfast spot, or leave a simple breakfast spread out on the counter for her. Consider leaving some warm baked goods along with butter and jam for your guest to snack on until lunchtime.
It's important to make a guest feel special, but there is a fine line between feeling special and feeling like a stranger in a loved one's home. You need not change your entire family's routine to accommodate your guest.

, Encourage guests to help themselves to food, snacks, to go out for a walk, and to make themselves at home. Show them how to find essential amenities like tea, coffee, snacks, internet access and wifi.As a household host, you aren't there to wait on your guest, but to include them in your household routines. Offering to take them out to see local sites or to go on a hike is great, but don't push it if they just want to chill around the house.

, If you have time, show your guest around your area. Introduce her to local friends, steer her through the sights, and try to give her a good impression of what it's like to live where you live. If you don't have time to spend the whole day with her (say, you have work or school), give her a bit of direction for her explorations, or invite her to hang out at your place until you return.


If your guest wants to explore on her own: don't feel obligated to let her use your car, but consider loaning her a bicycle or a bus pass to get around. Tell her the most effective way to use public transportation. Suggest things that she needs to see, and tell her you'll meet her somewhere after work.
Try to ensure that your guest isn't bored. However, it's not your responsibility to spend every waking moment worrying about whether she's enjoying her stay.

Prepare the house before your guest arrives.,
Be clear about the house rules.,
Give your guest the chance to help out, but make your expectations realistic.,
Make sure your guest is physically comfortable.,
Have a plan of events.,
Keep the conversation flowing.",How to Be a Good Host3," Being a good host is about making people feel comfortable from the minute they walk in the door. This means you need to do some preparation before your guest arrives. Clean the house, have a clear space for guest to put their bags/shoes/coat/umbrella. If you're planning on playing games or watching something, make sure that the supplies are easily accessible.Anything that could embarrass you may also make your guest uncomfortable: dirt, potentially-offensive books/magazines/movies, or having to root around in the closet or kitchen for something.
Know your guests' allergies beforehand so you can be prepared. Consider allergies to food, drinks, animals, and cleaning products., When your guest arrives, lay down the basic house rules right away. This doesn't mean that you need to give them a lecture: it means being kind but clear about the expectations for the space in which they've found themselves.


If you like guests to remove their shoes, don't let them walk around for a bit and then comment on it. Pointedly take off your shoes and ask if they would like you to put theirs away too. They will get the hint.
If you have furniture that you don't want your guests to touch or rooms that you don't want them to enter, be clear from the beginning to avoid awkwardness later on.
Point out the bathroom right away. This way, no one will need to ask where it is in the middle of another conversation.

, Don't pressure the guest to clean up with you, but don't deny them if they really want to help. Many people would rather contribute than be waited on. Having something to do takes the mind off of any lingering discomfort.


Give your guests little things to do, like emptying the table or putting the dessert on the table.
If they offer to clean the dishes, you may find it most polite to decline and offer them a drink. Sit them at the bar in the kitchen and let them talk to you while you clean dishes. If they are determined, then leave the dishes, sit at the table and talk; ignore the fact that there are dishes to be washed.

, No one likes to stand in the middle of a room, clutching their bag, wondering where to go. Put away whatever they are holding (if they want you to) and motion for them to take a seat. Offer to get them something to drink. Once they are settled in, it might even be nice to leave the room (maybe under the guise of getting that drink) so that they have a chance to take a break and look around.


If you are constantly with someone, they won't get the chance to absorb the environment, and they might be distracted while you are with them later. This does not mean leave them for a long time – a minute or two tops should do it.
People like having things to do with their hands. So having a drink or munchies can help. Don't offer your guest food and not eat yourself, they will feel rude and gluttonous. Take some snacks too.

, Inviting someone over and then asking them what to do is rude. They won't know what you can and can't do at your home, and they likely don't feel comfortable taking charge of someone else's territory. Even if you aren't sure if the guest will enjoy playing Scrabble, anything is preferable to sitting and staring awkwardly in opposite directions., One of your biggest jobs as the host is to keep everything going smoothly. You will need to set a positive tone, and act as moderator if anything goes awry. Be prepared to smooth tensions: always be ready to change the subject or talk to anyone who's causing trouble. Your social ""job"" as the host is to make sure that your home is a safe and welcoming space for all who enter – no matter who is causing the problems.


Consider coming up with conversation topics beforehand. Think about what you've been wanting to ask each person – about a new job, or a baby, or a big trip. Plan ahead so that you don't have to think about it much in the moment.

Sew on decorative hems.,
Add pre-made decorative accents.,
Embroider your towels.,
Apply an applique.",How to Decorate Guest Towels2," If you have towels with plain indented borders (sometimes called a dobby weave), then you can stitch on a thin line of contrasting fabric. This makes a subtle and pretty decoration, uses up fabric scraps, and is easy to do.


Prewash the towels and the fabric you’re using. Otherwise, when you wash them, they might pucker strangely.Cut two one-inch strips of fabric the width of a towel, adding an extra inch in length for seam allowance.
Using an iron, turn over a quarter-inch of fabric at the short sides of the rectangles. Then turn over another half-inch and iron again. This should give neat finished edges to the sides of the decorative strip.
Now turn over a quarter-inch of fabric along the length of both sides of a strip. This should result in a half-inch strip of folded fabric.
Pin the fabric to the plain border on one side of the towel with the right side be facing out. The fabric should be right in the middle of the plain border--probably a quarter inch from each edge, if it’s a standard one-inch border. Use a seam gauge to make sure the fabric is straight.

Whipstitch the cloth neatly to the towel along each edge.

, If you don’t have any scrap fabric to add to the towel, you can go out and purchase decorative trims instead. When looking at trims, it’s best to choose ones that are sturdy and made of the same fabric composition as your towels, so the towels will be easy to wash.Of course, you still need to pre-wash trims and towels before application.


Cording is a simple, narrow trim. It should be easy to attach with a single whipstitch.
Rickrack is a zig-zagging trim that adds a retro or rural charm to towels.
Lace can be fancy or homey. Whatever style you choose, sturdy cotton lace, like eyelet or Cluny, is best.Avoid anything too delicate.

, If you have a lot of experience with machine embroidery, you can apply this knowledge to your guest towels.If you don’t know how to machine embroider, towels are probably not the best medium to learn on. Cross-stitch is very doable, however.


Start with towels with an embroiderable inset, which are available at well-stocked craft or embroidery stores.Pick up a few colors of cotton embroidery thread and a pack of embroidery needles, as well.
Find a pattern you like. You can find patterns in books, but they’re also available on cross-stitch sites, or DIY and social media sites like Pinterest.Transfer the pattern to the towel’s embroiderable section, and cross stitch away. Make sure to tie knots off securely, since you’ll be running the towels through the wash., If you want to monogram your towels, or customize them with a simple shape like a heart or star, think about applique. With this technique, you apply a contrasting fabric patch to the towel and stitch it down securely.It requires a bit more patience, but the results are worth it. You’ll need decorative cotton fabric, fusible interfacing, tailor’s chalk, and a needle and thread.


Prewash both the towel and the fabric you want to apply. This will save the finished design from weird bunching and puckering.
Find a stencil for a letter or shape that appeals to you.
Peel the backing off the interfacing, then lay the wrong side of the cotton fabric against the bumpy side of the interfacing. Run a hot iron along the right side of the cotton fabric. This should make the interfacing stick to the fabric, strengthening it.Trace your chosen shape onto the right side of fabric, using the tailor’s chalk.
Using a sewing machine or a needle and thread, make a running stitch on top of the traced lines. This will help stabilize them.
Cut out the letter or shape, being careful to cut close to the stabilizing stitches.
Pin the shape to the towel in the correct place. Satin stitch around the edge to attach it.

"
"
Use bleach or dye to stencil.,
Bleach-paint an image.,
Add an ombre border.,
Tie-dye the towel.",How to Decorate Guest Towels3," If you like the idea of a big simple shape to decorate the towel, but don’t want to sew, you can stencil a shape on instead. You’ll need a stencil, tape, spray bottle, and dye or bleach that will contrast with your towel’s color. (In general, use dye for light towels, and bleach for dark ones.)


Pick out a stencil you like. You can print shapes onto cardstock and then cut around the edge to make a stencil, if you don’t have a pre-made stencil that excites you.
Tape your stencil to the towel.
Fill a spray bottle with fabric dye or undiluted clothing bleach.Spray bleach or dye through the stencil.
Wait a few minutes for the chemicals to develop on the towel. If you want a stronger color, spray more on.
Wash the towel after the stencil dries. Be careful not to wash it with anything that could be damaged by extra bleach or dye.

, If you want even more control over the imagery on the towel, you can use clothing bleach to paint on a word or design. This creates a beautiful and artsy appearance, and it’s quite easy. You’ll need chalk, gloves, bleach, a paintbrush, and dark-colored towels.


Sketch out your design in chalk.Put on your gloves. Now, using a paintbrush or foam brush, apply fabric bleach to the fabric on top of the chalk. You may have to wiggle the brush to drive the bleach into the pile of the towel.
Let the bleach develop, then wash the towel.
Breathe safe! If you’re working with bleach, make sure you’re in a well-ventilated area, wear gloves, and take breaks if you feel woozy., You can achieve a trendy image by dip-dying the tips of a towel. You’ll need light-colored towels, RIT dye, gloves, salt, a hanger, newspapers, and a bucket or tub that you can stain with no repercussions.Put on the gloves, so you don’t end up with purple hands.
Prepare a dye bath according to the package directions. This may require a surprising amount of table salt.
Wet the towel. Fold it in half and hang it over the hanger so that both ends are even.
Dip the tips of the towel into bath, and let them soak for 5-10 minutes.
Hang the towel to dry with its ends positioned over a pad of newspapers (to avoid staining the floor). Don’t let the dyed parts touch anything.
Wash the towel according to the dye’s package directions.

, For extra fun for young guests, tie-dyed towels are great. This is a project with an improvisational flavor, so you can even invite kids to help. You will need light-colored towels, rubber bands, a tie-dye kit, newspapers, and a bucket or tarp.Use the rubber bands to create a base pattern for the towel--there will be white stripes wherever the bands were. Bind the towel into sections for a striped design, or pull and tie off small corners to make starbursts.
Get the towel wet in the sink, then squeeze out excess water.
Place the towel in a bucket or on a tarp and squirt dye onto it. Don’t be dainty--it’s more fun if it’s colorful.
Carefully remove the bands from the towel (you might want to wear gloves for this step), and let the towel dry flat on a thick pad of newspapers.
Wash according to the kit’s directions.

Make a basic spiral.,
Spread your material out on a flat surface.,
Pinch the center of the fabric with your thumb and two fingers.,
Twist the fabric while holding it down with your fingers.,
Close your spiral with your free hand.,
Band your spiral together.",How to Tie Dye1," The spiral pattern is a classic tie dye look. The basic spiral collects all your fabric together into a single coil. Using this method of tying, you'll create a design with your design that corkscrews out from the middle point of your spiral., But before you do, make sure the surface is clean! If you are working on a commonly used surface, like a table you eat meals at, leftover food or oil can get on your fabric and ruin your consistency of the pattern made by your dye.


Crumbs wound in your fabric could create light spots in your dye or flecks of white. Take a damp cloth and wipe off your surface before laying your fabric on it.
You may want to protect the surface on which you are working by laying down a dye resistant mat or disposable cover to work on. Some common options include cardboard, plastic, and tarps., You only want to gather a very small amount of fabric between your fingers at this point. The fabric you grasp in your fingers will form the center point of your fabric. Gathering too much fabric can lead to a large, blob-like center of your spiral.







, Keep your spiral as tight and flat as possible. To help create a regular spiral, you should flatten your fabric against your surface with each full twist of your hand.As you continue to twist, the fabric should begin to form a spiral shape.









You may want to use a tool to help you coil your fabric to give you the tightest spiral possible. A tighter spiral will result in more coils in the pattern, making it more elaborate. Some tools you might use to wind your spiral include a blunt fork or the eraser end of a sturdy pencil., Bring the loose end of your spiral and hold it to the main coiled part with the free hand you aren't using to twist the fabric. Pull the outside end of your coil tightly so that your spiral is wound as tightly as possible.







, Continuing to hold your spiral together with one hand, use your other hand to slide several large rubber bands around the fabric. You'll want to position them so that they cross at the center of the bundle, stretching from one end of the coil to the opposite side.









Start with four rubber bands and increase the number as you find necessary. Larger pieces of fabric, fabric wound especially tight, or thicker fabric might need more rubber bands to maintain the spiral.

Wash the towels that you're going to use.,
Once the towels are wash and dried, set up your sewing machine.,
Fold each bath towel in half.,
Place on the ground.",How to Turn Old Towels Into Bath Mats," They should be old towels that are no longer considered suitable for general use. It doesn't matter if they're threadbare in places as it's only going to be feet standing on them.;
, Choose the thread to match the towel colours and set the needle to sew through thick toweling.

, Simply stitch down the edges to create a half size towel. Stitch down the folded edge too, for evenness and strength.

, You've now got a new bath mat. There is no need to add ornamentation to these; they doing floor duty and they'll do it well.

Know the effect of knotting tie dye.,
Twist the fabric into a long rope.,
Tie the rope into a knot.,
Hold the knots in place with rubber bands.",How to Tie Dye2," An advantage of knotting your tie dye is that you can tie as many knots as you want. This is especially useful for long strips of fabric. Dyeing knotted fabric creates a design where fine lines of white, like the irregular shape of cracked glass, run throughout your dye colors in random directions., Hold each end of your fabric in your hands so the length of it is stretched between. Then twist each hand in opposite directions in a wringing motion. Continue twisting until the fabric cannot be twisted any more., You might want a large, central knot at the center of your fabric to create a focal point in your design. You could also tie many knots to create a series of burst-like points throughout your fabric.Be careful while twisting and knotting your fabric. You'll want it to be tight, but knotting it too tightly can cause the fabric to rip or warp.

, After you tie each knot, pull it tight. Hold the tightened knot with one hand to keep it from loosening. Then, with your free hand, reinforce each knot by looping rubber bands over them."
"
Understand the effect.,
Bunch up the fabric.,
Fasten your ball together.",How to Tie Dye3," The electric bunching technique is easy to form but hard to predict. After dyeing the fabric, you should be left with several ""shocks"" of color dispersed at random through the cloth., You'll want to do so in small, random portions. Use one hand to hold your bunch together so they do not come loose and then draw the entire piece of fabric together into the shape of a ball. Keep as much of the cloth ""face,"" or outer side of the fabric, exposed as possible.







, With one hand, hold the ball of fabric together. With your free hand, wrap several rubber bands around it to hold it together. You could also use twine or string to fasten your ball together, but in both cases, fasten your ball loosely.


Fastening your ball too tightly can make it difficult for the dye to work its way into the core of the bunched fabric. This can create gaps in your dyed design. Use the minimum number of fasteners secured as loose as possible while still retaining the ball's shape.
If you plan on using twine or string, it may be easiest to have a friend help you hold the bunched fabric while you tie, or vice versa. If no friends are available, lay of the string on the surface, set your ball atop the middle of the string while still holding the ball together with one hand, cross the ends of the string at the top of your ball, and use your free hand to tie a simple knot."
"
Know the pattern rosettes will create.,
Plot out the pattern for your rosettes.,
Gather the points together.,
Fasten your gathered rosettes.,
Gather and fasten the remaining fabric.",How to Tie Dye4," The rosette pattern creates a series of small, overlapping circles that can be linked together in a variety of patterns. You'll create this pattern by gathering together several points along your fabric and tying them together., You might want an arc of rosettes beneath the top of your fabric, above its bottom hem, up and down its sides, or any number of other variations. When you've decided where you want your rosettes to be, use a piece of chalk to draw a dots along the fabric where the center of each rosette will be.You can even create more elaborate shapes with your rosettes. For example, you could make a circle of rosettes around the middle of your shirt or gather them into the shape of star. Your imagination is the limit!

, Using your thumb and pointer finger, pinch each point and draw it together with its neighbor. Use one hand to hold your gathered points together and your free hand to continue adding points. Continue doing this until all your points are gathered together., Wrap a string or rubber band about 2 inches (5 cm) below the topmost point, which should be where you first marked your dots. You'll want your rosettes fastened very tightly. This may require using more than one fastener., Hold your fabric just below where you have fastened your rosettes and, with your other hand, draw together the loose end and hold it firmly. Pull the fabric so it is tight and then use rubber bands or string to fasten it at regular intervals."
"
Understand the effect.,
Roll your fabric into a long tube.,
Fasten your tube at regular intervals.",How to Tie Dye5," This technique creates a series of white or lighter colored stripes vertically (top-to-bottom) through the color of your dye by rolling the fabric and tying it with fasteners. Horizontal stripes can also be made by rolling your fabric left-to-right instead of top to bottom., To create vertical (top-to-bottom) stripes, you should roll your fabric from its bottom to the top in a loose tube. For horizontal (left-to-right) stripes, you should roll your fabric in a loose tube from the left to the right., Use rubber bands or string to tie the cloth tube off at even intervals. If the spacing between your fasteners is uneven, the distance between your stripes will also be uneven.


Your stripes will form along the orientation of your rubber bands.
To ensure even striping, you might want to measure the space between your fasteners with a ruler and adjust as necessary. You could also measure out and mark your spacing beforehand."

Understanding how a fixative helps.,
Prepare a soda ash bath for most chemical dyes.,
Create a salt fixative for natural, berry-based dyes.,
Prepare a vinegar fixative for other natural, plant-based dyes.,
Soak the tied fabric in the corresponding solution.,
Squeeze out excess moisture.",How to Tie Dye6," Over time, your dye will fade and loose its vibrancy, but a fixative will help the dye to last longer. The kind of fixative you use will vary depending on the dye you are using, but by soaking your fabric in a fixative solution before dyeing, the color of your dyed shirt will stay brighter longer., Chemical dyes, even commercial ones that can be purchased at a craft store, will usually be most effective if you first soak your fabric in a solution made from soda ash and warm water. Take a large plastic bucket and:


Combine 8 oz (250 ml) of soda ash fixer with 1 gallon (4 L) of warm water. Stir until it is evenly mixed.
Wear a dust mask and rubber or plastic gloves when working with this solution. Soda ash can irritate your lungs and skin., If you plan on using a natural dye made with some type of berry, the generally recommended fixative is one made from salt and cold water. You can make this solution easily by combining in a large bucket:


½ cup (125 ml) table salt with 8 cups (2 L) cold water. Stir until dissolved., If you plan to use a natural dye made from plant material other than berries, a solution made from water and vinegar will likely work better than one made from salt. To create your vinegar fixative solution, mix in a large bucket:


1 cup (250 ml) white distilled vinegar with 4 cups (1 L) cold water. Stir well to distribute the solution evenly., Immerse the bundle of tied-up fabric in the fixative solution long enough to soak thoroughly. When using soda ash, soak the fabric for 5 to 15 minutes. When using salt or vinegar, heat the liquid to a simmer and let the garment sit in the simmering liquid for 1 hour., You will need to wait for your fabric to cool before handling it if it has been soaking in a simmering solution. After the fabric has finished soaking/cooling, remove it from the fixative and wring it out so that it feels damp.


If using vinegar or salt, rinse the material before squeezing out the excess moisture.
A pair of tongs can be used to remove the fabric from the simmering solution so you can rinse the fabric immediately with cool water. This will save you time spent waiting for it to cool. Then, wring out the fabric until it is damp."

Wash your jeans in hot water.,
Dry your jeans in a drying machine.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Shrink Jeans1," Put your jeans in your washing machine and run them through a standard washing cycle. Set the machine to the hottest water level possible.









Avoid using delicate or hand-wash settings. Instead, use a permanent press or heavy duty setting.
The combination of hot water and heavy churning will cause the fibers in your jeans to contract.
Use detergent and liquid fabric softener as usual. Detergent will not reduce the effectiveness of this technique, and fabric softener can actually help to prevent the jeans from becoming too stiff as they shrink.;
, As soon as you remove your jeans from the washing machine, transfer them to your dryer. Dry the jeans completely using the hottest setting possible.









The heat of the dryer will cause the fibers to contract even more than they did in the washer.
Let your jeans dry completely. In fact, if you can leave the jeans in your dryer for 5 to 10 minutes longer after they finish drying, you may have even better results.
Do not air dry. Air drying your jeans following this method can actually cause some of the shrinkage to stretch out.

, One cycle is usually enough to tighten up your jeans, but if your jeans still feel a little loose, try running them through another cycle or two.









Try a professional dry cleaner if you cannot get your jeans to shrink sufficiently in your own washer and dryer. The machines at a dry cleaner have higher heat settings.

Grab a pair of pants you no longer wear.,
Cut off your pant legs at the crotch.,
Cut a strip of another fabric to fill out the length of the skirt.,
Pin the fabric to the edge of the skirt and sew.,
Add any final, stylized flairs.",How to Turn Pants Into a Skirt1," They need to be your size or bigger than you. If you don't have the perfect pair, take a trip to the thrift shop! Jeans, khakis, chinos, slacks -- all types will work.


If the pants are too big, you'll need to rip up the side seam, cut out the unnecessary fabric, and sew it back together to match your waistline.;
, Make sure it lies flat; you don't want any material bunching or bubbling -- it should naturally lie flush to the table.


If your cut isn't perfectly straight, that's fine! As long as it's a clean line, it doesn't matter what angle it's at. In fact, a steeper angle can give your skirt a more refined, less patched-together look.
If you want to use the legs for the rest of your skirt (right now it's too short), don't throw them away just yet!

, You probably want another six inches (in width) or so of fabric, if not more. If you have some scraps lying around from an old project, use those! Or you can use the pant leg of the ones you just tore up. Does the thigh or the calf give you the width you'd like?


Cut 1/2"" (1.25 cm) wide than you need for a seam allowance.
Make sure the fabric is long enough to wrap around the entirety of the skirt.
If you're using your old jeans, you may need to rip out the seam that meets the skirt -- otherwise that's a lot of thread going on in one place. And because of the cut of the jean, make sure the fabric lines up (width-wise) front and back.

, Using your 1/2"" seam allowance, pin your fabric to the edge of the skirt, leaving the extra on the inside, rendering it invisible. Flip the skirt inside out and begin either hand stitching or blazing through with a sewing machine.


If your fabric requires it, create a seam on the bottom edge, too. Just don't make it too short!
If your fabric is giving you any guff, iron it flat. It'll be much easier to work with then.

, Your skirt's done! But if you want to make it more ""you,"" add a ruffle, some fabric paint, or a bit of material along the sides. And then there's always dye, glitter, iron-ons, ink transfers, and screen printing!

Follow the package instructions to mix chemical dye.,
Handle the dye using plastic or rubber gloves.,
Use a large plastic bucket as your dye bath.,
Stir the dye until completely and thoroughly dispersed.",How to Tie Dye7," Different kinds of commercial dyes are made from different substances. This means that you'll need to follow the label instructions carefully in order to create the best color.

, This will prevent it from staining your hands and will limit your chances of spreading dye. Sometimes wet dye can remain in the cracks or folds of the skin on your hands and be transferred to clothing, furniture, or other things that way. Plastic or rubber gloves will prevent this., The water should be hot, usually with a recommended temperature around 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). For some dyes, hotter water produces stronger colors. For other dyes, extremely hot water can actually cause the color to fade. Verify which type you have before pressing forward., Usually, you will need one packet of powder dye or ½ cup (125 ml) liquid dye for every 2 to 3 gallons (7.6 to 11 L) water. More dye will create stronger colors.You can use a normal kitchen spoon or ladle to stir your dye. You may want to avoid using wooden spoons; your dye could stain these.

Fill a spray bottle with fabric softener and hot water.,
Spray the area you want to shrink.,
Throw your jeans in the dryer.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Shrink Jeans2," Mix three parts water with one part liquid fabric softener inside a standard spray bottle.









Put the top on the bottle and shake vigorously to combine.
You need to use a combination of water and fabric softener. This technique will not work correctly if you only use plain water. Do not use detergent, however, since you will not be rinsing the detergent out.

, Douse the area you want to shrink using your diluted fabric softener. Make sure that the entire area is well-soaked.









The dry portions of your jeans will not be affected.
This method is especially helpful if the waistband has begun to stretch out. If this is the case, spray the solution on the waistband of your jeans, saturating the fabric completely around the entire band.

, Put your jeans through a standard drying cycle using the hottest heat setting possible.









The high heat should cause the fibers of the wet fabric to constrict.
Air drying the jeans will not have the same effect.

, If the area does not shrink as much as you would like, apply more of your fabric softener solution and dry it again.

Put your jeans on.,
Fill the bathtub with hot water.,
Get in the bathtub.,
Sit out in the sun until dry.",How to Shrink Jeans3," Slip on the loose pair of jeans, zippering and buttoning them up as usual.

This is the only method in which you must wear your jeans as you shrink them.
Since you will be shrinking your jeans as you wear them, the jeans will shrink around your legs, create a perfect, snug fit.
You should begin this process on the same day you plan to wear your jeans. If this is not possible, then use this method to shrink your jeans a day or two before you wear them. Do not wash the jeans after shrinking them, though, since doing so could cause the fibers to relax and ease back into their original, loose position.

, Fill the tub with enough hot water to cover your legs and waist completely.

Make the water as hot as you can tolerate. Obviously, you want to avoid burning yourself with water that is too hot to handle, but lukewarm water will not be able to cause the fibers to contract enough for sufficient shrinkage.
Test the temperature of the water with your hand to gauge how hot it is.

, Slowly ease yourself into the hot water while still wearing your jeans. Remain in the bathtub until the water cools to room temperature.

If you made the water sufficiently hot, it should take at least 20 minutes for the water to cool.
Make sure that your jeans are completely submerged under the water. If your legs or part of your waistband remain above water, add more hot water to the bathtub until these exposed portions are submerged, as well.

, Air dry your jeans so that they conform to the shape of your legs.

If possible, sit outside in a sunny location to do this. Make sure to choose a hot day to prevent yourself from getting sick and to help the jean fibers continue to contract.
Sit in a plastic or metal chair. Avoid absorbent surfaces that may soak up the water from your jeans.
You may need to turn yourself as you sit or lie out in the sun. Otherwise, the tops of your legs will dry while the back will remain wet.
It can take several hours for your jeans to dry.

Turn your jeans inside-out.,
Boil a large stockpot of water.,
Dunk your jeans in the boiling water.,
Dry your jeans in the dryer.",How to Shrink Jeans4," Make sure that the jeans are turned completely inside-out. Fold them loosely and set aside.









Turning your jeans inside-out will lessen the amount of fading that will occur. Your jeans should still shrink the same way without any problems, even if turned inside-out.
This step is especially necessary if shrinking new jeans with a fairly dark wash. If working with a pair of light wash jeans or an old pair of jeans that area already faded, you might be able to skip this step without causing much if any damage.

, Fill a large stockpot halfway to three-quarters full with standard tap water. Set it on the stove and bring it up to a full, rolling boil using high heat.









The water is at a full boil when large, rolling waves of bubbles violently break the surface of the water.
You need to make sure that you use enough water and a large enough stockpot so for the jeans to be completely submerged.

, Use tongs to place your jeans in the boiling water. Let them soak for 20 to 30 minutes as the water continues to boil.









Do not cover the stockpot as your jeans soak.
Check periodically to make sure that the fabric stays submerged in the water. If needed, push the jeans under from time to time using your tongs.

, Remove your jeans from the boiling water and transfer them to your dryer immediately. Use the hottest dryer setting possible and dry your jeans completely.









The intense heat of the dryer will further tighten the fibers already tightened by the hot, turbulent water.
Make sure that you use tongs as you hand the jeans since they will be very hot.
Do not air-dry the jeans.
Make sure that the jeans are completely dry when you remove them from the drying machine.

Wash your jeans using hot water.,
Dry your jeans until damp.,
Iron the jeans until dry.",How to Shrink Jeans5," You can use a standard hot water cycle in your washing machine or you can boil the jeans in hot water. The former will allow you to wash your jeans as you shrink them, while the latter will be quicker.









The boiling method is also slightly more flexible. If you only wanted to shrink a portion of your jeans, like the legs or waistband, you could submerge that portion only under the boiling water. Hold it in place using tongs.
If using the washing machine method, add detergent and liquid fabric softener as usual.
Make sure that the water is as hot as possible for either method.

, Throw your jeans into the dryer and dry until they are damp but not soaked. Set the dryer on its highest heat setting.









This is especially important if you used boiling water or if your washing machine did not put your jeans through a spin cycle. Your jeans should still be wet, but not dripping wet.














, Place your damp jeans on the ironing board and iron until the fabric is completely dry.









Use a moderate heat setting.
Note that this may not shrink the jeans as much as some of the other methods described, but it can be effective if you only need a slight adjustment.

Grab a pair of pants, any size.,
Measure to your desired length and cut.,
Rip out all the stitches from the edges of the leg to the crotch.,
Fold the edges under and pin.,
Iron.,
Take a cut pant leg.,
Turn it right side out and sew around the edges, starting at the bottom.,
Hem the skirt and press.,
Trim off any extra fabric and give it a final press.",How to Turn Pants Into a Skirt2," If they're bigger than you are, you'll need to cut down the edge and resew them to your size, but it'll still work! And any material will work, too. Jeans, slacks, khakis -- it's all good.

, Remember to leave 2"" for a seam allowance or your skirt will be a bit shorter than you want it to be. Keep the part that's cut off (that is, the legs) -- that'll be what goes between the ""legs"" of your skirt, filling out the middle.

, Do it all the way around until 1/4"" (.6 cm) below the crotch on both sides. You'll need your handy dandy seam ripper for this part. It'll take some time, so throw on your pajamas and the TV and get comfy.


This is the most tedious part. It's all downhill from here!

, All those exposed seams? They need to go away! Fold them under (1/2"" or so) and pin them to the inside. Do this on both sides, all the way around. You should have a clean, streamlined ""V"" on both sides, even and mirroring each other.

, Don't skip this step! It may seem a bit unnecessary, but your material will be much, much easier to work with if it's flat and all the kinks are worked out. You'll also be able to see if your lines are straight and your angles are how you want them.

, Turn your skirt inside out and pin the pant leg (the one you cut off) all the way around, covering the ""V."" Cut it so it covers the entirety of the opening, pinning it in place so it doesn't go anywhere.


You'll need to do this for both sides, by the way, unless you want a crazy big (read: totally inappropriate) slit up the back (or front!) of your skirt.

, Go up both sides, sewing as close as possible to the edges where the fabrics meet. This can be done by hand, but will be much simpler with a sewing machine.

, Since you have that new cut at the bottom of your skirt (it's actually a skirt now!), you'll need to get it clean and looking pretty. Grab 1/2"" (1.25 cm) of the edge of the fabric and tuck it under, creating a hem. Iron it down and sew (again, as close to the edge as possible), creating a nice, clean line.

, You probably have some extra fabric on the insides of your seams that can do to be cut off. After that, grab your iron one last time, and give 'er a final press. Tada! It may not be water into wine, but it's pretty dang nifty!

Get a pair of pants.,
Cut up and down the seams.,
Fold it in half (at the crotch) and sew a straight line down the middle.,
Pin the legs together and backstitch.,
Turn the skirt inside out.,
Pin the sides and sew.,
Cut it to length and create your edge.",How to Turn Pants Into a Skirt3," If they're your size, make sure they ride where you want them to ride -- that is, for a pencil skirt, around your natural waist. If they ride at your hip, you'll need to trade them out for a pair that are much bigger. A bigger size can easily morph into a high-waisted skirt.


Any material will do, not just denim! If your mom has a rockin' pair of chinos from the 80s, give it a shot!

, If the pants are bigger than you, you'll need to cut the inside and outside seams. If they're your size, you'll only need to cut the inside seams (along the inside of your legs).


Cut up the crotch too, so it lays flat. If you don't, you'll have this bulky, bubbly mess of fabric that you do not want to be dealing with later on down your skirt road. Cut to wear the material doesn't naturally curve anymore.

, That extra material for crotch room? The kind that juts out that forms a V? We don't want that. You want two long, straight shots of fabric for each ""leg."" Start at the widest point near the crotch and cut a straight line on both legs. It can even go down to the bottom of the pant.


If you bought pants that are much bigger than you and are working with two different halves, you'll need to do these steps twice.

, Down that straight line you just cut, pin both legs together to form the unified material for your skirt. Pin about 1"" from the edges, leaving room for your backstitch. You can cut off some of excess material (length-wise) right now if you'd like, or you can just sew it all and adjust for length later. But if you'd like a slit, don't sew up the back all the way!


Your backstitch should be as close to the edge as possible -- you can follow the seam line that's already there. You can do this either by hand or with a machine, no problem.
Again, if you're working with two different halves, do this for both.

, Or if you're working with two different pieces (having just sewn each piece separately), lay the top piece on the bottom piece, wrong sides facing out.


If the skirt is bigger than you, take a skirt that fits you and lay it on top. Then, cut your pants-skirt to that size, leaving 1"" on each side for a seam allowance. If you're not a super good seamstress, leave 2"" -- it's easier to make it smaller and not so easy to make it bigger!
If the skirt is your size, you're ready to start sewing up the edge!

, Each side needs a good pinning (up and down both sides) to make it easier on you for sewing and to assure a straight line. If you're working with denim, make sure you're using denim thread. Don't have denim thread? Then use cotton thread and go over it twice.


Again, if you're using denim, sew very slowly. You may also need to pull at the fabric a little to keep it taut and straight.
Then try it on! You can adjust for length once you see how it fits your body.

, Once you've tried it on, find out where you'd like it to hit your leg. Pin it, take it off, and you're almost there! Cut it at the desired length, create your edge, and you're done!


You have two main options here: you can either hem it, creating a clean, finished edge, or you can cut and fray it, sticking with the distressed look. If you do choose to hem it, fold under 1/2"" (1.25 cm) of material and sew along the edges. Do the same for your slit, if applicable.

Boil, simmer and strain plant material when mixing natural dyes.,
Boil and strain berry-based material to make natural dyes.,
Choosing the right natural substance to make your dye.",How to Tie Dye8," Many plants found in nature can be used to create a homemade, natural dye. You will need to follow the same basic procedure when separating the dye from the plant matter. To do so you should:


Chop up the plant or dye material into small pieces using a kitchen knife.
Place two parts water and one part dye material in a large pot and boil it over high heat.
Reduce the heat and let simmer for 1 hour.
Strain the plant material out and pour the now colored liquid into a large bowl for you dye bath., Berries also carry rich pigments that give them color. These pigments can be separated from the fruit of the berry to create a potent, natural dye. To create your dye from berries you should:


Boil the berries for approximately 15 minutes or until the color of the berries mixed in with water.
Separate the berry chunks by using a strainer and pour the colored liquid into a large bowl. Discard the berry chunks leaving only the colored solution to be used in dyeing the fabric., Using different plant materials, you can extract different color dyes. The following list is by no means exhaustive, but some popular colors and the plants they are made from include:



Orange: Onion skin and carrot roots

Brown: Coffee, tea, walnuts, and dandelion roots

Pink: Red raspberries, cherries, and strawberries

Blue/purple: Red cabbage, mulberries, elderberries, blueberries, purple grapes, cornflower petals, and purple irises

Red:Beets, rose hips, and St. John's Wort soaked in alcohol

Black: Iris roots

Green: Artichokes, spinach leaves, sorrel roots, lilac flowers, snapdragon flowers, black-eyed Susans, and grass

Yellow: Celery leaves, turmeric, willow leaves, marigold blossoms, paprika, peach leaves, yarrow, and alfalfa seeds"

Soak the fabric for the appropriate amount of time.,
Dye from the lightest color to the darkest.,
Rinse with cool water after each dye application.",How to Tie Dye9," Every dye is different, so the exact amount of time you need to soak your fabric in the dye will vary. For commercial products, you should always follow the listed instructions. Generally you can expect:


A chemical dye will usually require you to soak your fabric for 4 to 10 minutes. Soaking your fabric too long could result in the color becoming too dark.
A natural dye will yield the best and brightest color when simmering. Soak your fabric in the heated water for roughly one hour. For a stronger, more vibrant color, soak the fabric overnight., If you plan on dyeing your fabric multiple colors, soak your fabric in the lightest color first. You can do this by dipping the part of your fabric you want dyed in a shallow bowl so only that part of the collected fabric takes on that particular color. Then immerse the fabric in progressively darker shades until all your colors have been used., Use cool, running water after applying each dye application. This will remove excess dye and seal the color in the fabric. Excess dye could splash or bleed to other parts of your shirt where you don't want it! Rinse thoroughly to prevent this."
"
Understand the difference in effect.,
Prepare your dye in the bottles.,
Lay your fabric on a protected surface.,
Apply your dye.,
Read directions carefully before finishing.",How to Tie Dye10," Perhaps the easiest way of tie dyeing is to soak your fabric in a single colored solution called a dye bath. If you want multi-colored designs to create a rainbow, swirl effect, or some other kind of colorful pattern, squirt bottles are the way to go!, You should always follow the directions that come with your dye or dye bottle kit for best results.However, generally you can expect that for every packet of powdered dye or ½ cup liquid dye you'll need to add two cups of warm to hot tap water to your squirt bottle.


You can improve the dyeing process by adding salt to your dye solution. You should use the amount of salt recommended on the packaging of your dye, but typically you can expect to need one tablespoon of salt per squirt bottle. Stir or shake the solution until it is consistent throughout., If your dye soaks through the fabric, it could cause a stain to form on the surface on which you're dyeing. There are many ways you can protect your work area. You might use overlapping pieces plastic wrap, a tarp, thick cardboard, or many other kinds of material. After protecting the area you'll be dyeing, lay your fabric on top of the protected surface., Take your squirt bottles and, in whatever pattern you desire, apply the dye to the fabric. You might want to put primary colors, like red, yellow, and blue, next to each other to create sharper contrast.









It's a good idea to keep some paper towel on hand during this process. If you apply too much dye, it could puddle on the fabric and run, creating a runny design! You can prevent this by blotting excess dye with paper towel., Some dyes may require you to seal your fabric in a plastic baggie and then heat it in your microwave. When doing this, you should put down a layer of paper towel on the bottom of your microwave in case your plastic baggie leaks.


When removing your fabric from the microwave, be careful you don't burn yourself. A pair of gloves or tongs can protect you from burns.
Watch your fabric carefully when it is in the microwave. If you notice the plastic baggie inflate, this is completely normal. However, microwaving your bagged fabric for too long could melt the plastic and ruin your fabric."

Rinse your fabric again in cool water.,
Remove your fasteners.,
Wash the fabric in warm water.,
Gently squeeze out extra water after the rinse.,
Dry as desired.,
Enjoy your finished tie dye.",How to Tie Dye11," When you have finished all of your dye applications to your fabric and rinsed each part individually, rinse the whole thing one more time thoroughly under cool, running water. To ensure you've done this completely, you should:


Continue rinsing the fabric until the water runs clear. Be thorough; you don't want dye to spread to other clothing.
This process could take several minutes., Use a pair of scissors to carefully cut the string or rubber bands from the fabric. You should cut carefully to avoid damaging your newly tie dyed fabric. After that, you can unravel the fabric to reveal the pattern.









Alternatively, you could save your fasteners for later use by untying your string or unwrap the rubber bands.

, Use warm water and a mild, dye-free detergent to wash the fabric. You could do this in your washing machine or you could hand wash it in a tub or bucket. Once you are finished washing, rinse the fabric will cool water.If you decide on using a washing machine, you may want to run your tie dyed fabric through a cycle alone. This way, dye you might have missed won't transfer to other clothes., Wring any extra water from your fabric, but be careful not to wring too hard, as this can stretch out and deform your fabric. To prevent your fabric from deforming from excess wringing, you can:









Lay your dyed fabric flat in an old towel that is larger than it. Roll up your fabric inside the towel, and then wring out the towel along with the fabric inside.

, You can machine dry or hang dry the fabric. The best method for drying will depend on the kind of fabric you have dyed. Follow the tag instructions on the tag for best results, or, if there is no tag, allow your shirt to hang dry.

, You might want to try each of the three kinds of dye, plant, berry, and chemical, to find which you like best. Additionally, there are many differences depending on which plant/berry/chemical you choose to dye your fabric. You may find you enjoy some natural methods more than chemical, but other instances might be best suited for chemical dye.

Petals from different flowers work well, as do herbs such as rosemary, thyme, and sage.Some petals will have a stronger smell than others. For a spicier scent, try adding ingredients like cinnamon, clove, and star anise.;
, After gathering all your potpourri ingredients, you need to dry them thoroughly to prevent mold growth. Flowers and herbs can be laid out in a single, loose layer on a baking sheet. As long as the surface is completely smooth, it should work fine. the flowers in a dark, cool place for drying. Most flowers and herbs will be thoroughly dry after about two weeks if placed in an ideal location.To dry without rotting, the dead flowers and herbs should be placed in a location that is dry, dark, cool, and well ventilated. Ventilation is key, as it is crucial to removing moisture from the flowers and mitigating bacterial or fungal growth.

, Since essential oils dissipate quickly, you need to add a new ingredient to your potpourri mix: shavings of orris root. Use about a tablespoon (15 ml) of Orrisroot per cup (240 ml) of flower petals. You only need a few drops of each essential oil.Orris root is the root of a type of Iris, and it serves as a fixative for essential oils.

Assess the quality of your linens.,
Remove stains from antique linens.,
Do some research on vintage linens, if you want to sell them.",How to Recycle Antique or Vintage Linens1," Not all bed linens are classified as antique or vintage. Focus on those that were made before 1960 for the best results.


Find any damage on the linens. If they are damaged, they will not fetch the same price as if they are in excellent condition. Go over each set of linens with a careful eye. Decide what quality they are in, such as poor, fair, good or very good. Set poor quality linens aside to be used for crafts rather than resale.
Save any novelty linens from the 1970s and 1980s. Some novelty sheets can be sold online to collectors, especially if they are in good quality.
Try to decipher their age. If there is a tag, look that up online to try to find collections. If there isn't, try to take notes about what you know of the fabric and date of purchase. Ask older relatives in your family about the origins of these items.;
, You can improve the look and increase the value of some linens if you remove stains before using or selling them. The following methods can work on many types of vintage linen:


Spot treat the stain with gentle methods before laundering. Sprinkle salt and squeeze fresh lemon juice on the stain. Allow it to soak through for a few minutes. Then, pour hot boiling water over the linen. Be very careful when working with boiling water.
Hand wash all delicate linens. It is preferable to use soap flakes, rather than modern detergents, in order to maintain the integrity of the fabric. Never wring your linens dry, as it can damage the fabric.
Mix a solution of stain fighter in a bucket or sink, if this doesn't work and let sit overnight. Mix 1 scoop of enzyme bleach, such as Biz, with 1 scoop oxygen bleach, such as OxyClean and add 3/4 cup of ammonia and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Agitate and rinse the stain fighter out several times.
Dry all items on a line or on the grass to avoid damaging them with heat. If you don't have a line, lay the linen on white towels on the grass in the sun. Sunlight can help to further bleach out stains.

, Visit estate sales, antique shops or online antique linen stores, such as vintagelinens.com and emsheart.com. It helps to have some contact with the linens to find out what valuable linens look and feel like.

Make cutoffs.,
Distress your jeans for a ""shredded"" look.,
Make a skirt.,
Use the denim for patching material.,
Make an apron.,
Try acid-washing your jeans.,
Dye the jeans.,
Re-decorate your jeans.",How to Recycle Jeans1," This is the ""classic"" solution for extending the life of a pair of jeans. Any jeans can be converted to cutoff shorts or capris. All that's needed is to do is cut the legs where you'd like them to end. Use a ruler or tape measure to trace a straight line across each leg, then use a fabric knife or set of scissors to cut. See our cutoff article for step-by-step instructions.


If you're not sure how high you want your cutoffs, be conservative. You can always cut off more denim. However, you can't add more back once you've cut off too much.
You don't need to throw away the legs once you cut them off. You can use the material for rags, ties, or patches (see below).;
, Have a pair of jeans that's starting to look worn-out? Make a fashion statement by wearing them out more. Cut them, shred them, crush them, or otherwise beat them up to make your own ""distressed"" denim. See our guide to distressing jeans for lots of specific ideas.


One beginner-friendly option is to use a cheese grater or a square of sandpaper to wear out your jeans' knees. Shred until white, worn areas begin to develop or you have a set of ragged holes — whichever you prefer.
This is also a good opportunity to get rid of stains. Shred the stained area until the stain is gone.

, If you have some basic sewing knowledge, it's not hard to turn a set of jeans into a skirt or dress. See our main article on this subject for step-by-step instructions. To do this:Open the inside seam of both legs.
Stitch the front part of both legs together to form a new front seam for your skirt.
Stitch a large piece of fabric between the back part of each leg to complete the skirt.
Trim the skirt to your desired length.

, If you have another piece of clothing that's looking worn out, consider cannibalizing your jeans to patch up the other item. Cut square or oval sections of fabric from the jeans, then stitch them over the worn-out sections of the other clothes. You can even make your patch look like a deliberate fashion choice by patching the same spot on both sides of a piece of clothing. For instance, you might patch both elbows on a jacket or both knees on a pair of pants.


To get two patches that are the same size and shape, use a fabric knife or a set of scissors to cut through both layers of denim (front and back) at the same time.

, A denim apron uses the jean's waistband and fastener to stay around your waist, so you'll want a pair that fits. Turn your old jeans into a durable apron by following the directions below:


Cut the jeans to the length you want your apron. For a short apron, cut an inch or so below the pockets. For a longer apron, cut in the middle of the leg.
Starting at the top of the zipper, cut horizontally until you reach the side seam. Repeat for the other side.
Sew the legs together to make the front of the apron.
Put the jeans on backwards so that the pockets are in front. Fasten the waistband behind you to get it to stay on.

, Acid-washed denim is perfect for an 80s throwback look. These jeans have large patches that are so bleached that they are nearly white. Use the following method with a dark set of jeans for the most noticeable results. An alternate method is available at our main acid-washing article.


Mix 2.5 parts water and 1 part bleach in a large bucket.
If you want a blotchy, tie-dye like pattern, gather small sections of jean fabric and bind them into tight ""buds"" with rubber bands.
Dip the jeans into the bleach mixture. Let them sit for 30-60 minutes (longer will give a lighter color).
Remove the jeans and rinse with clean water. Dry as normal.

, For most people, denim sis synonymous with the color blue. However, there's no reason this has to be the case. With dyes, you can turn old blue jeans into colorful new additions to your wardrobe. Try this easy dip-dying method below (or see our main jean-dying article):


Soak the jeans in bleach until they are as white as possible. Rinse with water to neutralize the bleach.
Let the jeans dry. While you wait, mix fabric dye according to the instructions.
Dip the dry bleached jeans in the fabric dye while wearing leather gloves. Stir the mixture so that they are evenly coated.
Dip several more times, wringing out the moisture between dips.
Rinse in water with a little detergent to set the dye. Let the jeans dry.

, Another way to get new life out of old jeans is to treat them as a canvas for your artistic abilities. Don't be afraid to get creative. You can make your worn-out jeans look amazing with a little imagination. Below are just a few things you may want to try:


Drawings and doodles. Use a permanent marker or a fabric marker to get designs that stay in your jeans for more than one wash cycle. You may want to trace in pencil first to avoid mistakes.
Rhinestones and studs. Use a sturdy fabric-safe glue for durability.
Negative space designs. Trace shapes or designs on your jeans, then carefully cut them out with a fabric knife or set of scissors. Your skin will show through the hole, creating eye-catching contrast.

Make a tote bag.,
Make rags or placemats.,
Make a heating pad.,
Turn your jeans into insulation material.,
Use the denim to ""scratch-proof"" furniture and tools.,
Use the inseams for ties.",How to Recycle Jeans2," Jeans don't just need to be recycled into other types of clothing. Denim is fairly strong, so it's perfect for making sturdy tools and accessories as well. One easy project is to make a tote bag. This is perfect for carrying groceries and using as a purse replacement. To make a tote bag:


Cut the legs off just below the crotch (as if you were making a very short pair of cutoffs).
Cut the crotch seam and trim both sides to get something similar to a very short skirt.
Stitch the bottom flaps of the ""skirt"" together to make the bottom of the bag.
Cut two long, skinny strips of fabric from the leftover leg material. Stitch these to the top of the bag to make two handles.

, Denim isn't terribly absorbent, so it's not great for towels. However, it is quite durable, so rags cut from it are great for the garage or kitchen. Making denim rags and mats is easy: just cut square sections of fabric from the jeans as needed.


One simple way to get good-looking rags is to trace two straight, parallel lines across the front of one leg. Cut across both these lines to get a looped section of denim. Slice down one or both seams to get either one or two rags.
To make pot holders, fold the rags to double- or triple-up the material, then stitch them shut.

, This easy project is a must for treating back pain or sore muscles. Cut two identical squares of fabric from the jeans (see the trick above for cutting sets of rags). Stitch up three sides tight, leaving the fourth open. Scoop uncooked rice into the opening. Stitch the final side shut. Microwave the pad in 20-second increments until it is warm, then hold it against your sore spots.Use a large tube-shaped pad instead of a square to make a neck pillow that's great for painful kinks.

, This is a good choice for leftover sections of denim or jeans that are too ragged or worn-down for other tasks. Cut your jeans into many long strips, then soak these strips in a borax-and-water bath for about five minutes. Squeeze the moisture out of the strips and press them into small gaps in your walls or framing. The denim will dry into a hard, water- and insect- proof insulator.Borax is a safe, cheap laundry additive. You can usually find it in the laundry section of department stores or via online retailers.

, Denim is durable enough for heavy-duty use, but it's still soft enough that it will never scratch other surfaces. Use scraps of denim to ""scratch-proof"" objects around the house. Just use glue or adhesive to fix pieces of denim to scratch-prone spots.


For example, if you want to keep your ladder from scratching your gutters, cut two wide strips of fabric from your jeans. Glue them to both sides of your ladder at the top. When you rest the ladder against the gutters, the soft denim will make contact, rather than the hard metal.
Another easy idea is to cut small circles of denim and fix them to the bottom of furniture legs to keep them from scratching the floor.

, The thick, doubled-up line of stitched fabric inside each pant leg makes a strong, durable string-like material. You can use it to tie up a wide variety of things. For example, use jean inseams to tie loose tools together for easy transport. You can also use it like a keyring to organize things like measuring cups, wrenches, and other similar sets of objects.

Give the jeans to a family member or a friend.,

You can also try giving the jeans to people you know who are interested in crafts and DIY projects (like the ones above) for use as raw materials.

, This is a great option if you're looking to make a little extra cash. Sites like Ebay and Craigslist offer convenient options for selling your jeans. You're not likely to get very much money for used jeans (unless they're designer), but something is better than nothing.

Check other ads for jeans in your area before you price yours. You want to pick a competitive price to stand a good chance of selling your jeans.
Be sure to clearly list the size, maker, and style of the jeans in your ad. Note any areas of wear. Being honest is important for your reputation as a seller., Organizations like Goodwill and The Salvation Army will usually accept jeans in a reasonable state of quality. You can also donate your jeans to thrift stores and door-to-door clothing drives. There are a variety of choices available depending on your location, so check a local directory of charities (or an online resource like Guidestar.org).Don't forget to keep the receipt — you can deduct the donation from your taxes., You don't only have to donate jeans to agencies that will use them as clothing. Denim can be used as a raw material by many other organizations as well. Two possible choices are below. The options available near you may vary.Local art programs can use denim for rags, craft materials, and paint applicators.
House-building charities (Habitat for Humanity, etc.) sometimes use jeans as insulation.

Check on the baby clothes every six months.",How to Store Baby Clothes," Most people that store baby clothes prefer to put them in a cardboard box, as these are easy to label, stack, and move around. However, they are not a guarantee that the clothes will be in perfect condition when they are removed from storage.


Cardboard boxes need to be placed in a dry area with low humidity so that the cardboard does not deteriorate from moisture or develop mold that could damage the clothes.
It is not a good idea to line the inside of the cardboard box or tub with a plastic bag because it can also hold in moisture that will eventually cause the growth of mold.;
, Like cardboard boxes, plastic tubs (with lids) are great options for storing baby clothes, as they are compact and easy to transport. A few things to keep in mind when using plastic tubs include:


The plastic tubs need to be kept out of sunlight because the sun's rays can cause the exposed parts of the clothing to fade over time.
Although the plastic tubs keep air and dust out, they also keep moisture in. Therefore, it is important that the baby clothes that are stored in plastic tubs be thoroughly dried before storing them this way.

, If there are spare dresser drawers, the baby clothes can be stored there. Unfortunately, most people do not have a great deal of extra dresser drawer space and those that do might have it spread over several different rooms which makes it difficult to organize the baby clothes.

, Hanging up a year’s worth of baby clothes can take up quite a bit of space since they are so small and the hangers are rather thick. This method should only be used to store some items that would not do well being stored flat in a drawer or a box.

, Plastic bags are practical for storing clothes, especially when vacuum packed. Vacuum packed clothes are well-protected from dust and moisture, and take up less space than boxes. However, the clothes may be extremely wrinkled when you unpack them.

, Go through all of the baby clothes before packing them away, and dispose of any that are overly worn or stained. You should only store clothes that are well-preserved.

, Storing clothes that have not been thoroughly cleaned is almost guaranteeing disaster of one kind or another The dirty baby clothes, especially ones that have food on them, could attract a variety of bugs that might eat the material, nest in it, or leave droppings all over it.


Mice, rats, and other larger vermin might come to eat the bugs or the food on the clothes if they are stored in a garage, storage unit, or attic where people do not go often.
Additionally, any type of dirt on the clothes can cause stains to develop over time.

, All baby clothes should be washed and dried according to the instructions on the tag of the clothes. If there is no longer a tag, then it is probably safe to just wash and dry the article of clothing along with others that are made of the same type of material.

, Ironing clothes before storage is optional, because the clothes are likely to become wrinkled over time anyway (even if they are hung in a garment bag). There are also some vermin that might be attracted to the scent of sprayed starch if it is used on the baby clothes during ironing.

, Over time metal buttons can corrode and leave stains on clothing. Therefore you should remove them and store them in a separate box. Keep this box in a safe place, so you can re-attach the buttons in future.

, It's a good idea to sort the baby clothes into different categories so you can easily find what you're looking for in future. You can sort the baby clothes by size (0-6 months, 6-12 months, etc) or by season (summer clothes and winter clothes).

, Although it might be possible to fit more baby clothes in a storage container when they are folded, it is better if they are laid flat in the storage container, so they are stored with a minimal amount of folds. This is important as the pressure of folded clothes stacked up together over time can cause creases that are very difficult to remove.

, If you must fold the clothes in order to fit them into the storage container, try to fold them in places where the creases will be less noticeable.


Dresses or tops of any type can be folded at the shoulder where the sleeves are sewn on and at the waistline.
Pants should be folded lengthwise. Dress pants should be folded seam to seam because the crease is often already there.
If possible, the folds should not be made at high stress areas, like the knees, because it could cause them to wear out faster.

, To help keep pests like insects and vermin away from stored baby clothes, a few moth balls or special cedar wood pieces can be stored with the clothes. Both of these have an odor that is offensive to most pests.


When placing either of these pest deterrents in the cardboard box or plastic tub, it is important to make sure that they are not actually in contact with the clothes because they could leave stains on them over time.
Instead, the baby clothes can be covered with an old towel and the pest deterrent can by placed on top of that in such a way that it can’t reach the baby clothes.

, The place where you store your baby clothes needs to be dry and dark place, so the clothes do not get damaged by moisture or light. Moisture can cause the occurrence of mold, and light may cause clothes to fade.


Avoid locations with extreme temperature differences as attics or garages.
It is best to choose an interior room, away from heating ducts or exterior walls to prevent damage to the clothing. For example, leave the clothes under a bed or at the top of a closet.

, Even though all of the above safeguards are done to ensure that the baby clothes will be in good shape when they come out of storage, it does not mean that some peculiar circumstance won’t end up ruining the clothes. Therefore, it is very important to check on the condition of the stored baby clothes once in a while.


Knowing how often to check on the stored baby clothes is hard to determine, but most problems are likely to show signs within the first few months.
After that time, checking the condition of the stored baby clothes every six months should be fine.

Determine if spice racks will work in your bathroom.,
Purchase suitable spice rack(s).,
Measure and mark your spice rack placement.,
Install the spice racks.,
Check the levelness of the spice rack(s).",How to Add Storage Space to Your Bathroom1," If you have wall space above your toilet, to the side of your mirror, or in a similar location in your bathroom, extra spice rack storage will likely work for you. Use a tape measure to measure the available space so you know what size shelf your bathroom can accommodate.

The narrow design of most spice racks along with their usually raised edges, intended to keep spices from falling, are perfect for holding toiletries and bottles.;
, Your bathroom may only be able to fit a single spice rack, or it may fit a few shelves, but in both cases you'll need to go purchase a spice rack. Pre-made racks are available at many big box retailers, furniture stores, and hardware stores.

Be sure to check the dimensions of potential shelves against the measurements you took earlier of your available spice rack space.

, Use a pencil and a tape measure to mark the placement of your shelf or shelves on your bathroom wall. Try not to hang the racks too high or low, as will make them less convenient. Generally, two marks measured to the same height, one for the right end of your spice rack and the other for the left, will be sufficient for hanging.
The distance between your marks should be the same as the distance separating the holes that will attach your rack to the wall.

, Depending on your spice rack, your method of installment will vary. In many cases, you'll have to attach some hardware to your wall with a drill. This hardware, usually some kind of simple holding bracket, will then support the shelf or shelves.

In other cases, you may have to screw your shelf directly into the wall with a drill.
Hanging the spice rack on your own, while possible, may be difficult. A helper would likely make installing your shelf or shelves easier., Once the spice racks have been installed, take a carpenter's level and check that your shelf or shelves are level. If your shelf is uneven, this could cause your toiletries to slant toward one end of the rack or the other.

If your spice rack isn't level, remove it from its hardware or the wall, adjust it slightly, re-check its levelness, and if it is level, reinstall the shelf.

Utilize all available surfaces.,
Use drawers in cabinets to improve storage.,
Put a lazy susan in your cabinets.,
Install tower shelving in your shower.,
Upgrade your sink storage.,
Put in a second shower rod.",How to Add Storage Space to Your Bathroom2," The back of your bathroom door is a frequently underused space. But this is a great place where you can install extra towel racks. You could also purchase organizers with adhesive backing and stick these to the inside of the doors of your cabinets to boost your bathroom storage capacity.

Though these kinds of organizers are frequently small, they still work great for things like lipstick, cotton swabs, lotions, eyebrow pencils, toothbrushes, and more., Drawers stack, which will allow you to use more of the vertical space in your cabinets. Too often, items clutter the bottom of cabinets while the upper space is unused. Drawers, or stackable shelves, will help you make better use of this space., Items can be easily pushed to the back of a cabinet and lost or forgotten. For this reason, you may be under-utilizing the space in the back of your bathroom cabinets. A lazy susan is essentially a tray that rotates on a base, so you can spin the tray to reach items in the back of your cabinets more easily., These kinds of shelves often fit right into the corner of your shower, where they are out of the way but still convenient. They are perfect for holding soap bottles and loofah, and will prevent bathing supplies from crowding the floor of your shower or edge of your tub.

Some variations of tower shelving hang from the shower itself instead of fitting into the shower's corner. This variety may be even better for especially small showers., There are many pre-made cabinets, available at hardware and furniture stores, that wrap around your sink to increase your storage space. If this option is a little outside your price range, you could buy a decorative curtain and install it around suitable sinks with storage space underneath (like pedestal sinks), and then store bathroom items there.

You can improve storage space behind your curtain even more by adding stackable shelving beneath your sink as well.
Baskets are an inexpensive household item that work well in place of stackable shelving for storing items behind your sink curtain., Buy a second shower rod and install it above head height along the wall opposite of your shower curtain. Once the rod is securely in place, you can hang light bathing supplies from it in a suitable, waterproof bag.Water will collect in your waterproof bag over time, so its best to choose one that is mesh or has drainage holes at its bottom so excess moisture drains and the bag dries quickest.
In many cases, you'll be able to insert the shower rod between bag handles to hang it. In other cases, you may need to use a durable rope/thread, like paracord, to fasten bags or supplies from the extra shower curtain rod.

Take everything out of your dresser.,
Sort your clothes into different categories and place them into separate piles.,

Fold your clothes, if necessary.,
Consider wiping the inside of each drawer clean and adding a drawer liner.,
Take everything off the top of your dresser.,
Clean the top of your dresser to give it a fresh glow.",How to Organize Your Dresser1," This will give you a sort of blank canvas to work on. It may also make it easier for you to figure out what you have and where to put it. You might even find something that does not belong in your dresser.

, This will help you figure out what you should put in which drawer. There are many different ways to sort out your clothes. It all depends on what you already own and how much space you have in your dresser. Here are some ideas to get you started:Sort your clothes based on type, such as: pants, shirts, skirts, etc.
Sort your clothes based on season, such as: summer, winter, fall, spring, warm weather, and cool weather.
Sort your clothes based on occasion, such as: casual, school, work, formal, nightgowns, pajamas, and so forth.

, Are there clothes you have not worn in months or years? Is there something that no longer fits or suits your style, tastes, or interests? How about clothes that are ripped, stained, damaged, or torn? Go through your piles, and pick out the clothes you don't wear anymore. They are only taking up valuable space and could be put towards a better use.Here are some things you can do with the clothes you no longer wear:


Donate the clothes that are still in good condition. You can take them to your local salvation army or homeless shelter. You can also give them away to friends or family members.
Consider mending the ripped or torn clothes. Sometimes, you might come across something that you still like and would wear, if not for the horrible tear in the most embarrassing of places. Instead of tossing the garment, try mending it yourself with a needle and thread. If you are afraid to mend something, consider taking it to a professional seamstress. Keep in mind, however, that some things are beyond repair and cannot be mended.
Consider dyeing stained clothes that you still like. If you can't get a stain out, you can try dyeing the garment with fabric dry. You can also try coloring the stain in with an opaque fabric marker. It is not a perfect solution, but it might make the stain less noticeable.
Recycle torn, stained, and ripped clothes that are beyond repair. These types of clothes usually won't be taken by a salvation army or homeless shelter, and they are impossible to fix. Instead of throwing these clothes away, consider cutting them down. Use the stained parts as cleaning rags. Save the undamaged parts for future sewing and DIY projects.

, This will make it easier and quicker to put them away into the dresser. Be sure to still keep them in your piles.

, If your drawer has not been organized in a while, you might notice some dust inside the drawer. This is a great change to clean out that dust. You can also insert a drawer liner at time to give the inside of your drawer a flash of color and a new look.If you want to add a drawer liner, measure the bottom of your drawer first, then cut the liner to fit. Pull the backing off by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and press it down against the drawer bottom. Carefully peel the backing off little by little as you continue to press the liner against the drawer.

, This will give you a clean canvas to work on. If you'd like, you can place everything inside a bin or basket. This will keep everything together while you organize. Start by placing the largest items in the bin or basket first. Then, put in the smaller items. The largest items will take up the most space, and the smaller items can easily fit in between them.


Consider keeping a second bin or basket handy for items that do not belong on top of your dresser. This way, once you are done organizing, you can put everything back where it belongs.

, Dust the top and wipe it down with a damp paper towel. You can also use a cleaning spray if your dresser is especially dusty.

Organize coats by material and type.",How to Store Winter Coats1," Prior to storing them, you need to first wash them. Day to day, coats are exposed to germs, oils, food stains, and other messy substances, and you wouldn’t want any of these to discolor the fabric or attract bugs while they’re in storage. Check your coats’ tags for washing instructions.Puffy coats, fleeces, and many other types of jackets and coats can be machine washed, but wool, cashmere, leather and other natural materials require dry cleaning and other special storage care.
Machine washable coats can also typically be dried in your dryer. Use a low setting and clean tennis balls to help keep their form.;
, Double check all pockets for gum, papers, money, and so on before and after you wash them. Fasten all zippers, buttons, and snaps. Buttoning everything up will help the fabric keep its form while it’s in storage., If you and your family have lots of coats with varying materials, you should organize coats into separate categories in order to store each material properly. Use the biggest bed in the house, or another broad surface, to make different piles for wool or cashmere coats, puffy down coats, leather, denim, and so on.Keep them separated by family member as well for best organization.

Keep your towels handy.,
Hang your attractive stylish colorful bath towels in your Bath areas and give an immaculate view, which attracts your guests.,
Save space with a double-bar towel rack.,
Hide your towels away by hanging them on the back of the door.,
Put up hooks.,
Drape them over the rungs of a ladder.,
Hang your towels on hangers.",How to Arrange Bathroom Towels1," Hang bar racks and wall rings where you know you’ll need a towel.


Tuck a metal towel ring behind your bathroom cabinet, directly across from your sink, and store a hand towel or washcloth there.
Install bar racks beneath your counter top that houses your sink, and hang your hand towels there.;
,


Position a bar rack directly next to your shower or above your bathtub. Arrange your body towels on that rack, so that anyone stepping out of the shower has quick access to a towel.

, If you have a relatively small bathroom or if you simply do not want to clutter the space with towels, a double-bar rack allows you to reduce the amount of room your towels take up. These racks have two bars: the first bar is positioned higher and against the wall and the second bar is lower and extends further out. The extra bar allows you to hang twice as many towels in virtually the same space.

, This method is another alternative for individuals with limited bathroom space and those seeking to minimize clutter. The towels essentially share the same space your door uses, so they are not taking up much room. Moreover, when your door is open, the towels remain hidden altogether.

, Bar racks are the most common fixture used to hang towels, but hooks are just as functional and do not require you to fold your towels before hanging them. You can either customize the number of hooks you need by hanging individual hooks on the wall or opt for a “coat rack” style fixture, which consists of multiple hooks fixed onto a single board.

, If you have the space, prop a tall wooden ladder against one wall of your bathroom to introduce a touch of rustic, artistic flair. Hang your towels along the middle and upper rungs.

, This option works especially well for a guest bathroom, since the hangers can be easily moved from the bathroom to the bedroom as needed. Hang full towel sets on the hanger, including a body towel, hand towel, and washcloth. Hangers with metal clips may help hold the towels in place.

Arrange shirts by sleeve length.
Separate your dresses by their length, placing the shortest in the front and the longest in the back.

, If you have limited wardrobe space, use the areas above and below the clothing rack to store folded items, shoes, jewelry, and lingerie.If necessary, use organizational tools such as dividers or small boxes to help you organize the vertical space. For example:


Store large purses on a shelf above the clothing rack.
Stack two metal shoe racks under the clothing rack to store twice the number of shoes.
Stack shoe boxes on a shelf above the clothing rack.

, There are many department stores and online shops that sell containers, hooks, racks, and dividers. These items can be used to attractively display your clothing and accessories while making them easy to access. For example:


Use small, clear containers to store and stack shoes. Since you can see through the containers, you won’t forget about the shoes you store.Use shelf dividers above your clothing rack. These dividers can separate folded scarves, purses, or small handbags.Purchase small adhesive hooks and attach them to your closet wall or door. Use these hooks to store scarves, belts, or jewelry.

Finished.

",How to Organize Your Closet," Take all of your clothes off their hangers and out of any bins or drawers in your closet. Fold them in piles on the floor or on your bed. This includes your shoes as well.;
, The clothes you will keep are the clothes that you wear on a regular basis and clothes that you would miss if they weren't in your closet. If you've worn a certain item in the last week, month, or even few months, you should hold on to it as long as it's seasonally appropriate.


Make a ""Keep"" pile for the clothes that you will keep and wear on a regular basis.

, You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. If it's the middle of summer, you can store your winter sweaters and scarves, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your tank tops and summer dresses.


You can also store clothes that may have sentimental value for you, such as a shirt your grandmother knitted for you, or an old t-shirt from your high school tennis team that no longer fits. Try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum, though. Clothes are meant to be worn, after all.
When you're done sorting through the clothes you will store, put them in a plastic bin. You can either store them in the back of your closet, under your bed, or in a storage unit or a different part of your home if you have the room.

, This is the hardest step, and the most important. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible. This doesn't mean you should throw out your favorite things - however, it does mean that you should take a long hard look to ask yourself which clothes you will actually ever wear again.


If you haven't worn something in over a year and it has no sentimental value, it's time to donate it.
If you have an item that is so worn, covered in moth holes, or faded that you and anyone else will never wear it again, then it's time to throw it out.
If you have a few items of clothing that are just way too small, stop waiting for the day that they will fit and donate them.
Donate all of the clothes you don't need that are in good condition, or give them to a sibling or friend.

, You should do this before you put back your clothes. Vacuum or sweep the floor, wipe the walls down with all-purpose cleaner, and sweep away any cobwebs that may have accumulated there.


If you want to make any changes, such as painting the inside a different color or adding and removing some shelves, do it now.

, Try to hang up as many of your clothes as you can. This will make it easier for you to find your clothes and to conserve space. You should not only hang up your clothes, but you should also organize them in a particular way so you can easily find them whenever you need to. Here are some ways to organize the clothes you hang up:


Organize your clothes by season. If you've stored away some of your seasonal clothes, organize your clothes by season just for half the year. If it's summer, hang up your summer clothes first, followed by your fall clothes.
Organize your clothes by type. You can separate your tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses.
Organize your work and casual clothes. Separate your work clothes from your casual clothes so you can easily get dressed for work in the morning.
Organize your clothes by how often you wear them. You can choose any method of organization, but hang up a few key items, like your favorite hoodie or the pair of jeans you wear all the time, in the most accessible place.
If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use differently colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. For example, you can hang your tops on pink hangers, or your work clothes on green hangers.
You can also think about installing another pole to hang up your additional clothes.

, Once you've hung up all of the clothes fit on your pole, you should find other parts of the closet to store the rest of your clothes. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up, or they should be clothes that don't need to be hung up, like your workout clothes. Here are a few ideas:


Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Put a few plastic bins of clothes under the hanging clothing.
If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet. It will save you time and space.
Consider installing a closet organizer to find a more efficient way to store your remaining clothes.
If you have overhead space, make the most of it. Use it to store bulky sweaters, sweats, and other items that are thick and easy to spot.

, Your shoes may take up a lot of the space in your closet, so once you've chosen which shoes you will keep, it's important to make the most of your space by storing them in the most organized and efficient manner. Here are some ways to organize the shoes in your closet:


Organize them by type. Separate your dress shoes, sandals, and boots.
Organize them by how often you wear them. Keep your favorite pair of boots, flip-flops, or sneakers in the place with the easiest access.
Invest in a shoe rack to place on the floor of your closet. This will make it much easier to find the pair of shoes you want.
Try storing your shoes in your overhead space. This is another easy way to save space.
If your closet has a door that opens instead of a sliding door, consider getting a hanging shoe rack.
If you have a front hall closet, consider putting the shoes you wear the most often there instead to save space in your personal closet.

, by the end of the month you take out all the clothes that are hung backwards and toss them if they are in not so good condition, otherwise sell or donate them!, If your closet is big enough, then it's likely that you've stored things other than clothes in it, such as big boxes filled with mementos, old photo albums, and CDs you haven't seen for ten years. To finish organizing your closet, you should go through these old boxes to see what you should keep and what you should toss. Here's how to do it:


Get rid of any papers or items you've kept for over a year that have no sentimental value.
Consolidate the boxes to save closet space. If your closet is already cramped, consider putting some of the items in a different place, such as putting your old high school yearbooks on the bottom of your bookshelf.
If you've been using cardboard boxes, trade them up for plastic bins. They will last longer and will be more visually appealing.
Label the boxes or bins so you know what's in them next time you move or organize your things again.

, Take the time to go through any additional items in your closet to make sure that you still need them and that the closet is really the best place for them. Here are some examples:


If you find any towels, sheets, or blankets, put them in your linen closet.
If you've had an old lawn chair or another piece of furniture you don't really need hanging out back there, it's time to throw it out.
If you've had to pick up an item and spend at least fifteen seconds trying to figure out what the heck it is or why you would need it, it's time to throw it out.
Make sure that all of the other items you find belong in the closet and not another part of your home. For example, if you find a box of light bulbs, a box of comic books, or a box of chocolate, ask yourself if those items wouldn't be more logically organized elsewhere.

, Turn your creativity loose and think of ways to add pleasure to the routine of getting dressed and looking through your closet every day. If you spend more time making your closet look nice, then you will be less likely to let it get messy in the future.


Paint your closet a soft pretty color.
Add mirrors for sparkle.
Hang jewelry and scarves where you can see them -- as long as they don't get in your way.
Hang up a small poster or painting that makes you smile every time you open your closet.

Insert the divider into your dresser drawer.",How to Organize Your Dresser4," This divider is simple and easy to make, and even easier to use. It is a great way to divide up the clothes in your dresser. Here's a list of what you will need:Measuring tape
Cardboard
Box cutter
Metal straight edge
Cutting mat (recommended)
Gift wrap
Scissors
Spray adhesive

, You want to measure the width, depth, and height of the drawer. Write those numbers down.

, You will be cutting these out to make a cross-shaped divider. Here are the dimensions for each rectangle based on your measurements:


The first rectangle needs to be the same height and depth as your drawer.
The second rectangle needs to be the same height and width as your drawer.

, Place the cardboard on top of a cutting matt to protect your work surface. Use a box cutter to cut the rectangles out. To make a perfectly straight line, place a metal straight edge/ruler along the line you want to cut, and glide the blade alongside the straight edge.


Do not use scissors to cut cardboard. They are not sharp enough and may create frayed edges.

, Each piece of paper needs to be the same length as the cardboard rectangle, but twice the height. For example:


If your first piece of cardboard measures 6 inches high and 14 inches long, your first piece of paper should be 12 inches high and 14 inches long.
If your second piece of cardboard measures 6 inches high and 28 inches long, your second piece of paper needs to be 12 inches high and 28 inches long.

, Spray the glue on from side to side, using light, even strokes. Try to overlap each stroke by a little to prevent any gaps.


You are working with one piece of paper at a time so that the glue does not dry out.
Consider working on top of some newspaper to protect your work surface.

, This will help it stick better to the paper.

, The long edge of the rectangle should line up with the bottom edge of the paper. The top half of the paper will be sticking out from behind the cardboard.

, Now, both sides of the cardboard should be covered with paper.

,, The notches need to go down about halfway down into the cardboard rectangle. This will allow the pieces to slot together and form a cross.

, Form a cross with the rectangles, with the two notches facing each other. Gently push the two pieces of cardboard together.


If the pieces wobble around too much, you can secure the seams with hot glue.

, Your drawer will now have four compartments. You can fill each compartment with a different type of garment, such as camis, socks, underwear, and bras.

Fold neatly.,
Label your storage containers.,
Stack coats by weight.,
Use a vacuum sealed bag for puffy coats.",How to Store Winter Coats2," It’s best to fold sweaters, knits, and lighter coats, but heavy and dressy coats should be hung rather than stored in boxes. Fold the sleeves back at the seam where they meet the coat’s body. Fold the coat in half top-to-bottom. All you should see if the front top half of the coat.If it’s absolutely impossible to hang a heavy coat, roll it up tightly to prevent creases.
Fold the sleeves back neatly and roll carefully from the top, taking care to not to roll in any creases or wrinkles. If you have to, fold the coat in half at the zipper or buttons before you roll.

, Set a box or boxes aside for each family member or coat category. Label the boxes with the appropriate name. Use masking tape for the labels so they’re not only easily identified, but reusable for next storage season.


You should pick plastic boxes over cardboard. Some bugs like to eat cardboard, and it’s not mold or mildew resistant.
Airtight storage is best, unless your coat is wool, cashmere, leather, suede, or another natural fiber., Store heavier items on the bottom. This is better for the materials, and it’ll make it easier on you on next autumn’s first cool day. You’ll more than likely want a lighter jacket rather than a coat meant for the tundra, so leave items on top that you’ll use first.Place cedar blocks or lavender sachets into the box before sealing it to keep your coats smelling fresh and to repel insects.

, Since they take up so much room, puffy jackets made of non-natural fibers are best stored in vacuum sealed bags. Sucking all the air out of the coat and the plastic storage bag will allow you to store several jackets in a space where only one would have previously fit. Once you open the bag, air will reinflate the coat.Make sure your puffy coat is stuffed with polyfill, which is polyester and thus an artificial fiber. A down-stuffed coat should be stored in a garment bag, so it can breathe.
If the coat is still flat after you take it out of the bag, throw it in the dryer for 10 minutes on a no heat setting with a clean tennis ball to give it some fluff.

"
"
Have the coat dry cleaned.,
Freeze your wool, cashmere, or leather.,
Hang in garment bags.",How to Store Winter Coats3," Your wool, suede, or leather coat should be professionally cleaned before packing it up for the season. While this can get expensive if you have a number of natural fiber coats, it’s a necessary step in preserving their quality and extending their lifespan. Perfume, food, and even imperceptible stains, for example, can discolor leather or suede and cause irreversible damage.Use leather conditioner before storage to keep your leather jacket from drying out while it’s put away. Always test out a conditioning product on an inconspicuous spot first, like under an arm.

, Believe it or not, freezing your leather overnight is actually a good way to freshen up your leather. It’ll kill bacteria and tiny insects, and get rid of odors. It’s also great for wools and cashmere for the same reasons, and you’ll be far less like to have any little bugs eating your fabrics while they’re stored away.Use an appropriately sized bag to cover up your garment.
Using plastic is okay here: there’s a difference between keeping an item in plastic for a matter of hours versus storing it sealed in plastic for months.

, Hang heavy coats and coats made of natural fibers on thick wooden hangers that are capable of supporting their weight. Cover them up in cloth garment bags for moisture protection. Cloth bags will prevent mold and mildew while letting natural materials breath.No wire hangers, Mommie Dearest: use only wood. Thick plastic hangers are a fair substitute if wood hangers aren’t available.
Try to find a closet that’s about 65 to 68 degrees, low in humidity, and away from any heat ducts. If leather gets too hot, it could crack. Heat and humidity aren’t good for other natural fibers, either."

Tuck them away into their own cubby holes.,
Set them out in a bin or large punch bowl.,
Tie them with a satin ribbon and let them sit on the countertop.,
Place rolled towels in a basket.",How to Arrange Bathroom Towels2," Position a large, open cabinet with multiple cubby holes against one wall of the bathroom. Reserve several of the cubby holes for towels. You can either organize the towels by giving each family member his or her own cubbyhole—in which case, each would store a body towel, hand towel, and washcloth—or you would store the towels away by type—one cubbyhole for body towels, one for washcloths, and so on.


In the remaining cubby holes, you can store additional bathroom necessities.

, Storing rolled hand towels and washcloths a glass bin or bowl gives your bathroom the ambiance of a relaxing spa or hotel, especially if you use white or ivory towels. Arrange them artistically, so that the tops of each towel peek out from the bowl, instead of merely stacking the towels inside.

, If these towels are for a guest bathroom, you can add a welcoming touch of elegance by tying your rolled towels together with a glossy satin ribbon. White or pastel ribbons have the most soothing effect and, therefore, are generally most suitable for the bathroom. The ribbons also catch your guests’ eyes, making it easy for them to locate the towels they need.


Pile the rolled towels up in a miniature pyramid. Place two towels on the bottom and one on top, centered between the other two.
For an additional artistic spin, you can place the towel pyramid atop a small square mirror.

, The principle is similar to placing rolled towels inside a glass bowl. Instead of a sterile spa environment, however, placing your towels in wicker baskets creates a country-style setting. Tying a bow on the basket is a simple way to further decorate the towel space without making it difficult to unroll the towels.

"
"
Fold your towels and sit them on a vintage chair, table, or bench.,
Put up glass-front towel cabinets.,
Use a small bookshelf if you have a large enough bathroom.,
Hide your towels away in a decorative or practical container.",How to Arrange Bathroom Towels3," If you have the space, a rustic, antique surface makes a quaint decoration and a convenient surface to arrange your towels on. Neatly pile your towels atop the chair, arranging them from largest to smallest.

, Select either a low cabinet that sits on the ground or a high cabinet that must be nailed to the wall. By opting for a cabinet with a glass front, you can store your spare towels while simultaneously using them as decorations. Piles of crisp white towels can make your bathroom look cleaner and more refreshing, while piles of colorful towels can introduce contrast and vibrancy into the space.


You can also arrange the towels you presently need on top of the cabinet.

, A bookshelf is functional and introduces a bit of visual interest into the room, since you would not typically expect to see one in a bathroom. Plus, a bookshelf pays homage to the idea of having “reading material” in the bathroom; though, whether you choose to include such material is entirely up to you. Pile your largest towels on the bottom shelves and your hand towels and washcloths on the mid-range shelves for easy access.

, If you prefer to keep your towels out of sight, you can arrange them inside a more decorative surface, like a large, lidded wicker basket. You can also introduce a more functional piece into the room, like a window bench or vanity seat with built-in storage.

Hang any tops or blouses.,
Hang up lightweight dresses.,
Fold and stack heavy sweaters.,
Hang or fold jeans.,
Hang up easily wrinkled bottoms.,
Use dividers and hooks to store accessories.,
Organize your shoes.,
Store small clothing in drawers.",How to Organize Your Wardrobe2," If you fold these items, you can wrinkle or crease the clothing. Additionally, if it’s out of sight, you may forget you own it and you won’t wear it as often. Instead, hang your shirts and blouses in your closet on sturdy plastic or felt hangers.Pajama tops, old tee shirts, and other “around the house” tops can be folded and stored near lingerie.

, Any lightweight and sturdy dresses you own can be hung up and organized by color, length, or style. This will keep your dresses wrinkle-free and easy to find. However, heavy dresses should be neatly folded and stored to avoid stretching out the shoulders.For example:


Maxi dresses usually have thin, easily stretched straps. These dresses should be folded.
Long dresses made of cotton-spandex blends can easily lose their shape if they’re hung up.

, If you hang heavy sweaters up in your closet, the weight of the sweater will stretch out the shoulders. Instead, neatly fold your sweaters and store them in your wardrobe.For example:


Stack the sweaters on the shelf above your clothing rack for easy access.
Keep folded sweaters in plastic storage bins so that you can easily find them.
Fill spare drawer space with folded sweaters. Store the stack of sweaters on its side so that each sweater is visible when you open the drawer.

, Jeans are made of sturdy material that doesn’t easily wrinkle. If you have a lot of wardrobe space, consider hanging the jeans up so that you can easily see each pair. Alternatively, store folded jeans in a drawer or clear bin to save wardrobe space.If you store folded jeans in a drawer, lay the stack of jeans on its side so you can easily see each pair.
Hang jeans by folding them in half and draping them over the flat part of a hanger.
Clip hangers can also be used to hang jeans by the waistband.

, Nice trousers, work pants, flowing skirts, and pressed shirts should be hung up to avoid wrinkling them. To do so, use a clip hanger attached to the thick part of the waist band.


If you don’t have room in your wardrobe to hang these items, consider installing or hanging another closet bar further down the wardrobe.
Any casual shorts or pants can be folded and stored with your jeans.

, If your wardrobe has a lot of empty wall space, consider purchasing small adhesive wall hooks. Use these hooks to attractively store jewelry, scarves, hats, purses, and belts. If you don’t have wall space, store these accessories in drawers. Use drawer dividers to separate each item.Avoid storing multiple necklaces on the same hook. If you do, they may become tangled.
Roll up scarves before placing them in a section of a divider.

, Shoes should be stored in clear containers, in shoe boxes, or on shoe racks. Resist the urge to store all of your shoes in one box or bucket. If you do, the shoes will become misshapen and scuffed.If you store your shoes in shoe boxes, tape a picture of the shoe on the front for quick identification.
Metal shoe racks can be placed on the floor of your wardrobe.
Cloth shoe racks can be hung on your wardrobe door or on the clothing rack.

, Any lingerie, socks, or bras can be stored in a drawer. Items can be separated in the same drawer using dividers.Bras can be stacked inside one another and laid in a line for easy storage, while underwear and socks can be rolled up.


Make sure to circulate your bras so that you’re not wearing the same two or three all the time.

Lay out your clothing.,
Throw away damaged clothing.,
Choose clothing to donate.,
Store clothing.",How to Organize Your Wardrobe3," Pull all of your clothes from your wardrobe and lay them out on your bed. Organize the clothing by type and place them into piles. This will allow you to easily sort through your clothing while you decide what to keep and what to throw away.


Wash and dry any dirty clothing. If half of your wardrobe is dirty, you won’t be able to properly sort through your wardrobe.

, If a piece of clothing has large stains or irreparable tears, throw it away. Be realistic about what you can and can’t fix. Small tears in seams can be easily repaired, but larger holes are harder to mend. If the job is too advanced for your sewing skills, consider throwing the clothing away.


Don’t donate torn or stained clothing. The volunteers who receive the donation will have to trash them anyway.
If expensive clothing is damaged, see a tailor. However, less expensive damaged clothing may not be worth the cost of the repairs., Sort through your undamaged clothing to find items to donate. Be harsh with yourself and remember that you’re trying to reduce the amount of clothing that you wear. Place donated clothing in large clean plastic bags and take them to your local clothing donation center. While sorting, ask yourself:


”If I was shopping right now, would I buy this?””Have I worn this in the past two years?”
”Is this piece of clothing too small or two big?”
”Do I feel good when I wear this?”

, Any seasonal or sentimental items can be stored away until they’re needed. This will help clear up wardrobe space for other items or organizational tools. Bins of packed clothing can be stored under your bed, in a storage closet, or above your wardrobe.


Delicate items such as silk or cashmere should be wrapped in tissue paper and stored in canvas storage bags.
Regular clothing can be folded and stacked in large plastic bins.
Only store clean clothes."

Take all of your clothes out.,
Sort your clothes into two piles.,
Sort the clean clothes from the dirty ones in your ""keep"" pile.,
Put the dirty clothes into the laundry basket.,
Further divide up your ""get rid of"" pile.,
Throw away the clothes that are faded, stained, or torn.,
Donate the rest of the ""get rid of pile."",
Review your ""keep"" pile.",How to Organize Your Clothes1," The first step to organizing your clothing is sorting your clothes. You can do this by taking everything out of your closet, wardrobe, or dresser and piling it on the floor or bed. If you keep your clothes in multiple places, consider tackling each place one at a time. For example:


If you keep your clothes in a closet and a dresser, sort and organize your closet first. Then, once you have finished, repeat the whole process for your dresser.
Consider getting a box or basket for any items that you find that do not belong in your closet, wardrobe, or dresser.;
, Create two different piles: a ""keep"" pile and a ""get rid of"" pile. Put the clothes you do wear into the ""keep"" pile, and the clothes you don't wear anymore into the ""get rid of"" pile. Try to spend no more than a few seconds when deciding which pile you should place something into.


If you need more than a few seconds to decide on whether or not you will wear something again, consider creating a third pile. This pile will be the ""maybe"" pile, and it will hold the items you need to give more thought to.
You can also use baskets or boxes to hold your clothes as you sort through them instead of just piling them on the floor or bed.

, Once you have decided what clothes you will be keeping and getting rid of, it is time for you to further divide up the piles. Go to your ""keep"" pile and sort out the clothes that need to be laundered from the clean clothes that can be hung up or folded up and put away.

, Once you have finished sorting the clean clothes from the dirty clothes in your ""keep"" pile, take the dirty clothes and put them into a laundry basket. This helps prevent things from piling up and taking up space.


To save time, put your dirty clothes into the washing machine now. This way, they can wash while you continue sorting and organizing.

, You may have placed clothes into the ""get rid of"" pile either because you no longer like them, they don't fit you any more, or they are too faded, stained, or torn to be worn. Some of these clothes will need to be thrown away, while others can be donated. Go to your ""get rid of"" pile and separate the clothes that are still in good condition from the clothes that are ripped or stained.


Clothing that will be donated should be in decent condition. There should be no rips, tears, stains, or fading.

, The clothes that are too damaged to keep or donate will need to be thrown away. You can either throw them away now, or put them into a trash bag to throw away later, once you have finished sorting and organizing your closet.


Consider cutting up the torn clothes and saving the scraps for other purposes. Cut up T-shirts can make great cleaning rags, while scraps from plaid shirts can make great patches.
Consider repurposing or up-cycling the clothes into new items. For example, a pair of jeans that are shredded and torn at the knees can become a pair of trendy shorts or a skirt.

, The clothes that are still in good condition but that no longer suit you can be put into a box or bag and taken to your nearest donation center. You can do this now, or wait until you are done organizing your clothes.


You can also give away your clothes to a friend or younger sibling.
Consider selling your clothes online or at a garage sale.

, After you have finished sorting your clothes, you may decide that your ""keep"" pile is still looking big. Now is the time to go through it again. If you have a ""maybe"" pile, you can sort through it at this time as well. Some of the clothes may still fit you, but they may no longer fit your lifestyle. Others may no longer look good on you.Go through your piles and ask yourself once again whether or not you would wear the clothes again. Ask yourself these questions:


Does that color look good on me? Do I feel comfortable wearing that color? Some colors may look better on you than other colors. Choose ones that flatter your skin tone and hair color. More importantly, keep colors that you feel comfortable wearing.
Does this cut look good on me? The jacket you bought may have looked really cute on the mannequin in the store, but it may not flatter you at all. Keep clothes that flatter your figure.
How often do I wear this? Ever since you started your new job at the office, your wardrobe has gained several black slacks and button-up shirts. The colorful blouses and dresses you used to wear before you started your new job are now taking up space, unused. Consider giving them to someone who may appreciate them and wear them often.

Label difficult to remove areas.,
Choose areas that are discreet.,
Check the condition of labels regularly.",How to Safely Label Your Children's Items1," Labels on tags, for example, can be easily cut from clothing. This will make it easier for potential thieves to remove the labels that indicate the clothing is yours. A label on the fabric of the clothing, however, will be difficult to remove without doing damage.


Consider labeling the inside collar or bottom hem of shirts. For pants, you might label the inner waistband or bottom cuff.
When labeling with a writing utensil, like a permanent marker, test a less visible portion of the fabric first. This way you can check that the ink doesn't bleed through the fabric.;
, Labeling visible areas of your children's clothing could put them at risk to child predators. Children often regard adults who know their name as safe. Hide labels on the underside of fabric to prevent this.


When your children are under constant supervision, like when playing a sport or on a field trip, obvious labels are OK.
In some cases, like when on school trips, obvious labels can help supervising adults keep tabs on your kids.
As a general rule of thumb, if your child will at any point be unsupervised, even if it's only when walking home, all clothing labels should be hidden from view., Over time, even labels that were once safe can become less so. Peeling edges, loose threads, or weakened adhesive can cause your label to be pulled off your children's items. In these cases, your label can become a choking hazard.


You may want to create a safety schedule on your calendar or with your cell phone to help you remember to check the safety condition of labels.
A label that is properly attached to an item should hold up for some time. A once-a-month safety check should be sufficient.
You may want to check the label condition of heavily used or frequently washed items more frequently. The labels on these will be more likely to degrade quickly."

Create sections in your closet or wardrobe based on type of clothing.,
Sort your clothes by color.,
Consider adding shelves into your closet or wardrobe.,
Add a plastic drawer unit.,
Use boxes or baskets to store smaller items.,
Store your shoes in your closet.,
Consider moving your dresser into your closet.",How to Organize Your Clothes2," Sorting your clothes by type might help you find what you are looking for faster. It will also make your closet or wardrobe look neater and more organized. You can do this by dividing up your closet or wardrobe into different sections, and hanging your clothes in those sections. Examples of sections include: shirts, skirts, pants, dresses, and coats.


If you have created a section for shirts, consider dividing that section further into short-sleeved shirts and long-sleeved shirts.
For a more organized look, you can make little tags out of paper and hanging them between the different sections. You can then label the tags to remind you what section is what.

, You can create a more coordinated look in your closet or wardrobe by hanging all of the different colors together. This means that you hang all of the reds together and all of the blues together.


Try organizing your clothes first by type, and then by color. For example, you can hang all of the blue shirts together, and then all of the red shirts together.

, Closets and wardrobes don't have to be just for hanging clothes; you can install shelves to store folded items such as pants and shirts, and bulky items such as shoes and accessories. The shelves can be installed directly into your closet, or they can be a simple bookshelf wedged in a corner or beneath the shorter hanging items (such as shirts).If you do not have room in your closet or wardrobe for a shelve, consider adding in a hanging shelf instead. Hanging shelves are shelves made from fabric, canvas, or plastic cloth. They can be folded up when not in use, or they can be hung from the rod on which the rest of your clothes hand. They can be used to store hats, scarves, shoes, and other accessories., Just because you don't have space for a dresser does not mean that you can't store items in drawers. Buy a plastic storage unit with drawers and keep clothing that can be folded inside. If the unit is tall, keep it in the corner of your closet or wardrobe. If the unit is short, store it beneath the shorter hanging clothes, such as shirts.


Try getting a drawer unit with clear or frosted drawers that will let you see what you have inside. You might be more likely to wear something you can see as opposed to something you can't see.Try getting a drawer unit with wheels. This will make it easier to move around.

, If you don't have a dresser, you can keep small items, such as undergarments and socks, in colorful boxes or baskets. Keep these boxes and baskets on shelves.


Buy boxes or baskets that are all one color to create a more unified look.
If you are storing your boxes or baskets on a shelf, consider using a contrasting color. For example, if your shelf is white, use boxes or baskets that are black or a bright color, such as neon green or pink.

, Keeping your shoes in one place can help you get ready faster in the mornings. It will also make your closet look neater. There are many different options for storing shoes:


Plastic or cardboard shoe boxes can store special-occasion or out-of-season shoes when you are not wearing them. Store these boxes on a higher shelf.
A handing shelf made from canvas, fabric, or plastic cloth can be used to store larger shoes such as boots.
An over-the-door shoe caddy can be hung over the door of a wardrobe or on a hook in your closet. It works best for slender shoes, such as flats and loafers.
Shelves and cubbies can be used to store all sorts of shoes, from flats to heels to boots. Consider organizing your shoes based on type: all of the flats go on one side of the unit, and all of the heels go on the other side.
A wooden thread spool rack can also be used to store shoes. Hang each shoe by the heel over the pegs. This works best for flats, sneakers, and loafers., If your closet is large enough, and if you own a dresser, you can save space by moving the dresser into the closet. If the dresser is low enough, you might be able to hang shorter items, such as shirts, above the dresser. This keeps all your clothes in one place, which may help you get ready faster in the morning.

Dedicate one drawer to each type of clothing.,
Consider sorting your clothes by occasion.,
Fold and stack your clothes by color.,
Consider storing your clothes vertically.,
Try using drawer dividers.,
Roll up your socks and fold your undergarments.,
Rotate the clothes in your drawers based on season.,
Save space by moving your dresser into your closet.",How to Organize Your Clothes3," When putting your clothes away into your dresser, consider using one drawer for each type of clothing. This means placing all of your shirts into the top drawer, your pants and skirts in the next drawer, and your less-worn/out-of-season clothes in the bottom-most one.


If your dresser has some small drawers, consider using those for small items, such as socks and undergarments.

, Keeping clothes separated by occasion can not only help you get ready faster in the morning, but it can help your dresser look more organized. If you have to wear a uniform to work or school, keep your uniform pieces in one drawer, and your casual clothes in another. Be sure to keep the shirts separate from the pants and skirts.


You can also keep both your casual shirts and work shirts in one drawer: keep the casual shirts on one side of the drawer, and the work shirts on the other. Do the same thing for the pants and skirts.

, When folding your clothes and putting them away, consider sorting them by color. Keep all of your black shirts in one stack and all of your white shirts in another. If you have a lot of colors and not a lot of space, you can keep all of the light-colored shirts in one stack, and all of the dark-colored shirts in another.

, If you have a lot of shirts, you can save space by folding them, and storing them vertically in your dresser instead of stacking them on top of each other.You will end up with something that looks like the inside of a file cabinet.

, Placing dividers into your dresser drawers can be a great way to organize small articles of clothing. If your dresser has only large drawers, consider reserving one for your undergarments and socks; use a divider in the drawer to prevent the undergarments and socks from mixing.


You can make your own drawer dividers by covering cardboard boxes with colorful scrapbooking paper or wrapping paper.
You can also insert several small boxes into the drawer, and using those to keep your items sorted. Make sure that the drawers are short enough to fit inside so that you can close the drawer.

, Socks and underwear, though small, can create a lot of bulk and take up more space than they should. You can save space by rolling up your socks and folding your undergarments—this will also help your drawers appear neater and more organized.

, You are more likely to wear short-sleeves shirts in the summer and sweaters in the winter. Consider moving clothes to different drawers in your dresser depending on what season it is. During the summer, keep lighter clothes, such as skirts, shorts, and tank-tops in the upper drawers, and the warmer clothes, such as long-sleeved shirts and sweaters in the bottom drawer. During the winter, move the shorts and tank-tops to the bottom drawer, and the warm sweaters and long-sleeved shirts to the upper drawer. Try to keep the out-of-season clothes in one drawer to save space.


You can save space in your dresser and make room for more clothes by storing your out-of-season clothes in a drawer beneath your bed. If you have a closet, you can store the out-of-season clothes on a top shelf.

, If you have enough room in your closet, you can keep all of your clothes by moving your dresser into your closet. If your dresser is short, then you hang still hang small items, such as shirts, above it. Keeping all of your clothes in one place will save you time in the morning as you get ready for work or school.

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your label maker.,
Input the text for your label and print it.,
Apply the label to your children's items.",How to Safely Label Your Children's Items2," This is one of the easiest ways of labeling hard surfaced objects. Label makers and label tape can be found at most general retailers and office supply stores. In all, you'll need:


Batteries (for label maker; optional)
Label maker
Label tape
Scissors (optional), Your label maker may be a plug-in model, but if not you'll need to insert batteries into it first. After that, release the spool for the label tape, insert the tape, and fasten the spool back in place.Depending on your label maker, there may be many different spool configurations. Generally, this involves releasing a tab or removing the spool from a slot.
If you have bought your label maker brand new, it may already come equipped with label tape, in which case you won't need to insert your own.

, The way you input your label text into the label maker will also depend on your model of label maker. In most cases, this involves using a small keypad on the maker to input and confirm your label message.


Oftentimes, after you input and confirm your label message, the label will print directly. In some cases, however, you might need to select a ""Print"" option.
Some label makers might also ask you to select a label size from a list of options. Choose the size that best suits the item you are labeling., Many label makers come equipped with sharp teeth where the label emerges. This makes it easy to tear your labels free. If your label maker lacks this feature, you may need to cut the label free with scissors. After that:


Take your label and hold it close to the item you are labeling. Peel the backing off the label to expose the adhesive beneath.
Smooth the label onto the item's surface to prevent labels from pulling free and becoming a choking hazard. Use your nails or a hard edge to chase bubbles to the label's edges and remove them.
If a label does not stick cleanly to the surface you are trying to put it on, you may need to make a new label and try again.

Collect your label making materials.,
Plan potential label designs on your card stock.,
Create your card stock labels.,
Tape your labels in place.",How to Safely Label Your Children's Items3," Handmade card stock labels are an inexpensive way of labeling children's items that have hard surfaces. Additionally, you could turn this into a fun craft where your kids help decorate the labels. In all, you'll need:


Card stock
Markers (non-toxic, many colors)
Pencil (optional)
Scissors
Tape (durable, non-toxic)

, If you're labeling containers, you might want to use broad categories for your label. Labels like ""Balls,"" ""Puzzles,"" and ""Animals"" on containers can help cut down clutter. For personal or small sized items, you may want to use a first name or initials to signify whose it is.


If your children are especially young, you can draw simple designs with a pencil on your card stock to add flair to your labels. These can be colored in later.
Children who are a little older might want to outline label decorations with a stencil and then color, or draw their own freehand designs., Cut your card stock into small, label sized pieces. For larger items and containers, you may want a larger label so it is more visible. Write out your label message in marker in clear, large print so it is easy to read.


After your message is written, you or your kids can use markers to color in any designs you've added to the label., Use your tape to fasten all edges of your label to the hard surfaced object you are labeling. Make sure the tape is smooth and the label firmly attached.Tape with bubbling beneath its surface or loose edges will pull free more easily from the surface it's attached to and could become a choking hazard.
If the label does not feel secure, don't hesitate to pull it free and use new tape or a new label.

Figure out what items you can get rid of.,
Separate seasonal items.,
Organize your clothes by type.,
Organize your clothes by function.,
Separate items by how they're best stored.,
Divide the drawers into sections.,
Try using bins.,
Try using dividers.,
Try using bookends.,
Try other items in a pinch.,
Try rolling items.,
Use a shirt board.,
File items, don't stack them.,
Nest bras to maintain them.,
Consider an alternative for sock storage.",How to Organize a Dresser Drawer," Start your dresser organization project by taking everything out. Go through all the items and figure out what you can get rid of. Look for items that don’t fit, items that have gone out of style, items with stains or other signs of wear, and items that you just don’t wear very often.Items in better condition can be donated but items in poor condition can simply be thrown away.


You might be keeping some items for sentimental purposes, even long after they become unwearable. Try to find another use for items like this, like making a tee-shirt rug or a quilt, so that they aren’t taking up space in your drawers.
If it’s a casual or daily item and you haven’t worn it in a year, it’s time for it to go. Formal items can go unworn a bit longer.;
, Now that you’ve limited yourself to the items you want to keep, separate the items by what season they’re appropriate for. You can switch your dresser contents for warm weather and cold weather, storing the off-season items in a plastic bin in a closet or basement until they’re needed.


You can also store off season items in a box under your bed.
At the very least, you'll want to put heavy winter items in the lowest drawers. This is better for your dresser.

, Organize all of your clothes by their function. Generally you will have delicates, pajamas, casual shirts, dress shirts, casual pants, dress pants, heavy sweaters and light sweaters. Pants should really be stored separately, as should sweaters, so try to set aside a drawer just for these items.


Generally, these items can be split very nicely between four drawers. Delicates and pajamas in one drawer, shirts in another, pants in a third, and sweaters and other items in the fourth.
Sweaters should be kept separately to help protect them from moths but also to keep them from pilling all over other clothing items. Pants must generally be folded differently from shirts and keeping them separate will prevent wrinkles.

, Within each of the categories that you've now set aside, you will now want to organize items by how they should sit within their section. There are different schools of thought, and some people prefer to organize by function while some would rather organize by color. It's up to you.


For functional separation, look for the common pairs. Lightweight items vs heavy items, casual items vs formal items, flirty items vs professional items, etc. This can help you find the clothes you want more quickly, because you will know exactly where to look. It also keeps items with similar materials together.
However, separating by color will make your drawers look much nicer and help you stay motivated to keep them organized.

, With all of your clothes divided up, you'll have to decide what items go in what drawers. Generally, you want to put items you use most frequently towards the top. You also want to try to place lighter items at the top, to create the least amount of strain on your dresser.Some clothing types might need special storage considerations too. For example, placing a cedar plank or mothballs in a drawer with sweaters is important for combating moths.Some items might also need to be stored hanging up or in a bag, instead of in a drawer. It's a good idea to identify these items and set them aside. Examples of these items would be any item made of silk, as they will wrinkle very easily when folded, or very expensive or irreplaceable sweaters, which should be stored in bags to protect them from moths.

, One drawer is usually too big for all of the different types of items it contains. Visually divide the drawer into sections so that you can keep your clothes sorted by how you use them. For long drawers, dividing into three is a good place to start. Divide smaller drawers into two sections.The sections can then be further divided as needed. For example, you might have your top long drawer divided into three. Bras can be nested in the first section, the second section can be divided into two parts, one for socks and the other for pajamas. The third section can be divided into three parts, for the different types of underwear you have.

, You can use open bins, like the nice wicker or fabric bins that you see at home stores, to enforce the sections that you've broken your drawers in to. Find bins in different sizes and them put them in your drawers. Your clothes can then be put into the bins.


This will help keep everything separate but it also means you can take out and rearrange the drawers without having to take out and refold all your clothes.

, If you want to preserve space and money, you can simply put dividers into the drawer. You can get commercial dividers, which are like extending curtain rods but flat and can be set to the size of any drawer. These are easily purchased wherever other laundry items like baskets and ironing boards are sold. You can also make dividers out of cardboard or foam board.


Another great option is to save the divider that comes with a box of wine. This is great for storing sock, underwear, and other small items.

, Another quick cheat is to use basic metal bookends. These can be purchased (often for less than $5 a pair) at any store that sells office supplies. Stand them up in your drawers and you'll have an easy way to divide the space.


The downside to these is that they don't create a solid line, which can make it hard to keep small items separate. However, they're perfect for things like rolled shirts, jeans, and sweaters.

, There are also lots of other items you can use to divide and organize your drawers. You can use a simple dish rack, a pill organizer for small items like jewelry, pudding cups or an ice cube tray for jewelry or socks and tights, etc. Just look for any containers which are designed to keep items contained and separate. If it works outside a dresser, it will probably work inside one too.

, By now, you’ve probably heard the advice that you should roll your clothes when you pack a suitcase. Your drawers at home aren’t any different. Rolling takes up less space and it also prevents wrinkles and creases when done correctly. Make your rolls slowly and get them nice and tight in order to prevent wrinkles.


The exception here is if you have clothes with natural creases in them. Creased pants, for example, should probably be folded in the traditional way, although they are really best kept in a closet.

, If you do fold your clothes, use a shirt board when you fold them. This is a board like a clipboard or even a piece of cardboard which you fold your shirt or pants around. Place the board at the top center of a shirt, just at the collar. Pull the left sleeve over toward the right, until it creases at the side of the board, and then repeat for the right. Tuck the sleeves as needed and then fold up the bottom hem. Pants are simply folded in half and then wrapped around the board.


You can remove the board (as is more traditional), but if you used cheap cardboard, you can leave the board in the shirt or pants. This makes it faster to sort through the items or even store them vertically, like the bagged dress shirts at a department store.
To make your own shirt board, cut a piece of thick cardboard to about 15” by 18”. It should be just about the same size that a shirt is once folded into a “store style” rectangle.

, When you put items into your drawers, don’t stack them. This is the traditional way to place items in a drawer, but it makes it very easy to wrinkle them and makes it hard to find the item that you want. Instead of stacking, “file” your items.Place clothes in upright rolls, side rolls, or folded with a shirt board and kept like actual files.


You can even use a file organizer in your drawers to help keep items upright.

, If you have bras to store in your dresser, be sure to nest them. This means placing the curve of the cup into the curve of the cup of the next bra. This will not only save space and make your drawer more organized, it will also preserve the integrity of the bra, helping it stay strong and supportive for longer.


You can store them in one big line or you can place the left cup inside of the right cup to conserve space, although this is less good for the center of the bra and can lead to warping.

, Sock drawers are one of those drawers that quickly turn into a mess. You can ball socks in order to keep them together and make your drawer more organized, but this is bad for the elastic.Folded socks will quickly come apart as you look for the pair you want and pull items from a drawer. A better solution for socks is to not store them in your dresser. Instead, use a hanging shoe organizer with pockets. This can go in your closet, in your bathroom, or on the back of your bedroom door. Each pair of socks gets a pocket and you no longer have to worry about folding or looking for just the right pair.


Another option is to use pudding cups or drink cups in your drawer and put the socks in those. However, this is not very space efficient. It will make your drawer more organized but it will also take up a lot of space. Choose what's best for you.

If you don't want to have a garage sale, you can eliminate that box. You can also add a box of items you'll put away, if you're keeping them for sentimental reasons., That is, you are likely trying to organize your shoes because you are out of space. Therefore, the best option is to get rid of what you're not using anymore. Be ruthless with yourself., For instance, when was the last time you wore that pair of shoes? Are you keeping it for sentimental reasons?

Assemble your supplies.,
Prepare to iron.,
Iron-on the label.,
Sew a name or identifying mark into the fabric, alternatively.",How to Safely Label Your Children's Items4," Iron-on labels are relatively inexpensive and can significantly cut down on the time it takes you to label fabric. These kinds of labels can be ordered online or can sometimes be bought at craft or hobby shops. For this project, you'll need:


A cloth or light towel
Iron (for clothes)
Iron-on label
Ironing board, First wash the fabric you'll be labeling. Once it is clean and dry, set up your ironing board and select the ""Cotton"" setting on your iron (or 400°F (204°C)). Then lightly iron the fabric where you plan on applying the iron-on label until it is smooth.After ironing out the fabric, it's a good idea to lay out the patch to check that its placement is satisfactory.
Many kinds of iron-on label are intended only for cotton fabric. If the fabric you are trying to label is not cotton, you may need a special iron-on label., Lay the patch on the fabric so the design faces up and is positioned where you want. Put a cloth or light towel on top of the label, then press the iron firmly on the label, using slow, circular motions for approximately 30 seconds at a time. Then:


Turn the fabric inside out and repeat this process to the back of the patch. Once complete, allow the label and cloth to cool for about a minute.
If, after ironing both sides, the edges of the label still lift from the fabric, reapply your iron to the fabric for another 30 seconds in the fashion described.Always follow the directions that came with your iron-on label for best results. Some labels may require more or less time ironing, or more or less heat.

, If iron-on patches sound like more work than they're worth, you can always take a needle and thread and sew a simple label of your own into the fabric.


If you're inexperienced at sewing, you can make a simple ""label"" by sewing an identifying mark in the fabric instead. Passing your needle and thread through the fabric a few times and tying off the end should be sufficient.
Use scissors to cut any loose threads. With especially young children, thread pulled free from labels could be swallowed and lead to choking.

"
Choose the basic organizing systems depending on what kind of storage you will be primarily using, closet space or drawers.,
Decide how to best use the closet space.,
Organize your drawers.,
Consider alternative storage solutions for items that are either much bulkier or smaller than the rest.,
Organize your baby’s clothes by season.,
Group the clothes by activity or event.,
Sort the clothes by type.,
Decide what to do with the clothing once the baby outgrows it.,
Prepare the clothing you plan to store for the next baby.,
Give special treatment to special outfits.",How to Organize Baby Clothes," Most people use a combination of the two. That way space use is maximized. Remember that you can create whatever organization works best for you.


Be creative, and consider coming up with your own solutions. You don’t need expensive organizers and can often use items you already have at home to make the solutions yourself.Other than only using the closet and furniture drawers, think about other spaces that can be useful, such as wicker baskets, doors, boxes, and similar.
Even if you don’t have a closet just for the baby’s clothing, or if you live in a small space, there are numerous solutions available. Many of them are affordable and fun to make!;
, Rather than just placing everything on hangers, do consider what would be the best way to use all of the vertical space.


Arrange clothing by type (dresses, jumpers, jackets, pants, etc.) and select what would be best hung. Anything that doesn’t fold easily, or that wrinkles easily, should be placed on hangers.
You should definitely use hangers for delicate items, or for special events outfits.
Place dividers between the sorted outfits that you plan on hanging. You can make the dividers yourself and put your own artistic flair into them! Take as much advantage of the vertical space as possible. One of the best ways to maximize this is to install simple shelves, or to hang canvas shelves off the closet rod.
You can also stack plastic bins, boxes or drawers on the floor of the closet.

, Drawers are excellent for keeping diapers, wipes, lotions, bags, shoes, swaddle blankets, Boppy pillow covers, bedding, and such.


Modular systems such as boxes and collapsible sacks can be used to keep the drawers neat. In them you can store onesies, socks, bibs, beanies, or any other smallish baby items that otherwise could easily get misplaced.
You can use containers that hold an adult’s accessories, although you can make your own dividers very easily as well.,


Sweaters, hooded sweatshirts and snowsuits are best kept in wicker baskets or in deepest drawers.
Items you need when heading outdoor, such as jackets, hats, shoes, burp cloths, hair accessories and bibs need to be easy to grab. Consider hanging over-the-door hooks. Alternatively, you can use a simple hanging chain or rope to clip some of these small items, especially pacifiers, teethers, and small toys.

, Even though it might seem more practical to sort the clothes by type, organizing them by season is a more sensible long-term approach. Keep the outfits for the season handy; the rest can be stored away for now.


For summer, majority of the clothes will consist of either short dresses or tee-shirts and shorts. You will need to keep in mind items such as bathing suits, sandals and similar.
For fall, more of the clothes will start getting warmer such as long sleeve shirts, pants and tights.
When spring starts, layered clothing as well as rain ponchos, or jackets, will be necessary.

, After you’ve arranged the clothes by season, you should group them by what kind of activities they are for. You can put different clothes in different drawers, or drawer sections, based on the activity or event that your baby would wear them for.


Some common events are: indoor play time, bedtime, outdoor clothing, party, and special occasion outfits.
Remember to keep the special or delicate outfits on hangers. This way you will know exactly where each type of clothing is.

, This is an additional and the most common method by which you can organize your baby’s clothing.


For example: all the bottoms go in one drawer; the shirts go in another.
You can expand on this by separating shorts and pants, tee-shirts and shirts, footed pajamas and daytime play outfits.

, Do you want to donate the clothing or keep it for the next child? Whatever you decide, you need to make sure the outgrown items are not cluttering your drawers.


Once a season go through all the clothing and take out the items that have been outgrown.
Keep only those pieces that are still in good usable condition and discard anything that is heavily stained, torn, or used.
If you want to donate the clothing, wash it and place it in large clean bags and donate it to either friends or look for local organizations that collect baby clothing.

, It is also possible that you were given hand-me-downs from cousins or friends that you want to store for later on. It’s very important to get those items ready for when you will need them.


Remove any stains and wash the clothing in mild detergent.Use breathable boxes for storing, like canvas, or plastic, but stay away from using cardboard as moths can easily get in and they also can easily get damaged by water.Divide the clothing according to size and to season and label each box. For example: 12-18 months, Summer and Fall.Aside from writing labels for boxes, you can also tape pictures of garments that are stored in the box.

, You don’t want to just wash and fold them with the rest of the daily clothing.


Clean the special outfits according to washing instructions. If this is a christening outfit for example, and you want to keep as a memory, you might need to dry clean it.
Wrap it in acid-free tissue paper to prevent yellowing.
Once cleaned and wrapped, they can be stored in boxes, separately or not. Just make sure those items don’t get squished!

Purchase enough shoe boxes in the same style.,
Place each pair in a box.,
Print off pictures.,
Organize according to style.,
Sort by color.",How to Organize Shoes2," Pick one style of shoe box to use for all your shoes so that they will stack properly. You can choose cardboard or plastic, depending on your preference. You can find shoe boxes at craft stores, big box stores, and storage container stores.

, Only store one pair per box, so the shoes aren't crammed in the box. One point of having them in boxes is to protect them, and only putting one pair in each box will help you do so., If your shoe boxes aren't see-through, take a picture of each pair. Print off the pictures, and tag each box with the appropriate picture. That way, you don't need to dig through the boxes to find the right pair of shoe., That is, stack all of your fancy shoes in one area, your weekend shoes in the next stack, and your sneakers in the next one. Try putting in large shelves to hold all the boxes, which will make it easier to sort., Once you've sorted by style, sort your boxes by color, so that all of your fancy black shoes are together, and so on.

Find a wooden pallet.,
Pick a clean pallet.,
Pick one that will hold your shoes.,
Look for how the pallet was treated.,
Sand the pallet.,
Apply a stain.,
Apply a finish.,
Prop the shoe rack up on a wall.,
Divide your shoes by style.",How to Organize Shoes3," The best place to find wooden pallets for free is at independent nurseries and hardware stores, since they are less likely to have someone who comes and picks up their pallets. Therefore, they'll usually give them to you for free.You can also check out local construction sites. Always ask before removing a pallet., If it has spills on it, they could be hazardous. Therefore, choose one that looks relatively clean. Plus, clean ones will make a better finished product., The slates should be far enough apart that your shoes can slip through the slats but close enough together that it holds the shoes up.Be sure to wear gloves when picking up your pallet. It will have splinters.

, Some pallets are stamped with codes that describe how they were treated before use. One without codes is generally safe to use. However, if it has the codes EUR or MB or if the wood is colored, don't use it. If it has the codes DB, HT, or EPAL, it's generally acceptable to use., Most pallets are left untreated, which can mean splinters and uneven wood. Take the time to sand the wood.Use an 80 grit sandpaper. You can use a power sander to help get the job done. If desired, you can move up to finer sandpaper for a smoother finish.Some people recommend planning the surface if you prefer a new-wood look., You can use a standard brush-on stain, but if you want something quick, try spraying on a stain instead of brushing it on.When brushing on stain, apply it in long, even strokes with a wide brush. Use an ample amount, and then wipe away any excess once the stain has absorbed.When spraying on a stain, apply it in even coats. Read the directions to find out how far away you should hold the can from the project when spraying. Use light coats, and wait for each coat to at least partially dry before applying the next one., The finish will protect the wood. If you want the natural look of the wood to shine through, try a beeswax finish.Apply the finish in thin coats, waiting between coats. Once a coat is applied, run the brush over the whole length at a 45 degree angle to smooth it out.Let the pallet dry.

, You can put in your closet or your room. The beams should run parallel to the floor., Place all the fancier shoes on one level. Insert them between the slats. The top slat on each level should provide enough support to hold them up with the ends sticking out. Place the sneakers on the next level, the casual shoes on one level, and so on."

Evaluate clothing you feel neutral about.",How to Improve Your Wardrobe1," Separate the clothes you love from the clothes you hate and the clothes you feel neutral about.;
, Some pieces may have sentimental value, but oftentimes, you love clothing that makes you look good.


Study the pieces that you love for similarities in style and shape.
Hold a personal fashion show for yourself. If you feel uncertain about why you love a certain piece or outfit, try it on and examine yourself in a full-length mirror.

, If you hate it and no longer wear it, keeping it will only worsen your overall opinion about your wardrobe.


Throw out clothing with holes or stains.
Donate clothes that are in good condition to your local thrift store or second-hand store.
Box up clothing that has sentimental value. Some pieces may mean something to you, even if you hate the way they look on your body. If you cannot bear parting with a piece for sentimental reasons, store it in a box kept separate from your wardrobe.

, Determine what pieces look good on you and which do not.


Dispose of clothing that makes you look frumpy and clothing that ages you.
Hang on to bland clothing that fits you well or has potential. These pieces can be spiced up.
Keep a few comfort pieces. A loose t-shirt or a pair of sweatpants may not be fashion forward, but they are good clothes to wear if you plan on lounging around the house all day. As long as these pieces do not rule your wardrobe, having one or two won't hurt.

Get a standard clothes hanger.,
Consider adding a strip of velvet, moleskin, or hot glue across the bottom bar.,
Fold the pants in half vertically.,
Hook your hanger over something stable, such as a rod.,
Drape the pants over the horizontal bar in the hanger.,
Adjust the pants so that they balance right and don't slide off.,
Place the hanger inside your closet.",How to Hang Pants1," A standard clothes hanger will be shaped like a triangle. It has two diagonal bars, and a horizontal bar at the bottom. The method works great for any type of pants, but the pants are more likely to slip off.;
, This will create some friction and keep the pants from sliding to the side or falling off. Whatever you choose to put on the bar, make sure that you put it on the top part, as this is the part that will be in contact with the pants.If you want to use velvet, cut a piece of velvet to the length of the bottom bar. Glue the velvet to the bar using hot glue or fabric glue.
If you want to use moleskin, simply cut a piece of adhesive moleskin to the length of the bottom bar. Fold the moleskin over the top of the bar and run your finger over it to seal it.
If you want to use hot glue, simply draw a zigzag or squiggly line down the center of the bar.

, Make sure that the hand pockets are on the inside, and that the seat of the pants is on the outside.

, This will leave both of your hands free.

, Slip the pants through the hanger, and drape them across the bar by the leg part. When you are done, the waistband should be touching the cuffs.

, If you notice that the pants are slipping off the hanger, you will need to adjust them. Either tug on the waistband or on the ankles. Do this until the pans hang across the bar without slipping.

, If your pants keep sliding off, you can secure them with a clothespin. Simply clip a clothespin or two across the horizontal bar.

Empty Your Closet.,
Sort.,
Create Storage Solutions.,
Organize the Closet.,
Enjoy and Maintain.",How to Organize a Master Bedroom Closet," Be prepared to take a few hours and empty your closet, dresser and gather all your clothes, shoes and accessories from around your house (and your car). Do a load of laundry to ensure all your clothes are clean.;
, You may want to put on some music or invite friends over for a fashion show to help move along this part of the process. Remember to try on all your clothes, shoes and accessories. Create enough space to make five piles:


Keep. Keep any clothes that you have worn in the last year or have sentimental value (try to keep the sentimental value clothes to a minimum). These clothes should fit well, be in good condition and represent your personal style.Donate. If you want to have a truly organized closet, then your goal should be to get rid of as many items of clothing as possible.






Trash. Trash any mold ridden items or items beyond salvage.






Alter. Set aside those clothes you want to keep that need a little TLC like alterations or sewing.






Sell. Sell the clothes that are still current or valuable that do not flatter your shape, are not the right size or no longer reflect the image you want to project. Check out local consignment shops or online storefronts that specialize in buying and selling used clothes., While you clean your empty closet, start planning how you are going to utilize your space. Take a break and do a little research on how to maximize closet space by using shelving, shoe organizers or accessory organizers that hang over the door or stack. Clear plastic bins are excellent containers to let you see exactly what you have in them. Cloth boxes are a little more expensive, but provide you durable and attractive storage solutions. Remember to create a clearly defined space for everything and label all containers. Try to beautify and personalize your space with a fresh coat of paint, cedar hangers or a new light fixture.

, Decide which clothes you will store. You should store the clothes that you won't be wearing for a while because they aren't seasonally appropriate. Then decide which clothes will go back into your closet and which clothes will be stored in a dresser or other location. If you have the space to hang everything, hang everything. If you really want to step it up a notch, you can use different colored hangers to mark a different type of clothing. Start by hanging up all your clothes by type (tank tops, shirts, pants, skirts, dresses, etc.) and color. If you really get into the organization process you can sub-divide the clothing types further (short-sleeved shirts, long-sleeved shirts, blouses, dress pants, casual pants, etc.).


Put additional clothes in other parts of your closet. Boxes with lids can be stacked on upper shelves all the way to the ceiling to maximize storage space.






If you have room for a dresser, consider putting one in your closet.






Don't waste the space under your hanging clothes. Add shoe storage, clothing bins or even another shelf or hanging pole to double storage. The clothes that you put in the bins should be used less frequently than the clothes you hang up.







, Enjoy your clean and organized closet every day when you get dressed. Make sure to maintain all your hard work by creating a schedule to do a quick weekly clean up. If this project is too much to take on, call in a professional organizer.

Take your measurements.,
Determine your problem areas.,
Find something you like about your body.,
Know your body type.",How to Improve Your Wardrobe2," Even if you think you already know your basic measurements, re-measure yourself for accuracy.


Measure your bust size. Wrap a tape measure around the fullest part of your bust, keeping the tape measure taut and parallel to the floor.
Measure your waist size. Wrap a tape measure around your ""natural waist,"" the narrowest part of your waist usually located just below your bust. Keep the tape measure taut and parallel to the floor.
Measure your hip size. Stand with your heels together and wrap a tape measure around the fullest part of your hips, keeping the tape measure taut and parallel to the floor.

, Nearly all women feel dissatisfied about some feature of their body. Determine what features you feel unhappy about so you can work on balancing them out.

, Everyone has something they can work with. Keep positive and figure out which features you like and wish to accentuate.

, There are five basic shapes: pear, apple, inverted triangle, hourglass, and ruler.


Stand in front of a full-length mirror without any clothes on.
Focus on the contours of your torso. Start at your natural waist and mentally trace the shape of the contour to your rib cage.
Start your natural waist and visualize the contour extending to your hip line.

Visit a tailor.,
Accessorize with jewelry.,
Add color and style to your clothing with shoes.,
Invest in other accessory pieces.",How to Improve Your Wardrobe3," A piece in your wardrobe can fall short of perfection but still have potential.


Fix hems that are falling down and loose stitches.
Hem pants and skirts that have hemlines that drag or fail to flatter.
Have an old favorite taken in or let out, especially if you have experienced a change in your weight.

, A bit of flair can take an outfit from bland to sensational.


Dig through your jewelry box for old yet fashionable pieces.
Purchase a few new pieces of jewelry. Look for pieces that intrigue you, even if you would not have purchased them in the past.
Buy jewelry that you know you can match with your current clothing.
Look for bright, colored jewelry to spice up neutral colored clothing.
Consider a few classic pieces, like diamonds or pearls, for nicer occasions.

,


Purchase a pair of fashionable heels, flats, or sandals in a bright color to make bland outfits pop.
Also look for a pair of trendy heels in a neutral color that you can wear with most of your clothing.

, You do not need to limit your accessories to jewelry and shoes.


Try on different hats. Not every hat looks right on every head, but many individuals can usually find at least one style of hat that works for them.
Consider purchasing a long fashion scarf, so long as the style appeals to you.
Look for a fashion belt in a solid, neutral color. Belts can change the way a garment looks on you by accentuating the narrowest part of your waist.
Rotate your purses. If you already own a few handbags, pull one out that you have not carried in a while.
Alternatively, buy a new purse if you only have one, and if you have already had it for a while.

Look outside your closet for ideas.,
Cover the basics.,
Select a few “fun” pieces.,
Shop for pieces that flatter your body type.,
Look for pieces you love.",How to Improve Your Wardrobe4,"


Flip through fashion magazines and pick out pictures of outfits you love.
Cut a few pictures out and use them as ""cheat sheets"" to guide you when you go shopping.

, If you do not already have a few basic pieces in your wardrobe, add them.


Own at least one pair of well-fit blue jeans in a classic style, such as boot-cut.
Purchase one nice pair of soft material dress slacks with an interior lining.
Consider a simple, flattering skirt in a neutral color. A knee-length A-line skirt flatters most body types and can often be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.
Buy a few tank tops or camisoles that you can wear beneath jackets and low-cut blouses.
You should definitely own one fitted white button-down shirt.
Consider purchasing a blazer or jacket that you can wear over a variety of blouses.

, The idea is to improve your wardrobe, not keep it the same.


Look for daring patterns and colors that intrigue you, even if you would not usually consider them.
Pick one current trend you find appealing and shop for a piece that falls in line with it.

,


Accentuate your upper body by selecting shirts with patterns, bold colors, and interesting necklines if you have a pear shape body.
Conceal your midsection with empire waist tops and full skirts if you have an apple shape.
Create lower curves by wearing full bottoms with visual interest if you have an inverted triangle shape. Think jeans with flares and skirts with bold colors, patterns, and ruffles.
Add dimension to your shape with print, texture, color, layers, and other details if you have a rectangle shape.
Accentuate your waist using voluminous skirts, nipped waist tops, and draping fabrics if you have an hourglass shaped body.

, Avoid settling for another bland piece you can only feel neutral about. If you do not absolutely love a piece you try on, save your money until you find something you do love.

Get a hanger with clips attached to it.,
Consider folding your pants if they are too wide or too long.,
Clip the pants by the waistband to the hanger.,
Consider using index cards to protect fabric and leather from getting imprints.,
Place the hanger inside your closet.",How to Hang Pants2," If you can't find one, then buy some clips to fit over the bottom/horizontal bar of a regular hanger. You can also use large binger clips or clothespins as well. These hangers are suitable for most types of pants, but they may leave some imprints in leather or pleather pants unless you use cushioning (such as index cards).

, If your pants are too wide for your hanger, fold them in half vertically. If you do not have a lot of vertical space in your closet, fold your pants in half vertically, then horizontally. You will be clipping them by the knee part.

, Each clip should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the outside edge of the waistband. The clips on most hangers are adjustable. They can slide across the bar back and forth. Move the clips around as necessary.

, Many pant clips have little grooves or teeth on them. These can leave marks and imprints in soft fabrics, such as leather and pleather. Find four index cards and place two inside each pant clip. Place the fabric between the cards. The cards will cushion the fabric, and protect it from the teeth.You can also use business cards, playing cards, or even pieces of cardstock.

, Consider hanging them so that the curved part of the hook is facing you.

Get a clamping pants hanger.,
Fold the pants in half vertically.,
Open the hanger.,
Place the cuffs between the bars.,
Close the hanger and place it in your closet.",How to Hang Pants3," These are usually made out of wood, and consist of two horizontal bars that pull together. They are ideal for suit pants.

, The hand pockets should be on the inside, and the seat of the pants should be on the outside.

, Grip the hook part of the hanger and pull it towards you. The two horizontal bars should open up.

, You will be hanging these pants by the cuffs. You don't want to hang these pants by the waistband when using this type of hanger. This is because bulky things, such as buttons and zippers, get in the way. They prevent the hanger from closing together all the way., Push the hook part back down towards the hanger and away from you.

"

Get a standard clothes hanger.,
Hold the pants upside down by cuffs.,
Place the hanger between the pant legs.,
Drape one leg across the horizontal bar.,
Tug the leg down so that the cuff touches the crotch part of the pants.,
Drape the other leg over the first one.,
Place the hanger in your closet.",How to Hang Pants4," It is the one that looks like a triangle. It has two diagonal bars, and a horizontal bar at the bottom. This method is great for dress pants.

, Your thumbs should be touching the inseams. Your fingers should be touching the outer leg seams. The inseams should be facing each other.

, It might be easier to place the hanger on a rod first. The horizontal bar should be between the two pant legs. You should still be holding the pants by the cuffs.

, Pull the leg through the hanger, and fold it across the bar.

, Let go of the cuff., Pull the other leg through the hanger and drape it across the horizontal bar. Tug the leg down until the pants hangs evenly.

, The pants now won't slip off the hanger, no matter how much you shake it.

Remove all clothes, shoes, and accessories from your closet.,
Set up four piles.,
Try on each item.,
Place donations in a trash bag.,
Place items you will sell in a box or basket.,
Store off-season clothes and accessories.,
Consider all accessories carefully.",How to Clean out Your Closet1," Take every item out of the closet and lay it out on the bed, table, or floor. This will allow you to examine all of your clothes. Having everything removed from the closet will also help you make more efficient decisions about what you should keep, donate, or sell.;
, As you clean out your closet, you will be dividing your clothes into four categories – keep, store, sell, and donate. After you try on and assess each item, you will place it in its respective pile. Grab a trash bag for donated clothes, a storage container for off-season clothes, and a box for clothes you will sell.

, It is important to try on all of your clothes and accessories when you are cleaning out your closet. This will help you make informed decisions about whether you should keep the item, donate the item, or attempt to sell the item., You will need a large trash bag for clothes you decide to donate. Having one set up near your closet will make the cleanout process go smoothly. Go for an extra-large or contractor’s garbage bag if you anticipate you will be donating a lot of clothes. Once you decide to donate an item, place it in the trash bag.

, When you clean out your closet, you will decide what items you will try to sell. Find a large box in which you can place these clothes and accessories. The box will allow you to keep the clothes folded and free of wrinkles. You can also use a laundry basket instead of a box.


Folding the clothes nicely means you won't need to iron them before selling.
If you are selling online, use this opportunity to take nice photos of the clothes to post with your online listings.

, Once you’ve decided what to keep and what to let go of, you can divide your wardrobe into seasonal piles. Take clothes that are out of season and store them in a container with a lid, like a Rubbermaid container or a basket. For example, if you clean out your closet in the summer, you can store off-season items like sweaters, gloves, and winter boots., Your cleaning mission should also include accessories like belts, scarves, and shoes. Try each accessory on with a coordinating outfit. If it's out of date, you don't love it, or it doesn't fit, get rid of it.

Select a wooden coat hanger.,
Decide which part of the coat hanger will be painted.,
Decide whether you'll add an additional decorative feature in paint.,
Set up a painting area.,
Paint as planned.,
Finish off.,
Done.",How to Dress Up Coat Hangers1," The coat hanger should be in good condition, with the hanging part is intact and not rusty, although it's fine if it's a little rough as that can be fixed.


If the coat hanger chosen needs any rough edges removed, sandpaper until smooth.
If the coat hanger is varnished, sand it to remove the varnish, to allow the paint to adhere without a problem.;
, You have the choice of painting the entire wooden part of the coat hanger or just the front section (and not the rod). It's up to your preference, but it's easiest to only paint the front section.


Choose a color that you like. For example, pastel pink or bright orange. It really doesn't matter as long as the color pleases you.
Use artist's acrylics as they're long wearing, come in a good range of colors and will not become sticky on the hanger (you don't want paint transferring to your clothes).

, For example, you could paint a word, such as ""Chanel"" or ""Yves Saint Laurent"" or ""My Clothes"" or ""Coat Hanger"". It's entirely up to you.


Use a font style that matches your decor, such as cursive for a French flair or stark print for a modern look.

, Lay down newspaper or other covering to protect the work surface. Set out the paint and paintbrush, water cleaning jar and the coat hanger.

, Allow to dry for the length recommended by the manufacturer. Paint another layer if needed, although bear in mind that for the ""shabby chic"" or kitsch look, some of the wood showing through might form part of the hanger's charm.


Consider whether or not to add a sealant layer. This is optional but it might be something you'd like to add to protect both paint and clothing. Use a standard craft varnish suitable for wood or perhaps Mod Podge for this.

, Tie a small satin ribbon bow around the wire hanger element of the coat hanger. Glue in place to prevent it from moving up and down during use. Allow to completely dry.


The ribbon can be any width, style or color as preferred. You may like to match it to the hanger or even to denote the color of clothing to be hung on that hanger.

, The coat hanger is now ready for your clothing.

Make double hangers.,
Use upside down shelf brackets on bare walls.,
Invest in an over-the-door rack.,
Store a plastic or wooden set of drawers in your closet.,
Install double rods for short hanging clothes.",How to Double the Space in Your Closet1," If you have a tab from a soda can, you can easily double up on all your hangers. Make sure you find hangers with skinnier hooks to try this method.Take the soda tab and loop it around the neck of your first hanger. Then, take your second hanger. Place the hook into the soda tab.
You now have a double hanger, which you can use in your closet. Doubling up all the clothing will allow you to double the space on the rod of your closet.
You can also purchase multi-tier hangers at a local department store.;
, If you stop by a local hardware store, pick up shelf brackets. If you have bare walls in your closet, nail shelf brackets into the wall upside down. You can then use the brackets to hang extra items. You can place hangers on the bracket, or use them to hang items like scarves.If you're storing lighter items, you can also use command hooks. You can easily adhere these to the wall to create extra storage space.

, An over-the-door is a simply, handy item you can buy at any department or hardware store. It will allow you to have a few extra knobs to hang things from on the inside door of your closet. If you have things like scarves, belts, and bags cluttering the floor, hang them up on the over-the-door rack.If space is an issue, you can purchase very small clothing racks at a department store. These can be great to store items like hats, scarves, and purses.

, If you have cleared up extra space on the floor, invest in a small plastic or wooden set of drawers. While this may seem like it's taking up space, if you use it to organize better, you can actually free up space with a few extra drawers.For example, instead of hanging all your clothing on the rods, you can store items that don't necessarily need to be hung in the drawer. Things like t-shirts and jeans can probably be stored in a drawer.
You can also store items cluttering the floor in the drawer. Bags you don't use regularly, belts, socks, and other small items can all go in the drawer.

, If there are any existing rails in your closet, make use of them. You can simply buy another rod at a department store and position it over the rails, keeping in it in place. A rod hanging close to the floor can be used to hang shorter items, like skirts, shorts, and some shirts."

Use your trash bin regularly and spontaneously.,
Don't think twice!,
Set up a storage and reuse bin.,
Think before you buy.,
Stop at the doorstep.,
Create a hobby space.,
Keep a donation/exchange box inside your car.,
Take photos of your kids' artworks.,
Encourage your whole household to donate, regift, or toss out unused items.",How to Stop Clutter Buildup," Most of the clutter in our homes is created by things that we store up for an unseen future use. If you can't think of a good use for any of the items right now, do away with them. Go on both regular and spontaneous binges where you throw unneeded things into the trash.;
, When you feel like throwing that empty jar, or that broken toy, your feeling is 100% right! Just throw it out and feel happy that you have saved on some space and some future work.

, If you will definitely need some items for future use (which you can foresee now), throw them into a bin. This ensures the clutter is restricted to just one place.


It makes sense to have multiple small bins, one for each room.

, Always re-think whether you want that item you are going to buy, especially when it is cheap or is given away as freebie. They might be good for the price you are paying for, but can you exist without that thing? If yes, you are buying clutter! Don't even bring it into your home.

, When you come back from shopping, literally stop at the doorstep and throw out any cartons, filler papers, unwanted wrappings, etc., right into the trash or recycling.

, Dedicate a room if possible, or at least an area of a room, to your hobbies. This concentrates your hobby-related clutter into one area.

, Regularly toss items into it. Makes your home more spacious and makes it easier to donate/exchange items during your other trips and errands.

, You can remember and cherish their creativity forever, without it adding to your clutter. Toss the original into dustbin without any guilt, knowing that you have a space-saving record of it.

, In particular, old school bags, shoes, uniforms, and clothes are unlikely to be reused. It is better to donate them and feel happy about it. The earlier you donate, the less clutter will build up.


For kids unwilling to clear up, you can make a game out of who can donate the most old items, or reward them with a small gift or treat if they clear out a certain number of items.

Let go of items that don’t fit.,
Get rid of items that are out of style.,
Follow the one year rule.,
Don’t hang on to damaged items.,
Sell high quality clothes and accessories.,
Donate clothes and accessories you can’t sell.,
Organize the clothes and accessories you keep.",How to Clean out Your Closet2," Once you have the item on, make an assessment as to whether it truly fits you. You should be able to move around comfortably in the item and it should flatter your figure. You should not hang on to clothing that is too small, too big, or unflattering. If the item doesn’t fit, get rid of it!If you decide to get an item tailored, make sure you do it within two weeks. If you don’t get around to it, get rid of the item.

, Generally speaking, you should not hang on to clothing that is no longer in style. These items are taking up valuable real estate in your closet. For example, if your closet is filled with mom jeans from the late 1990s, you should probably donate them. You can then use the space for jeans that flatter your figure and are in style., If an item fits, you will next need to think about the last time you wore it. If you can’t remember when you wore it last, get rid of it! If you wore the item within the last year, and you still have a use for it, keep it.Try putting all your hangers in the same position when you hang the clothes up after the closet clean-up. After you wear an item, flip the hanger in the opposite direction. At the end of the year, get rid of all clothes that have hangers that have been flipped.

, Look over the item carefully for any signs of damage. Keep your eyes peeled for stains, rips, and holes. Depending on the degree of damage, you will want to donate, recycle, or throw the item out. If you can repair the item, make a plan to do so within the next week., You can sell clothing that is in good shape, of high quality, and in style. Try selling higher end clothing online through a website like eBay, ThredUp, or Poshmark. You can also take clothes to local consignment stores, or have a yard sale., Find a local charity that is accepting clothing donations. You can take all the clothes you no longer want and cannot sell to the charity. For example, you can try calling the local women’s shelter to find out if they are currently accepting clothing donations.Do not donate significantly damaged clothing or used underwear.

, You can now organize the clothes in your closet. Try hanging items up on slim hangers by clothing type or color. You can also utilize storage solutions like shoe racks, shelving, and storage containers to make your closet more user-friendly."

Understand that some areas of the house are harder to declutter than other areas.,
Realize that objects can stand between you and space to think and move.,
Bring home three big boxes from your grocery store.,
Set a time limit for the session, say 15 minutes to one hour.,
Make three piles on the floor, to match each of the marked boxes.,
Tackle one room at a time.,
Find a place for everything.,

Keep your living area and bedrooms clutter free by minimizing décor.,
Stop shopping!,
Make sure that your mail is under control.,
Make use of shelves or baskets to keep your items out of the way.,
Set limits on things.,
Get used to having less.",How to Remove Clutter From Your Home," Each room or area of a house can present its own level of decluttering difficulties. A lesser-used area may be the simplest to begin with and can therefore bring the quickest rewards. Because it is so frequently used, often by more than one person in the household, a kitchen can be more difficult to keep decluttered.;
, De-cluttering a house full of objects, especially ones that are either broken, or likely to never be used at all will make more space for living and entertaining. Redundant objects can be removed or hidden in storage. Only the best-looking objects and knick-knacks, like vases, lamps, and chairs that fit the style and look of the room should be left on display.


Determine what you use on a daily basis and seek to have those items easily accessible. For example, if you do not use your food dehydrator often, place it into storage (basement, garage). It will save valuable space for items you may use on a daily basis (toaster, coffee maker).
You may also determine usage of items based on season. For example, during the winter months you may not entertain as often. If so, you can place your serving trays and extra dishes in the basement until spring or summer comes. The same reasoning can be applied to seasonal items such as BBQ accessories (skewers, grills, etc.).

, Label each box using a permanent marker: One ""Keep"", one ""Sell"", and one ""Charity"". Also get a large, lined garbage can into which you can throw things that you don't want to keep, ready to sell, toss or donate.

, Set a timer, and don't start more than you can finish in your allotted time. When the timer rings, make yourself stop, clean up, and then take at least a 15-minute break so you don't burn out. You can always decide to do another round after the break is over but you will probably be relieved to have to break.

, Later, you probably will change some of the items in each box, or move them to another box, but that's after you've had some time to think.

, In each room make three piles on the floor, matching the labeled boxes. Pick up an item, decide which box to put it into, and toss it into the box.

, keep the things you need in a place where you will find it easily. For example, by the phone in the kitchen area, keep pens, extra paper and scissors. Make sure everyone in the family is aware to return things back after they use them.

, Look around and enjoy the neat and tidy area that you probably have not seen for months, or perhaps years. Scrub off grime from surfaces, remove cobwebs and repaint drywall if necessary to make a clean and cozy room.

, The rule of thumb here is if you have not used any item in a year or more, it goes! Add it to one of the other boxes, or toss it into the garbage.


Donate the items you have not used items in 1-2 years. Chances are you don't need them. Donate them to the less fortunate or perhaps a family member who is starting out or moving away to college. This principle also applies to furniture, not just dishes and clothes.

, Call a charity of your choice and ask them to pick them up. Most of the time they will. Sort through and price items for your garage sale. This will save you time when you have the sale. Try to arrange the garage sale at an early date, so you will not be tempted to return the items to your house. Bring the filled garbage bags to the curb on the next pick-up day.

, No clutter, no mess, just a nice clean and nice looking house. Keep it that way on a daily basis.

, This will not only look larger but cleaner, as there is less around to distract the eye. Having less décor means less to clean and dust as well.

, This is a tough one but, learning to not replace items that you have gotten rid of is important one to follow. Also it is really important to shop well. In order to prevent buying twice, buy quality items or items that please the soul. If you have to pay extra for sofa cushions you really love then do so rather than buying the ones that were on sale. Chances are if you love your décor, then you will stick with it.


It is easier to remember the items you spent more money on, and to treasure them above the cheaper things. Focus on quality over quantity.

, Address it when you get it, rather than letting it pile up and then intimidate you. Recycle magazines once you read them or cut out the articles you like and place them in a folder to keep.

, Try not to get into useless memorabilia collecting. Buying a coffee mug where ever you travel to can add up. Be realistic, having a few digital pictures are more than enough to create memories rather than a dozen mugs.

, Having eight cereals to choose from and five cookie packages is not being realistic. Enjoy two to three items, then once finished, buy others. This will teach children to respect what they have and appreciate it and it will encourage a less-cluttered mindset for you.

, Once you declutter your environment, enjoy the space and the look of having less items but a more open cleaner space. Instead of finding new appliances, furniture of clothes-- take up a hobby and distract yourself from items you probably do not need.

Use a plastic coat hanger for this.,
Cut the wadding into a strip.,
Wind the wadding strip around the clothes hanger.,
Draw around the padded hanger onto a piece of paper.,
Place the paper template against the fabric you've chosen to cover the hanger.,
Pin the fabric to the padded hanger, one piece on the front side and the other piece on the back side.,
Turn the seam allowance under once the fabric has been attached with pins.,
Add a ribbon to the hook for embellishment.,
Done.",How to Dress Up Coat Hangers2," Wooden coat hangers are too nice to cover up!

, The strip should measure about 1 meter (1 yard) length by 10cm (4 inches) wide.

, Stitch so that it remains wound in place around the hanger. Focus on keeping it smooth, so that there will be no evident bumps when the fabric covers it.


This forms the soft wadding against which your clothes will sit when hung.

, Get the exact shape, as this will form a template. Draw an additional seam allowance around the template of 2cm or 3/4 of an inch. Cut out the paper template.

, Draw around the shape or pin it in place. Cut out the fabric piece. Repeat one more time, to get two pieces of fabric in the same shape.

, Allow for the seam allowance all the way around, as you pin.

, Hand stitch the two pieces of fabric together. As you stitch, pull the fabric tightly around the padding over the hanger. Finish off with a neat and tight knot.

,


If the hook is ugly on its own, consider winding yarn around it––coat the hook in glue first, then carefully wind on the yarn. Allow to dry, then add the ribbon embellishment.

, The padded coat hanger is now ready for keeping your clothes in great shape.

Start by removing everything from your closet.,
Identify what you absolutely want to keep.,
Eliminate anything you haven't worn in six months.,
Toss anything that doesn't fit.,
Trim down your accessories.,
Remove empty or thick hangers.",How to Double the Space in Your Closet2," Before you can figure out how to downsize, remove everything. Having everything set in front of you will give you a sense of how much you have, and allow you to find very old items you have not used in years., Before you begin throwing things away, you should figure out what you need to keep. Go through every pile of items and pick out the items that you absolutely cannot throw away.Be strict with yourself here. You need to identify items you need over items of sentimental value. While you can certainly decide to keep non-essential items later, it's important to start off by identifying everything you need.
Only keep items you need. This means items you wear regularly. If you haven't worn an item in months, it may be worth keeping for a variety of reasons. However, for the time being, strip your wardrobe to the bare essentials to get a starting point.

, First, look through all your clothing. Find anything you have not worn in six months and set it aside.Sort through these items. Some of them are probably items you're not going to wear again. For example, you may have an outfit that was for a particular occasion that you don't care for. You can donate this, give it away, or throw it out.
Other items you have not worn in awhile may be worth keeping. For example, items for warmer or colder months can be stored elsewhere instead of thrown out. An item that has sentimental value can be kept, even if you probably won't wear it again. You also may want to keep expensive items. Even if they no longer fit, or if you no longer care to wear them, you could sell them later on.
Try to be strict, however. Get rid of as much as you can in your current wardrobe.

, If it doesn't fit now, you probably don't need it. Don't count on something fitting later if you're trying to save space in your closet. If an item no longer fits you, you should donate it or throw it away. You can always purchase new clothes later if your size changes in the future.However, you may be working on losing weight and have some goal outfits in your closet. These are okay to keep, but it may make sense to store them elsewhere until you reach certain weight loss milestones.

, Many people find they have accessories that they simply no longer use. If this is the case for you, start getting rid of accessories you don't need. Review your collection of things like belts, scarves, and jewelry and determine what you should and should not keep.You may be surprised how many accessories you no longer use. Most people, for example, only have a few good belts they use. You probably have a lot of belts you can simply toss.
There may also be accessories that were given to you as gifts that you never cared for. As it's unlikely you will ever use these items, it's okay to throw them away or give them away.

, Only keep as many hangers as you need. Hangers can take up space in the closet that could otherwise be used for hanging clothes. You should also remove any hangers that are very thick, as these take up space unnecessarily.If you foresee yourself buying more clothes soon, you can store extra hangers elsewhere. Put them in the basement or attic or store them under your bed, for example.

Add shelf dividers.,
Roll up clothing for storage.,
Use shoe hangers to store a variety of items.,
Use old boxes to organize your drawers.",How to Double the Space in Your Closet3," Shelf dividers can be purchased at department stores. They can be used to make individual compartments on drawers and shelves. This can help you save space as it allows you to organize more effectively, making the most of your closet space.You can place some shelf dividers on, say, the top shelf of your closet. For many, this space gets messy easily. You can then use the top shelf to store items clogging the bottom of your closet, like shoes and scarves.

, If you have clothing that does not need to be hung up, roll it up. T-shirts, flannel shirts, and some pants can be rolled up prior to storage. This will free up a surprising amount of space in the drawers in your closet, giving you a lot more space., Shoe hangers and shoe trees do not just have to be used for shoes. You can use them to store things like nail polish, toiletries, jewelry, and other small items that don't have a place. By hanging a shoe hanger somewhere in your closet, this frees up drawer space and floor space., If you have a lot of chaotic drawers in your closet, you may not be using your space in the most efficient manner. You can use old shoe boxes or other boxes in your drawers, separating items by type. This may free up a lot of space in your drawers.For example, you can have a separate box for socks, underwear, accessories, and so on.
You may find, when items are not haphazardly thrown in drawers, you have much more drawer space than you realized.

, If you don't love it, toss it! Better yet, donate it to someone who could really use it. Stop piling up things for a yard sale you know you're never going to host. Get rid of it!

, If you block out time on each Wednesday on your way to work, or on the way to your Bridge Club meeting, you can get things out of your house on a weekly basis.

, Never keep more than two issues of any publication around. You can keep the current issue and the last issue. If you have not read these by the time the next issue comes, you are never going to read them, so recycle them now.

, If it needs to be filed, do so. If it needs to be signed and returned, do so. Keep your calendar near your 'checking' station so you can write down important dates and then toss the paper clutter!

If you can't get rid of that 20-year-old cheer-leading uniform that you'll never wear again, maybe a year of decluttering other items will make it easier to part with later.;
, Or sell your extras in a yard sale before you end up with an unintended collection.

, If you don't want to give-up something for sentimental reasons, but can't justify the space it takes up, take a photo or photos of it. It can even be more fun to go through a photo album or scrapbook and remember things than it is to pull them out of a dusty box. (Besides, holding up the cheer-leading uniform and noting how small you were ""back then"" can be really depressing.)

, This will help you remember stories or details that you might forget later, and is great for sharing with family and friends.

, Instead of collecting dust, it could have real purpose again! Focus on this, and give it away. Enjoy the good feeling that comes with sharing and helping others!

,, The ugly lamp that Aunt Cheryl gave you could be replaced by something else that would make you happier because it actually matches the rest of the décor.

, Box it up if you can, so you won't see the item, and give it to someone else before you can change your mind.

, Write the date on the box and mark it ""Give away on (date)"". Then when that day comes, don't even open the box. Give it to your choice of local charities (Goodwill, etc.) and let it go without thinking about it any more.

, Keep it out somewhere in plain view - e.g. if it's an item of clothing, hang it on your wardrobe door. Once you realise you've seen it every day for a week/ month and haven't wanted to use it, it'll be much easier to part with.

, It's easy to become attached to items, and learning to detach yourself from ""stuff"" takes time. Keep at it and you'll discover it becomes easier and easier to do.

Go through your current belongings.,
Limit (Or Resist) Impulse Buys.,
Create a Place for Everything.,
Use Multipurpose Furniture.,
Deal With Mail Immediately.,
Sparing with Displays (Simplicity Reigns).,
Use Vertical Space.,
Use Stackable Drawers in Cabinet Space.",How to Reduce Clutter in Your Apartment," Did you find that old sweater that Aunt Mable gave you for Christmas three years ago that you've never worn? It's time to find that old sweater a new home - donate it to charity, or take it to a consignment store to try to sell it. When we accumulate a lot of items that we don't use, they take up space that can be used for items we will use. This creates a cramped, cluttered feeling throughout our home. Removing these items will create space for the belongings that you actually use or wear.;
, While a 90% off sale is a strong temptation, ask yourself if you really need whatever is on sale. If you don't need it, put it back. The more things you own, the worse clutter will get. Impulse buys increase the unnecessary belongings in your life (and home).

, and Put Things in Their Proper Place - Once you've cleared out the old belongings that you never use, you're ready to organize! Designate a place for all the things you use - whether it's in a specific drawer, in the closet, or just placing all your clothes on hangers. Once you've created a place for things, keep them there! This will help you keep track of your belongings and reduce piling up clutter.

, When you're designating places for everything, it helps to make sure that you're making the most of what space you have. If you live in a large home, chances are that you have plenty of closet space, but an apartment poses more of a challenge. In either case, buy furniture that can pull double duty - storage ottomans help create a welcoming atmosphere and store items inside. Store a set of board games for a family and friends game night, or an extra blanket to snuggle under during cold days.

, Unwanted mail and piled up mail is one of the biggest headaches when it comes to apartment clutter. To reduce piled up mail, simply go through your mail every day. Throw away junk mail immediately, and decide what needs to be done with the rest of your mail. Once you have a plan for your mail, it can be dealt with or filed where it belongs.

, One sure way to make your apartment feel cluttered is by filling it up with knick-knacks and displays. This makes the space feel busy. By selecting a few key items and displaying them simply, you can reduce the busy atmosphere and make your living space feel more organized and less cluttered.

, In any home or apartment, your biggest ally in reducing clutter is vertical space. Wall shelves and tall bookcases let you organize belongings according to necessity. Place items you use rarely along top shelves, and items you use frequently on easy to reach shelves.

, This tactic might fall under the multipurpose category, but it's important enough to merit its own segment. Instead of using cabinet space as-is, purchase stackable drawers to place inside. These drawers allow you to easily organize cabinet space, and make better use of open space in the top of the cabinets, giving you more space overall. These drawers can be used in kitchen cabinets, under the sink, and any other type of cabinet. Drawer organizers are also a great tool for dividing drawers into smaller spaces for smaller items.

, Try to use your nightstand drawers to store items you will use in or near the bed. Find other homes for things you don't use in bed. Unless you sleep with it, your bottle cap collection can live in other, more appropriate quarters.

,


Put things on the top that need to be accessible. Things like lamps, clocks, phones, and tissues should generally go on top.
If you like to read in bed, do you have space for books? The right place depends on where there is space. If you have a shelf on the nightstand, you can put some books there. If not, place bookshelves nearby and use the nightstand for only the current read.

, As you do, think about why the things ended up there. Are things landing here because of lack of space on the nightstand? Are they there because the laundry hamper should be closer to where you undress?

Throw away trash and unneeded items.,
Decide what needs to stay on your desktop and what doesn’t.,
Downsize to more streamlined furnishings.,
Cut down on personal effects.,
Leave plenty of room to work.",How to Maximize Office Desk Space1," Embark on a total purge of all bothersome, extraneous or irrelevant items that are crowding your desk. This includes out-of-date documents, junk mail, empty boxes and old or unused office supplies, as well as more obvious clutter like food packages. While cleaning out your desk, get rid of as many things as you can do without. The more you throw away, the more room you’ll have left over to get some real work done.
Put a wastebasket next to your desk so that trash doesn’t continue to accumulate.;
, Sort remaining items into groups based on their importance to your work and how often you use them. Supplies that you use every day can be arranged in sensible desktop organizers or thrown into drawers within reach, while inessential items should be relocated to an out-of-the-way place or discarded entirely.If you’re stumped on how best to proceed, start by ranking your work materials from 1 to 4 in terms of their immediacy. Items that receive a ranking of 1 can remain on the desktop; items with a ranking of 2 can go in drawers; those with 3s should be placed in separate organizers and those with 4s can be put into storage.In order to increase your overall space, you need to create a more focused, minimalistic approach to the types of things you keep around you.

, You might have items on your desk that you consider essential that are nonetheless taking up more than their fair share of the workspace. Reevaluate bulky, unwieldy or oddly-shaped objects and see if it would be worthwhile to replace them with smaller, more space-effective versions. For instance, you might be able to track down a more compact light source to take the place of an outdated, oversized desk lamp.This will give you a handy excuse to do a little shopping for yourself—the types of office products sold today tend to be smaller and sleeker compared to their older counterparts.
Look for items that have multiple uses, such as a printer cart that doubles as a filing cabinet or a nameplate that also holds pens., While it can be good for your morale to keep a few pictures of your kids or various pop culture knick-knacks around your workspace, too many of these objects start to consume valuable desk space. They can also easily become a distraction, as you’ll be tempted to stop and admire them throughout the day.Limit your personal belongings to a handful of small items, such as a framed portrait of the family dog or a Garfield bobblehead.Brush up on your employer’s decorating guidelines to get an idea of how much is alright to keep.

, The center portion of your desk should be reserved for your computer or important documents. Section off a small area to one side of the desk and use this to complete paperwork. Give yourself plenty of elbow room so that you don’t feel smothered while you take care of daily tasks.Avoid letting other items drift into the space you’ve set aside for your primary job functions.

Use your drawers.,
Invest in a drawer organizer.,
Have a dedicated spot for electronic devices.,
Keep bags and briefcases out of the way.",How to Maximize Office Desk Space2," Place your basic supplies and most commonly used items in the top drawers so they’ll be close at hand. This includes things like writing utensils, envelopes, important forms and file folders. Save the bottom drawers for backup supplies, reference materials and documents that you only need to look at occasionally. Take a little extra time to organize the contents of your desk drawers so that you’ll know exactly where everything is when you need it.Stock up on copy paper, printer cartridge refills, ink pens, staples and other items you tend to go through quickly to create a ready cache of supplies.
Drawers are particularly at-risk zones for clutter. Go through your drawers every couple of weeks and get rid of anything you don't need that's interfering with the efficiency of your desk's layout.

, All the drawer space in the world won't do you any good if the drawers themselves are a jumbled mess. Stop simply throwing things into your desk and instead use a compartmentalized drawer organizer that does the work of sorting and storing for you. Dedicated organizers will prove useful day in and day out, as they allow you to separate your supplies however you see fit while keeping them together in one place.Label the various compartments of your drawer organizer so that its contents are immediately identifiable.
For especially large or full desks, try running with multiple organizers of different sizes and configurations that are conducive to keeping track of your supplies.

, If your laptop, tablet or smartphone plays an integral role in your work, feel free to leave them out, but isolate them to one corner or a special drawer. That way, they won’t end up spread out over the desktop. Try not to rely on too many devices at once, as they can quickly become an aggravation rather than an aid.Set up a “charging station” near an outlet or electrical strip where your devices can remain plugged in and ready for use.In general, it’s best to only use your digital devices when they’re strictly necessary. Electronics contribute to a lot of mental clutter, as well.

, Backpacks, purses, laptop bags, lunchboxes and other carriers are bulky and take up a lot of space, so it doesn’t make sense to cover your desk with them. Stash these accessories elsewhere, preferably beside or underneath your desk where they’ll be accessible without being an obstacle. Try to pack your essentials in as few bags as possible on the way to work each day.Take advantage of lockers or break rooms for storing personal belongings if your company offers them.
When storing larger accessories at floor level, try not to obstruct existing walking space.

Invest in a paper tray.,
File documents away in boxes.,
Keep your writing utensils in one place.,
Hang a small bulletin board nearby.",How to Maximize Office Desk Space3," If you aren’t already using a paper tray, you’re missing out on both crucial desk space and an invaluable organizing tool. Paper trays feature multiple tiers that you can use to divide up your incoming, outgoing and in-progress documents, which will greatly streamline your workflow. This means you’ll never have to dig through a stack of disordered papers ever again.Consider implementing two separate trays: one for current work and one for files you don’t need but haven’t yet archived.
You can also use a paper tray to sort and respond to unanswered mail that’s been piling up.

, Papers that you don’t need on a daily basis can be ordered, stapled or put in manila folders and tucked away in labelled storage boxes. You can then find a place for these boxes around your desk or office, or in your company’s specified document storage facility.Storage boxes will protect important documents from damage, spills and accidentally being misplaced or thrown out.
Make sure all boxes are properly labelled and filed systematically.

, To prevent loose pens, pencils and highlighters from going missing on the bottom of the junk drawer, bunch them up and group them together in a tray or cup organizer. Make a home for the organizer somewhere on your desktop so that you’ll always have a writing utensil handy.Throw away any utensils that are broken, dried out or don’t have a cap.
Don’t forget to keep a few backup packs of pens and markers in a bottom drawer in case you run out.

, You can use a simple cork bulletin board to tack up notices, stick up Post-It reminders and keep urgent documents in plain sight. If you have an office to yourself, mount the bulletin board on the wall somewhere visible. If you work in a shared space, try rigging it to a cubicle divider or even the side of the desk.Bulletin boards are extremely space-effective, as they allow you to remove objects from your desk entirely.Posting personal photos or decorations on the bulletin board will free up space on your desktop for more essential items.

Don't be embarrassed that you are selling so much clutter, be proud that you are now clutter free!,
Stay organized and clutter free.",How to Organize Your Life and Get Rid of Clutter," You normally shouldn't do this, but before you follow these steps, wash the dishes, sweep the floor and all that Jazz! If you have clutter, let it be. Stuff like picking up wrappers and all the basics. When you get this done, pat yourself on the back. This is the hardest part of your cleaning plan.;
, This should clearly tell them their chores. If they make a mess in a room, they should always pick it up. If not, take a sticker off their chart.

, You could keep a journal of the things you need to do. You should only spend about 30 minutes cleaning a day, or less. Your list would be things like sweep the floor, do the dishes, just to keep your house looking neat. If you want you can choose a day to do all of the laundry, or do it everyday. You could also pick one deep cleaning day, and one off day. Put your own personal spin on how you want to clean.

, This gives them time to do their chores, and they still feel like they have freedom. Make your deadline for chores clear. If not done, you could make them go to bed right then, or a punishment of your choice. If they continue not to clean the next day by 7:00pm you could give a harder punishment such as groundings. Don't worry, as soon as you take their electronics away, they will bust out the broom! At the end of the week, give your children a dollar for every stick they have earned. They will feel proud that they have earned money, and will be encouraged to keep cleaning and may want to extra work for extra stickers!

, Do not yell at them to clean, or else they will associate yelling and cleaning. Praise them once they do their chores. Try to make their MCP fun for them by decorating the boards. Remember, you want your kids to like to clean so that when they grow up, they will keep this habit. If you associate cleaning and praising at a young age, they will think of cleaning a lot differently than many people. Maybe it's not that your kids don't want a clean habitat; maybe it's just that they have a bad opinion of it because they do not think it's fun. The trick is to make them think it is fun! Try to remind them once throughout the day to do their room chores, but understand it is their responsibility and you cannot make them because you want them to do this independently., On your MCP you could have rooms listed and maybe two to three things under each room. If it was the kitchen you would write under it 1. Sweep Floor 2. Do dishes 3. Clean counter tops.

, Every day or every other day, make a side note to yourself to go through 10 minutes of clutter. The clutter is mainly your responsibility, but if your kids want extra stickers, this is a great way to earn them!

, If you find something that is of no value put it in a box, and every couple days to a week throw everything in the garbage box away. If it is something of value, pack it away in a box marked Garage Sale. When your clutter is completely gone, have a garage sale!

, If you would rather do this privately, take it to a local pawn shop, or come up with your own method. Whatever you do, do not let the garage sale boxes sit around long. Doing so will add to your clutter! When your clutter is gone, celebrate!

, Now that you have come this far, you don't want to go back! Stick to your MCP everyday. Positive reinforcement is the key. Hopefully this will train your kids to keep cleaning even when they grow up!

Make time to clean.,
Clear up your schedule.,
Prioritize.",How to Declutter Your Life1," Schedule in the time to declutter your home on a regular basis. It is unrealistic to expect yourself to do it all in one go. Allocate a set period of cleaning or ""decluttering"" time each day or each week.


Try setting an alarm clock. Designate a cleaning chunk of, say, twenty minutes each day or two hours each week. Set the alarm for the appropriate time so that you can throw all of your attention into the act of cleaning. If you are thinking about what you need to do afterward, then you may not get as much cleaning done in this moment.
Try playing music while you declutter your space. Make it a cleaning party! This can make the job much more manageable!;
, Make a list of all of the things that are on your mind at this moment: plans, projects, chores, and commitments. A cluttered physical space can certainly have an impact on your mental peace, but the case may also be that you have too much on your plate. Go through your list and identify the things that are weighing most heavily on your mind. Decide which obligations, if any, you can let go to ease the stress.

, Order your to-do list from most urgent to least urgent. Give yourself time to clean up your life, but make sure that it fits with everything else that you need to do. Make sure that at any given moment, you are performing the task that feels the most important.


The most important task in a given moment may be cleaning, or it may be your job, or it may be taking time for yourself. Remember that you must sometimes put small things in order so that you can clear the way for big things.
Do not forget to maintain perspective. Remind yourself that irrelevant things can feel very pressing when you are swept up in the moment. Keep your priorities straight.

Tidy up your workspace.,

Be ruthless and realistic.,
Rethink your storage.",How to Declutter Your Life2," The arrangement of a space can directly influence the clarity of your thoughts. Make your work area a comfortable and productive place. Start now! Clean what is dirty, sort what is messy, and let go of what is nonessential., Identify what you need to keep and what you do not need to keep. If you don't need to keep something, then find a way to release it from your life. There are a number of ways to donate, sell, or otherwise pass items along without a lot of effort on your part.Give things to your community. Speak to your friends, or post photos of items on social media. Put things out on the curb. Consider having a garage sale.

Post online. Sell used goods on eBay, Craigslist, and other online marketplaces. Give things away using sites like http://www.freecycle.org/ or the ""free stuff"" section of Craiglist.

Donate. Arrange a pickup from your local donation center, or bring boxes of things in to a local thrift store. Find a Goodwill store in your area: these centers will usually sift through large amounts of unsolicited used goods., The more space and tidiness you can create, the more relaxing your home will become. It is also important during this process to have a very clear mental image of how you want each room to look. This vision can be a very strong motivational image to spur you forward., Even after the purge, you may wind up with items that you want to keep but don’t really have the space to keep. Try to find an alternate storage solution that does not directly clutter your life. If you are emotionally attached to a thing, but you rarely use it, then it may be worth relegating it to a less visible corner of your life. For easy reference, make sure to keep a master list of everything that you store away.Pay for extra storage elsewhere. This can be a solid solution if you're keeping furniture or other large objects that you may need in the future. Weigh the cost of the storage unit against the benefits of keeping the item.Store the items in attics, basements, and other out-of-the-way places. Sort things into labeled boxes: e.g. ""Christmas decorations"" or ""Family photos."" Make sure that you can easily reach thing that you'll need to access with any regularity.
Create cheap storage solutions within your rooms using cardboard boxes and wrapping paper for decoration. Decorate the boxes in any way you want, to match the décor of your rooms. With a little creativity and flair, you can even add to a room's overall look and feel. Store a decorative box beneath a bed, couch, chair, or table."
"
Be a conscious consumer.,
Put things away.,
Try not to over-commit.",How to Declutter Your Life3," Control the temptation to hoard things. Each time that an object comes into your sphere of possession, consider whether you truly need to keep this thing. If you do not need this thing, then let it go. Move on.Resist the urge to buy things you don't need. Catch yourself when you are buying things on impulse rather than for a practical use. Think: ""Will I be glad that I bought this thing in a week? A month? A year?""
Learn to let go. Practice turning away from opportunities that aren't relevant to you right now.

, Be more mindful of where you leave things. When you are holding something in your hands, make sure that you put it away in its right place before you move on to a new task or a new object. It is easy to let your space become cluttered when you are constantly flitting from scene to scene, leaving a trail of forgotten objects in your wake. Try to build a mindfulness practice around reducing clutter.

, It can be easy to say ""yes"" to too many things and lose sight of what you really need to be doing. Find your focus. Do not limit yourself, but try to keep an even keep. Be careful not to let your life become so cluttered that you cannot keep track of where you're going.


Tell yourself that you cannot flake out of any plans that you make. Teach yourself to be more intentional about choices and commitments in your everyday life.

Go through the items you have either outgrown or no longer use.,
Empty your closet and all the drawers.,
Unearth all the pieces of paper you have laying around.,
Any place that attracts clutter, such as your bed, clean it first.,
Place the sorting pile in a large, clean area so that you can see everything and organize it.

,
Ask yourself the three questions about the objects that have ended up into the sorting pile:


Do you love it?,
Divide the sorting pile into three sub-piles.,
Do not expect to be able to finish all this in a day.",How to Get Rid of Clutter," Be brutal. If it clutters up the room, and doesn't have a standard place to live, put it in a sorting pile. After all, do you really need those magazines which you have collected since 1998, but have rarely read?;
, Take all the clothes that don't fit or make you look awful, and put them in the sorting pile.

, Either recycle or throw away the ones you don't need. Store the rest in organized folders.

, Then remove all the items in this area. Throw away items you don't need, clean dirty ones, and put everything else back where it belongs. Anything you're not sure about goes in the sorting pile.

,,
Do you use it often, or will you soon (within 3 months)?
Will you miss it when it's gone? Does it hold memories that are very important to you?

,



First pile: Pile number one should be the things that you mostly use on a daily basis and the things you ""love"".

For example, your phone, tools, shoes, and so on. For keys, perhaps place them in a bowl near the door, keep tools in a toolbox, or buy a shoe organizer. Whatever works for you and will help you find all the more important items easily.
Things you love, such as photos, figurines, etc. should now find a home where they can be put on display/secreted away/carefully stored, etc.



Second pile: Pile number two should include the things that you use at least once a week or once a month. These are the items that belong in closets, garages or other places that are out of the way. Organize these into storage containers (preferably clear ones so you can easily see their contents) and label them. Other items, such as clothes, hang on clothes hangers and put them away.

Third pile: Pile number three should include the things that you have not used for at least six months or a year. If you have not used them in a year, chances are you may never do so. Therefore, get rid of them for good. Give unused and unwanted items to charity, so that someone less fortunate can use them.

, Depending on how bad the clutter is, it may take you 2 days or a week. If it is emotionally challenging, it can take months and it's a good idea to get a non-judgmental friend or buddy to help you and to keep up your morale.

Find a decluttering schedule that works for you.,
Enlist the help of others.,
Get rid of easy targets.",How to Declutter1," There are many approaches to decluttering your space. Depending on your schedule (if you have one), take an hour or two or maybe even a whole day to declutter (depending how much stuff you do have to declutter). No matter how little time you have, you'll be able to find a decluttering schedule that works for you.Start small. Focus on one room at a time and work your way to the next one until you have decluttered every room you planned on decluttering. When you begin to declutter, you may be tempted to turn your entire house outside down and to gut every single piece of furniture right from the start. This may seem like a good idea, but it will actually make your space seem so messy that your goals become unmanageable.This may seem like it will take forever, but if you're methodical, you'll be able to make the most of your time. You can even declutter your things if you commit just five minutes a day to the process.Set reasonable goals. You should only empty out a room or a piece of furniture if you have the time to sort through everything in it and to put everything back in its place.;
, Decluttering will be much more fun and manageable if you enlist the help of others, whether you have roommates or just helpful friends who want to spend time with you. Working with others to declutter your space will make the time pass by much faster, and will make the entire process more enjoyable. You do not have to do this, though. For some, decluttering may be a personal project.


Play some music and order pizza. Make the whole process feel more like a party than a cleaning session. Don't let the leftovers and package lay around, though.
Having other people help you is also valuable because they may have better insight into the things you really need. A trusted friend or family member can give you the courage to throw out an item that you're attached to for no good reason.

, Once you've found a schedule that works for you, as well as the help of some trusted friends, you can start the process by getting rid of some easy superficial targets. Before you get serious and take it one room at a time, you'll feel better if you're instantly able to get rid of a few items that are crowding your life. Here are some quick and easy targets that can give you a jump start on decluttering your space:


Just get a big black trash bag and fill it with old papers, old shoes you haven't worn in years, empty shampoo bottles, old mail, and anything else that's in plain sight.
Go through your fridge and medicine cabinets and toss any old and expired items.
Get rid of any garish pieces of furniture that are crowding your space. If you just can't stand that big, ugly chair in the corner of your living room, you may feel better if you set it to the curb right away.

Get rid of trash.,
Throw out broken, dirty or unused items.,
Part with old clothes and toys.,
Put unnecessary furniture into storage.",How to Declutter an Entryway1," Grab an oversized garbage bag and fill it with whatever refuse has been cluttering up your entryway. Food and drink packages, debris from the outdoors, out of date mail and unidentifiable odds and ends can all go. Once the accumulated litter has been taken care of, you can move on to bigger and more important things.Place a wastebasket in the entryway to have a place to throw away trash on your way in and out.;
, Anything that no longer works the way it’s supposed to should either be repaired or disposed of for good. The same goes for clothing and gear that’s stained or otherwise past its prime. Obsolete electronics and work boots with the soles peeling off probably aren’t worth keeping around.Don’t be tempted to hang on to an item thinking it might have some value in the future. If you haven’t used it in months, you don’t need it.
Gather up things you intend to hang on to and put them away somewhere else, like a junk drawer or a labeled box in the basement., Rummage through the assortment of outgrown items you have lying around and see what you’d be willing to throw out. Sort the mess into individual piles based on what can be given away to friends and neighbors, what can be put up for consignment and what should be carted off with the week’s trash.Consider holding a yard sale to offload some of your finds and make a little extra money in the process.
Donate items that are in good condition rather than throwing them out. What seems like waste to you might be just what someone else needs., Go around the room and determine whether a given piece is doing its job. A decorative end table or antique mirror may look great in your foyer, but if the rest of the room is a wreck, they’ll just be taking up valuable real estate. Find another area where you can stash these pieces and put a few utilitarian storage aids in their place.Be practical about your decor. There’s no sense in having a desk for opening mail, paying bills and carrying out other day-to-day tasks in your entryway if no one ever sits down to use it.
Find helpful ways to use the furniture you keep. For instance, you could put a paper organizer on an empty hallway table, or reposition chairs or benches to provide seating in a spacious mudroom."

Empty out all of the things in one room or area.,
Decide what to keep.,
Decide what to throw out.,
Decide what to store.,
Decide what to sell or donate.,
Keep a ""maybe"" box.",How to Declutter2," To declutter in an organized fashion, you'll need to empty out everything in one room, or one area of a room, or even one drawer, before you can get the whole picture. You can put all of the things on the floor or on a piece of furniture -- anywhere where they are in plain sight.Be prepared with four different boxes: a box for things you'll keep, a box for things you'll store, one for things you'll donate or sell, and the last one for things you'll throw out.

, At first, you may want to keep absolutely everything you've taken out. But remind yourself that the point of decluttering is to get rid of all of the extra things that are crowding your life. You should keep the items that you use on a regular basis, which you wear, cook with, or use for other household tasks.


You should keep anything you've used in the last year. If you're really trying to declutter, you can make that everything you've used in the last six months.

, The point is to get rid of any- and everything you no longer use, that has expired, is broken and can't be repaired, or just anything you generally don't use and just lays all over the place. Get rid of it. If you have an item that you haven't used in a year, have completely forgotten about, or can't even image what you'll need it for ever again, then it's time to toss it. Go through your things and ask yourself, ""Do I really need this?"" If the answer is no, or if you hesitate for more than five seconds, it's time to part with it.


You may save a few precious sentimental items, but don't overdo it. You can't save every little thing, and you shouldn't make excuses for why every little button and piece of lint has special meaning in your life.
This is a great time to get the advice of your trusted friends. They may be able to be more honest and tell you that you will never use a certain item.

, You should store any item that you will need eventually, but which you know you won't need for at least a few more months. Many of these items will be seasonal or special occasion items.


Store your seasonal clothes. If it's the middle of summer, you can put away your winter sweaters for a few months.
Store any holiday decorations. Put away those Halloween, Easter, or Christmas decorations and take them out only when you need them.
Store any camping gear, ski equipment, fishing poles, or anything that you only need on vacation.

, You should sell or donate any items that you don't want/need but which still may have some value to someone. If you have clothes that are still in good condition, appliances that are still completely functional, or a nice painting that you just can't stand, then it's time to donate or sell the items.


Look for doubles of useful items. If you have two coffee makers, two tea kettles, or twice as many lamps as you need, then start donating or selling the items. Even if they work perfectly well, you don't need two of them.
You can easily sell your items by putting them on craigslist or having a garage sale. You can donate anything that isn't sold.
Selling items is rewarding, but it can take a bit of time. If you don't have the time, then just donate everything and you'll be doing a good deed.

, The ""maybe"" box is where you can place the items that you're not sure if you should store or keep the stuff. Store the stuff for now, and then come back to it in six months and throw it out if you haven't thought about it once. You may forget about the box all together -- but at least all the stuff in it will be out of your space.

Put everything in its logical place.,
Rearrange your furniture.,
Keep your counters clean and relatively empty.",How to Declutter3," Sorting through your things is the hard part. Now, you just have to throw out all of the trash, store all of the items you've chosen to store, and donate or sell all of the remaining items. Put all of the items you want to keep back where they belong, and make sure to have a great organizational system that will keep them neatly in place.


Organize your clothes by how often you wear them and what type of clothes they are.
Create a filing system that will help you put all of your future papers in the right place.
Invest in plastic bins to help store items in your closets.
If you have a lot of shoes and don't know what to do with them, invest in a shoe-rack.
Organize the books on your shelves based on the genre or time period, and make sure all the books are actually stored vertically instead of just sitting sideways on your shelves.
Make sure to clearly label all of the stored items so you can easily access them when the time comes.

, Get rid of any extra furniture you don't need and rearrange your furniture in a way that creates the most space by not blocking off any extra space with the furniture, leaving the windows open and free to let in lots of light, and keeping everything arranged in an aesthetically pleasing way.Rearranging your furniture will also make the space feel new, and will make you feel like you've truly embarked on a new clutter-free era of your life.
Consider putting up an extra mirror or two in place of a painting. This will make your walls look less busy and will create the illusion of more space.

, If you want to feel calm and at ease in your new space, then you should keep the counters of your desk, kitchen table, kitchen, coffee table, and any other surfaces relatively empty. Wipe them down, and only keep the items on them that you really need.


If you're cleaning the surface of your desk, you can keep a mug for pens, a few small office supplies, and one photograph, but don't leave ten pictures and five stuffed animals and knickknacks on the surface of your work space.
Your kitchen table should only have things on it that are related to eating, such as salt, pepper, and napkins. Don't use the kitchen table as a place to store your extra school supplies or papers.

Make time for weekly and daily decluttering.,
Enlist the help of anyone who shares your home.,
Be a savvy consumer.,
Give away one old item each week.",How to Declutter4," If you want to maintain your home's new beautiful decluttered look, then you have to know that decluttering is only half the battle. Now that your home looks nice, you have to make a concerted effort for it to stay that way by making time to keep your space organized every day and at the end of every week.


Spend 10-15 minutes decluttering your space at the end of every day, no matter how tired you are. You can also think of it as a challenge. Tell yourself you're done once you've put ten items in their place.
Spend at least 30 minutes decluttering your space on the weekends. You'll have a bit more time to do this on Saturdays or Sundays, and can do it while watching television or chatting with friends on the phone. It doesn't have to feel like a chore.

, Decluttering is much easier with the help of others, and so is maintaining a decluttered home. If you really want all of your hard work to pay off, then you have to enlist the help of your roommates, significant other, children, or anyone else who shares your home.


The process will be much easier if the person you're living with is just as committed as you are. If he's not, then you may spend a lot of time just cleaning after him/her.
Set household rules that encourage cleanliness. Say that all dishes have to be washed right after they're used, and that certain toys can only go in certain rooms, and so on.
If your roommate or significant other is just as committed to the process as you, then you can even take turns during nightly mini-decluttering sessions.

, Being a savvy consumer will help you continue to live in a calm and clean space. Pay attention to all of the things you buy and ask yourself if it's something you'll really need or if you won't have a use for it after all. If you're a smart consumer, then you won't be buying too many new items and crowding your home with them.Make a list before you shop. Whether you're going grocery shopping or trying to improve your summer wardrobe, make a list of all the items you really do need, so you come home with only the things you're looking for and don't fall victim to the impulse buy.
If you're not sure whether you should buy something, then resist the urge. See if you really want that thing two or three weeks later.
If you really need new furniture, get rid of old furniture. Don't crowd your space with more furniture. If you really need a new coffee table, don't put the old one in a different room; get rid of it.
Sign up for electronic bills so paper bills no longer crowd your space.

, This old trick will help you continue to declutter every single week, and it can also be a lot of fun. Just go through your things, whether you're looking at an old dress you may never wear after all, your second coffee maker, or a book you'll never read, and find a good friend or family member who will have a use for it.


If you can't think of anyone who will have a use for it, just donate it.
If you're feeling ambitious, you can aim to give away two old items each week, and go up from there.

Install a shoe organizer.,
Take advantage of available closet space.,
Use your walls.,
Acquire some spacious storage containers.",How to Declutter an Entryway2," Having an out-of-the-way area to store footwear will come in handy when you just want to kick off your shoes after coming in from a long day. Whether you opt for a rack, cubby, mounted shelf or just a corner of the room where you can line up unworn shoes, you’ll be glad to have them all in one place that isn’t right in front of the door.If you live in an area that receives a lot of snow or rain, place a separate plastic tray nearby to leave wet boots and sneakers in.Use a mounted or hanging organizer to keep pairs of shoes together and out of the reach of pets.

, Stash larger and lesser used items in a coat closet near the front door. This could include things like sporting equipment, duffel bags or baby carriers that take up too much room elsewhere. Closets are especially useful because they keep your belongings confined to a single space that’s easily accessible and out of sight.Stacking or leaning items on-end can help you fit more into the closet.
Don’t forget to check your closet space for things that can be thrown out.

, Mount a rack or row of hooks at head height along one wall and use them to hang jackets, backpacks, scarves, hats and other accessories that get put on and taken off frequently. They’ll be plainly visible, which will keep them from getting lost, and won’t obstruct walking space.Attach hooks using removable wall strips to make installation quick and painless and prevent damage.
Stick name tags above racks or hooks so that the kids each have a place to leave their things.

, For most homes, a few inconspicuous baskets or bins will be enough to tuck away stray items. Make sure they’re big enough to hold everything you need them to with no overflow. These containers can then be tucked away in a closet beneath another piece of furniture to make them less noticeable.For a more decorative approach, look for attractive pieces like wicker baskets and ornamental wooden chests or trunks.
An old cabinet or dresser can be converted into an all-purpose storage solution."
"
Commit to the new system.,
Take responsibility for your belongings.,
Lay out designated zones.,
Clean the area regularly.",How to Declutter an Entryway3," There’s no point in picking up junk and making more storage available if everyone is just going to keep doing what they’ve been doing. Get into the habit of actually using your new household organizational resources for what they’re for. It may take a while to establish a routine, but it will get your home looking better in the long run.Find a layout for furniture, storage containers and other helpful additions that works for your individual space.
Mindful practices will eventually become instinct, and you’ll be able to say goodbye to frustrating messes for good.

, Beautifying your entryway will be much simpler if everyone in the household is tasked with keeping up with what’s theirs. Busy professionals, for instance, should make it a point to leave work-related materials in the bedroom or office rather than beside the front door. Similarly, kids should take toys and school supplies to their rooms when they’re not in use.Try to stop thinking of the foyer as a spot to dump all your things as soon as you walk in the door.
All it takes is a little discipline to transform one of the most chaotic parts of the house into one of the most orderly.

, Reserving a single space for a particular type of item can help set up a practicable pattern. This means no hanging skates on wall hooks and no leaving sneakers under the mail table. Keep things in their respective domains and all you’ll have to do is tidy them up.Craft your own signs or placards to keep different areas labeled.
Give your spouse, kids or roommates gentle reminders when things turn up where they’re not supposed to be.

, If you want to keep your entryway spotless and clutter-free, it’s important not to put it off until it becomes a problem. Schedule a time once a month or every couple of weeks to go through and collect trash, hang up garments and relocate belongings to their rightful areas. That way your living space, and your conscience, will remain clear.Make cleaning and organizing a family activity where everyone can pitch in.
You’ll never have to stress over decluttering your entryway again if you tidy up as you go."

, Have a sort and toss party. Set aside a full day, and invite family and friends to help. Pull everything out of your garage and sort it into your pre-determined zones. Also create a trash pile, a give-away pile, and a “belongs-elsewhere” pile.

, As you sort, decide which items deserve a place in your soon-to-be-clutter-free garage. Only those things that you use and enjoy should be kept. Consider donating those items that you no longer need or want to charity. Or plan a yard sale for the following weekend. Don’t hesitate to throw away things that are broken or unsafe.

, Assign a specific area in your garage for each zone. Gardening tools should be stored together in one place, sports equipment stored together in another. Choose storage units that are the proper size and shape for each category. Think vertically by mounting pegboards and hooks for tools. Mount racks for bicycles and sports equipment on walls or from the ceiling. Line walls with floor to ceiling utility shelves. Store the items used most often in easy-to-reach areas. Reserve high or awkward storage areas for off-season, rarely used items.

, Don’t let all of your hard work go to waste. Return everything to its assigned home as you use it. Refrain from filling your space with unwanted, unneeded stuff. Schedule a yearly tune-up each spring to keep your garage clutter-free forever. An organized garage will save you time and money as you easily find the things you need. And maybe you can even park your cars in there!

Set aside a full weekend for this project.,
If you don't have shelving in your garage already, consider purchasing a strong shelving unit for your garage walls.,
Buy a number of plastic containers with lids that will fit into your shelving unit.,
You will need three (3) areas or containers for the following:


Trash
Donation/Sell, and
Action Items.,
Throw away any obvious junk that is lying around that you never use.,
As you go through all of your stuff, you will want to organize it into major categories; for example, tools, Christmas ornaments, collectibles, pet supplies, etc.,
Consider using eBay, Etsy or other online sales sites to sell anything that has commercial value.,
Start collecting these groups of things in the separate containers you purchased.

,
When a container is filled, label it clearly, put it on a shelf, and start filling the next one.,
When you are finished, call the people you need to return things to and arrange to drop them off or have them picked up.,
Review the items that need repairs.,
Take the donation stuff to donate to charity immediately.,
Get to the business of selling what you can.,
Now you can sweep your newly acquired floor space.",How to Clean out Your Garage," Get the family involved too, unless you think they will prevent you from being thorough, and assign tasks to everyone. Suggest a garage sale and the possible cash flow arising from that in return for their assistance!;
, All warehouse hardware stores sell various types. Storing stuff on the floor is the no-no of organization.

, Measure the height of your shelves, and make sure the bins are not too tall for your shelving. These are available at Target, Walmart, or other such stores.

, Action items include items that you have borrowed and need to return, things that need to be taken for repair, and items that belong somewhere else in your home. If you can, use a large trash bin for the trash, and boxes or large trash bags for the charity stuff and the items you want to repair or return to others.

, It doesn't matter if its ""good stuff."" If you are not using it, it doesn't matter what it's worth. Exceptions, of course, include photographs and other keepsakes. Adopt the rule that it if hasn't been used for 12 months, it is probably not needed (except for very expensive equipment, or if you have been too ill or work-swamped to get to a hobby).


Remove big items, such as work tables, totes, vacuums, etc. for more cleaning space.
Pick up small things, such as tools and decorations and separate.

, Be methodical, as the more things that you can place together in related groups, the easier it will be to see what you want to keep, what you have in duplicate, and what you no longer want or need. You will likely find something that you have been looking for!

, It is easy enough to post items, and you may have something in your garage that is worth more than you might think. Look up a similar item first to see what the potential value might be.

,, The goal is to have everything you want to keep in a container on your shelves clearly labeled so that you can see where things are from a distance.

, If they have decided they don't want these items anymore, add them to your Donation/Sell pile.

, Is it going to be worth the trouble and the expense? If not, put them into your Trash bin. If you decide it is worth the trouble, then put that item into your car to take to the repair shop tomorrow.

, Don't let anything just sit around. The objective of this project is to create space and organization, so things you don't want or need shouldn't be in your garage anymore, or anywhere else around your house for that matter.

, As mentioned before, you can use your unwanted garage stuff to have a garage sale, if you are so inclined. Or, you can also sell your things on eBay or Etsy as described earlier.

, And pat yourself on the back. You did it! Congratulations. And enjoy your new space.

Determine what it looks like now compared to what you wish for it to look like.Make it like a game.Figure up your amount of time. Match your amount of time and how clean you want it to be, and determine how quickly you will need to clean.;
, You should eat a snack, get a drink in something you can carry around without spilling, go potty, and be motivated. Find a small laundry basket to put your tools in. Your needed supplies are listed below.

, Anything that is is trash, broken, old, gross, etc. is put in the trash. Look in drawers, under things etc...Empty all trash cans in the main one, and POOF! No more trash in the entire house. You should now take out the trash.

, Don't bother with drawers and such now. That will come later.

, In my case this is the laundry room so I will begin there. Firstly, you should put a load of clothes in the washer. Now, sort the clothes by color, or the color will mix and Put the in baskets and leave them outside of the room. The closet (If you have one) should be organized. Put the cleaning supplies here, coats there etc... Make all labels in there face you. Go to the cabinets (If you have any) The cabinets should have only washer detergent, fabric softeners etc... Brush the ceiling, and machines with the broom and finally the floor. Wipe the washer and dryer down with a damp cloth and dry with paper towels. If necessary wash the window(s)lastly, put an air freshener, Febreze etc. in there to get away any strange stench from the clothes. Put the laundry baskets in there, and stand back to admire, but not for too long!

, The next room in my home is a hallway which we store shoes, coats, and bags in. Sort through the shoes throwing what is broken, ugly, or too big/small. Sweep the ceiling and walls again along with the floor. Mop the floor, stand back and admire.

, The kitchen should first be swept on the ceiling and walls. Now, go around the house and gather the dishes. Put them in the sink and begin washing with water on the highest temperature possible and soap. Now, put the dishes away. Wipe the counters with a bit of your pine-sol on a damp rag. Go ahead and do that to the stove, sink, cabinets, and fridge as well. Look in the cabinets and throw away out of date or nasty food. Sweep the floor. Mop and wash windows if needed. Put a 'Scentsy' or 'Febreeze' in too! Look at what you have accomplished!  :0

, This should be the most comfortable room of all in the home. Firstly, Sweep the walls and ceiling. Now, wipe down all of the furniture with some pine-sol. Go get the vacuum and vacuum the couches. Shake out rugs etc...Wash the windows if needed. Sweep, and mop. Lastly, put on something that smells good. For the living room, I suggest candles.

, Firstly, run a bit of scalding water in the bath with a bit of pine-sol. Put the soaps, shampoos on the shelves in the shower, and close the curtain. Now, hold the toilet seat up and put some pine-sol in there as well as a toilet bowl cleaner. Let it sit and scrub! Flush it, and wipe all surfaces with a rag dipped in the solution in the tub. Sort the cabinet and shelves. Sweep, then mop if needed. Put a dirty clothes basket in there, drain the water and leave this room. I have a hallway outside of here which I sweep the walls, ceiling and floor of as well.

, All that is left is the bedrooms. You should probably get everyone to clean their own bedroom, and bathroom. Your house is clean, and now you are presented the problem of keeping it that way...Good luck!

Remove all of the DVDs from the shelf or shelves.,
Clean the shelves.,
Dust the DVD jackets.,
Restore the DVDs to the shelves.",How to Clean and Organize a DVD Shelf1," Separate them into separate piles as you do so, using genres, directors, favorite actors or whatever system you like. A fairly standard approach would be to separate into kids, family, teens, adult, action, rom-coms, sci-fi, thriller, etc. Or, go alphabetical or by color––whatever will help you and other householders find the DVDs they enjoy watching.


Use this opportunity to get rid of DVDs that you know you won't ever watch again. Your local thrift store or Freecycle will appreciate a donation of unwanted movies and TV shows, or you can try selling them in an online auction.;
, Dust and wipe down the shelves. A feather duster and wet cloth will be useful here. When clean, consider using appropriate polish, unless it's a surface that is not suitable.

, After a while, movie jackets can collect a lot of dust. Removing the dust is not only good for appearance but helps to ensure that the DVDs stay in top condition too.


Wipe with a just-dampened cloth. Take care if wiping paper, as it can tear easily when dampened.

, This time, only put them back in the order you've now organized them into. This will require standing back and deciding what sits next to what and where before physically moving the DVDs back onto the shelves.


For example, if you organized by genre, then action might go on one shelf while fantasy goes on another. Placement will be determined by just how many DVDs in any one pile or genre you own.
It can be helpful to get someone to assist you with putting the DVDs back on the shelves. Depending on how many DVDs you own, this can be quite a workout.

Store kitchen items in cupboards.,
Have a place for each and every one of your things.,
Zone your kitchen.,
Hide items in standalone covers, caddies, and cabinets.,
Allow yourself a “junk” drawer.",How to Clear Clutter from Your Countertop1," The trick to getting the most out of your cupboard space is organization. Cupboards can get messy quick, and this can cause items to overflow onto your counter. Not to mention, the more free space you have in your cupboards, the more clutter you can hide away in those cupboards.Use vertical, tiered storage racks to create additional shelf space inside tall cupboards. This kind of shelving is available in the home goods or kitchen sections of most general retailers.
Install utensil hangers on the inside of the doors of your cabinets. This way, your utensils will still be convenient, but will still be out of sight.;
, There should be no orphaned items on kitchen counters that float around without a specific place. When you don’t know where an item goes, how can you put it away? Take some time to go through all your kitchen items, and determine a specific location for all of them.

While taking inventory of your kitchen, evaluate how often you use each item. If you only use an item three times or less in a year, you can save space by storing it elsewhere, like in a closet., By creating specific locations in cupboards, drawers, and so on, for items that are often used together, you can make your storage more efficient and organized while creating places for clutter to go. You can use whatever system you desire, but you might consider:

A zone for coffee and coffee related items.
A zone for baking supplies and tools.
A zone for cooking supplies and tools.
A zone for plastic containers., This kind of storage is generally less expensive than buying and adding new cabinetry yourself or paying someone else to do it. By choosing standalone storage that matches your kitchen décor, you can integrate these seamlessly with your countertop and hide away items inside.

In many cases, you can find these kind of storage containers at furniture stores or home goods stores, like Ikea, Urban Outfitters, Pier1Imports, Target, Walmart, and so on., No matter how well you organize or zone your kitchen, some odds and ends might be difficult to place. Your junk drawer is a great catch-all storage location where you can tuck things away until you’ve found a more suitable place for them.

Even though your junk drawer is likely to be mess, at least the clutter will be out of the way and hidden from sight there.
Junk drawers sometimes have a tendency to overflow to other locations. When your junk drawer begins to fill up, it may be time to go through it and throw away unnecessary items."
"
Organize and separate the disks by movies, music CDs, games, etc.,
Get a disk storage folder for each category.,
Take the movies and TV shows out of the DVD cases.,
Place each DVD in the pre-selected genre or type folder.,
Add a label to the front of each DVD storage folder.",How to Clean and Organize a DVD Shelf2," Use the sorting approach suggested in the previous method above to further divide the movies and TV shows by category (family, children, etc). By having piles of each genre or type of movie/TV show, you can simply work across piles per folder.

, These can be purchased from music stores, storage stores, etc. Allot a folder per genre or type of movie/TV show as decided by your sorting piles. Check that each folder will be able to contain all the DVDs from each pile; if not, allot more folders to each pile as needed.

, Handle with care so as to avoid dropping them or placing fingerprints all over them.

, Stick to one genre or type per folder, to make it easy to find movies and shows again.


It can be helpful to remove the case front labels, cut them to fit the folder and place them in the folder behind the relevant DVD. That way, you'll be able to find the right location to return the disk with ease. This also alerts you to missing DVDs, just by looking.

, If you intend storing the folders on their sides, a label should be added down the spine too, to make it easier to locate the DVDs when searching for something to watch.

Follow the ""one in, one out"" rule.,
Fight clutter at the beginning and end of your day.,
Line/hang up and space out things when you finish with them.,
Put things away right when you get home.,
Leave the kitchen counter cleaner than you found it.",How to Clear Clutter from Your Countertop2," Usually, you add storage to your kitchen for a specific purpose, like hiding your toaster, storing your coffee mugs, stashing utensils and so on. If you add another similar item, you won’t have anywhere to put it. This is the basis of the “one in, one out” rule: for every item you bring into the space on your counter or kitchen storage, take one out.

Following this rule is an excellent way you can prevent countertop items or those in storage spaces from becoming too numerous.
In the case of new, unique appliances and kitchen implements, it may be inconvenient to follow this rule. Think of it more as a decluttering rule-of-thumb that you can follow generally., When you get into the habit of something, it becomes less of a chore. By starting and ending your day with a little bit of countertop cleaning, you should notice a decrease in clutter. It may help you make positive changes if you ask yourself questions like:

”How do I feel about my kitchen counters in this moment? How can I improve how I feel about my kitchen counters?”
”Is the current arrangement of my countertops convenient? Is it easy to work in this space? What might I do so I can work better in it?”, The untidy mess of clutter can be arranged in a much more appealing way with only a little effort. Even by lining up often used items, like appliances, utensils, and napkins, against the back of your counter, you can make the space look much tidier. Also consider:

Installing adhesive hooks or more permanent hardware, like hooks you screw into your wall, on the wall behind your counter. This way, pots, pans, and other items can be tidily hung out of the way.
Leave a decent sized gap between items that you hang or line up. Spacing between items will make their placement seem natural, while groups of items squished together may appear like untidy piles from a distance., A major source of clutter comes from the things you deposit on your counter right when you get home. These are items you frequently carry on your person and want to unload once you get home. When you get into the habit of putting these things away right when you get home, it’ll become second nature. This means they’ll be less likely to clutter your counter.

Common culprits for these kind of items include purses, mail, books, keys, pens/pencils, wallet, water bottles, and so on.
Items you carry on your person are typically items you’ll also want to take with you when you go. Installing some storage, like coat hooks for bags, purses, and jackets, key hooks, and so on, will make it easy to put things away and grab them when you’re ready to go., This can even be something small, like wiping off a countertop or gathering some papers and tucking them neatly into a corner of the counter. Every little bit will contribute to the decluttering of your kitchen countertops. Some quick and easy cleaning maneuvers you might execute include:

Collecting writing utensils and supplies, like pens, pencils, paper clips, tape, notepads, sticky notes, and so on, and transferring them to your junk drawer.
Organizing items so they are orderly placed in their intended location. This may even include something as simple as moving an empty drinking glass from the counter to the dishwasher.
If you’re having trouble finding something to clean, ask yourself the question, “Is there something I can do right now to make my counters a little bit cleaner?” In some cases, there might not be."

Prevent clutter shedding from your fridge.,
Put appliances away after using them.,
Throw out unneeded items.,
Move items out of the kitchen that don't belong.",How to Clear Clutter from Your Countertop3," Although the refrigerator can be a handy place to hang recipes, notes, report cards, chip clips, and so on, these items can easily get transferred to your counter and forgotten. In some cases, things might get knocked loose and set on the counter. Keep your fridge clear of these sorts of things to prevent them from becoming counter clutter.

By keeping your refrigerator clear of these items, it will also contribute to the clutter-free atmosphere of your kitchen and counters., This can be something of a chore, especially if you're putting away heavy appliances, like a coffee maker. But when you tuck appliances away in cupboards or cabinets after using them, it can significantly reduce the cluttered appearance of your countertops.

A closet nearby your kitchen is another useful, out-of-sight place you can store large appliances typically left out on the counter.
When storing heavy appliances in cabinets, be careful that you don't overload the shelves. Doing so may cause the shelf to collapse, resulting in damage to your appliances., This can be difficult for some. If you’re the type of person who hates seeing things go to waste, you might donate your unused kitchen items to a secondhand store, to a friend, or to a relative. In many cases, things that you use less than once a year can be disposed of.If you have younger relatives just starting or finishing college, ask them if they could use any of your kitchen items before throwing these away. It’s likely they might need something you have.

, The kitchen is generally a central room in the home. Because of this, sometimes items that don’t necessarily belong there find their way into the kitchen. These items may include things like toys, vacuum cleaners, work materials, jackets (especially when draped on chairs), hats, and so on.Distribute these items throughout your home. You can keep the clutter from migrating from your kitchen counters elsewhere by following the motto “every thing in its place, and a place for every thing” and applying this to the rest of your home.

",How to Be Neater," You should start off with your home organization. Keep your room clean all the time and people will think of you as 'always being neat'. No one likes a slob, or to see a messy house. If you are a lazy type don't try shoving everything under your bed or closet and covering it, you will never learn to be neat by doing that.;
, You should start off with your locker or binders. If you have a lot of papers you should keep them in a neat pile. Don't try to hold on to everything. Ask yourself if you are truly going to need this in the future. If not, then start a pile with things you don't need. Stay after if you are embarrassed about other people watching you discover moldy oranges at the back of your desk or papers that you have been looking for a long time for.

, This will make you neat in no time. Keep them in your purse, bag, desk, or locker. Also keep yourself neat by combing your hair and ironing your clothes. Keep your face clear and your fingernails clean. You may find it helpful to have a lot of portable cleansing products. Don't forget to bathe and try to smell good.

, How do other people get neater? You can learn a lot of valuable things from other people.

, Many people's homes look cluttered because of a sofa right in the middle of a small room apparently. Rearranging your furniture will also make your house look bigger and brighter, so then that will help.

, Eat well and exercise daily. Drink plenty of water. Maintain a healthy weight and wear well fitting clothing.

Use the library: most library systems will lend you books from anywhere in their system.,
Use the library for downloading e-books: many libraries offer an e-resource service that allows you to download ebooks to your computer gratis.,
Purchase and collect your books on an e-Book reader (like Kindle Wireless).,
If you have room for them and you still think ""I'm going to read (or re-read) that someday"", keep them.",How to Stop Accumulating Books," A couple of hundred is probably okay, particularly if you are a student. A couple of thousand may not be okay if you live in a small home. Is it intruding on other aspects of your home? Are they gathering dust or obstructing parts of your home? If they're merely disorganized then organize them. Box up any you never read.;
, Keep only particularly valuable books after reading. Donate the rest to your local library or charity, or trade them with other book lovers online. You can also sell your books:


Look up your books by ISBN on BookScouter.com or RentScouter which also ranks the companies offering to buy your books. This will give you and idea how much your book is worth if you choose to sell it online. It also has feedback on ratings from most book-buying websites so you know which sites are reputable and which to avoid.
Look in the yellow pages of your local phone book under ""Books - Used."" Call the promising-looking stores and find out if they are buying books, if they give cash or trade credit, and if you need to make an appointment. Selling to a local used bookstore is the fastest way to downsize while getting something back, but they generally will take only the ones they think they can sell. The leftover books can then be donated to a thrift store; many libraries also accept donations for their used book sales and will give a donation receipt for tax purposes as well.
Sites like Amazon.com, Half.com and eCampus.com allow individuals to sell books; listing is free and a small commission is taken when the book sells. Current textbooks in particular sell well. However, you're then stuck with storing listed books until they sell (if they sell), as well as the hassle of packaging and mailing them. Decide how much your time is worth and how much you want to make per book; a book that you would sell for $5 may not be worth the effort to list, store, package, and mail, but it would be worth it for a book that could sell for $25. Set a time limit (say, two months), and if a particular book doesn't sell online by then, either reduce the price, ""un-list"" it and take it to a local bookstore, or give it away.

, This is probably a good time to organize your books as well. First, break your books up into the following piles, and decide which ones have to stay and which ones have to go.

, These are books like encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other nonfiction sources that you come back to regularly for reliable information. If you haven't referred to a particular book for over a year, though, you should probably part with it. These days, you can find a lot of reference information online and there's always the option of using the local library.


Books you've already read, that you want to keep. Whether they're fiction or nonfiction, think carefully about why you're keeping them. Will you really be reading it again? Less than once a year perhaps? If you can get your hands on a copy at the library, why keep a copy at home? This would be extraneous. Keeping books on hand ""just in case"" you want to read it again is a surefire way to watch your book collection invade your abode.
Books you haven't read yet. These can be broken down into two other categories: books you haven't read because you haven't had time, and books you haven't read because you're not really interested in them (usually gifts). If you don't want to get rid of the books that you're not interested in, consider putting them into storage. For the other books you haven't read, follow the remaining steps in this article.
Generally, if you haven't touched the book in the last 2 years, it's probably time for it to go!

, Set a ""read-to-purchase ratio"". This solution works well because it lets you control your book purchasing habits without requiring that you wait several years until you've read the entire existing selection. It also encourages you to read more, knowing that you can reward yourself with a new book soon enough, and not feel guilty about it. Choosing a ratio that’ll work for you involves finding that sweet spot between how much time you have to read, how quickly you read, and how many shelves you’ve still got to get through.

, Look at your bookshelf, and pick out the next 10-14 books you want to read. The longer you've hoarded it, the better. Then write down the total pages in each book and add up the total. Give yourself a reasonable amount of time to finish all the books, break the total pages down into a daily reading assignment, and tell yourself that you can’t buy a new book until you finish half of the books within the syllabus.

, Sometimes the urge to get a book can be satiated by writing it down on a list of books you would like to read or acquire ""someday."" Gardening your list can be a satisfying activity. Your list can be as simple as a piece of paper tucked into your library, or as elaborate as a computer database. There are even websites that allow you to keep and catalogue a virtual library.

, Either donate it or give it to a friend, or list it for swapping with an online book swap such as http://www.paperbackswap.com. This can make you more cautious about buying a book, because you'll have to part with one that's already on your bookshelf!

, They also have online resources so you can look up for free and reserve books.

, Many titles can then be burned to a CD or transferred to another device such as an IPad.

, All your books are digital and there would be no worries of having piles of them!

, Some of the best post-retirement hours are spent with books that were selected years and years ago. Finding time to read is no longer an issue, no need to answer to anyone (including the library) about how long it's taking to get finished with a book, and keeping five books going in five different rooms at once is perfectly satisfactory. THEN, when you are satisfied you are really done with them (or you think you are not likely to live long enough to re-read all of them), they can go to someone else or to have the paper recycled.

, Carry extra money with you. If you have a cell phone, always make sure that it's fully charged. You never know when you will be stuck in a situation where you are stuck on your own. You will be very thankful that you brought your cell phone with you. A neat freak cannot be neat if they are unprepared!

Make a to-do list for your day. Your daily or immediate list should never be more than 5 items long, or else you're taking on too much and setting yourself up for failure. Mark one or two of those items as things you absolutely must get done that day, and pursue those tasks relentlessly until you get them done.
Make a to-do list for the week. Appropriate items here would be: Grocery shopping, fix air conditioner, etc. Draw from this list to make your daily to-do list. A white board or board with erasable markers can help to remember all one has to do every day, or long term goals.
Make a to-do list for the month. This list would have more general tasks like: Birthday gift to Jill, get car serviced, dentist appointment. Draw from this list to make your daily and weekly to-do list.
Make a to-do list for your life. Drastic, yes, but why not use this time to rethink your life and where it's going? Being a neat freak is all about priorities, and it never hurts to get your ducks in a row.Follow through. There's no point in making a to-do list if you don't discipline yourself to complete the tasks you've assigned yourself. There are many ways to stick to your to-do list. Stop procrastinating, remove or ignore distractions, and hop to it.
Take a good look at things that slip to the bottom of your to-do lists. Are they really important? If so, get them over with, or at least get them started. If not, put them back in the long-term list for ""someday"" or get them off the list altogether. Don't let yourself get hung up on something for too long.
Remember to stay organized all the time, not just one day.
Clean out any clutter, because it is not fun to have around!

Identify the cupboard which you want to clean: make sure that the room is tidy as the items could get mixed up.,
Get some storage containers: these could be bins or cardboard boxes or shoe boxes.,
Find a good marker pen: a permanent one would be best.,
Remove everything from the cupboard: this prepares the cupboard for cleaning.

,
Make some hot soapy water: do this by adding washing up liquid into a bucket or bowl and pour in lukewarm to hot water.

,
Wipe all of the surfaces in the cupboard: if the floor is carpeted, use a vacuum cleaner.

,
Dry the surfaces: do this with a micro fibre cloth.

,
On the floor arrange the items: sort into 4 sections ( shown below)

,
Memorabilia and Decorations : These are things which are normally boxed such as photographs, old school book and memory items, holiday decorations(Christmas, Halloween),greetings cards etc.,
Things you use daily, weekly or monthly: This differs from person to person but it is usually things like cleaning products, a vacuum cleaner, clothing etc.,
Unwanted- disposable : Are you an obsessive hoarder that keeps things just for the sake of it?,
Unwanted- useful: This section is for items which are still of good quality, but you don't want any more.,
Close the cupboard and be proud of your hard work and now tidy storage cupboard.

, They don't have to be too pretty because if they are hidden in a cupboard they don't have to be looked at every day.

, Make sure that the colour is visible on the container. Black would be the best to use.

,,,,,, Sort all of these together and put to the back of the cupboard. It is best if they go here because there are other things that you need to have more accessible over things that you probably only use and want once or a few times a year. Remember to label to containers.

, it is important that you should put this at the front of the cupboard as it makes it more accessible and easy to obtain.

, Well if you are this step applies to you. To determine whether to throw something away ask yourself- does it hold any memories? If yes, add to one of the memorabilia. If no, ask yourself is the item old and broken or doesn't work well? If so, throw it away.

, There are many ways which you can get rid of these items such as charity shops, eBay, car boot sales or placing an ad in a local newspaper.

Diagnose thyself digital packrat.,
Go through a massive purge.,
Simplify before organizing.,
Get organized and have one place for everything.,
Reduce accounts.,
Simplify your feeds.,
Clear out your in-box.,
Clear out old emails.,
Clear your desktop.,
Delete multiple or poor photos.,
Stop saving junk.,
Defrag your hard drive.,
Aim for a simple digital life.,
Develop purging routines.",How to Stop Being a Digital Packrat," One or more of these symptoms will likely mean you're a digital packrat:


Do you have 20 or more folders and sub-folders in your documents folder on your hard drive?
Is your list of Internet bookmarks long and overwhelming? Do you use them much or scroll through lots of unused ones to get to the few you do use?
Is your email program nearly full, or do you use more than one email account because of all the storage you need?
Do you have multiple duplicates of photos, and is it hard to find a photo you need?
Is your hard drive 75 percent full or more?
Do you have multiple accounts for similar things, making it hard to find stuff?
Are any of your digital file systems overwhelming?
Do you have email from 5 years ago?
Do you have project files from 2 years ago?
Do you have folders of stuff waiting to be read that would take a year to actually read if you ever did get around to reading them?;
, In the beginning, you’ll need to devote some time to purging files. Thirty minutes a day is a good time — put it in your calendar, and just spend 30 minutes purging everything you can. See the ""Tips"" below for more details. When you’re done with your massive purge, it feels amazing! It’s worth the time you spend doing it.



Target one folder at a time. If you can set aside some time each day for purging, then each day you should target a large folder. Start with the biggest ones and then work your way down. ""Folders"" mean anything that contains digital files or information, email accounts, Flickr accounts, hard drives, USB flash drives, Internet bookmarks, My Documents sub-folders, etc.

Choose only the important stuff, and trash the rest. Go through all the stuff in the folder you’re targeting (see above) and pick out only the most important stuff, only the super essential files. Put them in a separate, temporary folder. Once you’ve picked out the essential stuff, delete the rest. Put the essential stuff back where it belongs and delete the temporary folder. What this leaves you with is a lot less stuff in each folder — just the stuff you need. Sometimes, you can delete an entire folder — if you can, then do so.

, Many people try to create complicated organizing systems for all of their stuff, in an attempt to get organized. But it’s much better to reduce your stuff, and to get it as simple as possible, before organizing it all. If you simplify enough, you might not even need to organize at all! Consider compressing files you do intend to keep, so they take up much less space.

, Once you’ve simplified, organize so that everything you need is kept together, either in one place or as few places as possible. For example, you could organize all the information in your life in a personal wiki, creating different pages in the wiki for different types of info. Having one place for everything reduces the need to look for stuff.

, Same concept, but in this step you should list out your different accounts for holding files and digital information, and try to analyze which ones are necessary and which ones can be eliminated. The fewer, the better. And if you find an account that holds all your things in one place, prefer it over a dispersed range of accounts.

, If you’ve got 100 RSS feeds or more, chances are you’re being a packrat with them. Drop as many as possible, so the incoming information is reduced to a manageable amount. Set yourself a challenge to reduce your feeds down to 10.

, Having an overloaded in-box is overwhelming. Reduce your in-boxes and clear them out. This includes all those unsent drafts you've ""slept on""; you're never going to say it now.

, After you clear out your in-box, it's useful to clear out old messages. In Gmail, for example, you could create a filter that searched for all your email messages older than 6 months. Scan through this new folder, and delete all of the messages if possible. You could then do a second filter to find all types of media files (.jpg, .gif, .pdf, .mov, .mp3, .mpg, etc.) and then delete as many of these as possible.

, Don't have any icons on your computer's desktop. Delete or sort through all of those, and have a clear desktop. Simple and calming. Instead, use a simple filing system where you have a folder for downloads, another for things you're currently working on, another for read/review, and another for archives. For shortcuts to applications, use a program like AutoHotKey to make keyboard shortcuts to all the applications you use — much faster than shortcuts on the desktop.

, It's useful for both amateur photographers and pros to cull through their photos, not only to simplify but to force you to analyze your photos and just choose the best. Get rid of all the mistakes, blurred images, and ones that you don't think much of now and never will. Otherwise, you're not looking at any of them!

, Once you’ve cleared out your old files and emails and accounts and your desktop, the key is to keep them clear. Every time you’re about to save something, ask yourself if it is really valuable information, or if it's basically junk. Toss the junk.

, Once you’ve gone through all your old files on your hard drive, it's good to run a defrag utility so that your drive is organized efficiently and runs faster.

, Once you're purged of all the clutter and junk, see if you can keep things simple. When you're tempted to file something, see if you can deal with it and delete it immediately instead. When it comes time to create another account for more storage, see if you can reduce your storage needs instead. At all turns, aim to simplify instead of complicate. This is more of a change in mindset than anything else.

, It's important to do some regular house cleaning of your digital files. Just as you have to clean your house regularly, or it will become junk-ridden and cobweb-filled, you have to clean your digital house as well. Once a week or once a month, depending on the amount of stuff you amass, should be a good interval for purging. If you want to be really organized, develop a checklist of things to purge during these regular intervals.


Put purging reminders in your calendar. To make purging a routine, set reminders in your calendar program. Every week or two, or every month, are good intervals, depending on your needs. But make it a regular thing, and you’ll be living the simple digital life from now on.

Reflect on what sort of clutter proves sentimental in nature for you.,
Recognize where the value in the sentimental object emanates from.,
Separate the sentimental from the practical and the liberating.,
Consider your space allowances.,
Develop a series of tests for your sentimental objects rather than seeking to keep them all.,
Cut down on the trinkets, letters, cuttings, etc., kept or piled in boxes and other containers.,
Use the digital world to clear up the physical space for you.,
Set limits and boundaries.",How to Let Go of Sentimental Clutter," Not everyone will have the same sentimental triggers or reasons for keeping clutter. However, there are some fairly standard reasons that bring about sentimental clutter:


Someone you care/cared about very much gave the item(s) to you.
Your children made it or brought it into the house.
Your loved ones bought it or brought it into the house.
It brings back awesome memories of a very special time that has long since passed, perhaps ""halcyon days"";
You made it or bought it when you were younger/going through a crisis/experiencing a life transition or epiphany, etc. or you got it when traveling overseas.;
, It isn't the object itself that is creating value and causing you to feel sentimental. Rather, it is you who are doing this, by adding value to the object through attaching your memory to it. Remember that no matter how much magic or uniqueness you have imparted to the object, it isn't the person or the moment – it is simply an object and it's an object that is potentially holding you back. It is your way of bringing that person or moment into the present and hoping that the magic still holds now. However, that moment is a memory and the feelings, emotions, and interactions first present when that object came into your life have passed. You are always entitled to the memory but allowing such objects to create a burden on your present life is unhealthy.



Emotional attachment is the biggest reason for why people are not able to let go of their clutter. And yet it is stifling and immobilizing to be storing ""memories"" in the household equivalent of hardware (your brain being the software). It follows you everywhere, trips you up, and prevents you from doing things you'd rather be doing because it's there, in the way, hiding the gear you really need to be using to enjoy your life!

, Sentimental clutter can soon drown you when you cannot create boundaries between it and the remainder of your life. Allowing sentimental clutter to fill your current life soon becomes a way of bloating the present with the past, of recreating memories instead of forging ahead, and even of hanging on to a self or onto other people who have since changed considerably (such as children growing up, your own entering another phase of life, etc.). On the other hand, practical and liberating things in your life are the tools with which you make current living better, easier, and more enjoyable. Practical things have a place and are not clutter, they're not shoved away in unmarked boxes or at the back of cupboards; instead they're in clear places, getting used regularly. Liberating things are the daily items that enable you to get your chores, living, and leisure sorted. And you also gain that wonderful element known as ""space"" – to have the space is to have freedom from clutter.


There is such a thing as ""too much to remember"" and you cannot possibly recall it all, so allow yourself some forgetfulness and learn to appreciate the freedom in that.

, If you have the space for a whole lot of sentimental stuff, maybe you feel you can hang onto it. Even then though, that's a folly because you're still going to be confronted by it even in a large house. One day, some day, you'll have to go to that storage space and check it out and ask yourself why you have all that stuff there... The problem for most people is that too much stuff tends to cause us to expand our space instead of making the most of the space we have. Once we start feeling we don't have space, we think about bigger living premises instead of reducing. And that hits the wallet, the psyche, the planet's resources, and your sense of well-being. If your space is bulging, you need to tackle the sentimental clutter the most precisely because it is the hardest to let go of and yet the most liable to be preventing you from living a fulfilled life right now.


You're in a big mess if you're renting out space to cover the extra stuff you've got. None of it can be worth the need to rent space!
Imagine watching people going through your sentimental clutter from hovering above after your death. Do you feel good about what they're finding or enormously embarrassed?

, It can be very hard for a sentimental person to let go of sentimental objects; it can feel as if a large chunk of who you were/are and the things that make up you are going with the object. To ease the transition from clutter to clarity, allow yourself a sliding scale of sentimental objects or a series of test questions. Keep the objects only if they meet the grade, be done with them if they fail. Consider such tipping out points as:


If I haven't looked at it for over a year, it has had its time.
If I am too embarrassed to display it, it is not an object worth keeping.
If I have so many of this kind of object that I am blurring the memories, be done with all of them.
If I am still harboring anger, resentment, irritation, or other negative feelings toward the person represented by this object, it is time to let go for my mental health's sake.
If the sentimental objects consist of several items from a member of the family who has long passed and I am not using them, not displaying then, and not enjoying them but really only hoarding them, then it's probably time to share the items around more of the family than just me. (In this case, often there will be new members of the family old enough to care for heirlooms after you've hoarded them long enough, so be kind and pass some on.)
If I hate the object but have imbued it with redeeming powers or as a reminder to be a better person, it's time is up. I am a better person for having kept it so long and for making a major decision to toss it.
If I am prepared to display it, care for it, use it, wear it, play with it, read it, whatever action it needs, then I can keep it. For now.

, Sentimental boxes have a way of breeding around sentimental people. And how easy it is to shove a full shoebox or other box to the back of a shelf or cupboard and forget it's even there... And yet, it is taking up space and not serving you at all, especially when you find another 15 of these special boxes"" cluttered all about the house. Be honest with yourself; just how many of those Christmas cards, love letters, recipe snippets, travel brochures, ticket stubs, children's artwork, and so forth, are you truly going to look through again? Start consolidating the many special boxes or piles to one. It will take time but you have one more chance to travel down memory line as you sort and toss.


Be very selective. Pull things that you really want to keep together into one box and when it's full, either cull or don't add anything else. In the case of children's mementos, it could be a sign that they have left one growth stage for another and that means a mental shift for you too. Same for your own phase shifts in life; they are natural, healthy, and it does no good to cling to what you once were.

, Digital cameras, computer memory, online albums, and cloud computing are your allies in the journey to remove sentimental clutter from your world. Since memories are a particularly large reason for feeling sentimental, photographs can become a means by which you can keep your memory and toss the object. Remembering that the memory is inside of you, not in the object itself, treat the photos as ""memory triggers without spatial dimension"". Take a photo of each object before disposing of it or donating it (do try to donate or recycle wherever possible). Store your photos on your computer, in cloud computing, on a photo site, or wherever it's easiest and most fun for you to go through when you're feeling a need to track back down sentimental lane. The beauty of this process is that every memory trigger is in one easy-to-find spot, it's not taking up any space, and it's not going to be lost. It does work!


Become a digital scrapbooker. You can hoard away and play with creativity to your heart's content and none of this will take up space in your non-virtual world!

, In the future (after your initial declutter experience), use limits or boundaries to prevent you from adding to a sentimental clutter pile, drawer, or space in the house. There are several ways that you can do this, including:


Asking yourself each time: ""Is it necessary, is it just about my memory, is it going to make a difference or a mess in my life?""
Using containers for anything stored. If it doesn't go in the container because it either isn't the same as the other things in the container or the container is full, use this as a reason to pause and ask yourself if it's necessary to keep it at all.
Reminding yourself that you do not need more space. What you need is more time, more relaxation, and less impingement of the things that tie you down in life.
Developing a sorting mentality, not a piling mentality. Both are habits and you can break the bad one and liberate yourself with the good one through sheer practice and self-talk.

Consider the impact your messiness might have on your productivity and overall professional or academic life. Some reports suggest that having a cluttered or messy workspace can decrease motivation and efficiency when performing structured (rather than creative) work. Additionally, when you’re at work, your co-workers, supervisors, and clients/customers are more likely to view your work ethic and abilities negatively if they see an unkempt workspace.;
, “Becoming neat” when you’re currently a messy person can be an admirable goal, but left at that, it’s probably too vague for you to work toward effectively. A good goal should be both specific and positive, and should also involve a clear action plan that will allow you to reach it.Define your goal so that it focuses on the positive: instead of saying, ""I want to be less messy,"" which focuses on a negative, say, ""I want to be neater and more organized,"" which focuses on a positive.
You'll also need to define what terms like ""neat"" and ""organized"" mean to you. Ask yourself if you only want a cleaner, clearer environment, or if you also want to better organize your time, goals, and habits.
After setting a clearer goal, figure out what you'll need to do to achieve it. This may vary by person, but generally, you'll need to set patterns and habits that make becoming and staying neat feel more natural in addition to clearing any existing clutter from your living and work spaces.

, Writing down information you need to remember later is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to organize cluttered thoughts. With all the information thrown at you on a regular basis, attempting to memorize everything will only lead to chaos and forgetfulness.You can use your phone, your computer, or a pen and paper. Just make sure you're consistent about the method you choose and also have a way to keep written information organized.
Write down both ""big"" and ""small"" details. Big details include things like notes on school lessons and instructions for projects at work. Small details include things like shopping lists, names of new acquaintances, and birthdays.

, These two ideas actually pair together naturally. For personal projects that have no deadlines, give yourself deadlines based on how quickly you can reasonably be expected to finish them. Keeping this deadline in mind will make you less prone to procrastinate.That said, it might still take some conscious effort to stop procrastinating if you're in the habit of doing so often. Simply focus on getting tasks done as soon as they come up, or as soon as you're able to get to them.
When you don't set deadlines, it'll be harder to break out of your usual disorganization. When you procrastinate, you're more likely to run into chaotic situations in which multiple things have to get finished in a short amount of time.

, While it may seem contrary to the idea of becoming neat, you need to accept that some projects will be imperfect. That's not a result of being messy--that's just the way life is.The key here is to organize your priorities well enough to know which things are most important to you. Crucial projects (e.g., a project for school or work) should get more effort and attention. For less crucial tasks, it's okay to postpone the task or complete it in a less-than-perfect way (e.g., simply sorting your movie collection so that it's all in one place without worrying about organizing it by title, genre, etc.).
By letting yourself remain a little messy when it doesn't matter, you'll save more brain power for neatness when it does matter.

, Cleaning isn’t a chore if you’re having fun! Instead of viewing staying neat as a chore or challenge, find ways to make it more fun and enjoyable. For example, wait until you’re cleaning up before letting yourself listen to a new CD or audiobook, or time yourself to see how fast you can complete certain chores and reward yourself based on speed.


It’s all about perception. Many people avoid tidying because they can only view it as a chore, which taints the process with a negative hue. If you can turn the process into a game or reward, you’ll put a positive spin on something you previously dreaded, making it easier to complete.

, Sometimes, becoming tidy is difficult for tangible reasons instead of psychological ones. You may not consciously realize it, but if accessing your filing cabinet requires you to dig out a key from a messy desk drawer and move a few boxes crowding the space in front of it, you’ll be less likely to go through the effort and more likely to let your papers pile up on the desk.Look for any physical obstacles encouraging you to be messy, then brainstorm ways to reduce or remove those obstacles. In the noted example, you could hang the key on a designated key hook and move the filing cabinet out into the open, making it easier to file your papers into their proper places.

, Designate one clearly defined space to pile any mess you don't have time to deal with immediately. For instance, you might choose an unused coffee table in a spare bedroom. Limit your messes to this one space, while keeping the rest of your living or work area consistently tidy.This way, instead of trying to completely break your messy habits, you're simply controlling them by giving them an outlet you can manage. Doing so can make it easier to be neat outside of that single outlet.
Additionally, having one ""dump zone"" makes it easier to know where to find lost items. Just make sure you clean this area occasionally, or else, you'll risk letting it expand beyond its boundaries as more things pile up.

, Don’t give in to any embarrassment you might feel about your current messy lifestyle. You’re trying to improve, and that should be the point you focus on. To that end, don’t be afraid to ask for help tidying or organizing when you feel too overwhelmed to manage the task on your own.If possible, try to ask someone who’s fairly well-organized for help instead of asking someone who is equally messy. This might mean asking your super-tidy brother for help organizing your homework area, or consulting your mentally organized sister for help straightening out your financial papers.

, Famous philanthropist W. Clement Stone once said “You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective.” Spending time with people who are tidy will indirectly influence you to become more organized. Plus, you’ll pick up useful tips and tricks about how to stay neat.


Not all peer pressure is bad. Spending time with tidy peers will encourage you to mimic their behaviors, thus becoming tidier yourself. Plus, if you need some assistance clearing out clutter from your life, you’ll already be in contact with some people who have the know-how to help you.

, Making plans to clean your environment regularly and writing these dates on the calendar helps you stay committed to being neat.


This is an especially crucial step if you’re transitioning from being a notably messy person to a neater one. As a messy person, you likely don’t have any cleaning rituals or habits currently set in place, so tidying up won’t come naturally to you. Being more intentional about your cleaning schedule sets you into a more organized state of mind, and should make it easier to follow through.

, Spending short increments of time on organizing your environment helps you develop the habit of staying neat and clean long-term. For example, spend 15 minutes today organizing the junk drawer in your kitchen, then spend 15 minutes tomorrow organizing all loose papers on desks and tables.On a similar note, make your bed immediately after getting up. This makes your room look neater instantly, and helps set the tone for a fresh, new day of staying tidy.

, Dusting and vacuuming helps the air in your environment stay fresh, and indirectly influences you to stay neat and tidy. Dedicate one day each week for dusting and vacuuming every area you’re responsible for, whether that means just your bedroom or your entire apartment.


Alternatively, you could spread the dusting and vacuuming throughout the week, tackling one area at a time: e.g., take care of your bedroom on Monday, your living room on Tuesday, your home office on Wednesday, etc. This can make the process seem less overwhelming if you have a large space you need to manage.
Examining dust accumulation on certain items can also help you determine which things need to be put away--a thick layer of dust on an item that you’d need to physically handle to use, like a baseball bat or sewing machine, suggests that the item has been sitting around unused for long periods of time.

, Refrigerators packed with clutter and expired food can be hazardous to your health, especially when old foods are stored next to fresh foods. Go through your refrigerator every three months and throw away all expired foods, as well as all nearly expired foods you don’t plan on eating before their expiration date.


While you’re at it, go through your pantry and freezer, too. While most pantry and freezer foods last much longer than perishable foods in your refrigerator, they still expire eventually, so you’ll also need to clear out these areas. If once every three months seems like too much, try to go through your pantry and freezer at least once every six months.

, If excess clothing is partly to blame for your messiness, go through your closet and drawers at least once every year to get rid of clothing you no longer wear or need. Clothing that is stained, smells bad, is damaged, no longer fits, or hasn’t been worn in over a year should be thrown away or donated to free up closet space.Stained or otherwise damaged clothing should be thrown away. Clothing that’s in good shape but no longer worn should be donated.
Many communities have large clothing drop boxes meant for donations located in the parking lots of convenience stores, restaurants, and churches. They often look like brightly colored dumpsters, but will have some instructions or information on them indicating their purpose. These can be a convenient place to drop off any unused clothing you wish to donate if you’re too busy to hand it over to a thrift store.

, If you need to tidy an existing mess, you might find the task overwhelming, especially depending on how much of a mess you’re facing. Work on one room or area at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed with finding a place for each of your belongings. For example, start with organizing your bathroom one weekend, then organize your living room the next weekend.


It’s a good idea to make a tangible schedule for yourself since doing so will structure your thoughts and better encourage you to stick with your plan. If you already have messy tendencies, relying on a spur-of-the-moment desire to tidy up any certain space will only carry you through that one space; it’s unlikely you’ll want to extend your efforts beyond that space and into other areas later on, based on the messy habits and mindset you’ve already built up.

, If you’re dealing with a significant mess, it’s probably best to start the tidying process by gathering every out-of-place item into one centralized location. Doing so will make it easier to sort through those items and handle each one as needed.


You should also take this time to dust, vacuum, and disinfect as needed. Clutter often covers up space on your floor, desk, and other surfaces, making it impossible to clean in those areas. Once these previously hidden areas are made bare again, taking a few minutes to clean them can make your living environment healthier and kickstart your desire to keep things looking as clean and clutter-free as possible.

, Messy people tend to collect useless items with hopes of using them again, such as outdated business cards, old paperback novels, and clothes that no longer fit. As you sort through your pile of clutter, set aside anything you don’t use. Recycle and throw away litter and trash, and donate good items you no longer need to thrift stores and charities.If there’s an item you haven’t used in over a year but genuinely expect to use soon, tag it with a sticky note, makeshift flag, or other identifier, and store it alongside the other items you plan on keeping. When you use that item, remove the tag. Go back through your closet or desk in another 6 to 12 months and look for any remaining tags--these will indicate that you truly didn’t need the item after all, and it should be safe to get rid of it.

, If your home or environment isn’t designed to accommodate all your belongings the way you desire, pack up and stow away items you’re not currently using to reduce clutter. For example, pack away seasonal clothing, books you’ve read and want to keep, last year’s tax paperwork, and various dust-collecting knick-knacks.


Keep in mind that these should mostly be items you need or will use in the near future. You can keep a few pieces for sentimental reasons, but try not to make a habit of it. Simply transferring all of your clutter to your storage area will only shift the problem out of sight--it won’t actually help you become neat.

, Organized people usually have a place for everything: pens and pencils go in mugs or pencil boxes, clothes have designated drawers and closet space, and loose papers go in filing cabinets and desks. By setting designated spots for each type of possession, it’ll be easier to put things away in their proper place instead of letting them gather in one large, unidentifiable pile.


Stay away from ""miscellaneous"" labels.Aside from being a non-descriptive and unhelpful identifier, giving yourself a “miscellaneous” box, file, or junk drawer may encourage you to lazily keep things there instead of putting them away where they actually belong, especially if this miscellaneous box is easier to get to than the proper location. In this way, you could unknowingly reinforce your existing messy habits and undermine your efforts at neatness.

, Go through a closet or a drawer anytime you get the chance, and as you pull out things for your sale, go right ahead and mark them with prices, using a marker and some tape. Put the items in a bag or the box, and tuck them away in the basement or the garage.

, Do this about a week to 10 days before the sale.

, Advertising is important here. People won't come to a garage sale with a lopsided piece of cardboard as a sign. Get a good piece of hardboard, and paint on your message in white.

,, It is easier to say go to 9th and 10th rather than 1000 9th st, because now they have to look that up.

Make eye contact with the host, offer a brief greeting and smile.,
Browse the inventory.,
Pick up any other items that you see.,
Use the price tags as a starting point.,
Get out your cash.,
Make an offer.,
Consider counteroffers.",How to Negotiate at a Yard Sale," Do this when you arrive. This will help you establish a rapport with the host.  ;
, If you see something that catches your eye, then make sure it works (don't forget that you are at a yard sale).  Set it down and keep looking, unless you are worried about someone else taking it. If you are worried about the item being taken by another customer, then carry it around with you as you browse for more items.

, Yard sale hosts are ready to get rid of their stuff.  The more stuff you buy, the happier they are that they don't have to pack it inside or donate it to a thrift store.  It is best to bundle at least three items together.

,  When you make an offer, try to take 50% off of each item you intend to buy.

, Psychologically, the sight of cash can make people mentally drool.  Bring lots of one-dollar bills with you to the yard sale.  Carry around your cash in your hand so that people can see it.  After walking up to the host, make eye contact and get read to make an offer.

, Introduce the items individually. If there are noticeable blemishes on the items, point them out.  After you you show everything you have, make the offer.  Do not ask, ""How much for all of this?"" Instead make an offer, such as ""How about $__ for everything""?  Maintain eye contact and wait.  If the host is uncomfortable with the price, don't speak first.  Make the host speak.

,  If the host says no, then force the host to make a counter offer. You do not want to bid against yourself.  You have set the new negotiating point, the old one they set were the price tags.  But you rejected those as soon as you made your offer.  


If the host adds up the price tags and tells you the price, then you can gently remind him or her that they are hosting a yard sale, and this is not a retail store.
You may even ask them what they are going to do with them if they don't sell them.  Ask again for a price concession.  If the host still won't budge and you don't want to pay full price, then you can leave the host with an offer saying, ""Let me leave you my number and if you don't sell them by the end of the day you can call me back and I will buy them when I return.""

, You can use a pair of pliers, a small crowbar and a flat head screwdriver, to get in the small spaces and force the trim up. Make sure to watch carefully for stray nails and screws.

, They can be attached with a combination of screws, nails and glue. Take your time with this process in order to ensure you do not damage the area or cause injury.


Remove nails and/or screws 1 by 1. Remove all noticeable nails before trying to lift up the counter. Lift the counter bit by bit with a hammer.
Use a utility knife to scrape up the construction adhesive. Apply acetone with a rag to the remaining adhesive. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes in order to dissolve the adhesive. Wipe away any adhesive. If that doesn't work, apply a layer of adhesive solvent, available at most hardware stores.

, Move from the corners to the lengths of the counter top. If it does not come up in 1 piece, or it is very heavy, you may need to cut the counter top and remove it in manageable pieces.

Take all your spices out.,
Combine spices that you have multiples of.,
Discard spices you won’t use.,
Clean the bottles of spices you’ll be keeping.,
Label individual spices.",How to Organize Your Spices1," Look at your spices tot get a sense of not just what you have, but how much of each spice you have. With this information in hand, you can begin thinking about which organizational method is best for you and your spices., There’s no need to have three containers of cumin or two containers of ginger. Combine spices of the same type whenever possible to save space. If you have two spices of the same type that are both relatively full, combine them in a larger container if possible., If you have spices that are prepackaged but opened and you don’t plan on using them, give them to friends who are interested. If you have spices that are prepackaged but unopened, give them to friends or donate them to your local food bank. If you have spices that are expired, throw them out., If you have empty bottles – for instance, from a spice rack – that you want to keep and refill with fresher spices, wash them thoroughly and let them dry before refilling. If you have prepackaged spices that you won’t be refilling, just use a damp cloth and carefully scrub the outside of the bottle as needed., If you buy unlabeled spices from wholesalers, ethnic grocers, or some other venue, you’ll need to label them. This will help you keep track of what you have and how old each spice is.The most low-cost way to label your spices is to just slap some masking tape on the resealable container you store them in. Write the name of the spice and the date you obtained it on the tape using marker or pen.
Remove the tape when the spice is expired or when decide to use that container to store a different spice.

"
"
Identify the spices you cook with regularly.,
Move occasionally-used spices into the middle area.,
Place the least-used spices in the back section.",How to Organize Your Spices2," To organize your spices according to their level of utility, you’ll first have to figure out which ones you use most often. Make a list of your favorite dishes, the ones you cook most frequently. Next to each dish, list the spices involved in the dish. This secondary list will be your guide for organizing your spices.Spices you use regularly should be given pride of place when organizing your spices. Place them in a convenient location like the top row of a spice rack or toward the front of your kitchen pantry.

, Make a list of dishes you cook only intermittently or rarely. Draw a second column next to this list and identify the spices used in each of these dishes. Use this list to determine which spices should be located toward the middle of the spice cabinet or in the middle of the spice rack., If you look at a particular spice and realize you’ve never used it, or cannot remember the last time you used it, place it in a low-priority position when organizing your spices such as the back of the kitchen cabinet. These spices should be given the lowest priority when organizing your spices, or discarded altogether.Unlabeled spices or spices that you cannot identify also fall into this category.

"
"
Make fresh spices the most accessible.,
Put spices with longer shelf lives in a less accessible location.,
Place whole spices in the least accessible location.",How to Organize Your Spices3," Fresh spices typically last only a few days. When organizing spices according to their shelf life, it’s best to use those that are freshest first. By placing spices that will “expire” soon in an easy-to-reach place, you increase the chance that you’ll actually use them.Bay leaves, basil, celery seeds, and most other fresh spices last five to seven days.
Fresh chives and mint generally last seven to 10 days.
Herbs, too, tend to age quite poorly. Make use of them as quickly as possible.
Dried flowers, zested citrus, and flowers should be tossed after about three months.

, Most of your spices are probably in their ground or dried forms. These spices don’t really go bad – they just lose their force of flavor. Some spices do this faster than others. Generally, spices lose flavor after one to three years.Powdered spices that tend to lose their flavor quickly include black pepper, ginger, and turmeric.
Seasoning blends often lose potency after just one or two years.If you purchase prepackaged spices, you might get a “use by” date on the container. Use this date to guide your organizational process.
There’s no way to determine exactly how long a particular spice will be effective. Flavor retention depends on storage conditions, temperature, and the inherent properties of the spice itself.

, Whole spices tend to stay fresh and usable for the longest time. Store your whole black peppercorns, mustard seeds, whole cloves, cinnamon sticks, and so on in airtight containers toward the back of your pantry or in an equally out-of-the-way place.Whole spices stay fresh for about four years.Extracts, too, have shelf lives of about four years (except for vanilla extract, which has an unlimited shelf life)."
"
Use a spice rack.,
Use a shelf system.,
Use a spice drawer insert.,
Use a pullout spice cabinet.,
Store your spices somewhere dark.",How to Organize Your Spices4," A spice rack is a kitchen fixture consisting of outward-facing rows of bottles or small containers, each of which contains a different spice. These bottles might be empty and ready for labeling, or they might come pre-packed with various spices and include the name of each on the container. You can refill the pre-packed spice rack containers when you exhaust the initial supply.The spice rack will typically stand 24’’ x 12’’ x 5’’ (61 x 30 x 12.5 centimeters).
The main downside of the spice rack is that it has a limited number of slots.However, few people will use more than the standard 20 spices the spice rack allows. Think about your spice usage before investing in a spice rack.

, Storing spices in a stackable shelf is another option. This allows you to easily arrange spices according to freshness or usage. For instance, using shelves, you could place the spices you use most often (or which are closest to expiration) on top and those you use least often (or those which are furthest from expiration) on bottom.Many spice cabinets are stackable. If you get more spices, you can just get another cabinet and add it to the stack.
On the downside, spice shelves are unable to accommodate jumbo-sized prepackaged spices. They are geared instead toward standard spice bottles of the variety that come bundled with spice racks.

, A spice drawer insert is a kitchen product of flimsy plastic that fits in a deeper kitchen drawer. It has parallel rows angled upward slightly so that your spice containers are easily accessible. It’s essentially a larger and non-stackable version of the stackable shelf system, with neat rows of spices lined up across whichever drawer you choose to place it in.You can cut the spice drawer insert carefully with scissors to ensure it fits in your drawer. Just remember, once you cut it, there’s no going back, so choose a drawer that is large enough to accommodate all your spices and accommodate future growth (if you believe you’ll be adding more spices to your repertoire).
When using a spice drawer insert, you might want to use an alphabetical system. In other words, line your spices up by name, starting with the spices starting with (or closest to) “A” at the top left, then moving across the rows and continuing onto the next row when one is full.

, A pullout spice cabinet is a fixture in many kitchens. To organize your spices with this storage method, you’ll have to determine how many shelves you have. Based on the number of shelves, you’ll be able to organize your spices in a number of ways.You could use one of the two most common methods of organization (expiration date and frequency of use).
Additionally, assuming you have just two shelves and a larger recess below for cooking oil or other essentials, you could place very spicy spices on the bottom shelf and more mild spices (basil, cilantro, celery seed) in the upper shelf.

, Light destroys the flavor molecules that gives spices their potency. Keep them in a kitchen cabinet, in your pantry, or somewhere away from light.If you’re using a freestanding spice rack, stash it in the pantry or somewhere it won’t be exposed to constant direct light.

Keep meat and dairy on the bottom shelves.,
Use the side drawer for condiments.,
Put produce in the crisper drawer.,
Use your upper shelf for items that don't spoil easily.,
Keep certain food items out of the fridge.,
Store food for the long term in your freezer.",How to Organize Your Fridge1," Dairy and meat products tend to go bad fast. You should keep such items on the bottom shelf of your fridge near the back. This area is generally the coldest, keeping these products freshest for the longest. This also helps juices from meat from contaminating the entire fridge in the event they drip.You should also wrap meat products carefully, especially raw meat, in plastic wrap to prevent contamination.
Placed wrapped raw meat in a bowl, dish, tray, etc., to catch any leaking juices.;
, Your side drawer is the warmest part of your fridge. As condiments do not need super cold temperatures to stay fresh, you should store them here.You can also store cooking oils, juice, water, and butter in the side drawers if you don't have space for them elsewhere in the fridge., The crisper drawer is designed to keep produce. Many crisper drawers have a humidity level you can set. Even if your fridge does not have an adjustable humidity level for the crisper drawer, you should still store produce here.Items that thrive at lower humidity include many fruits, such as apples, avocados, peaches, plums, and pears.
Vegetables, like green onions, broccoli, and cauliflower, do well at higher humidity levels.

, Your upper shelf is warmer than other parts of the fridge. You should store items that are not as prone to spoilage in this area.Snack foods and spreads, like hummus, jam, and jelly, can be stored in the upper level of the fridge.
While yogurt is a dairy product, it is fermented so it can safely be stored in the upper shelf.
Leftover foods can be stored in the upper shelf.

, Many people put items in the fridge that do not belong there. This can make items spoil faster and take up space unnecessarily. They should be stored in the pantry instead. Keep the following items out of your fridge:Coffee
Garlic
Bananas
Bread
Potatoes
Onions
Tomatoes

, If you're short on space, and have food you're not going to eat quickly, transfer it to the freezer. This will free up space in your fridge and save it for later. Items like meat, cheese, milk, and herbs can keep for months in the freezer."

Use and label baskets.,
Place labels on your drawers.,
Line shelves with plastic wrap.,
Use stackable containers.,
Make use of removable shelves.",How to Organize Your Fridge2," If you do not have a lot of individual storage spaces in your fridge, stop by a local department store and pick up some baskets. Label each basket and separate food items by basket. For example, you can have a basket for cheese, a basket for deli meats, and so on.A bonus of baskets is that they easily slide out of the fridge, so you can access food quickly if necessary.

, If you have drawers in your fridge, label them. This will help you keep track of what items go where and, if you have guests, they'll know where to put things away in your fridge. Side drawers often get particularly messy, so label these. For example, one side drawer can be labeled ""condiments"" while another can be labeled ""Drinks and milk."", Spills happen in fridges, even if you're well organized. A great way to keep your fridge clean and organized is plastic wrap. Remove all items from your fridge and lay down a layer of plastic wrap. In the event a spill occurs, simply remove the plastic wrap and replace it.Plastic wrap may work particularly well in areas where you keep sticky, messy items.

, Avoid storing leftovers in round containers. You're better off storing leftovers in square Tupperware containers, as these can be easily stacked in your fridge. This helps you make the most of your space., Most fridges have shelves that are removable and able to be repositioned. Take some time to think about and try different arrangements while your fridge is empty (either upon purchase or after a thorough cleaning). Position the shelves so that you minimize wasted space and maximize your ability to organize and access foods easily.

Replace the paper towels each time you clean your fridge.Crisper drawers can often be difficult to remove and clean, so paper towels can be particularly helpful here.

, You should use removable shelf bins for sticky items. Jams, syrups, and sauces can spill easily. Cleaning can be difficult if you cannot soak a bin in the fridge. Opt for easy to remove drawers so you can clean up sticky spills easily., Remove empty cans and containers promptly. There's no reason to have an empty milk container clogging space. Try storing leftovers in small bags rather than large bins. If you have more space in your fridge, it's easier to stay organized., You should spot clean your fridge every week. This means wiping up small spills and removing crumbs from drawers and surfaces. Every three to four months, you should deep clean your fridge. This means removing food to give the fridge a good, thorough cleaning., When you deep clean your fridge, you remove all items from the fridge, as well as any removable drawers or compartments. Food should be stored in a cooler while you clean. Wash down the shelves in the fridge using warm, soapy water.Wash all removable drawers in the sink, as you would dishes.
When you're done, dry your fridge as best you can and return all items to the fridge.

There are some posters or stickers which cannot be removed from your home. Tag these ""Not for sale"" items with a big red sticker.;
,, Place a throw pillow on the couch or a blanket on the back of the couch, books on a shelf or display dishes on a kitchen table. Creating a look of a 'boutique' style atmosphere is much more appealing and people will buy more, especially with yard sale prices.

, Set clear rules for those contributing if there is to be a clearance time at the end of the sale of when that will occur and for how much.


Items not to participate in end of sale clearance should be removed prior or marked clearly that the item is not to participate in clearance.

, The 'must haves' are plenty of plastic bags and plenty of change including coins. Often people will give a twenty dollar bill for a twenty five cent item.


Once the customer has change in their pocket they are much more likely to spend that change than when they only have big bills.

, It may be reconciled at the end of the sale with the cash on hand. This makes for good accounting. Always keep a calculator handy for quick math so not to keep the customer waiting.

, An Email Sign Up Sheet or notebook left out for future sale notifications will bring more customers back the next time you have a sale.

, Baked goods and crafts are wonderful eye pleasers and usually go over well anywhere. If you don't bake or do crafts recruit others who do. You may work out a percentage deal on all their sales for extra income.

, This helps to cut down on theft as well as help the customers., This will keep them from leaving earlier than planned when nature calls expectantly.

, This can keep a customer shopping longer.

, Place large signs at the end of your street and neighborhood entry with balloons emphasizing the word ""INDOOR"" yard sale. People will come out of curiosity over the word ""INDOOR"".

If you have duplicates of an item that you rarely use, set these aside. You may want to reconsider buying that item in the future.


Check expiration dates. If something is very old, but not outdated, consider donating it. If it has lasted years, you probably aren’t going to use it.;
, Dust your pantry and remove any sticky messes. If you clean your pantry, there will be more of an incentive to keep it clean. Use baking soda and vinegar to clear out any mold, and clean the floor as well.


Use butcher paper to line the shelves, so that your pantry will be easier to clean in the future. Some people like to use wrapping paper for a more cheerful look. Wire shelves in particular can be drab and may need some dressing up. , If your pantry is disorganized, then it is likely that you need separate containers to split it into sections. Find baskets with low or transparent walls, so that you can see what is in them without pulling them out.


Some people suggest using spice racks or lazy susans for easy access to items.
Some things, like flour or nuts, that you may accumulate a lot of, can be put into large jars and labelled with a tag and a sharpie.

, If you have two bags of flour, put them into one container. If you accidentally buy duplicate items, you can simply empty them into the containers. Get square, stackable containers to make the most of the space that you have.

, Gather like items together into groups that you will keep them in once you transfer them all to your shelves. Some people prefer to organize their pantry by meals-- breakfast foods, lunch foods, snacks and beverages.Some people prefer to organize by type. Common groupings are as follows: flour and sugar, canned and jarred goods, grains and beans, boxed items, spices, canned/bottled beverages, potatoes and onions, and paper goods.

, You can usually find cloth baskets at a home goods store. Also be sure to check goodwill or another thrift store.


Don’t be afraid to pack the basket a little bit tight-- you will be removing it from the pantry to grab your items.
This will ensure that instead of reaching to the back of the pantry you will be able to pull out the basket, remove your item, and replace it.

, If you took items out of their original container, label the container. If you put items in an opaque container for grouping, put a tag on the container and write down which grouping is inside. You can also print labels onto stickers for more permanent staples, like flour.Labelling is essential for clarity, especially if many of your family members will be reaching into the pantry as well. If everything is clearly labelled, you will reduce the learning curve and minimize confusion.

, Organize your items by weight and necessity. Heavier items should be the most easily accessible. The same goes for healthy snacks and daily staples, like cereal and bread.


You may need to put things like cookies and other sweets higher. They are less likely to hurt someone if they fall, and stay out of the reach of small children.

, These can be found online, or you can make your own. A pantry inventory list is just a list of your groups, the items in them, and how many there are. As you use and buy items, you update the list, so that you always know how much food you have in the pantry.


You can also buy a chalkboard at a thrift store, or chalkboard paint at a home improvement store. When you are running low on an item, you can write it on the chalkboard.

, You will have more of an incentive to keep your pantry organized if you like the containers that things are kept in. Buy a couple of fun containers whenever you see them out shopping, and add beauty to your pantry.


You can usually find vintage or antique containers at secondhand stores or junk shops.
Brightly colored containers can usually be found at a home goods store or big box store.

, This way you can see their labels, and you will not buy duplicates when you visit the store.


Big box stores sell low wire racks for this purpose, but you can also get creative. Old cigar boxes can be about the right height. If you have many duplicate items, sometimes you can stack them two high.

Decide if you will give volume discounts.,
Dispose of the leftovers.",How to Hold a Used Book Sale," Call up friends, neighbors, teachers, relatives, whoever. Get those books! Prepare a storage space for the books such as your basement or the garage. Get as many books as possible, but be careful not to add any worm-infected books into your stock (discard them in the garbage and get them out of the house immediately). The 'collection' process may take a week or two. Be patient and try your best. Ask someone to help you judge if you have unknowingly been given a valuable antique!;
, Separate the trashed books -- paperbacks without covers, books with broken spines or missing pages. Nobody wants to read these. If they have great illustrations and some artist might be able to use them, make a separate section called ""Damaged Books, Cheap!"" so somebody doesn't accidentally buy a book that will disappoint them later. Paperbacks can be put into paperback recycling, but the glue in the spines of hardcover books makes them not recyclable, so do everyone a favor and throw the damaged ones away before the sale. Trying to sell trashed books makes the rest of the Book Sale look cheap, and makes the good-enough books look worse, not better.

, There are several ways of doing this: by author, subject, or title. Subject is probably the best, since people don't always know the author or title of books they would want. Place children's books in one box, horror in another, romance in yet another, etc. Keep going until every last book has been categorized. Put them into boxes (preferably shallow ones) with the spine facing up so people can read the titles without having to paw through the box and make it messy.

, Time to gather fair prices. Look at the back. What was the original price? Is the book in good condition? Ask yourself questions like that, then mark the book with a sticker with the price written on it and drop it back into its proper box. Or, even easier, post signs saying ""Hardcovers $1, large paperbacks 75 cents, small paperbacks 50 cents (unless priced otherwise).""

, Set out your boxes on the lawn on tables. Make sure to label each box. Set out a special area labeled ""Suggested Reading"" or ""Special Books"" where you will place your best books. Make sure they look nice and semi-new even. Make sure to have a list of price ranges on one of the tables as well.

, Put up signs around the neighborhood with information about the sale. Remember to mention the charity or good cause you are supporting. You will need to include your address and the time and date of the sale. Call friends and neighbors, inviting them to come. You can even make invitations and send them by snail mail or email.

, Dealers will show up early to try to buy up all your best books. Will you let people start before the posted time, or not? If not, set up a line to keep everyone orderly and let them know they can start browsing at the appointed time.

, If you think someone is stealing, nicely ask them, ""Have you paid for those already? Who did you give your money to?"" If they're shady, they will probably give some excuse and leave the books there.

, If someone comes up with an entire box of 20 paperbacks that might cost $15, you could say, ""How about $10 for the whole box?"" and make them very happy. Make sure everyone who is working on the sale knows the policy, and appoint one person as the ""final authority"" in case a customer starts to argue.

, You are likely to have a lot of leftover books. Keep in mind that if nobody wanted them at your sale, they're probably not great books, so don't dump trash onto another organization. At the end of the sale, sort through the books again and recycle (for paperbacks) or throw away (for hardcovers) the books that you can see that nobody will reasonably want. The rest of the books can be donated to a thrift store or library.

Find yard sales in your area.,
Gather supplies before you shop.,
Decide what time of day you want to shop.,
Check out the neighborhood.,
Read yard sale signs carefully.,
Examine the yard sale's presentation.,
Ask the seller if you are looking for a specific item.,
Request prices on unlabeled items before offering a price.,
Look over items carefully before you buy at yard sales.,
Avoid buying potentially hazardous items.,
Prepare to pay around 15 percent of an item's original price at a yard sale.,
Negotiate if you believe an item has been overpriced.,
Provide your name and number if a seller won't negotiate.",How to Buy from Yard Sales,"


Check the classifieds in your local newspaper.
Look for flyers at grocery stores, churches, and other areas with community billboards.
Browse websites with event or for-sale listings in your community.
Keep an eye out for yard sale signs while driving on the weekends.;
,


Make sure you have adequate cash in small bills. Most sellers at yard and garage sales will not accept personal checks, and the items you're interested in may sell while you're gone if you have to make a trip to the ATM.
Bring a hat and sunglasses to protect your face from the sun if it's a warm day and you plan to go to multiple yard sales.
Consider taking a tape measure with you if you are looking for furniture. Measure areas in your residence where you might want to place new furniture and record them in a small notebook that you can bring with you for reference while shopping.
Keep hand sanitizer or cleansing wipes in your vehicle or purse, fanny pack, or pocket. You may accidentally touch dirty or unsanitary items at some yard sales.

,


Plan to arrive at the sale's start time for the largest selection. Be aware sellers may be less likely to negotiate early in the day.
Choose a later arrival time if you want to get the lowest prices. Sellers are often willing to sell items for much lower prices towards the end of a sale so that they have fewer items to put away or donate.

, Although you never know what you might find at a yard sale, you can draw conclusions about what types of items might be available based on the neighborhood.


Look for swing sets, children's toys or bikes in yards. These indicate there may be many families in the neighborhood and a better chance that you will find toys, baby items, and children's clothing.
Focus on established neighborhoods with retirees if you are looking primarily for collectibles or antiques.

,


Make sure there is a date and time listed on the sign. People often leave up old yard and garage sale signs for days, or even weeks, after the sale is over.
Look at the condition of the balloons if the seller has tied them to the yard sale sign. Full balloons indicate an ongoing or recent sale, but droopy, under-filled, wrinkly balloons can be a sign that the sale is no longer current.

, Sellers who take the time to organize their items and whose merchandise is clean are more likely to have quality items that are well-maintained.

, This will save you time and allow you to stop at more sales on the same day.

, You will often get a better price if you wait to see what the seller thinks the item is worth than if you offer first.

, Sellers offer items as is and usually will not take a return.


Check battery compartments for corroded batteries.
Ask if you can plug in any electrical appliances to make sure they function correctly.
Run your finger around the rims of dishware and glasses to check for chips and cracks.

,


Use caution when purchasing baby items as these have often been recalled. Do not buy a used car seat as you have no way of knowing whether the seat was involved in an accident, even if you know the model was not recalled or expired. Older cribs often have slats that are spaced too far apart.
Leave used bike or motorcycle helmets on the table. Helmets may look fine on the outside, but you can't know if they were involved in an accident that caused internal damage.
Consider whether you want to risk bringing pests home with you before buying a used mattress. Used mattresses can hold dust mites, bed bugs or even mold spores.
Check the plugs on hairdryers. The plain 2-prong plugs used on hairdryers prior to 1991 in the United States don't properly protect the user from accidental water immersion.

, Prices are usually comparable to those you see in thrift stores.

, Most sellers are open to offers, and they will let you know if they think a price is too low.

, The seller can call you after the sale if the item doesn't sell and the seller is willing to sell the item for less.

Check to see what junk you already have around.,
Expand your junk supply.,
Choose what junk to take on a given day.,
Wake up really early the day of the flea market.,
Pay for your selling area.

,
Prepare for the onslaught.,
Sell your wares.,
Haggle and deal.,
Use your profit to invest in more junk.",How to Harvest Junk and Sell It at the Flea Market," Junk can come from a number of sources. Try finding things that you yourself no longer have any use for. Anything will do; it is amazing what people will buy. Look around. Would anything be worth more to you in the form of cold hard cash? If the answer is yes, put these things aside. Don't be too concerned with what the items are. If they fit in a box and are not complete trash, by the end of the day you may be able to recover a dollar or two.;
, After you rummage through everything you own for anything you can part with, look further. A large supply of items is necessary for any junk selling endeavor. This part is largely up to the individual.


Offer to help your friends and relatives clean out their garages for them in exchange for some boxes of their junk.
Visit garage sales late in the day. Offer low prices for junk in quantity.
Check local dumpsters or shop on the curbside during extra trash day in your town.

, You should now have a pretty good sized collection. Depending on the amount of junk you have you can pick and choose what you want to take. Writing the contents of each box on the outside will make this step easier. Again, it's hard to determine what kind of junk people will be in the mood to buy so throw as many boxes as you can in your transportation and strap it all down. It is best to do this the day before as hopefully you will have quite a bit of stuff.

, Try to be at the market by 5:30 am, or an hour or two before the flea market opens. More than likely there will be a line of trucks that all have the same lots of stuff strapped to them.

,, As soon as you park and begin to unload your junk, a crowd will inevitably swarm around you of people trying to buy your stuff for really cheap before you've even set up shop. They will grab at your stuff like crazy people and yell out numbers while manhandling all your boxes. They may be trying to stun you into selling them really good stuff for cheap. It is up to you how you use this whirlwind. You may make a lot of sales during this initial frenzy, but be wary of getting flustered and saying yes to too low a price. Also, watch for people stealing things when your back is turned. It will help to have a partner so that one person can do business while the other unloads.

, Things will even out as people arrive throughout the day.

, Selling junk is great because you never really price anything until someone asks, you might have an idea, but it's all relative. Give discounts for buying more things. Fill a box with toys and sell handfuls or bag-fulls for a dollar each. Barter with people. The key to selling junk is quantity over quality and one dollar is better than no dollars.

, If you have a goodwill clearance center nearby, try there. There will be a crowd and you might have to fight for the good stuff but you can get a cartload of stuff for cheap. If you buy junk to sell, make sure that you know about what price you can get selling it. Keep your purchase price low.

Gather needed supplies.,
Measure your cabinet shelves.,
Calculate the amount of liner you’ll need.,
Decide on color, pattern, and material.,
Remove all food and dishes from your cabinets.,
Clean the interior with all-purpose cleaner or a vinegar solution.,
Let the shelves air dry.,
Measure the liner material.,
Cut the liner material.,
Place the liner on the shelf and smooth it out.,
Repeat these actions for each shelf in your kitchen cabinets.",How to Line Kitchen Shelves," You’ll need a regular ruler and a quilting ruler to properly take measurements, as well as a notepad and writing utensil for writing them down. Get a pair of scissors or a rotary cutter to cut the liner. Some other supplies you need are: shelf liner, a cleaning cloth, all-purpose cleaner or vinegar, a cutting mat, and a squeegee., Use the regular ruler to measure the length and width of a shelf that you plan on lining. Make sure to write down these measurements in a notebook., Multiply the length by the width measurement. Take that number and multiply it by the number of shelves you have. This will tell you approximately how much liner you need to buy.


If your shelves measure 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) by 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) and you have 8 shelves in your kitchen that you want to line, you’ll multiply 10 in (25.4 cm) x 5 in (12.7 cm) = 50 in (127 cm) and then 50 in (127 cm) x 8 = 400 in (1,016 cm). In this example, you’d need to buy at least 400 square inches (1,016 cm) of liner.

, Scan the aisle of a home improvement store to find patterns and colors that you like, whether it’s bright red polka dots or solid black. Contact paper is one of the more popular liner material options because it’s decorative on one side and has an adhesive on the other. You can also choose a non-slip material such as sponge or ribbed plastic to avoid issues in the future when you remove the liner., Before lining your cabinet shelves, you’ll need to empty them out completely. Take out all of your non-perishable bottles, cans, and boxes of food as well as all dishes and cooking utensils. Put these items on a nearby flat surface that’s out of the way, such as your kitchen table.

, Soak a clean cloth in either all-purpose cleaner or vinegar diluted by water and wring out the cloth well. Wipe down the interior of your cabinets with the cloth. Use a toothbrush to scrub the edges, corners, and cracks., Keep the cabinet doors open for a half hour or so after you’ve cleaned them so that they can dry out naturally. Touch the shelves after this amount of time has gone by to check that they’re fully dry., Use the quilting ruler to measure your liner to fit the measurements of the shelves that you wrote down earlier. Mark the top and bottom of the paper with a pencil or pen., Use scissors or place a cutting mat underneath the liner and then cut it with a rotary cutter. Use the quilting ruler as a guide while you’re cutting the liner. Repeat this process to create as many pieces of liner as there are shelves., Take the backing off of your contact liner paper and carefully place it on your shelf. Go over the liner with a squeegee to eliminate any bubbles or wrinkles.Put a small blob of reusable mounting putty in each corner of the cabinet before placing in spongy or plastic liner to secure it., One by one, take the pre-cut pieces of liner, place them in each shelf space, and smooth them out until all of your shelves are lined."
"
Assess what you consider to be valuable and less valuable items.,
Arrange clothing to show its value clearly.,
Keep baby gear in one place.,
Keep children's toys, games and items separate and somewhere that children won't be likely to bump into other sale items.,
Make the furniture stand out.,
Keep the outdoor living and outdoor landscaping or cleaning equipment in one place.,
Place household items like curtains, vacuum cleaners, etc.,
Be prepared to explain the value of quality items in your garage sale.",How to Sell Quality Items in a Garage Sale," If the items are really valuable, such as gold jewelery, consider selling them online or through a trusted broker rather than leaving open the possibility of theft during a busy garage sale. If you do intend to sell very valuable items through the garage sale still, have one person completely responsible for selling those items only and make sure that they know to keep an eye on the objects at all times or to remove them or have someone else stand in if they need to leave for a moment. You will be too busy supervising the whole garage sale to be watching very valuable items and everything else otherwise.


Break down the ""values"" within those things you consider to be valuable. While gold jewelry will definitely be very valuable, your designer clothes may be valuable to you because you spent a lot on them but that doesn't necessarily mean that this value will be realized by bargain-hunters wanting to pay next-to-nothing. Always consider the other selling options if you have items like clothes that may not get a good price back at a garage sale or be prepared to make it very clear why you're standing your ground on higher prices for certain items that buyers would usually expect to pay less for.
Place antiques and valuables worth lots of money in a safe spot that you can keep an eye on. While these are items are the ones that will gain you lots more cash, they are also the most vulnerable.;
, Clothing can sometimes be a hard sell at garage sales because people feel exposed looking through their neighbors' clothes or buyers from elsewhere simply feel uncomfortable about not being able to tell if items will fit or not. Make it easier for everyone by doing the following:


Rig up a changing area that provides absolute privacy.
If items of clothing need explanation, pin Post-It note explanations to the clothes to save people having to ask.
Make the prices clear, from a bag of baby's clothes for $1.00 to $100.00 for the Givenchy gown.
However you plan to price, always leave haggle room because that's what happens at garage sales.
Put the clothes in a section of their own. This will ensure that it is not so crowded when people are looking through them. If you can, it really helps to hang them on racks or provide them with a single table for sorting through.
Put the shoes together. People can go and look for their size without making a big mess under the clothes. Also, if you still have the original shoe boxes, make use of those to keep the pairs together.
If you are allowing your customers to try the shoes on, make sure there are a couple chairs and places to sit for them to try them on.

, Only some people will be interested in baby gear but they're likely to be very interested, so make it very easy for them to look. For starters, keep all the quality items in one area and be realistic about items with stains, breaks, cracks, etc. and either recycle those things or bag them together for next-to-nothing. For the good remaining items, put the toys, baby strollers, and other baby items together in an easy-to-access place. If your customer asks where the baby stuff is, just point them in the direction of this section.


If you have a baby creche fence, put it up with a blanket on the ground and some toys to allow new parents to put wandering babies in there while they rummage. Make a sign to make it clear that you're happy for parents to ""park their babies"" there while they browse (at the parent's risk of course).

, Don't expect to get a lot for most toys and if you have antique ones, keep them in the antiques area rather than with the general toys and games.And be sure that all of the toys toys and games that you trying to sell still look presentable because nobody would want to buy a tatty item


Don't put out board games unless you are certain all the pieces are there, because people won't buy them with the pieces gone (they do ask or check). Add a Post-It note confirming that all the pieces are intact.

, People love furniture at garage sales, especially quality furniture and it will fly out of your yard if you display it properly. Put all the good quality furniture as close as possible to the front or driveway. This will mean people won't have to carry it very far and it also attracts people who are simply cruising by wondering whether or not your garage sale is worth stopping for.


Try to fix rips, tears, or holes in furniture to encourage purchasing and to get a better price.
If you have a trolley or something else to help get furniture to cars, or you're even willing to deliver, make this clear by adding a sign and placing it near the furniture.

, Put the things that belong outside like lawn mowers, statues, etc., together, perhaps on the lawn.


Have keys, tools, etc. ready in case someone wants to test things out and have someone in the family ready to stand by in case they ride away on your ride-on mower...
Have electricity cords in place for testing any electrical appliances.

, together. Avoid placing out soiled or destroyed items; things such as stained mattresses will reduce the sense of overall quality, not just for the items they're sitting near. If you need a dumpster or skip bin to get rid of stuff that really doesn't deserve to be sold, arrange for this to arrive after the garage sale so that you can get rid of anything else you don't wish to recycle or donate.


Put out ""free"" boxes of things that are really not worth selling but still seem like they could be of use to someone with handy person skills. Someone might be keen to take a box to rummage through at home.

, Don't expect people to know just by looking – although equally, do expect some to know and hope that you don't realize! Through the use of signs, conversations and good positioning of quality items, you can increase the chances of selling your quality garage sale items for more money than just bargain prices because people will be aware of the value and understand that you are too. When explaining why items are quality, be sure to focus on designer/labels, craftsmanship, age, amount of use, rarity, utility, price comparisons with new items, etc.

It can be hard to part with things, even if you never use them. If you haven't used something for over a year, it's a good sign you won't miss it.Sell anything you don't want or use anymore like clothes that don't fit you, dishes that you never use, outdated game systems, shoes, crafts that you've made, picture frames, and other knickknacks.
People will buy just about anything. While there are certain hot sellers like children’s toys, old tools, books, antiques, and simple kitchen items, don’t be afraid to try to sell things that you can’t imagine anyone buying. The worst case scenario is that it doesn't sell and you'll have to dispose of it.
Make sure merchandise is fairly clean and not broken, especially to prevent an item from injuring someone. However, you can try and put out broken stuff that is safe to handle. You might be surprised. Many people will buy broken hardware items, kinked hoses, old doors, and other seemingly undesirable items. You may want to consider putting these out for free.;
, Record each item you plan to see on a sheet of paper as you identify it for sale. Many people skip this step, but a master list of your wares can make your sale run much more smoothly.


Include the price of each you item in your inventory. Price tags have a strange way of getting lost at garage sales, and it’s hard to come up with a fair price on the spot, especially if you've got other people asking you questions or you're helping out someone else with their garage sale.
The more items you're trying to sell, the more important it is to tabulate your wares.
A list can help you keep track of your items to look out for thieves who might try to steal.

, Review your completed inventory sheet and assign a reasonable price to each item.


If you really just want to get rid of an old knickknack, price it cheaply. For items that are more valuable, a general rule is to price it at a quarter of what you paid for it initially.
You can go higher on certain items, such as those that are nearly new, collectibles, or valuable antiques.Remember that the main purpose of a yard sale is to get rid of your old stuff and not necessarily to make a huge profit. Garage sale shoppers are looking for bargains. If you don’t want to have to pack everything back into your house at the end of the day, then you've got to give people the low prices they’re looking for. Some people won't pay more than 10% of the retail price when they go to garage sales. Price your merchandise to sell, and you’ll make money.
If you aren't set on a definite price for an item, use the phrase ""Make an Offer"" or write it on the price tag. Bear in mind that some customers may try to low-ball you with ludicrously low prices. You can also say, for instance, ""$40 or best offer"" if you want to suggest a certain base price.
Prices need not be set in stone. You may want to change the price of a given item depending on the crowd and how much they need the item.

, Attach a clearly written price label to each item. This will protect you from a constant barrage of price inquiries and clear up confusion regarding the price of an item.


Using brightly coloured labels will make it easier for your customers to find the price and will save you time on the day of the sale.
You can purchase adhesive labels, or you can use a “sticker gun.” If you don't have sticker labels, you can also use small pieces of masking tape, or make your own stickers.
If you have a lot of similar items that are all the same price like books, CDs, cassettes or VHS tapes, put them all in one box and label the box with the price for each. For example, a box of books might have the label, ""$0.50 per book"". Customers will sift through the box if they're interested, and some collectors may offer you a bulk price for the entire box.

, Garage sale-goers tend to prefer larger sales. If there looks like there is not a lot to choose from, people may not even get out of the car. As well, attracting serious garage sale-goers will attracts casually passing by who are wondering why there are so many people at a sale.


Ask your friends, family, and neighbours to contribute their items. You may know people who want to sell a few of their own items, but who are not prepared to set up a garage sale. If they do want to sell their items, avoid a logistical hassle later on by making sure your friends, family, or neighbours have done inventory on their own items. They should tell you exactly what they're giving to you to sell, as well as what it's worth.
Haggling on friends' items should only be done with their permission. If a customer isn't willing to compromise on their low-ball offer, say, ""It's not mine. I'm selling this for a friend, so I have to stick with their price for you and the other buyers"".

, Check with your city or homeowner's association to find out if you need a permit to have a garage sale.


Many cities place restrictions on garage sales, dictating where you can place advertisement signs, when you can sell, and how often you can hold a sale. These serve to distinguish sellers who are conducting retail within a residential zone and from full-time commercial operations.
It's better to take the time to do your research, and to pay the the small fee for a permit than to risk losing more money in fines.

, This means having many families and neighbours holding garage sales at the same time as you. Each family or house will attract their own buyers who might visit other homes and their sales that are happening at the same time. Multi-family garage sales are often more successful than single family garage sales.

If you mix items in a multi-family sale, colour-code your price tags or clearly mark the items as yours so that your cashier will know who should get the money for each item.
Let the other families know or the cashier which items are available for haggling and which are not, especially if all your items are mixed together.

, A two-day garage sale is usually enough to sell out most of your stock, and summer weekends—especially Fridays and Saturdays—are the best times. Choose a day when a lot of potential buyers will be out and about.


Most yard sales start early in the morning as early as 8 a.m. and can end late into the evening. Plan to set aside an entire day. For example, hold a sale from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m.
Check the local weather forecast, and try to avoid rain, snow, or extra chilly days. Warm days usually bring people out of their homes more.
Be careful about scheduling your sale during special events and holidays, as many potential customers will have something more urgent to do than drive around picking through garage sales.
Some streets and neighbourhoods will have ""Annual Garage/Yard Sale"" days. These are your opportune moments. On these days, everyone is out looking for yard sales in your area. Notices about these days may appear in the mail.
Avoid holding a sale when there is road construction occurring along the main route to your sale location. Construction may keep away potential customers who are either avoiding the traffic or in a bad mood from the traffic.

, If you’re just having a single-family sale, your location is pretty much set: hold the sale in front of your house in your yard, your driveway, or an open garage.


If you’re having a multifamily or charity sale, be sure to pick a spot that is large enough for everybody’s wares, and choose a location that is easy to find and to get to. It should preferably be at a location nearby like a park or parking lot., You don't need to advertise ahead of time, but it may dramatically increase your customer traffic.


Your local newspaper may offer a deal on ads for garage sales. If your sale is happening on Friday, you should have an ad in the paper by Wednesday or just on Thursday. You also want to make sure to get your ad into the paper before the deadline, which could be several days in advance before you plan to show the ad in the paperAdvertise in free weekly community shopping papers and on community bulletin boards in grocery stores and laundromats. Spread the word through your local neighbourhood grapevine.
Don’t overlook the internet. There are many sites that allow you to place free advertisements for free.Post to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms. Invite your network to peruse your wares.

, Give the date and time of the sale, the location and, if you have room, list some items for sale.


The signs can be as simple as ""Garage Sale: 8 a.m. - 2 p.m on Saturday at 1515 Whiskery Way"", or ""Yard Sale Saturday: 1515 Whiskery Way"" with an arrow pointing down the street toward your house.
Try to find a balance of information that's useful, fun, and easy to read from a moving vehicle. Make sure that the phrase ""Garage Sale"" or ""Yard Sale"" is prominent.
Use plain, bold colours and simple lettering when conveying your garage sale's information.
Use a sturdy material for your garage sale signs, like a couple of layers of poster board or corrugated cardboard, so that the wind won't bend it.

, Hang your signs a few days before the sale in places where they will be noticed by many passersby. You can tape signs to telephone poles, lamp posts, trees, and stop-sign poles.


Put a sign at the entrance to your neighbourhood, or in front of your house.
If you live near a major road, hang the signs on telephone poles or street signs at an intersection on that road. Intersections with stop signs or traffic signals are particularly good places to post a poster.
In case, check your municipality's or homeowners association's rules regarding signs.

, Garage sale customers are more likely to buy (and to buy at higher prices) if it looks like the merchandise came from a good home with owners that care for their things. They’re also more likely to feel comfortable stopping and browsing if your sale space is attractive and clean. Presentation is key.


Mow the lawn, rake the leaves, and open up space to display the items you're selling.
Make sure that customers have plenty of parking space. Consider moving any cars that are usually parked in front of your house. You might need to move them to another street or ask a neighbour if you can park your car in front of their house or in their driveway.

, You can use tables and bookshelves from your house to display your items, Or you can rent folding tables if you don't have enough.


While customers do see and buy items that are on the ground, it's important to display small items on tables. This protect them from foot traffic and people can easily inspect them.
If you're using furniture from your home to display your wares, make sure that this not-for-sale furniture isn't mistaken for something that's up for grabs. Consider draping a sheet or a tablecloth over tables to hide the furniture itself but preserve the display space.

, Customers may not have exact change on hand, and your ability to make change could be the difference between a sale and a walkaway.


Unless you've got a lot of change at home, chances are that you’ll need to visit the bank the day before the sale. Pick up a few rolls of coins and be sure to keep plenty of small bills on hand.
You’re going to be making change for a lot of customers, so consider using a fanny pack or an apron to organize your money. Many fanny packs have two pockets: you can keep the bills in the large compartment, and the coins in the smaller compartment.
Keep large bills in the house until they're needed. You don't have to drop them or lose large amounts of money incase your money is stolen.
If you own a smartphone or a tablet, consider setting up a credit card swipe. This is a professional touch, and it may entice customers to spend more than the hard cash they have on hand. This is especially handy for ""big ticket items"" like furniture, bikes, instruments, and rare antiques.

, Get up early so that you’ll have plenty of time to arrange your vending area. The morning will mainly be used to set up your display items, move furniture and cars.


Consider enlisting a few early-rising friends or family members to help you set everything up more quickly.
Make a game plan the night before. You should know where your tables will go, where you're putting various goods, how much you're charging for each item, and where you're going to put the money. If your sale is popular, everything will start to happen rather quickly, so be prepared.
Seasoned garage sale customers often arrive before the posted times to get a first crack at the premium merchandise, and these customers come ready to buy. Make sure you have everything ready an hour or two before your advertised start time.
Don't set up the night before, even if you live in a safe neighbourhood. You never know who walks the streets at night. Furthermore, your wares could grow damp from dew or morning mist, making them harder to sell.
To avoid people coming before you're ready to open, wait to put up signs around the neighbourhood until you have everything out and you're ready to sell. Put the signs closest to your house up last. The early birds (usually re-sellers) can be distracting, even pushy, while you are busy setting up.

, Many potential customers will drive by before they stop, and you want your sale to look intriguing and well-organized so that they stop.


Take things out of the boxes in which you gathered them, so that people driving by will see your goods instead of a bunch of cardboard boxes.
Place premium items (nearly-new merchandise, antiques, large tools, etc.) close to the street to attract interest.
Arrange your tables so items are neatly displayed with enough room between items to allow people to comfortably inspect them.
Instead of folding clothes on tables, hang them from a clothesline strung from trees or from your garage ceiling near the door. Hanging clothes are easier to look through, and you won’t have to worry about refolding them on the table.
Helium balloons are an inexpensive way to draw attention to your sale. Hang them on your tables or at the end of your street.

, Add more interest to your sale by offering craft items, home baked goods, or beverages.


Having coffee or donuts available encourages some to stick around and buy more.
People tend to attract people. People will often pass up a garage sale if no one is there.

, Running a garage sale is a lot like working at a retail establishment, so bring out the salesperson within you.


Greet your customers with a friendly smile as they arrive.
Ask customers if there is anything you can help them with. Then let them browse if they say no. You want people to feel comfortable at your sale and not like they are being watched or judged.
Offer package deals (if a person buys a blender, for example, why shouldn’t they buy those margarita glasses as well?), and reward big buyers with bulk discounts. Don’t just hope that your goods sell themselves.

, Always have several people at the sale for the sake of convenience and security. You can ask your family members or friends to help out and repay them with a small fee or treat them to a meal afterwards.Bathroom breaks are made easier with extra help. When you need one, you can keep the sale running smoothly.
Never leave the sale unattended for more than a few moments at a time and avoid leaving the sale under the watch of small children., As your sale progresses, things will unavoidably get disheveled, disorganized, and possibly even broken. If you want to sell as much as possible, you should try to keep things looking nice.

Straighten items as you walk by them and while you speak to customers.
Move items around as you sell them, putting forward new and premium items in the front.

, Even though your prices are clearly marked, some people will try to haggle. Play along; haggling can be a fun experience, and you’ll likely make a lot more sales if you’re willing to reward these bargain hunters.


Don’t be afraid to decline an offer, but consider all offers. After all, you’re trying to get rid of this stuff.
Be sure not to drop your prices too early in the day. If you've successfully organized your garage sale, you should bring in plenty of customers that are willing to pay the full price.
If you're having a multi-family sale, haggling on friends' items should only be done with their permission. If a customer isn't willing to compromise on their low-ball offer, say, ""It's not mine. I'm selling this for a friend, so I have to stick with their price for you and the other buyers"".

, If you still have items left over during the final scheduled hours of your sale, then go ahead and slash prices. Some deals you can offer:


Buy-one-get-one deals.
Bulk discounts.
Two for the price of one.
Half priced items after a certain time.

, You never know when someone's going to come across your sale, even if traffic has died down.


This is especially relevant if you've set a specific window for your garage sale, such as 9am to 3pm, and even more so if you've posted the times for the sale online or in the paper. You may continue to get occasional customers all the way up to the end of the sale.
If you wait until after closing time before you start to pack up, you may find that some stragglers will come by. Sometimes people will come by to offer you a set dollar amount for the entire load!

, Don't just throw perfectly-good items into the landfill--try to find someone who needs the things that you don't.


You can post ads online or posters around your neighbourhood advertising the things you will be giving away.
You can tell your friends, family, and neighbours about the items you will be giving away, asking them if any of them are in need.
Check with local charities and thrift stores. Some will pick up items that you don't sell and put them to good use.

, Try to take down the signs as soon as possible to help keep your neighbourhood and community clean. Nobody likes to see old, faded, and sagging signs taped up to poles.


Ask a friend or family member to take down signs right after closing time so you can continue to sell or clean up.
If your address is written on a sign, and you leave it up in your neighborhood for weeks after the sale, everyone will know where you live. Furthermore, you might continue to get prospective customers showing up at random times.

, A garage sale brings all kinds of people, including shoplifters.


Keep your wares in plain sight and avoid leaving the sale unattended for more than a few moments at a time.
Consider asking friends or neighbours to help you run the sale so that there's always someone watching over the customers. The more eyes you have on your side, the more likely you'll be to catch shoplifters in the act.
As long as people know you’re watching, you probably won’t run into much trouble, but if somebody does steal a small item, it’s probably not worth confronting them. Use your best judgment. If the thief is a neighbourhood kid, you might consider confronting him and telling his parents. If the thief is a surly, dangerous-looking stranger, you may want to let them take the item without a struggle.
If you suspect that someone has stolen something valuable, confront them tactfully and call the police if necessary, but do not attempt to detain them.

, During your sale, lock all doors into the house. This includes back doors, front doors, and side doors. As well, windows and close screen doors.


There may be a thief, or thieves working together, looking for a five-finger-discount on the valuables inside your home that you aren't selling.
Crowds bring distraction. It's important to place yourself and your items in a place where you can easily see everything.

, Anybody can come up to it and steal the money you've made, so make sure that someone is attending it at all times. Or keep it close to you in a closed bag or fanny pack.


Only keep a reasonable amount of money in your cash box or with you at a time. That way, if somebody does steal it, they’re not getting too much.
Consider buying a counterfeit pen--a marker that can detect counterfeit bills. If someone offers you a hundred-dollar bill, you'll want to be able to tell whether it's real.

, The larger your garage sale, the longer people will stay; the longer people stay, the more likely it is that they'll need to use the restroom.


Some customers may ask to use your home restroom. You are under no obligation to let anyone into your house, even to use the restroom, but you might consider making exceptions for small children or the elderly.
If someone really needs to go to the bathroom, direct them to the nearest public building.

Take everything out of your pantry, or the cabinet or shelves you use as a pantry.,
Clean your pantry thoroughly, from the light fittings to the shelves and the floor.

,
Sort all the things you have taken out according to categories (baking stuff, savoury cans, fruit cans, pasta...).

,
Discard anything that is past its sell-by date.,
Group items in a way that is logical to you.,
Think of what you want to put where.,
Refill flour, sugar and salt into see-through glass or plastic containers.",How to Declutter a Pantry,";
,,, Also discard all things that have been opened a long time ago, all spices that don't smell anymore, and everything you bought years ago but have never used.

, Baking stuff with baking stuff, savoury cans together, sweet cans together, breakfast cereal together, toilet paper, spare soap and toothpaste together and so on.

, Again, go with what is logical to you. If you bake often, the baking stuff can go into a more prominent place then if you hardly ever bake. You can also put all the basic baking ingredients into a wire basket, this will make baking quicker and simpler.

, This way you avoid having to wipe up the flour every time you open the paper bag. It makes it also easier to see how much you have left. But don't forget to label the storage canister.


One good way of doing that is to paint a strip of blackboard paint on it. Now you can wipe off and change the labelling whenever you put something different into the container. Storing food stuff in glass or plastic containers also discourages mice and bugs.

Use proper storage methods to prevent freezer burn.",How to Arrange Refrigerator Shelves," Fruit keeps best when it isn't exposed to too much moisture. Most refrigerators have a special drawer that has the lower humidity than the other shelves and drawers. Sometimes it's labeled ""low humidity,"" and other times it's labeled ""crisper."" This is where you should store your fruit, from apples to bananas to grapes.If you're planning on eating fruit quickly, however, you may want to store it on the top shelf. Fresh berries, for example, will go bad faster than apples, so you might not want to store them in the crisper. Store the carton on the middle or top shelf, where you'll see it and reach for it before they start to shrivel.
Produce stored in the crisper may be stored either loose or in open plastic bags. Don't store fruit in tightly-sealed plastic bags, since this can cause many types of fruit to rot more quickly.;
, Most vegetables benefit from a little extra moisture - hence the sprinklers you see wetting down the produce section in the grocery store. Most refrigerators have a drawer that is labeled ""high humidity,"" usually right next to the low humidity drawer. Store your whole vegetables there either loose or in open plastic bags to keep them fresh.


If you're storing salad or cut vegetables, however, they'll go bad more quickly than vegetables that remain whole. For this reason, you should store them on the middle or top shelf and so you'll see them and use them quickly.
To help vegetables keep longer, don't wash them before storage. Getting vegetables wet increases the chance that bacteria will grow and they'll begin to rot. Humidity is good, but you don't want the vegetables to be sitting in water. If you do need to wash them, dry them completely before storing.

, Whether you need to store chicken breasts, steak, sausage, or turkey, it should go in the coldest part of the refrigerator. In most cases, that's at the back of the bottom shelf, although some refrigerators have a designated meat drawer. If you store meat on the top shelf, it's likely to go bad more quickly.Make sure your meat is kept separate from the rest of the items in your refrigerator. It should be wrapped in plastic and stored as low as possible, so that if any juices escape other items won't get dripped on and contaminated.
Clean the area where you store meat more often than you clean the rest of the refrigerator.

, Many people store milk and eggs on the door of the refrigerator for easy access. However, the door is the warmest part of the refrigerator, so storing them there will cause them to lose freshness faster. Store your milk and eggs on the bottom shelf, or whichever shelf is coldest in your refrigerator.Unless you go through eggs quite quickly, it's better to store them in their original carton instead of transferring them to the egg containers on the inside of the door.
Cream, buttermilk, yogurt, and similar products should also be kept on the cold shelf.

, If you have cold cuts from the deli, cream cheese, and other types of cheese, put them in the shallow meat drawer, which usually slides out from the middle or top shelf. This is also a good place to store bacon, hot dogs and other preserved meats. It's slightly cooler than the rest of the refrigerator, though not as cold as the back of the bottom shelf. Clean this drawer as regularly as you clean your other meat storage spot.

, Condiments usually contain a lot of salt, vinegar and other preservatives that prevent them from going bad quickly, so it's fine to store them in the warmest part of the refrigerator: the door. Drinks also tend to keep longer than food. Designate the bottom shelf for the larger, heavier items, like orange juice, beer or soda. Put sweet condiments like jams, jellies and syrups on another shelf, and save the savory condiments like mustard and soy sauce for the last shelf.


Even though butter is a dairy product, it's fine to store it in the butter compartment on the door. Butter doesn't need to be kept as cold as milk.
If you're a condiment lover, it can be easy to let your condiment area get pretty messy with expired food. Go through the area regularly and toss out anything that's expired or mostly used up.

, Cooked food is fine to keep on the top or middle shelf. Use the the top and middle shelves to store any items that don't need to be kept especially cold: cooked baby food, pizza, dips and sauces, tortillas, and so on.The top or middle shelf might also be the right place to keep a pitcher of water, medicine you need to keep cold, and other items that need to be cool, but won't easily spoil.

, Using baskets to organize your food is a great way to keep everything separate and accessible. You can buy baskets to store on your shelves and designate each basket for a different type of food. Label the baskets so you know what goes there. For example, if you buy a lot of cheese, you could have a separate basket just for cheeses.


Baskets sized especially to fit in the door shelves are also available. Using baskets is a helpful way to keep condiments from getting too messy. When something spills, you can just remove the basket and clean it out.

, This trick is so useful, it's a wonder refrigerators don't come with lazy Susans already installed. Get a plastic lazy Susan (a circular spinning shelf) to put on the middle or top shelf of your refrigerator. Place items you're in danger of forgetting about, like leftovers, on the lazy Susan. This eliminates the common scenario of discovering months-old leftovers in the back of the fridge from time to time.


It's also a good way to make sure you use up salad items, cut vegetables, fruit, and other items that tend to go bad quickly. Consider designating one lazy Susan for items you want to use right away.

, Using shelf liners protects your food from getting contaminated and makes cleanup much easier. If you need to store meat on a shelf above your produce drawer, for example, having a plastic liner under the meat will prevent your produce from getting dripped on. Every week or two, just take out the liners and change them out for fresh ones.

, Don't let expired items or moldy leftovers hang around and clog up your fridge. You'll end up having to squeeze fresh items in wherever they'll fit, which is a recipe for forgetting what you have on hand. Every week or so, go through your refrigerator and get rid of anything you're not going to use., Use your refrigerator to chill perishable items, and keep things like bottled water, cans of soda, extra condiments and other non-perishables in your pantry instead. This will make more room for the items that actually need to stay cold. Transfer your nonperishable to the refrigerator as you need them.

, If you're one of those industrious people who make a big casserole or batch of soup in order to freeze portions for later meals, make sure you label everything with the name and date. That way your food won't end up as a nameless, freezer-burned bag that you can't remember putting there several months ago. Keeping your freezer organized with labeled items will help you actually use up all the items you store there., Make sure you know how long everything will keep in your freezer, then put the items that store longest in the back or bottom of your freezer. Items that need to be used more quickly should be kept toward the front, so you'll see them and use them.


For example, frozen vegetables, fruit, meat and so on may keep for months or longer, so should be stored behind other items. This will prevent them from getting warmed up every time you open the freezer.
Ice cream, popsicles, ice cube trays, and other items that you use up more quickly should stay near the front of the freezer.

, Frozen items don't tend to spoil, but freezer burn can still ruin their taste and texture, rendering them inedible. In addition to organizing your freezer so that the items that keep the longest are in the back, you should also use good freezer storage methods to protect the food from exposure to air and moisture. Use air-tight freezer bags or bins to store all items. Double-bag items that need to stay in the freezer for more than a few weeks.


Storing items in flimsy sandwich bags doesn't protect them from getting freezer burn. Use thick freezer-safe bags instead.

Choose a cabinet that everyone uses on a regular basis.,
Take specific measurements of the cabinet door.,
Determine the type of material you’ll need.",How to Create a Cabinet Message Board1," From the pantry cabinet to the dinner plate or drink glass shelf, identify a cabinet door that is often used.


Consider the amount of space you will need. Do you simply want an area to write down phone messages or do you need more room so you can post everyone’s schedule or calendar?;
, If you’d like to include a pouch or box area to hold paperwork or pens, take into consideration the depth you have between the door and the inner shelving. If a pocket is must and space is tight you may need to consider another area.


Plan how much material you’ll need for the entire board, especially if you plan to create something with two (or three) different types of material. For example, if you are doing a dry erase and cork board, measure the amount of space you’ll need for the dry erase portion as compared to the cork portion.






Pencil sketch the board on the back of the cabinet so you can see how it will look. This will give you a better idea if you should make one area of the board bigger than the other (perhaps you’ll need more room for the dry erase as compared to the cork).







, The way you plan to use the message board will dictate the type of material you’ll need. For simple message posting, cork or metal might work (for magnets and or thumbtacks) or if you think you may need to create pockets to hold piece of information you may want to consider creating a board that has wooden or canvas pouches to hold items."
"
Hit both the home improvement and craft store to find the right supplies.,
Cut out materials to fit the space.,
Create your board on the baseboard if you are working with different materials.,
Clean the back of the baseboard or message board using clean water and a towel.,
Spray the back of the board with spray adhesive or apply double sided tape.,
Assemble the cabinet to the hinges.

,
You can now leave a message!

",How to Create a Cabinet Message Board2," Have measurements on hand to ensure you obtain the right amount of material, plus the right tools to create the board.


If you are creating a board containing two or three different types of materials you’ll want to purchase one large board to act as the base. You’ll mount your other materials to this board and then mount the large board to the cabinet. Look for material that is lightweight but durable to act as your base board.
Don’t forget to include the mounting material. Often spray adhesive will do the trick or even heavy duty double sided tape. Take into consideration that mounting a board on the back of your cabinet may damage the wood or material should you ever want to remove it.
Pick up ancillary items such as thumb tacks, dry erase pens, magnets etc. to complete the board.

, Using a jigsaw or electric handsaw, cut materials according to your measurements and specifications. If possible, ask an employee at the home improvement store to cut out material before you get home.

, Lay out the cork, metal or dry erase on the base board first and then use the spray adhesive to attach it to the base. Allow the materials to dry for an hour (or less) before mounting it to the cabinet.

, Allow it to dry before mounting it to the cabinet.

, Line board up with previous measurements and the pencil drawing to ensure it is placed exactly as desired. Press and hold for a few minutes to ensure it adheres.

Purchase a kitchen cart.,
Make full use of counter and tabletops.,
Store kitchen items in large wicker or plastic baskets.",How to Create Open Kitchen Storage1," A kitchen or microwave cart is a cart on wheels that you can use to store additional items in your kitchen.You can purchase these carts at department stores or specialty retailers that specialize in kitchen and cooking goods. Before purchasing a kitchen cart, make sure you have ample space in your kitchen for it. You can read the size of the cart on the box or online before purchase. Then, measure the available space in your kitchen to make sure that the cart can fit.


You can place appliances, pots, pans, and dishware on a kitchen cart.;
, Countertops can be a great place to store things like spices, dishes, mugs, and bowls. Tabletops can have elaborate centerpieces that also serve a functional purpose, such as a vase to store utensils. Stack your kitchenware on top of flat surfaces to reduce the number of things that need to go into drawers or cabinets.Try different configurations, and make your designs symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing.
Feature dishware that matches the colors of your kitchen.

, Wicker baskets and open plastic bins can provide a quick solution to your storage needs. Store the baskets under existing shelves, tables, or islands. Use the bins to store dinnerware such as plates, utensils, and glasses. You can also place these open containers on top of tables or islands to store fruits and vegetables.


Choose a wicker basket that matches the aesthetic of your house.
Wicker baskets can make your kitchen look more rustic.
Wicker baskets can also enhance a coastal or nautical theme in your house."
