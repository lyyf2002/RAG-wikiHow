Before you sit down on the toilet, fill one or two bidet bottles with lukewarm or warm water, then make a pad from 6-8 sheets of toilet paper and put it within reach of your left hand.,
Do what you came in the bathroom for.

,
Follow the Unspoken Rule of Water Hygiene that millions worldwide adhere to: the left hand is used for bathroom cleaning, the right hand is for eating and greeting.,
Check the pad of toilet paper after you dry yourself.,
When you have finished and stood up, wash your hands thoroughly.",How to Use a Bidet Bottle,";
,, This is very important to remember, especially if you travel worldwide.


If you are female and only went pee, simply pick up the bottle with your right hand and gently pour the warm water over your genital area. While still sitting, use your left hand to agitate the water to clean yourself. Take the pad of toilet paper with left hand and dab yourself dry. You are now done.
If you are male and had a bowel movement, you will need to pour the water from behind. Scoot slightly forward to provide space behind you. Wet the fingers of your left hand (so nothing sticks), then pour the water out of the bottle in your right hand, letting the water run down your bum. Use your left hand to agitate your rectum area and remove the feces that is on you and your bum hair, if you are a hairy male. Using your left hand, dab yourself dry with the pad of paper. Don't rub, as the paper will ball up and cling to hairs. You are now done.
If you are female and had a bowel movement, you can let the water from the bidet bottle cascade down from the front. Again, make sure that the fingers of your left hand are wet before you start cleaning. This way you wash both your vaginal area (remove pee) and remove feces by using your left hand to agitate. (You can do this from the front as you have no ""junk"" to get in the way.) Also, the water flow direction is to the rear, preventing any feces from coming in contact with vaginal area. Use your left hand to dab yourself dry with the wad of toilet paper you prepared. And you are done.

, This is the time to make sure you did a good job, but more importantly, to look for any kind of discharge that may indicate a call to a doctor: blood, spotting of blood, unusual discharge or discoloration, anything out of the ordinary.

, Use soap and water and scrub up for at least two renditions of ""Yankee Doodle"" or ""Happy Birthday.""

You can be charged with disorderly conduct if you are seen peeing or defecating in public places including campsites, public parks, or public waterways.In some very rare cases, urinating or defecating in public places can result in charges like indecent exposure or public lewdness, which can result in registering as a sex offender for the rest of your life.Of course, there are circumstances when hiking or camping where you must relieve yourself even on public land. It is vitally important that you ensure that you are in a secluded area when you relieve yourself outdoors.;
, The ethical and responsible way to enjoy the great outdoors is by leaving no trace of your presence there after you've left. Not only does this mean leaving wildlife alone and not destroying natural landmarks, it also means leaving no trace that you've relieved yourself. This means you will need to properly dispose of your own waste.You must be committed to burying your waste and leaving no trace of it behind.

, If you will be spending time outdoors camping, hiking, or picnicking, plan on the fact that you or your friends will need to relieve yourselves at some point in the outing.


You will need a small trowel or hand shovel for digging a hole to bury feces, a roll of toilet paper, and a plastic bag to cart out used toilet paper when you leave.
You will also need waterless hand sanitizer.

, Because you have to be discreet and also have a place to bury your feces that is sanitary, you need to keep the following guidelines in mind before you squat:


Choose a place that is well hidden from passersby, preferably with the cover of trees.
Choose a place that is at least 200 feet away from water sources like lakes or streams, and away from campsites or other places where other people are likely to discover it.Try to find a place with soft soil for digging.

, A cathole is a small hole for defecating, similar to how cats dig a hole prior to defecating in the wild.


Using the trowel or hand shovel that you brought with you, dig a hole six inches deep. and about four to six inches wide. It needs to be big enough to be a target as you squat above it, and also deep enough that animals will stay out., First, lower your underwear and pants. You can remove them entirely if you prefer, and drape them on a nearby tree or bush.


Then, squat over your cathole and defecate directly into it. If you miss, use a stick to move your feces into the bottom of the hole.

, While you might have seen people in movies using leaves for wiping, unless you have a thorough knowledge of local vegetation, don't try this yourself. You might end up with a blistering rash in the worst possible place.


Put your used toilet paper in the plastic bag you've brought with you, then seal it and put it in another plastic bag to conceal the smell. Take it all out with you and dispose of it when you find a trash can, or when you get home., You must bury it for sanitary reasons. By burying your feces, you can reduce the risk of someone stepping in it or of spreading illness and germs.Cover your feces with the soil that you dug out of your cathole, then cover it with sticks, leaves, or rocks to disguise it. This helps keep animals away, which can help prevent the spread of germs., Look for a place behind rocks or trees for privacy.


Don't forget to bring your supplies, including toilet paper, plastic bags, and hand sanitizer.

, If you're wearing a skirt, raise it and wrap it securely under one arm, then lower your underwear. If you have enough time and privacy, it's better to remove pants and underwear completely, just in case of urine dribbles.


Set your pants and underwear on a dry spot on the ground or a nearby bush. Don't put them too close to you or you may soil them.

, You might be used to squatting on the balls of your feet, with your feet close together, but this position is very unstable and hard on the knees. Squatting with feet hip-width or shoulder-width apart and with your feet flat is easier to hold for an extended period of time.


If you're wearing pants, be careful not to let things fall out of your pocket as you squat.

, Push your urine stream hard at the beginning and at the end to get a strong stream and not dribble. Some women find it helpful to use one hand to spread the labia and better expose the urethral opening, but this can also be accomplished by spreading the legs a bit farther.


If you prefer not to squat, you can try the steps in How to Urinate Standing up As a Female.

, Put the toilet paper in the plastic bag you've brought and take it with you when you leave, disposing of it when you get home or back to camp.


If you need to change a tampon, be sure to pack the old one out in a plastic bag and dispose of it in the nearest facility. Tampons do not break down and the blood will attract animals., Alternately, you can bring down your skirt if you are wearing one, and make sure that it is not tucked into your underwear.


Don't forget to use the hand sanitizer you've brought.

, Often, behind rocks or trees can be a great place for privacy.


Remember to find a spot that is away from water sources, so that the runoff from your urine doesn't end up in the water supply, and also away from campsites and other places where people are present., Instead of peeing directly on the ground, it is better to pee on a rock or log if you can.Otherwise, an animal may try to dig up the ground where you have urinated, which can damage the soil and vegetation., Try to open your pants and underwear just enough to pull your penis out. It is not necessary to pull your pants all the way down.


Don't worry about covering up the urine when you're done. Urine does not pose much of a sanitary hazard in the outdoors.Don't forget to use the hand sanitizer you've brought.

Evaluate the environmental impact of hand dryers.,
Assess the health risks.",How to Use a Hand Dryer," Although drying your hands is important to reduce the spread of germs, washing your hands thoroughly is even more essential to good hygiene. Before using the hand dryer, follow these steps to wash your hands:Use warm or cold, clean running water to wet your hands.
Apply soap and lather your hands, rubbing them together and being careful to use soap on the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and underneath nails.
Take a minimum of 20 seconds to scrub your hands.
Rinse them under clean, running water.;
, This can be accomplished by gently shaking your hands into the sink after you have finished washing them. The more moisture you remove, the faster it will be to use the dryer.

, Most hand dryers feature diagrams and instructions showing users how to operate the unit most effectively and hygienically.

, Many hand dryers available today automatically turn on when you place your hands under the unit.


This makes the dryer more hygienic to use because you do not have to push a button that countless other people have also touched.

, Angle your palm slightly downward to encourage the water to roll off your hands.

, Although it might feel like rubbing your hands together while they under the dryer speeds up the process, this can actually increase the spread of bacteria., Keep your hands under the dryer until they are completely dry, since wet hands increase the spread of germs.

, These places harbor bacteria, and you reduce the effectiveness of washing your hands by touching these potentially contaminated surfaces.You also place people who use the dryer after you at a greater risk. , Most hand dryers in use today also shut off automatically when you walk away or when you withdraw your hands from underneath the dryer. Some models also shut off after a specific amount of time.

, Instead of reaching for the roll of paper towels, use a hand dryer to save trees and water.To replace the paper towels that we discard on a daily basis, 51,000 trees have to be cut down every day.
To produce one ton of paper towels, 17 trees are cut down and 20,000 gallons of water are required.

, Using hand dryers as opposed to paper towels cuts down significantly on waste.On a global scale, our discarded paper towels result in an estimated 254 million tons of trash every year.
In the United States we consume over 13 billion pounds of paper towels every year.

, While thoroughly washing your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of germs, drying your hands also decreases the spread of bacteria.According to the CDC, germs are more easily transferred to and from wet hands., If you wash your hands and do not dry them, you usually end up with water stains all over your clothes. Use a hand dryer to prevent this from happening.

, While hand dryers can help reduce your carbon footprint, they still have an environmental impact. They require electricity to run, and thereby play a role in carbon dioxide emissions.Drying your hands with the typical 2,200 watt warm air-dryer three times a day for one year produces 26.61 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.To evaluate the carbon footprint of using hand dryers, also think about how your local electric company generates electricity. The more coal it uses, the more carbon the dryer produces., Researchers have concluded that paper towels are the more hygienic and sanitary choice.Here are some of the main reasons why hand dryers are less effective at decreasing the spread of germs: Dryers in public places are rarely cleaned.
People often stick their hands in the dryers or on the rim, leaving bacteria on the surface.
The dryers can blow bacteria onto other surfaces and onto people using them.
In a study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, researchers determined that jet dryers left 4.5 times more bacteria in the vicinity than warm-air dryers, and 27 times more bacteria than paper towels.Other researchers, however, have questioned the methods employed in the study."

Dry hands and head back outside.",How to Use an Italian Bathroom1," This is more difficult than you might think. Some public bathrooms in small towns in Italy, for reasons stubbornly unclear, are closed during the lunch hour and on Wednesdays. (Yes, we're looking at you, Rio Maggiore.) If you can't find a public bathroom, try the train station. If the train station is anywhere close by, beeline right over there in full confidence that you will most likely find free restrooms which are somewhat functional.;
, If there is no open bathroom in the public square, and the train station is just too far and you know you can't make it, then your best bet might be to find a restaurant or a café. And yes, you will be expected to sit down, have a drink, and then use the facilities. You are thinking that drinking more fluids, just so that you can use the bathroom, kind of defeats the purpose. True enough. You have run up against one of the great conundrums of traveling in lovely rustic, old lands.

, Give your bag, your sweater, that cute little sunhat, and any other handheld belongings to your friend. Or give it to your husband, your boyfriend, or to anyone who has the skill to be able to stand outside waiting for you for quite awhile, holding all that precious stuff you always drag around with you. Hopefully it's not raining. Once inside, the last thing you want, is to have to put any of your treasures on the floor of this bathroom. There is not likely to be a hook in the bathroom, nor a nice clean surface of any kind, at any height. Nor is the bathroom all that likely to have a spotless and dry floor.

, As you make your handoff, be absolutely sure to take your toilet paper, and tampons, or sanitary pads, and your hand sanitizer with you. Don't leave them in your backpack. Those necessary supplies won't do you a whit of good if you can't reach them, for heaven's sake.

, While some bathrooms in Italy are equipped with lightbulbs and functioning electricity, some are not! Some of the doors in bathrooms run all the way from the floor to the ceiling. If the light inside that little stall is out, when you close that door, you might as well be shut up deep in the darkest Kentucky cave. This is not ideal. You need to be able to see for these delicate maneuvers. Bring that flashlight.

, Wait in line and when it's your turn, get down. If the floor is dirty, squat as close to the ""toilet hole"" as possible. This is going to be easier for you if you are in good shape. Just another reason to be glad you are doing those regular gym workouts. You are doing those, right?

, If you hear a strange noise and water is rinsing the entire toilet area floor, don't worry. It's how it ""flushes.""

, Do not wipe back to front, as it can cause UTI.

, If you have an accident with aiming, clean off the fixture with some toilet paper you have brought from home. Leave things nice for the next person. You are all in the same boat together. They too, have been wandering the town looking for a place to go! You are like soul sisters.

, Not guaranteed. Try to have hand sanitizer in your purse or knapsack just in case. And use it!

, Get your stuff. Say thank you to the nice person who held all that crazy junk for you while you were in that stinky place for so long. Then go on your way and get a nice pizza or go tour another church or something.

If you want to take a closer look, you can ask to see the original scan at your doctor's office or ask for a copy to take home.


Although your doctor will likely be reluctant to give you the original bone scan to take home, he must legally provide you with a copy if you ask. The office might charge you a small copying fee.
A bone scan is done to show problems with bone metabolism — the process of building and recycling bone tissue.Some activity is normal, but too much or too little bone remodeling is a sign of disease or injury.;
, Most bone scans take an image of the entire skeleton, but sometimes they're more focused on an injured or painful area, such as the wrist or spine.As such, learn a little about basic anatomy, especially the names of most of the bones in your bone scan. Search online for information or borrow a book from your local library.


You don't need to learn detailed physiology or anatomy, but you should know what bones the radiologist is referring to in her written report of your bone scan results.
The most common bones that are noted on bone scans are the vertebrae (spinal bones), pelvis (ilium, ischium and pubis), ribs, wrists (carpal bones) and leg bones (femur and tibia).

, Once you have an idea of the bones that are problematic on your bone scan, you also need to know on which side of your body it is. You often can't tell just by looking at your body image, but all diagnostic images including bones scans have to be labelled in terms of which side is the patient's right and which is left.As such, look for words such as left, right, front or back on the image to get orientated.


Bone scan images can be taken from either your front or back. Looking at the head, you can sometimes see from which direction it was taken, but not always.
Instead of words, bone scans and other diagnostics images may be orientated by marker letters, such as L (left), R (right), F (front) or B (back).

, If you have more than one bone scan taken over time, which is common when following the progression of a bone disease or condition, then determine the dates (and times) that each was taken by looking at the label. Study the earlier one first, then compare it to later ones and take note of all the changes. If there isn't much difference, then it's likely your condition hasn't progressed (or improved).


If you have osteoporosis, for example, your doctor will likely recommend a yearly or bi-yearly bone scan to monitor progression of the disease.
If a bone infection is suspected, images may be taken shortly after the radio-tracer is injected into you and again three to four hours later when it's collected in your bones — this is called a 3-phase bone scan., The test results of a bone scan are considered normal when the radioactive dye is spread and absorbed evenly throughout your skeleton; however, a bone scan is considered abnormal when it shows darker colored ""hot spots"" in your bones.Hot spots show areas in your skeleton where an excess of dye accumulates, which could signify bone destruction, inflammation, fractures or tumor growth.


Diseases that cause bone destruction include aggressive types of cancer, bacterial bone infection and osteoporosis (leads to weakening and fractures).
Some bones can normally appear slightly darker than other bones because of their increased metabolic activity. Examples include your sternum (breastbone) and parts of your pelvis. Don't mistake these for diseases.
In some cases, as with lesions resulting from multiple myeloma, hot spots will not appear on a bone scan. A CT or PET scan may be more helpful to identify signs of this type of cancer.

, Test results are also considered abnormal when there are lighter colored ""cold spots"" in your bones.Cold spots indicate areas that absorb less radioactive dye (or none) compared to surrounding bones due to reduced activity and remodeling. In general, cold spots are usually a sign of decreased blood flow to an area for some reason.


Lytic lesions — associated with multiple myeloma, bone cysts, and certain bone infections — may show up as cold spots.
Cold spots can indicate poor circulation due to a blood vessel blockage (atherosclerosis) or benign tumor.
Cold spots and hot spots can appear simultaneously on a bone scan and represent different but concurrent diseases or conditions.
Although lighter cold spots are abnormal, they typically represent conditions that are less serious than those represented by darker hot spots.

, The radiologist will interpret your bone scan results and send a report to your doctor, who will use that information along with other diagnostic studies and/or blood tests to establish a diagnosis. Common diagnoses that stem from abnormal bone scan results include: osteoporosis, bone fractures, bone cancer, bone infection, arthritis, Paget's disease (a bone disorder involving thickening and softening of bones) and avascular necrosis (death of bone due to lack of blood supply.With the notable exception of avascular necrosis, which shows up as cold spots on a bone scan, all the other above-mentioned conditions show up as hot spots.
Common osteoporosis hot spots to see on a bone scan include the upper thoracic spine (mid back), the hip joints and/or the wrists. Osteoporosis leads to fractures and bone pain.
Cancer hot spots can be seen in virtually any bone. Bone cancer often spreads (metastasizes) from other cancer sites, such as the breasts, lungs, liver, pancreas and prostate gland.
Paget's disease causes hot spots along the spine, pelvis, long bones and skull.Bone infections are most common in the leg, feet, hand and arm bones.

, Although you don't need to make any special preparations before taking a bone scan, you should dress in comfortable, easily removed clothes and refrain from wearing any jewelry.Metal jewelry and watches, in particular, should be left at home or removed just prior to the bone scan because they can affect the results.


Like other diagnostic imaging tests, such as x-rays, any metal on your body will make the bone scan images look white or lighter than surrounding areas.
Tell the radiologist and/or technician if you have any metal fillings in your mouth or metal implants in your body, so they can make note of it and not confuse them with diseases processes.
Wearing clothes that are easily removed is a good idea because you may be asked to wear a hospital gown.

, Inform your doctor if your pregnant or potentially pregnant because the radiation exposure from the radiotracer can be harmful to the baby.As such, bone scans aren't often performed on pregnant women or nursing mothers — the breast milk can become slightly radioactive and harm the baby also.


There are other imaging tests for bone that are safer for pregnant women, such as MRI studies and diagnostic ultrasound.
Short-term osteoporosis is not uncommon with pregnant women who are malnourished because minerals are leached from their bones to provide for the growing baby.

, Although you can eat and drink normally just prior to your bone scan, tell your doctor about the medications you're taking, as these may affect your test. For example, medicines that contain barium or bismuth affect bone scan test results, so you should avoid taking them for at least four days prior to your appointment.Bismuth is found in a variety of medicinal products, such as Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate, Devrom and De-Nol.
Bismuth and barium can cause areas of your body to look too light on bone scans

, The amount of radiotracer injected into your vein just prior to getting a bone scan is not very much, but it still produces radiation in your body for up to 3 days.Radiation increases the risk of healthy cells mutating into cancer cells, so make sure you weigh all the pros and cons with your doctor before getting a bone scan.


It's estimated that a bone scan exposes you to no more radiation than a conventional full-body x-ray does and less than half that of a CT scan.Drinking lots of water and fluids starting immediately after a bone scan for 48 hours can help to flush out any radioactive tracer left in your body.If you must have a bone scan while breastfeeding, pump and throw away your breast milk for two to three days so your baby isn't harmed.

, Allergic reactions related to the radiotracer dye are rare, but they do happen and can be life threatening.In most cases the reaction is mild and causes some pain and inflammation at the injection site and a related skin rash. In severe cases, anaphylaxis is triggered and leads to a widespread allergic reaction causing swelling, breathing difficulty, hives and reduced blood pressure.


Call your doctor immediately if any signs of an allergic reaction become obvious once you get home after your appointment.
The radioactive tracer takes between one to four hours to be absorbed by your bones, although most allergic reactions occur within 30 minutes of the injection.

, There is a slight risk of infection or excessive bleeding when the needle is inserted into your vein to inject the radioactive dye.Infections usually take a couple of days to develop and include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site. Call your doctor immediately if you notice these signs. You may need to go on antibiotics to combat the infection.


Signs of a more significant infection include severe throbbing pain and pus drainage at the injection site, numbness and tingling in your involved arm, fatigue and a fever.
Make sure the doctor or technician cleans your arm with an alcohol swab or wipe just prior to the injection.

, Lemon juice is packed with vitamin C which helps to restore the skin's pH. This is key in the treatment of penile yeast infections because it creates an unfriendly environment for yeast cells to thrive.


A man with penile yeast infection can make a treatment solution by mixing 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice with 1 quart of warm water. The affected area of the penis is then soaked in the solution.
This should be done three times daily until the penis is healed.

, Cranberry juice is a great penile yeast infection remedy when the skin has hardened because of the infection. It works by preventing the yeast infection from turning into a bladder infection. Additionally, it boosts the body's levels of good acidophilus bacteria.


A man with a penile yeast infection should consume cranberry juice twice daily until the symptoms fade away.

, A moist environment encourages the growth of yeast, therefore, men should ensure that their genital area is kept as dry and cool as possible by wiping with clean, dry towel after taking a bath.

Discomfort during intercourse: A man with a penile yeast infection may experience discomfort during sexual intercourse, due to the soreness, irritation, and inflammation of the penis.

, The most common causes and risk factors for penile yeast infection include:



Sexual transmission: Just like sexually transmitted infections, a yeast infection can be transmitted through sexual contact. A man can contract penile yeast infection by having unprotected intercourse with a yeast-infected woman.

Antibiotics: Although it is less common than sexual transmission, a man can get penile yeast infection through prolonged use of antibiotics.

Diabetes: Yeast thrives well in glucose, therefore men with diabetes are more susceptible to yeast infections, due to their elevated blood sugars.

Foods: A typical American diet increases the chances of a man developing penile yeast infection. Wheat, barley, oats, peanuts, red apples, and corn encourage yeast growth in the body because of their high glucose content, which is food for yeast.

Give your feet a rest.,
Perform easy stretches.,
Rub ice on your heel.,
Avoid using heating pads if pain increases.,
Try wearing night splints with you are sleeping.,
Wear a walking cast on your calf.",How to Treat Plantar Fasciitis1," One of the best things you can do for plantar fasciitis is to limit the amount of time you spend on your feet. The less pressure you exert on your heel, the more time it will have to heal. Additionally, try to avoid exercising on hard surfaces like concrete when you are experiencing pain. Opt for running on grass or an all-weather rubber track if possible.;
, Stretch your toes and calves throughout the day to prevent stiffness from occurring. By loosening up the ligaments, you can strengthen the muscles around your arch and relieve pain.

, Doing so can help reduce inflammation and can ease the pain caused by plantar fasciitis. Better yet, place a golf ball or a full water bottle in the freezer and use it to massage the bottom of your foot once frozen. Make sure to massage the inside of your arch thoroughly to try to reduce inflammation and ease tension., While some people receive relief from heating pads, heat can also cause inflammation that can make symptoms worse. If you do choose to use heat to treat your symptoms, make sure to alternate between a heating pack and an ice bath or pack. Always end with an ice treatment.

, Night splints position the foot at a perfect 90-degree angle to the ankle and hold the toes in an upward position to stretch the arch of the foot. This prevents stiffness and cramping from occurring during the night and allows you to maintain a constant, light stretch throughout the night.

, A walking cast holds your foot in place with a traditional cast for several weeks. This method is a bit more expensive and requires a substantial time commitment of inactivity. Additionally, you will likely have to undergo some level of light physical therapy after the cast is removed to restore flexibility.

Take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine.,
Visit a physical therapist.,
Get corticosteroid shots.,
Undergo extracorporeal shock wave therapy.,
Resort to plantar fascia release surgery.",How to Treat Plantar Fasciitis2," Household pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin can all help reduce inflammation and bring some relief to your foot. Choose either pill or cream form. If you choose to take a pill, make sure to eat something beforehand. If using a cream, simply cover the affected area and allow it to soak in.

, Before turning to surgery to relieve the symptoms of your plantar fasciitis, consult a physical therapist to determine whether or not your condition can be treated with a guided stretching and rehabilitation program. A physical therapist appointment should be scheduled after exhausting all of the non-medical treatments listed above and before resorting to invasive medical procedures like surgery.

, Corticosteroid shots can ease the symptoms of plantar fasciitis by temporarily relieving pain. However, these shots are not a long-term solution to curing the problem. Be aware that while much less invasive than surgery, the shots can still be painful. Over-administration of shots may also lead to damage of the heel.

, This procedure sends sound waves to the painful area to relax the muscles in your foot. Shock wave therapy is usually prescribed for people who have not seen any results from home treatments for more than six to twelve months. Side effects include bruising, swelling, pain, and numbness. While less invasive than surgery, it has also proven less effective., If none of the above methods have helped relieve your symptoms over a year-long period of time, plantar fascia release surgery may be necessary to cure your symptoms. This surgical process ultimately releases tension and inflammation in the plantar fascia ligament by snipping part of the ligament itself.


Be patient with non-surgical treatments before opting for surgery. Allow yourself at least six to 12 months of trying non-invasive treatments before choosing to go ahead with surgery.
There are several risks associated with plantar fascia release surgery. These include: nerve entrapment or tarsal tunnel syndrome, development of a neuroma, constant heel pain and swelling, infection, long recovery time, and delayed ability to heal the wound."

Avoid railings.,
Wear a surgical mask.",How to Travel Without Germs1," When you touch a surface in the vehicle, gems may transfer to your hand. Regularly washing your hands will lessen the chance that germs are exposed to your eyes, nose, or mouth.Effective handwashing involves five steps: wet, lather, scrub, rinse, and dry. You should scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Keep a small bottle of alcohol-based hand sanitizer nearby. If you do not have access to a sink, you can apply the dose specified on the bottle and rub your hands until it evaporates.;
, Even if it’s difficult from your seat, put your shoes back on before going to the lavatory. Your socks may transmit germs from the bathroom floor to your luggage when you change clothes.


Keep your feet off of seats and trays. If you place your feet on these surfaces you can spread germs from the floor to surfaces where they are more likely to infect you.
Wearing shoes will also provide an additional barrier to prevent the spread of warts.

, Many common illnesses are transmitted through close contact with infected people.Germs can travel up to six feet from a sneeze.Limit your risk by maintaining several feet of separation from other travelers when possible. If you need to interact closely with a stranger, wash your hands after you finish.

, Hundreds of people touch overhead bins, seatback pockets, trays, and vehicle doors every day. Several surfaces in an airplane can house germs for up to several days. Be aware of your surroundings and do not make assumptions that something is clean to touch.


If you are staying in a hotel, disinfect commonly touched items, like a remote control, before using them.
If you are flying, bring your own sleeping supplies in your carry-on bag or as your personal item. Airlines clean blankets and pillows sporadically, and bus and train seats are not cleaned between each trip.

, Likewise, avoid touching your face after contact with the seat or tray-table. These surfaces are not frequently disinfected and everyone else who sat there touched them and potentially spread germs., If you can, skip using railings and the tops of seats as you walk to your seat. Though these may be convenient tools for maintaining your balance, they are touched by many other travelers and germs can survive on these surfaces for several hours.

, If you are sick, this will lower the amount of germs that you spread while traveling. As germs enter your body through your nose and mouth, a surgical mask creates a barrier that may also lower the number of germs that reach your system.Alternately, keep your nose hydrated with a saline nasal spray or by putting petroleum jelly on the outside of your nose. This can boost your body’s normal defenses.

Be very cautious when using tea tree oil when pregnant, breastfeeding, or undergoing childbirth. Some reports suggest the oil decreases contraction strength, though this is unclear due to a lack of significant scientific information.Avoid using tea tree oil on the skin of adolescent males, as it has been known to cause the growth of breasts (gynecomastia)., Vinegar is known to have antifungal, antibacterial, and antiseptic properties. It can help treat fungal rash because it contains acid and enzymes that create a fungus-killing chemical reaction in the skin. There are several ways you can use vinegar to treat fungal rashes.


Dilute apple cider vinegar in a 50:50 ratio (1 cup of apple cider vinegar and 1 cup of water). You can pour a small amount of the vinegar onto a cotton ball and rub it on the affected areas 2 to 3 times per day. You can also soak the affected areas in 50:50 mix of apple cider vinegar to water for 10 to 15 minutes. Be sure to dry the area completely after soaking.
You can soak your entire body. Fill a tub with lukewarm water, then add 5 cups of vinegar. You can add little more you want your vinegar bath to be a bit more concentrated. Soak your body for about 10 to 20 minutes.

, Garlic extract inhibits the growth of microorganisms due to allicin, an active ingredient of garlic produced only when it is crushed. Additionally, ajoene is another compound found in raw garlic that is very effective in treating fungal rashes. It kills fungus in the skin and promotes faster healing.


You can apply crushed garlic to affected areas 2 times a day. Cover these areas with gauze for better absorption.
You can try a garlic paste, made by crushing 1 clove of garlic into small pieces and mixing it with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of olive oil. You can apply this to fungal rashes several times a day to promote healing.

Eat a variety of foods to make sure your immune system has all of the nutrients that it needs to keep you healthy.Fruits and vegetables such as berries, citrus fruit, and leafy greens are especially good for your immune system.Avoid foods high in sugar as sugar limits your immune system’s ability to fight off bacteria and infections.

, Dining options may be limited while you travel. If you are unable to get the full recommended amounts of vitamins from your diet, vitamin supplements can help you keep your immune system strong.


Make sure to take a daily multi-vitamin that contains no more than 100% of your recommended intake. Excessive doses can create toxicities that will harm your health.Over-the-counter supplements often make unsubstantiated boasts. High dose vitamin C tablets and lozenges may have minimal effect on your health. If consumed at the first sign of a cold, they may help you manage symptoms.

, You increase your chances of getting sick when you get too little sleep. When you are unrested, your body has higher stress and inflammation levels. Keep your immune system strong by getting consistent rest.


High quality sleep does not always mean more sleep. Make sure you are sleeping between seven and nine hours a night., Stay hydrated by consuming water, fruit juices, and teas. Proper hydration strengthens your immune system by flushing toxins out of organs.


The amount of water needed depends on the person. On average, men are encouraged to drink roughly 3 liters a day, and women should drink approximately 2.2 liters daily.You cannot take bottled beverages with you through airport security, so buy a bottle of water from an airport restaurant or shop.

This can be used to a physical barrier to germs while you are seated in a cramped cabin.
Bring your own magazines and entertainment options. The magazines provided by the airline have been used by many people and some germs can survive on paper for hours or even days.

, It’s easy to overextend yourself while you’re traveling. This will leave you tired and feeling stress, which makes infections more likely. Plan your arrival and departure times so that you will be able to rest before exerting yourself.


Anticipate jet lag. While it’s uncommon to experience jet lag from taking a short flight in the same time zone, longer flights that cross time zones increase the risk. If your trip may disrupt your sleep patterns, try to schedule an extra day after your arrival in order to adjust.

, Avoid illness by limiting your possible exposure to germs. As morning flights are less convenient, taking an early flight might lower your exposure to people. If you can schedule your bus ride for the middle of the week, there is a good chance that it will be less crowded.


Holidays and weekends are the most popular flight times.
Certain destinations experience heavier traffic during certain times, such as beach spots during spring break. Plan to visit these locations during off-season in order to lessen the chance of being on a crowded flight or full hotel.

, If you are travelling to another part of the world, make sure that you have all required and recommended vaccines. Requirements vary by region, so check the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website (http://www.cdc.gov/features/vaccines-travel/) once you know where you will be traveling.

Don't compare yourself to others.",How to Stay Fit and Beautifully Healthy," Exercise is one of the most important aspects in staying (or becoming) fit and healthy. Experts recommend that you should aim to be active for at least 30 minutes per day. Try scheduling your exercise the same way that you schedule other appointments and commitments. You'll be more likely to stick to it if it's on the calendar.If you are trying to tone-up or lose weight, you might need to exercise more than thirty minutes per day. If you belong to a gym, ask to have a consultation with a personal trainer. They can help you plan a regimen for your specific goals.
Exercise in increments. If you are finding it difficult to block out 30 or 60 minutes of your day for exercise, try getting your movement in smaller chunks of time. For example, walk to work, take a walk at lunch, and walk home.;
, You will see the most benefits from exercise if you do it regularly. One good way to make a habit stick is to pick a form of exercise that you enjoy. For example, if you like swimming, make it a point to swim laps twice a week.Make it easy to stick to your routine. Try setting out your workout clothes and your gym bag the night before. That way, you're all set to head out the door in the morning.
Utilize technology. Try a gadget to help you track your movements, such as a fitbit. There are even free apps on your phone that you can set to remind you to get up and move once an hour.
Don't give up. It typically takes between 20 and 30 days to make a habit stick. Keep exercising, and eventually it will become a natural part of your day.

, There are definitely some perks to working out at a gym--air conditioning and televisions are a few. But scientists report that exercising outdoors, at least part of the time, can have major benefits. The varied terrain of a road, sidewalk, or trail challenges your body in ways that the monotony of a treadmill or elliptical trainer can't do.Exercising outside can also have positive benefits for your mental health. In studies, people who walked both outside and inside reported enjoying the activity much more when completed outside.
Utilize your local parks. Many parks will have great areas for running or walking. If you like sports, you can also make use of the tennis courts or basketball courts.

, If you involve other people in your exercise routine, you'll see a positive impact in your results. Finding a workout buddy can help with accountability. If you schedule an activity with a friend, you are less likely to cancel than if you were only cancelling on yourself.Group exercise classes also offer benefits. In classes, instructors can offer encouraging words. They can also motivate you and correct your form to make sure that you are doing each move safely and effectively.
Working out is a great way to meet new people. Try joining a running club or a tennis league. You'll make friends with similar interests and stay in great shape.

, It's great when you find an exercise that you enjoy. And there's no reason to give up something you love, like yoga or swimming. However, it can be beneficial to vary your exercise routine. Your body will respond positively to new challenges and you'll see greater results when you switch things up.Your body will get used to a regular routine and will eventually start to spend less energy when you exercise. That means you'll burn fewer calories and might notice a plateau in your fitness goals.
Try doing a mix of strength training and cardio. For example, try running for two minutes, then stopping to do some core exercises, such as a plank or crunches. You can switch up the order of your exercises and add new ones to your routine.
If you prefer to work out indoors, try using cardio equipment like a treadmill. You can visit a gym or purchase your own. You may even be able to find used equipment to purchase.
Try changing your routine every two to four weeks to start seeing some faster results.

, Eating right has a lot of benefits. It will help you maintain a healthy weight, improve your skin, and give you more energy. One of the best ways to eat a healthy diet is to cook your own food. Reports show that people who cook their own meals consume lower levels of sugar and fats. Cooking with fresh foods also helps you to eat fewer processed foods, which typically have high sodium levels.Make cooking fun. Recruit family members to get involved, so that it feels like less of a chore. Give each family member a day of the week to request a certain meal and find a new recipe to try out.
Being organized can help make cooking seem easier. Try planning your meals in advance. This will limit the trips you have to make to the grocery store, and will also help you stay on track with your fitness goals if you plan healthy weekly menus.

, When you're cooking your yourself, you can fully control the ingredients you use. This will help you make sure you are getting the nutrients your body needs. Eating well can help control your weight, and it can also give you the energy you need to exercise regularly.Try to eat a diet that includes several servings a day of fresh fruits and vegetables. These are packed with vitamins and fiber.
Eat lean meats and fish. These will provide you with protein and also gives your body healthy fats.
Make your plate colorful. The more color on your plate, the more fruits and vegetables you are likely eating. Try for leafy greens, like kale, and vibrant orange tones, like those in sweet potatoes and carrots.

, You can plan a general, healthy diet for yourself. But if you have any special concerns about your weight or overall health, it's a great idea to consult your doctor. She can help you figure out the foods that will help you meet your fitness goals, whether it is maintaining your current fitness levels or losing weight.Your doctor can also help you figure out which foods to avoid. For example, if you suffer from high blood pressure, your doctor will likely recommend a reduced sodium diet.
Ask your doctor before taking any weight loss supplements. While diet pills can be effective when used safely, it's best to check with your doctor about whether or not they are right for you.
Ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian. They can help you review your diet and plan meals to lose weight or maintain an already healthy lifestyle.

, Pay attention to the nutrition labels on the foods that you buy. The information listed here can help you make healthy choices about what to put in your body. When reading labels, pay specific attention to the amounts of sugar, fat, and calories that are listed. You can see how much of the recommended daily allowance of sugar, for example, you should aim for.Pay attention to serving size. For example, if you want to have a bag of chips, read the package to see if the information tells you the calorie count for the whole bag. Sometimes, a third of the bag is considered a full serving.
If you have hypertension, you may need to watch your salt intake. Make sure to read how much salt/sodium is in each product to make sure that you do not consume more than 1,500 mg a day.Canned foods and pre-prepared meals are often full of sodium.
There are multiple different names for most ingredients. For example, sugar has at least 61 different names, including sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, and rice syrup.If you are trying to avoid a particular ingredient, make sure that you can recognize all of its different names.

, Mental health is an important part of feeling fit and beautifully healthy. It can be hard to have a positive body image when we are inundated with pictures of very thin actresses and models. But there are ways you can learn to feel good about yourself, no matter your shape. A positive body image will help you stay motivated to eat healthy and work out. Find something you like about your looks and make that your focus. For example, if you have been running a lot lately, compliment yourself on how strong your legs are looking.
Avoid negativity. Try not to criticize yourself. It's fine to want to make changes, but try to give yourself encouragement, rather than tearing yourself down. For example, instead of feeling bad about eating a bag of cookies, say to yourself, ""I guess now I have extra motivation to do 20 extra sit-ups tomorrow!""

, Body image is all about how you feel about how you look. So try to focus on positive feelings. Focus on the good things your body does for you, like give you the energy to play with your dog. When you feel healthy, you will also feel more fit and beautiful.Don't worry about the numbers on the scale. Instead, focus on how strong you feel and how your clothes fit. Base your personal fitness assessment on your energy levels and overall health, not on your weight.

, It can be tempting to judge yourself based on how other people look. But experts say that comparing yourself to others can be damaging. For instance, it can lower your sense of self-worth. That can lead to lower self-esteem, and lower energy levels.Make your own goals. Trying to look like someone else isn't going to help you achieve your goals. Instead, assess your fitness level by noting if you've made improvements and if you can see and feel a difference in your body.
Think about your body frame size. Everyone is different. Some people have small frames, while others have a large frame. Yours might be medium. You can figure out your frame size by measuring the circumference of your wrist and consulting a height chart. Remember, if you have a large frame, you will have different weight goals than someone who is naturally smaller.Try keeping a daily journal, where you record positive statements about yourself. You can use this journal to track your exercise and diet, or you can just write down happy, self-affirming thoughts to keep you motivated.

Learn how a strategic asset management plan can help.,
Collect information about assets.,
Decide which assets will receive your focus.,
Create strategies for each asset.",How to Develop a Strategic Asset Management Plan1," Asset management is a strategic approach to to how a company conducts business, reaches decisions, and processes, uses, and communicates information. Creating a strategic asset management plan will help your organization provide services as effectively as it can. By examining which assets your organization possesses, how important they are, and what their future costs and values may be, your organization can get the highest amount of worth from its assets.A strategic asset management plan will allow you to understand how effective your assets are being utilized.
The value over the entire lifecycle of an asset can be determined and planned for.
You can dispose of costly assets that are not deemed necessary and generate funding from their sale.;
, Before you can proceed in making a strategic asset management plan you will need to collect information about the assets that you will be planning for. The focus of this inquiry is to learn how well certain assets are serving the needs of your organization. This will later allow you to learn which assets need your attention and which need to be removed.Collect information about which assets your organization currently holds. This information should be available from company accounting records. Confirm the records with a physical audit of the tangible assets.
Think of how well your assets are serving the goals of your organization or individual department. Consider your company's short-term and long-term goals and then use this information to help you determine how the assets may be assisting or hindering your organization.
Take into account projected costs for any asset to learn what steps you need to take now.

, After you have taken an evaluation as to how important and how effective certain assets are to your organization you will need to prioritize the assets.Work to create a list of categories for use based upon their importance and frequency of use. For example, an asset that is critical but used infrequently may be replaced by short-term rental.


Some assets may be necessary to hold but may require upgrades.
Certain assets may be deemed non-essential or extraneous and may not require further holding by your organization.
For example, your organization may own a manufacturing plant or lease a building for operations or administration. The value to cost ratio of this plant will need to be assessed to fully determine just how important it is to your organization's goals. Be sure to separate individual assets within a building based upon cost, contribution, frequency of use, and importance. You will likely need to work closely with other departments to fully understand their procedures.

, Once you have a good understanding of which assets you need to focus on and in what order of importance you can begin to build your strategic asset management plan. Creating a plan for the assets will allow you to best utilize their value and avoid any risks they might come to pose to your organization over time. A basic strategic asset management plan will include the following six phases:


Acquisitions (including leases or rentals).
Operations.
Maintenance.
Disposal.
Funding.
Risk assessment and management.

Study necessary acquisitions.,
Plan for asset operations.,
Plan for maintenance of assets.,
Prepare for disposal of old assets.,
Include information regarding funding.,
Manage risk.",How to Develop a Strategic Asset Management Plan2," The acquisitions phase will determine which assets need to be purchased or otherwise made available. This part of the strategy will also include financial planning which details how much funding is made available for the acquisitions and where the funding will come from.This phase may also include replacement assets.
Cost to benefit analysis should be calculated before acquiring or leasing an asset.
Only assets that have already been evaluated as being necessary should be acquired.
For example, your organization might want to expand and acquiring a new facility could be part of your acquisitions planning phase.

, The operational phase of the strategic asset management plan will account for existing assets and their functions in your organization. This will allow you to get a better idea of the exact role of the asset, how secure it is, who is accountable for it and how well it is performing.


Any operational costs should be considered during this phase.
If any training is required in relation to the asset it should be factored into this phase of the strategy.
For example, an industrial water filter will have a certain cost attached to its function over time. Including this operational cost will let you compare it to other costs in order to make a good strategy for its management.

, All assets will require maintenance over time to continue serving your organization as well as they can. This phase of your strategic asset management plan will allow you to plan for the future maintenance of your assets. This phase will also detail what level of maintenance they will receive and who will be responsible for that maintenance.Keep in mind that all of a company's assets are important for carrying out the strategic plan. The physical assets that your organization owns will all require some type of maintenance to improve your chances of success.
Details of planned future maintenance operations should be included in this phase.
Include projected costs of maintenance over time.
For example your company may own an older facility. It can be expected than that maintenance costs will likely continue to rise. These rising costs will factor into the organization's decision regarding the future of the facility.

, Not all assets will be deemed important or valuable enough to continue holding. These assets requiring disposal will need to be included in your strategic asset management plan, as well as any tax consequences that may result from the disposition. You should also include the details of the disposal process including how it will be disposed of and the amount of costs incurred during the disposal process.Include the reasons for disposal.
List the methods of disposal.
If the asset is being sold list the value that it could generate.
All assets should have a disposal plan that details when they are to be disposed of and when.
For example, your organization might have recently acquired a new shipping vessel. Even though it is new, you should have a planned retire date for the ship based on projected operational and maintenance costs compared to how critical the ship is to your company's functions.

, Holding assets, maintaining them, or even disposing of old assets will require funding. During the funding phase of your strategic asset management plan you will need to detail where the funding for each asset is coming from, how much each one is receiving, what the funds are specifically being used for and whether or not they are recurring.


Consider the cost of the asset over its entire lifetime.
Consider costs of disposal as well as any funds generated from the sale of disposed assets.

, The risk management phase of your strategic asset management plan will detail the potential threats to your assets and their level of priority to your organization. Losses include down time, customer relations, poor press, and other factors that may damage value. A risk management plan should detail any potential risks to assets, how likely they might be, and what to do should the potential risk come to pass.


Keep in mind that all of a company's assets, whether they are physical, financial, human, information or intangible, will have different risks associated with each of them. You will need to address all of these risks.
Funding should be made available for the replacement of essential assets in case of an emergency.
Plans to quickly acquire key assets in the event of their loss can be included in your risk assessment.
For example, there may be a low risk that your company's generator will stop working as long as it is properly maintained. However, should it fail to be maintained, having a plan in place can help minimize loss.

Get a feel for what a good strategic asset management plan looks like.",How to Develop a Strategic Asset Management Plan3," The ISO 55000 is a standardized document that details an effective system for creating a strategic asset management plan. The ISO 55000 can help an organization to develop a plan that is a great fit for that organization's unique needs.The ISO 55000 will take you through the entire process of creating your strategic asset management plan.
The ISO 55000 can help you meet regulatory laws and requirements that might be demanded from your organization.
The ISO 55000 meets international standards including the American National Standards Institute and ASTM International standards.The ISO 55000 is becoming a necessary standard when working with clients, insurers or investors.

, The ISO 55000 is a rigorous and highly specialized text. As a result there are many specific terms that are used to make the text an effective one. Learning how the ISO 55000 defines assets can be useful when studying its content.Assets are things of value that a company owns or is responsible for.
Asset systems are groups of assets that must function together.

, The ISO 55000 specifies the overview, concepts and terminology in asset management, the ISO 55001 defines the requirements for a management system, and the ISO 55002 provides interpretation and implementation guidance for the management system.The ISO 55000 offers a comprehensive plan that you can follow to build your own strategic asset management plan. The ISO 55000 achieves this goal by breaking the process down into certain stages and concepts. Understanding these concepts before you set out to utilize the ISO 55000 can help you navigate the process with less trouble. Review the following outline for a sample of what your plan might look like:Mission statement and introduction.
Information about your organization including the state of your business, needs of clients, and an asset portfolio.
A section that details the planning process that went into your strategic asset management plan.
Objectives for your asset management program.
Strategic plans that include targets, time-frames, priorities and who is responsible.
Lastly your strategic asset management plan should detail risks and end with a conclusion.

, The ISO 55000 offers some overall guidelines that your strategic asset management plan should have in its final form. Review some of the following key points to understand what qualities your strategic asset management plan should include:A planning process that is backed up by strong strategies suited to your organization.
Your plan should include both assets and asset systems.
Any objectives presented need to be included clearly and plainly.

List the problems your organization wants to solve.,
Make a list of indicators for each problem you want to solve.,
Determine how you will observe and measure the indicators you have chosen.,
Write a brief job description for each observation task, for each indicator, for each area you want to address.,
Assign somebody for each job description.,
Determine how you will use the information you gather from the previous steps.,
Write a rough draft of the monitoring and evaluation system.,
Make the necessary changes and clarifications, then format the document into a formal process manual.

",How to Develop a Monitoring and Evaluation System," If your organization already exists, you will be looking at losses, risks and underperforming departments. If the organization is still forming, you want to look ahead to problems you anticipate.


This step can also include listing the things you want to learn about how your organization performs.;
, Indicators should be concrete and measurable, as well as objective as possible. Without consistent measurability, it's difficult to develop a meaningful framework for monitoring and evaluating the different processes in your organization.

, This includes the scale you will use, the points at which you will make observations, and the frequency with which you will record and measure.

, This can just be a sentence or two. At this stage, you're still developing the plan, not writing a formal process document.

, Multiple people can hold multiple job descriptions, or you can assign them to individuals best placed to make and understand the observations.


It's best to assign a title to the job description rather than a specific individual. If the line manager is responsible for a task, the task will get done by whomever the line manager is. If it's Don's job, the task stops getting done when Don gets promoted or retires.

, In some cases, you'll base the analysis by comparing the reality to benchmarks you set. In others, you'll base it on growth or decline as compared to other time periods. New companies might use industry averages, or use the first set of measurements as a baseline.

, Hand it off to somebody you trust who hasn't been involved up to this point. Ask that person to read it and report anything that doesn't make sense.

Determine if there is anything you need to change or add to the evaluation itself. You may decide to build on what you already have or to develop a new system altogether.;
, Performance management systems help rally staff members around your organization's goals because they help staff know how they are to be involved in reaching that goal. Take the time to clarify what your goals are for the next year as a company.


Identify processes or procedures that could be simplified or done more effectively.
Declare your sales goals for the next year or new products you would like to develop.
Share your hope for better communication between departments and staff members.

, As you sit down with each employee, clearly lay out your expectations for them.


Acknowledge what they are already doing well. Use this to encourage them.
Share some weaknesses that you have observed in them and in their work habits, and how overcoming those would help their performance in the company.
Identify specific things you would like them to accomplish over the next year, or whatever time frame works best for you. Prioritize these so the staff member knows which is most important and make sure to give them a deadline for each task.

, As employees begin to work on their performance, keep an eye on how they are doing. Give praise where performance is strong. If they appear to be struggling to meet performance expectations, talk with them and see if you can offer any support or coaching.

, At each performance review, let the employee know how they are doing. It is often helpful to assign a numeric value on a scale, rating the employee from ""not meeting expectations"" to ""meets expectations"" to ""exceeds expectations.""


Provide feedback on their performance. Be as specific as possible, noting key examples of when they demonstrated a certain quality.
Talk about the consequences or rewards of their performance. Let them know if they are on probation, are getting a raise in pay, changes in vacation days, or any other relevant action.
Discuss any problems they may be having. Listen to their concerns or worries as you talk through potential solutions.
Align feedback with feedback given throughout the year in their one on ones

Assess the effectiveness of the performance improvement plan.,
Take action.",How to Develop a Performance Improvement Plan," Before putting an employee on a performance improvement plan, you need specific proof that he or she is underperforming on the job. Use information that is objective, factual, and detailed in documenting problems with an employee’s performance. It is generally considered best practice to use a consistent format in documentation of employee performance so that all employees are assessed fairly. Your documentation should include the following:


Employee information (name, title, ID number if applicable, etc.)
Relevant dates
Description of performance discrepancy
Description of expected performance
Description of actual performance
Any specific rules or policies that may have been violated ;
, Conduct a candid, face-to-face meeting with the employee in question to share the observed issues with his or her performance. Sharing your observations with your employee is important so that he or she understands your point of view, and acknowledges that there's a problem. Use your documentation to provide as much specific information to the employee as possible. Be objective, and don’t use inflammatory or accusatory language, so the employee doesn't feel attacked.

, Let the employee know if he or she has committed a specific policy infraction, is not keeping up with work quotas, or simply not meeting the expectations of the position. Focus on the outcomes of the behavior rather than on the individual so that your employee sees how his or her behavior is affecting results on the job, or the workplace as a whole.

, Goals should be definitive and if possible, include numbers that can be measured later to assess progress effectively. Avoid generalizations or wording that can be interpreted several different ways. Specificity in improvement goals will prevent misunderstandings of expectations between you and your employee.Some examples of specific goals are:


”Employee will produce at least 150 units per month.”
”Employee will clock in for work no later than 9:00 a.m. every day.”
""Employee will have no more than one calculation error per report.”

, Any resources that your employee has access to should be listed (and possibly explained). This helps you document that you've provided help for the employee and gives them an idea of the tools that can help him or her to improve. Make sure the employee is aware of these supports and how he or she should use them appropriately.


These resources can include funds, training materials, time away from normal responsibilities, or other people’s time and expertise.
For example, an employee who is struggling with time management could be given access to an administrative scheduling tool that helps organize and set time goals for work completed.

, This will keep the employee on track in achieving the goals in his or her plan to make steady progress toward overall performance improvement.


State the start and end date in the employee's performance improvement plan, usually a 30-90 day period.
Provide dates in between the start and end dates and identify benchmark goals to be met on those dates.

, To avoid any confusion on the part of the employee, be as specific as possible in how you will evaluate his or her progress toward achieving goals. Different goals will require different methods of measurement. For example, if improved attendance is the goal, state how you will keep track of an employee's attendance. Some examples are:


""Employee will clock in using _______ computer software; supervisor will review attendance records on this program.""
""Employee will report to supervisor at the start of each work day.""

, Include the specific actions that you will take if the targets are met or unmet by the end of the performance improvement plan. Your employee should be made fully aware of what will happen when the plan ends, so that he or she knows what to expect in moving forward. Some examples of consequences include:


""Employee is on probation until he or she successfully completes at least three of the five targets outlined in performance improvement plan.""
""Employment will be terminated if two or more targets outlined in performance improvement plan are not met.""
""Employee will be reassigned to the position of________if all targets outlined in performance improvement plan are not met.""

, It's important to review a performance improvement plan thoroughly with your employee so that you both understand and feel comfortable with the terms of the plan. This is an agreement between two parties and can serve as a legal document in the future, if necessary.


Provide the employee with a copy of the performance improvement plan.
Verbally walk through each aspect of it with him or her.
Allow the employee to respond and give feedback.
Make any necessary adjustments to the plan to ensure it meets the needs of both parties.
Get verbal affirmation from the employee that he or she fully comprehends the terms of the plan.
Sign off on the plan with your employee to acknowledge its receipt and review.

, Using the metric established in the performance improvement plan, measure the employee’s progress toward meeting his or her targets, and document the progress as thoroughly as possible. This will provide you with objective evidence of the employee's progress and help in sharing useful feedback to your employee.

, Establish regular follow-up meetings with the employee (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.). This holds the employee accountable for improving his or her performance and can help him or her stay motivated and committed to achieving success. The object of these meetings is to help your employee succeed.Furnish feedback to the employee about his or her progression toward improvement goals.
Allow the employee to ask questions, seek guidance, or request clarifications on performance objectives.
Offer advice and suggestions to help the employee stay on track.
Learn more about your employee to give you a better understanding of ways you can help him or her.

, Decide if your employee is making reasonable growth with the performance improvement plan. If it's not working, decide if the shortcomings lie with the plan or with the employee. This will help you figure out how to move forward in dealing with the employee.If the problems stem from the performance improvement plan, alter it to make the goals more attainable. Some questions to ask in evaluating a plan's effectiveness are:


Does the timeframe need to be extended?
Are the performance targets too difficult to attain?
Were the results not completely within the employee’s control?

, If the performance improvement plan works, provide the employee with positive feedback, and if applicable, reward him or her in whatever way you outlined in the plan (i.e. coming off probation). If the plan does not succeed in improving performance, and you've ruled out deficiencies within the plan, take the actions outlined in your plan to proceed in the best interests of your organization.

Wipe down your arm rests, tray and any hard surfaces with an antibacterial wet wipe, also wipe your hands when you're done.,
Remember to wash your hands often especially before eating.,
Check with the airline if you use daily oxygen.,
Consider notifying the airport when you arrive if you or a travel companion will need a wheelchair or motorized assistance making it through the airport or to your gate.",How to Stay Healthy when Traveling by Plane,"


It may be inadvisable to fly and you should take the doctor's advice seriously. Find alternate means of travel.;
, Flying can exacerbate whatever illnesses you already have. Between the dry air, tiring situations and stress your little cold can become worse and perhaps even develop into a more serious respiratory illness.

,

Consider taking a day off to rest as soon as you feel something coming on. People tend to be very busy before leaving for vacation or a business trip. Don't dismiss taking a sick day if you need it.






Place a call to your doctor or get a prescription called in if possible.







, Drinking green tea may also help curb illness.

, It may take several days to show symptoms so try to avoid sick people a few weeks before your trip.

, Commercial airplanes have very low humidity. (Lower than the Sahara desert.) This can lead to you becoming dehydrated. Drink plenty of water the days before your flight as well as during and following your flight.


Dehydration can cause you to become run down and make it easier to pick up viruses.







, It can dehydrate you and leave you feeling drained.


Alcohol affects you differently at different altitudes.

, Make sure you carry accurate instructions. A late connector or lost bag could leave you without important medications.

, Pack light snacks in your bag or pick up something from the airport.


Don't fly hungry. Some airlines have eliminated in flight snack service. Any delay can leave you unable to grab a meal in a connector airport. Have a little something to eat in your carry on.
If you have any restrictions in your diet you should definitely pack something from home. This includes low sodium, low fat, low cholesterol, etc.
Vegetarian and organic eaters should also pack food for the flight. Pickings will be slim in the airport and you don't want to live off of weird sides and a snack you'd really not prefer.






Eating will keep your energy up, your blood sugar normalized and you won't be fighting a growling stomach to sleep.
Eating weird food on the run can cause you to feel bad.
Long flights often offer food service but special need meals (low fat, low sodium, vegan, kosher, vegetarian, etc.) will need to be requested several days in advance.
Contact the airline and confirm what meal options are available.
If you have a special diet you should request the special meal.
Call the day before and confirm they have your special meal request. By calling the day before they can still make arrangements if your request was ""lost"".






Eating outside your regular diet can cause stomach upset or leave you feeling awful.

, Don't assume the airline will have something if you forget. Take Tylenol, Advil, Pepto Bismol, etc. Think of worst-case scenario and not just how you feel while packing.

, This includes chicken pox, measles, etc. Not only could it be dangerous for you to fly buy you may be a carrier until symptoms begin to show. You could cause many people to become ill.


The recycled air makes illnesses easier to spread.
Don't assume. Ask your doctor. They may even be able to test for exposure.

,, The limb expands with flight and you can cause the circulation to be cut off causing permanent damage. Talk to your doctor if you fly often and have them leave extra room in your cast or use a different casting if you will be traveling soon.

, Try to get up every hour or so. Even if you must just walk to the restroom and back you should. Also stretching your legs in your seat will help when you aren't allowed to the restroom.


The lack of blood flow to the lower limbs can cause a blood clot to form with the coagulating blood. It can cause pain or in some cases can lead to death.
Notify the flight crew if you are having pain or swelling in your extremities, any shortness of breath or any other strange symptoms with a sudden onset.

, In case of emergency the other passengers, airport staff or flight crew can have details of any illnesses you have.


If you don't have one you should contact your local pharmacy or your doctor to get one. You may also be able to have it covered by insurance but they are usually inexpensive.
Some pharmacies have some pre-printed with common health problems (drug allergies, asthma, diabetes, cardiac problems, COPD/Emphysema, blood thinners, etc.)
Ask your pharmacist about what is available. Check a different pharmacy if your local one doesn't have it or look online.

, If possible, include a number for your travel town as well as your hometown.

,,


Slipping and falling in airports is also quite common.
Consider weather conditions where you are traveling. It may be advisable to pack shoes for walking in snow and rain.

, Many people like to avoid checking luggage so they over pack smaller bags and they become too heavy. Injuries can occur from trying to negotiate a heavy bag. You could injure your back, shoulders, arms, chest muscles, etc. Just check the bag and let the professionals take care of it. If your concern is something getting broken you should consider packing it in a shipping box or mailing it.

, Try to only carry what is needed. Pack your carry-on to be lightweight and as few pieces as possible. Loading and carrying heavy carry-on bags can also cause muscle injury.


You aren't going to read 3 novels on a short flight.
Don't let your over-stuffed luggage spill over into your carry-on leaving you with a super heavy carry on. You may just need a bigger suitcase to pack what you need any leave your carry-on for just what is needed for flight.
You may need to lift it over heads to store in an overhead container.
Not all seats have under seat storage (emergency rows).

, They are often used multiple times and are loaded with germs and bacteria. (If you must find one that is still packaged in the safety wrap).


If you travel often or need to sleep on a flight you should pick up your own pillow at a kiosk or travel store.

, Even traveling in the summer time the temperatures can vary wildly on board (+/- 20 degrees at times). Dress in layers and bring a light jacket or sweatshirt. Longer pants are also a better idea. You don't want to resort to using the loaner blankets and pillows. Sudden temperate changes and being too hot or cold can make you feel uncomfortable and increase your stress levels.

, You don't know who sat there before you and if they were sick with the flu or a cold.

, You can avoid picking up too many extra germs or bugs.

,


Some allow specific brands or models of oxygen concentrators. Others will not allow you to bring your own and require you to rent one from the airline for a fee.
Always call first to verify your equipment is allowed and establish if you must rent alternate equipment from the airline or make additional arrangements at lay over airports. Call several days in advance and 48 hours prior to verify your rental.
Different airlines have different policies for oxygen use so do your research.
Get a note from your doctor stating it is safe for you to travel.






Don't forget to call the individual airport if you will need oxygen during a layover. Don't assume the airline will communicate your needs with them. Even if they say they will, call and confirm.

, Don't risk falling.

Don't abuse this service and use it if you aren't medically impaired. Others in greater need may require it.

Reevaluate your training program.",How to Develop a Comprehensive Management Training Program," Before creating a management training program, you'll need to gain a basic understanding of how such programs work. Research existing management training programs that are available online to get an idea of how they are structured, what is taught, and other aspects of the training. Read articles about management training in online news sources, trade publications, and industry magazines.


If you need further guidance, there are management training program workshops that can give you the tools you need to create your own program.;
, Identify the things you want your managers to be able to do once they complete your training program. In addition, think about what qualities or values you want your managers to cultivate as a result of your management training. These values, just like the skills you teach, should be specific to your company. There is no standard set of values and skills that will be beneficial to all managers, so develop your own based on your operations and specific company culture.


For example, Disney's management training program places the most emphasis on improving interactions between employees and customers.
However, other management training program might focus on increasing collaboration between employees or another goal.
Whatever goals you choose, make sure they are realistic. Otherwise, you might alienate your management trainees., Your training may be structure in several different ways, each with their own unique advantages. For example, you might choose a self-directed training program or a classroom-style one. Whereas the classroom-style program may give you more control, a self-directed one will give trainees the ability to manage their own learning and may lead to more successful absorption of knowledge.


Another structure choice involves the formality of the program. Whether your program is best carried out formally or informally will depend on the specific culture of your company and the extent of the training provided., If you are running a very small organization, you might have to carry out the management training yourself. Otherwise, you have choices for who will teach your trainees. For example, you might choose for training to be run by existing management and executives. However, this would take them away from their other duties at the company. Another option is to hire an outside management trainer, training coordinator, or management training organization., Your management trainee class might be composed of employees promoted from within or outside hires. However, identifying who to promote and hire for these roles can be difficult. In some cases, your best employees might not be cut out for management duties. One possible solution is to allow employees to shadow a manager for a short time, like a day or a week. This will allow the employee to get a sense of the duties involved and give you a chance to assess their performance., Though there are basic skills every manager should have, there is also specific information you may want to cover during your training. Besides the skills listed below, identify foundational knowledge your managers need such as learning how certain processes work within your organization (e.g. turning in expense reports).


Leadership skills involve casting vision, inspiring others, and developing relationships with your employees.
Communication skills include conflict management, public speaking, business communication, and leading one-on-one meetings with their team members.
Supervisory or management skills incorporate tasks like directing others, solving immediate problems, and making sure work gets completed in a timely manner.
Technology skills help managers know how to use the technology available to them, whether mobile devices, computer software, or other computer applications.
Tactical skills include time management, stress management, and leading meetings.
Ethics and compliance training involves teaching managers about your company's code of ethics and how you expect them to conduct themselves as part of your organization.
Employment laws help managers understand and apply the law to specific circumstances, specifically discrimination, harassment, and termination laws., Use the format that works best for you and your managers and stays true to the values and mission of your organization. In general, training should be done in the style that it is meant to teach. This means that if you are teaching collaboration skills, your training format should be equally collaborative. Some specific format options include:


Computer-based learning or online learning. These are both cost-effective formats and can be very useful tools for individual study.
Live training with a facilitator. They can present good information while being there to answer questions or demonstrate specific skills.
Case studies offer practical applications. These can be incorporated into any format of training.
Physical activities such as manufacturing and simulation.
Group research.
Group tasks.
Lectures/readings., Management instruction is useful if managers are shown how to integrate that training into their work. Support your training efforts with real-world observation and demonstration. Make sure to use current operations to demonstrate applications, rather than irrelevant or out-of-date examples. Have leaders from each department assist in the instruction relevant to what they do.One option is to rotate management trainees through different roles within the company over a period of time. This will allow them to become acquainted with each part of your organization., Your training program will be composed at least partially of materials designed to convey specifics about your company and its processes. For example, you may choose to provide user manuals or a management handbook that lays out critical information that trainees might want to refer back to at a later date. In addition, you may want to create worksheets or computer courses that allow trainees to work through problems. Finally, case studies can be effective way for trainees to tie in their training with real-world events.


These materials should be designed to support and enhance lectures, group discussions, and group tasks., Pair trainees with senior leadership at the company during their training process. Mentoring allows each manager to receive personal feedback from the more experienced manager. Those in training can ask questions or listen to stories of past managers, realizing that they are not alone in any problems they are encountering. Allow the trainee and managers to individually meet and set the terms of their relationships, including the level of contact outside of formal training.


Allow them to spend time getting to know each other outside of a business context. This can help build trust that will lead to more effective learning., Determine how long the training program will last. It might be an ongoing process, where the program is repeated every 2 years or so in order to allow managers to review the information and continue learning. Or, it might be a more succinct process new managers go through individually. When you have a time frame, you can begin setting up a specific training schedule. Remember to allow for regular breaks, meals, and the performance of other work responsibilities, if necessary., Your training location choice will depend on your budget and training goals. You can train management in your workplace or someone's home for free or you can a rent a space from a convention center, retreat, or other local institution. Make your choice based on the specific needs of your training program and the number of trainees you have., In order to successfully implement your program, you'll need a way to assess how well it is working. You can track attendance, participation, performance, and post-training results as ways to assess how well your program is doing and whether trainees are benefitting from it. This might involve having trainers or trainees fill out forms to assess the learning experience or an analysis of trainee performance before and after the program., Your program should include provisions for management trainees to drop out or fail the program. Not every trainee will be cut out to become a manager, and your program needs a mechanism for recognizing that. For example, if you include tests or evaluations as part of your program, you can weed out those who score low marks. To keep trainee levels up, you can continuously recruit additional trainees to fill the gaps left by dropouts., Decide in advance how you will determine if your training is effective or not. One way to do this is to look back at your goals. If your goals identified what you wanted your managers to know, you can test their knowledge formally (e.g., test) or informally (e.g., casual conversation). Or, if you specified how you wanted your managers to act, observe their behavior as they interact with clients and employees.


Gather feedback from trainees about the program. What do they feel could do handled or taught better?, Use what you learn through your evaluations to make changes to your management training program. Like your trainees, your program is a work in progress and must be treated as such. If something isn't adding value, cut it out. Likewise, if trainees reported one activity as highly informative, extend the useful aspects of that activity to the rest of your program. Make changes frequently, being sure to update your materials and program plan as you go along."

Consider if there is a legitimate reason for the absenteeism.Sometimes, employees have compelling reasons for being absent.,
Understand what unexcused absences can mean.If you cannot determine that there is a legitimate reason for an employee’s absences, or if they are excessive, you will want to take steps to deal with the situation.,
Don’t ignore the problem.While it may not be pleasant, if an employee has a problem with excessive absenteeism, it is necessary to deal with it.,
Assess your management style.,
Set up a meeting.To directly address an employee’s absenteeism, set up a meeting between yourself, the employee, and any other relevant individuals (such as another supervisor or human resources representative, if applicable) to discuss the situation.,
Give the employee a chance to explain.,
Make a decision and get it in writing.If your workplace has an explicit policy regarding absenteeism, and the employee is in violation of that policy, then you will have to act in accordance with that policy.,
Terminate the employee, if necessary.,
Develop a clear absenteeism policy.Many instances of absenteeism can be prevented if your workplace institutes a clear, written policy regarding leave and work time.,
Track employee attendance.You can help employees follow workplace policies, and know where they stand in terms of work time and absences, by tracking their attendance.,
Institute performance reviews.",How to Deal with Excessive Absenteeism," An effective manager will accommodate and understand if an employee has a good reason for not attending work, especially if he or she can explain the absence ahead of time. Depending on your company’s policy and the employee’s situations, permissible absences might have reasons including:Sick leave
Maternity leave
Bereavement
Routine medical appointments
Accommodations for disabilities
Military leave
Court appearances
Jury duty
Voting
Approved time off
Religious holidays;
, The exact definition of “excessive” will depend on your company’s policies and expectations for employees. Common examples of the misuse of employee leave include:Frequent brief periods of absences for “emergencies” or “illnesses” that do not seem to be documented.
Frequent requests for absences just before or after holidays or other breaks.
Repeated absences on the same day of the week or at the same time.
Requests for absences at undesirable times (such as periods of peak workload).
Absences just before or after the employee receives notice of unsatisfactory performance.
Requests for sick leave or emergency leave after a request for regular leave was denied.
The amount of time the employee has been absent approaches or exceeds the amount of time the employee has worked.

, As a manager or employer, you cannot ignore the problem.


Having and enforcing sound policies is essential for creating an effective workplace.
If other employees see an employee get away with excessive absenteeism, their morale will be lowered and they may increase their own absences.
At a fundamental level, the employee-employer relationship is about showing up and doing the work; if an employee is absent excessively and cannot do his or her work, then that relationship is violated.

, Perhaps even more difficult than addressing an employee’s excessive absenteeism is recognizing that you may have played a role in causing it. Sometimes, however, management style can be a contributing factor in excessive absenteeism and other workplace problems. If you are not managing effectively, your employees may feel resentful and miss work as a result. Consider:


Do your employees feel valued?
Do you treat all employees fairly?
Do you consistently enforce policies regarding absences and other issues?
Do you make it easy for employees to communicate with you about problems and concerns?

,


Be proactive. Schedule a meeting as soon as you notice the problem, or it is brought to your attention.
Let the employee know the purpose of the meeting. The point is not to blindside the employee, but to let both sides communicate, determine the facts, and decide on a course of action.
Don’t assume that there is an inexcusable reason for the employee’s absences. Instead, offer to set up a meeting so that everyone can be clear with each other and understand the situation.

, Before deciding how to deal with the absenteeism, let the employee explain if there were any legitimate reasons for missing work. If the absences were due to a misuse of leave time or a violation of workplace policies, let the employee discuss any plans he or she has for improving in the future. You can use the employee’s explanation, if any, when determining what to do about the excessive absenteeism.


As an employer or manager, you can ask an employee to explain absenteeism, and ask for documentation (such as a doctor’s note) if necessary.
After hearing from the employee, explain any policies or expectations your workplace has regarding absenteeism.

, Otherwise, your decision will be based on the facts or explanation presented by the employee, your management style, and your own sense of judgment. Whatever your decision, make a written statement of it; deliver it to the employee and human resources office (if applicable), and keep a copy for your records. Some options include:


You may issue a formal warning to the employee, explaining that future absenteeism will result in more severe consequences.
You may require the employee to have special permission for any future absences.
You may decide to remove certain privileges from the employee, such as the opportunity to choose shifts.

, Termination is a severe consequence, even for excessive absenteeism. If you are thinking of terminating an employee due to excessive absenteeism, make sure it is necessary—for example, the employee has no legitimate explanation for the absences, and/or continues the behavior even after you meet to discuss the problem. In addition, you must make sure that termination is permissible according to any relevant employment contracts, workplace policies, and laws.If you plan to terminate an employee, consider sending him or her a written notice and explanation beforehand.Usually, you cannot terminate an employee on grounds of absenteeism if you only expect that the employee will miss excessive amounts of work; instead, there must be an actual record of absenteeism., If your workplace does not have one, work with your human resources department or other managers to develop one. This policy should outline things such as how to properly request leave, what level of absenteeism is considered a problem, and how excessive absenteeism will be dealt with.


Once the policy is developed, be sure to implement it and enforce it consistently.Make sure that your policy accounts for any applicable laws regarding acceptable absences for reasons such as maternity leave, medical leave, bereavement, etc.You should also consider whether you want to treat excessive tardiness as an issue of absenteeism.While it is important that an absenteeism policy is clear, it is also often prudent to reserve some flexibility.This will allow managers to use their discretion when necessary.

, If your employees are compensated hourly, their time and attendance is already tracked; you can help them, however, by making sure that this information is available to them at all times. Other types of employees can chart their attendance by formally recording days worked and leave time, by using an electronic entry system, a paper form, or some other means.


Some employers institute a point system. For example, employees can earn points for regular and/or consecutive attendance; these points can then be redeemed as necessary for leave or absences. If you implement such a system, make sure that it does not put employees on approved leave (such as maternity leave or bereavement) at a disadvantage.
You might also institute incentive plans to reward good employee attendance.These can range from fun and silly (employees with good attendance records can display a work mascot at their desk, for instance) to competitive (for instance, perks such as gift cards to a restaurant can be earned by working a certain number of days consecutively).

, Scheduled performance reviews with each employee, perhaps once or twice a year, can improve the workplace environment. If you have regular meetings with your employees, you may have the opportunity to discuss any absenteeism before it becomes excessive, as well as a chance to discuss overall work performance.

Consider the fact that there are at least four possible means by which one can debrief.,
Debrief with oneself.,
Debrief with a team.,
Debrief with the client.,
Debrief with peers.,
Keep a record of debriefing.,
Learn from the debriefing.",How to Debrief to Promote Organizational Learning," Alone, each of these methods has singular utility but they are most successful when combined as an overall strategy for turning an employee's learning experience into an organizational lesson. These methods are:


Debriefing with oneself
Debriefing with a team
Debriefing with a client
Debriefing with peers;
, Before taking your learning experience to a wider audience, it is important to go through your experience with yourself. This type of debriefing consists of asking yourself questions about the learning experience and keeping notes. In this way, you not only prepare yourself for sharing the experience more widely, but you also learn about the experience at a deeper level for yourself and hopefully also take this chance to reflect on how you might approach things differently next time if the learning experience was more of a negative one. Questions that you might ask yourself include:


What did I learn?
What lessons can I extrapolate from this experience to bring to the organization?
What was good about this learning experience?
What was bad about this learning experience?
How can I build on both the negative and positive aspects of this experience?

, Select the appropriate organizational team people who will benefit from your learning experience and who can expand upon its import for the rest of the organization. Initially, tell the team about the experience and about what you learned. However, this time you should also aim to elicit team responses to how they perceive the learning event and how they see its applicability to the organization. The team should be made up of individuals who are able to address issues that have been raised and come up with solutions, actions and outcomes.

, In a situation involving a client, the ability to ask the client about the experience is invaluable. This time, frame the questions using ""we"" and genuinely seek answers from the client that can help to improve both the client's experience and the working patterns and deliverables of your organization. This is not meant to be a confrontational exercise but is a genuine attempt to come to grips with areas of weakness in your organization and they may well be areas that nobody has considered before or has only danced around. Finally, clients appreciate being asked, so this does a great deal for building a strong relationship. Questions that you might consider asking the client include:


Did we do a good job for you this time?
If not, why not and how do you feel we could have made this a better experience for you?
Are there particular areas that you feel need greater attention?
What did you like about your experience with us?
Is there any particular activity or event that you believe is superfluous to the achievement of a good outcome?

, Peers in your profession are also benchmarkers and innovators. They are watching you and you are watching them. Touch base through networks and exchange ideas and thoughts over recent learning experiences in a broad manner that does not breach client or organizational confidentiality. You can, and should, share experiences with peers. Some may have answers to problems that you are facing, some may appreciate your answers to problems that they are facing. Developing strong relationships even within a competitive context is vital to ensuring that all clients are receiving the best advice, skills and up-to-date information, so it pays back for all of you. Questions that you might consider asking include:


Why did you resolve X problem in that way?
What additional benefits did you foresee doing it like that as opposed to the way Y?
What recommendations would you make to someone doing this same thing?
What do you think the outcome would have been if you had done Y?
What thoughts do you have about developing Z instead?

, Unless you debrief for personal reasons, it is always a good reason to keep file or notebook records of debriefing sessions. That way you, your team and your organization can continue to learn from past lessons and the discussions surrounding these experiences. It will also help you to better recall what each of your clients expects of you in the future and gives you a good indication of how your client's organization operates and the types of expectations under which that organization may be working.

, Don't just stick the notes in the bottom drawer. Pursue the lesson actively and put into practice what you have learned. If you, your team or your organization generally needs extra skills or a change in direction, start implementing the things that need to be done to achieve this. Book yourself into a conflict management course, book team members into an updating seminar on the industry in which you work or make proposals for changes in direction about the ways that things are done, produced, manufactured and delivered within your organization. Use every debriefing session to build upon the last, to continuously strive for improvement from the individual level to the wider organizational community.

Consider the future.,
Write a True North statement.True North statements indicate a change in direction.,
Reflect on your past.,
Start with small improvements, rather than grand, large-scale changes.,
Be consistent.,
Paint the big picture.,
Give clear instructions.,
Make your True North statement your personal or business mantra.,
Participate in your vision.,
Allow experimentation.Making room for creative approaches and even failure fosters a positive working environment and allows employees to bring their own talents to the table.,
Show appreciation publicly.,
Incentivize employee objectives.While verbal praise offers emotional reward, tangible benefits (such as time or money) also reinforce a job well done and create a positive work environment.",How to Develop a Culture of Continuous Improvement," The demands of the present often take priority in our work and non-work lives. However, having a vision for the future and long term goals are the starting point for improvement. Start by considering where you see yourself and your company in five to ten years.Be honest and specific as you consider where you are now and where you want to be in the future, and determine what you need to do to get from point A to point B.
For example, if your business has issues with quality control, identify the recurrent issue and map out a plan that resolves it.
Privilege behavior over production. It’s easy to say, “My company will double our profits,” but improvements never happen without changing behaviors. Changing outcomes is a benefit of changing habits, attitudes, and skills.;
, Consider your business goals and write a few statements that address these goals, and then determine which statement best fits your long term plan.A True North statement for a business might be “100% customer satisfaction.”

, After deciding on your True North statement, itemize past behaviors that could hinder your overall goal. These behaviors must be modified in order for you to reach your goals., Think “quality over quantity”!Small improvements allow you and/or your employees to see results more quickly, which can be a positive reinforcement. While large improvements are of course the goal, not seeing results for years can foster a sense of disappointment or hopelessness. Local improvements can also serve as a model for large scale changes. , Changing everything at once can cause confusion and frustration. Make one change and make sure it sticks before making another change. Strive for consistency also as you implement these changes. For instance, if your True North statement was ""100% customer satisfaction,"" one change you might make is to set a standard time span for responses to customer complaints.If you decided that all customer complaints should be answered within six hours, be sure to keep that change consistent.

, Employees should understand how they, individually, contribute and are necessary to the larger goals of the company, not just in terms of how what they do benefits an increased profit return, but also how what they do matters in the larger world., Having clear guidelines and clarifying your expectations from the start is important for any collaborative or individual work. Showing employees how to do something versus telling them how can also clear up any initial questions.


However, demonstrate trust by allowing employees to be in control of their own work. Allow them to determine how they can best complete the task at hand or to make modifications to the changes so that they can complete their work efficiently. , This phrase should be repeated often. Your employees should know the True North statement and how it is important to their own projects and daily tasks., Be visible as someone contributing to the goals in everyday ways, rather than simply “overseeing” your employees. Actions speak louder than words! If your employees see you interacting with customers and responding to customer complaints, you are serving as a model for future behavior and reminding them through your actions that this goal is important to the overall success of your company.Although administrative work is a large part of managing a company, schedule regular intervals to step outside your office and help your employees with their tasks.
If you run a retail business, for example, help out with stocking inventory, ask customers if you can help them find anything, or work the register.

,


While the goals you have itemized in your plan should be consistent across the board, understand that your employees have different ways of thinking and a variety of skills. One employee’s method for resolving a customer complaint, for instance, might not be what you specifically envisioned—it might be even better!
Consider posing situational examples in group meetings and asking employees how they would resolve the problem. For instance, “X customer has a screaming baby and can’t find Y product. How would you help him/her?” Thought experiments can then be tested in the work environment. In the following meeting, have employees reflect on how these experiments went in actuality.

, Everyone needs affirmation, and highlighting jobs well done both reinforces new habits and skills and inspires others to do well. Make a point to give praise immediately when possible. Set aside time in weekly or bi-weekly meetings to compliment employees on what they are doing well. Mention specific instances when you have observed an employee utilizing a new skill or behavior that is part of your long term vision and reaffirm how that small act is important to the larger goals.

,


For example, if your True North statement was “100% customer satisfaction,” you might offer a bonus to employees who have had no customer complaints for a month.
To promote a collaborate environment, you might choose to reward all of your employees with a nice group dinner or a weekend trip if your company meets the quarterly goal.

Without this key assessment, you won’t know what sort of people you need to grow your company. Most importantly, assessing the state of your company will help you determine your management weaknesses and strengths.

, Creating an organizational chart for your company will help you to identify which managers are responsible for which aspects of your business. You might find out that you have overlap or you are lacking key personnel to manage an aspect of your organization. Fundamentally, an organizational chart will help you visualize your company and get a better idea of where you have gaps in leadership., Without a strategic plan, you won’t know where your business will be in the short and long term, and as a result, you won’t know what sort of managers you’ll need to meet your goals. Once you’ve developed your strategic plan, you’ll be better able to identify your management team needs.


Determine the state of your business.
Plan where you want to be in 1, 5 and 10 years.
Decide what you need to do to get there. Does this involve expanding into a new market?, This is perhaps one of the most important steps in creating a successful management team. After all, the buck stops with you. You can’t know or do everything. Don’t see your weaknesses as a strength. Fundamentally, understanding your weaknesses and taking steps to remedy those weaknesses is actually a strength.


Spend some time reflecting on your own weaknesses to determine what sort of help you’ll need running your company.
If you lack sales skills, you will need a strong Sales Director on your team.
If accounting is not a strength, you will need a Chief Financial Officer or Finance Director.
Be willing to include managers who are better than you at certain things. You will need to put your ego aside for the sake of your business., It is very hard for people inside an organization to identify the organization’s strengths and weaknesses. This is for several reasons, but it’s often because we’re unable to critically evaluate ourselves. As a result, you should request an assessment from someone outside of your organization. This outside auditor might be able to identify weaknesses in your management team better than you.


Hire an outside consulting firm to assess your business and management team.
Survey your clients on your business.
Talk to colleagues and friends in your industry., Sometimes the people who best know the problems with an organization are those within it. Make a concerted effort to get input from your employees and partners about your company. Listening to a wide range of opinions will help you determine who you really need on your management team.


Create a way for anonymous feedback and constructive criticism within your organization.
Put together a board of advisors made up of senior managers and senior employees. Even if your business is small, having a group of advisors you can regularly rely on will help you streamline your management.
Regularly visit and talk to and listen to your employees – at all levels. , This might seem like something you don't want to do, but in order to go forward, you need to assess your current team to see if they meet or exceed the skills and performance you need to meet your goals and achieve your strategic plan.


If a current manager does not measure up, consider letting them go, demoting them, or reassigning them to a position that better suits their skill set.
If current managers seem gifted and skilled but are in the wrong position, reassign them to positions that will allow them to use their talents the best.
Communicate with your managers throughout the assessment process, try to be transparent, and treat your managers with respect.

, Using all of the information you’ve gathered, implement change and create the best management team possible for your organization. Don’t be afraid to let people go, demote people, have people switch positions, or even promote junior employees above more senior employees. Your goal is to create the best management team you can.

, If you have a few employees who know your company well, consider which ones have leadership potential. Often times, people who already work in your company will make the best managers. Consider the qualifications of your current employees, and if you have someone who meets the criteria for a management position, promote them.


Communicate to your employees that you are restructuring your management team, and you are looking to promote or create new positions.
Approach current managers and see if they have any ideas about employees that are management material.
Talk to the employees who you think might make good members of your management team. Discuss their level of interest and your overall vision for the organization. , Since you now know what areas of your company need stronger managers, you can focus on hiring talented individuals in your industry who have an expertise that you need. Search wide and make sure to advertise your search in a number of publications and outlets.


List job openings with major online job sites.
Advertise positions in trade journals and newspapers.
Communicate your need for new managers at conferences and to other business leaders you know personally.
Send someone to job fairs at college campuses, in your community, or at national conventions and conferences., Locating new managers through less public channels might be good if you have a small company and you know exactly what type of person you need. This way, you can personally recruit people you’ve met at conferences or through other channels, and you’ll be confident as to their abilities and their character.


Attend national conferences and conventions related to your industry and meet new people you might recruit.
Browse LinkedIn or other online professional networking sites for people you may know, or people who might be in your broader network.
Talk to other senior executives or business owners about your need. They might know someone who fits the position you’ll be hiring for., If you have a good idea of the position you want to hire for, but no idea where to look, invest in the skills of a professional headhunter or executive recruiter. This service might result in your finding the exact type of candidate you need.


You’ll have to pay a fee to the search firm.
The search firm will tailor their search to your exact needs.
Search firms often draw on a much larger geographical area and on a larger pool of possible candidates than you might be able to reach on your own., When hiring a new part of your management team or creating a new position, make sure that the individual’s role is defined clearly. There is nothing worse than having managers coming into conflict with each other. Taking care of this potential problem ahead of time will reduce the possibility of conflict in the future.


Explain your broader expectations for each manager as a member of your team.
Make sure managers have authority to act independently when they need.
Explicitly outline the nature of a manager’s job and responsibilities., One of the most important things you’ll need to do is develop a culture within your organization that nurtures best practices, communication, and collaboration. This, though, can be very difficult to achieve, and will take substantial effort over time.


Explicitly outline your company’s core values to your employees. If you’re in service, you should include something like customer satisfaction. If you’re in manufacturing, you should name quality.
Lead by example. Leadership sets the tone of a company’s culture. Whatever your core values are, make sure you live them and demonstrate them every day to your employees and to your customers.
Nurture your employees and treat them as valuable members of a team. Employees won’t follow your lead if they don’t respect you, and if they feel you don’t respect them., Communication is perhaps the most important part of running a successful company. Your management team should communicate and make sure that your employees are communicating with each other.


Set up group meetings. Every month or two, you should have a meeting of your entire management team to discuss challenges and issues confronting your company.
Set up individualized meetings. Once you have your management team assembled, meet with your managers at least every couple of months to talk to them about the challenges and opportunities they face every day.
Set up socials every couple of months. Company sponsored picnics or baseball games are a great way for everyone to get to know each other and to open the lines of communication during off-hours. This will also help reinforce your company culture., Respect is key in creating a management team that successfully interacts with each other in order to grow the company. Managers who respect each other and the top leadership of the company are more likely to go above and beyond in order to fulfill their jobs.


Treat your managers the way you would want to be treated.
Offer competitive pay and bonuses for excellent work.
Listen to your managers when they have concerns or suggestions.
Explain your expectations. The members of your newly formed management team will need to understand clearly their roles and responsibilities., Do not be afraid to give up some of the things you have had to manage out of necessity. Once you’ve got your management team in place, let them do their jobs. After all, you hired them because you had faith in their intelligence and ability. Not relinquishing power and authority will only undermine everything you’ve tried to accomplish., Managers do not perform well if they have a lot of responsibility, but no authority. A good chief executive will observe their managers and assess their work periodically, rather than micromanage.


Trust your management team to make good decisions and oversee their respective departments properly.
Never micromanage. If you had enough faith to hire someone, let them do their job without interference.
Authority also includes proper resources (money and people).
More authority given to managers down the chain of leadership will enable managers to deal with problems quicker and take advantage of opportunities faster., goals. Launching a management by objective plan that is clear and laid out to your managers will help build your management team by keeping everyone focused on common goals. A S.M.A.R.T plan will enable you to better assess your managers when the time comes. These goals are:


Specific. You need to describe the specific goals everyone should work to achieve.
Measurable. Your manager's work towards their individual and shared goals should be measurable, and they should understand those metrics.
Achievable. Your goals need to be achievable. They should not be goals that can only be achieved under the best circumstances or be merely aspirational.
Relevant. Your goals need to be related to the business strategy being implemented. Focus is key to achieving long term objectives.
Time-based. Your goals need to be set with a time frame in mind. For instance, if you hope to increase sales by 10%, your goal should be to increase sales by 10% in a year, not during some vague period of time., Another important part of building a strong management team is to make sure that team is functioning all the time. Make sure to monitor your team and assess individual work and team collaboration regularly. This will let you know if your team is working well and succeeding.


Review reports of your managers on the goals you’ve laid out to them.
Meet with your team members constantly, not only if something is going wrong.
If a team member has demonstrated consistent success, reward and praise them. Criticize them in private, not in front of the rest of the team.
If a team member has failed at their job several times, consider replacing them or reassigning them."

Rather, they should be adapted to the particular demands of a situation, the individual requirements of the people involved, and the specific challenges facing the organization. For example, when first beginning to work with a new group, it might be a good idea to adopt a more authoritative, proactive style of leadership. As your group becomes more competent and confident working together, perhaps you can relax and take a more laissez-faire attitude.;

They show passion about the group achievements which spreads to the team and super-charges the group, enabling the collective to accomplish goals quickly, effectively, and to polish the final result with a shine of perfection.

, Not only must you communicate the goals, effective strategies, and your vision, but you must also lay the ground work for meaningful one-on-one communication between group members. Good leaders should communicate their sincere caring and concern for the individuals verbally and nonverbally. The good leader opens the door to communication when one team member seems closed to another.

Be assertive yet accepting of realities.",How to Become a Smart Manager," This is perhaps one of the most important parts of being a smart manager, through knowledge and ability you become respected and performing the task becomes much easier.;
, People often forget that they themselves are doing the activity and so they constantly forget to enhance themselves and constantly try to enhance the activity, but if you enhance yourself then every activity that you do will be enhanced.

, Time limits inevitably make you smarter because you have to be able to do lots of things within a certain time, this leads to making what you do count, remembering 'how' to do things efficiently and also to hard work. Knowing your goals allows you to measure your progress.

, Are they motivated? Are they well? Do they like each other, do they work together harmoniously? Through gaining basic but vital intelligence on your team, you can tailor the work to suit the needs of the team.

, By doing this you can make sure that each member of your team gets the right kind of work, it would be foolish to give mathematics work to the linguist of your team and the written work to the mathematician.


You can also manage the team so that people learn from one another and better themselves.

, If a team is inspired, they will be full of energy and work to the best of their ability, if not then they will  even hate coming into work.


Keep morale high by various means - good spirited competition, good dress code, scheduled 'play' time such as nights out and team building exercises and regular breaks.

, It is important that there is respect amongst the team and respectable assertiveness is essential.


The realities of the matter are that people make mistakes, not everything will be perfect al the time and on occasion things happen that you did not intend. if you start shouting at everyone or being ignorant of the realities then this loses the respect of the team and thus progress becomes relatively halted.

Know what time period you wish to calculate labour turnover for.,
Establish the the mean average and total amount of people employed during this period.,
Think of which type of labour turnover you wish to calculate.,
Calculate the labour turnover.",How to Calculate Labour Turnover,"

Seeing as labour turnover is an applicable statistic for a chosen length of time, this step is necessary. As an example, from the years 2012-2013.
;
, This does not, however, refer to the amount of positions available.


As an example, say 55 people were employed on average and 80 were employed in total throughout the chosen timeframe of 2012-2013.


, Categorizing by reason of unemployment can also provide a greater insight.

You can use categories such as ""voluntary"" or ""involuntary"", for example. These categories may be arbitrary but they can aid in predicting future trends. As an example, say you would like to calculate the voluntary labour turnover for the years 2012-2013.


, In order to calculate labour turnover correctly, the following formula is used: The average Number of unemployment during a period ÷ Number of employees of that given period x 100.

So, if the previous examples are used, the business with 55 average employees and 80 total employees, the labour turnover would be: 55÷80x100 = 68.75% (remember that labour turnover is percentage calculation).

You can then further calculate labour turnover in your chosen categories and compare percentages.

Leave the rag on for three to five minutes, or until the washcloth cools down.Repeat at least three to four times before doing anything else to the ingrown hair.;
, After you have covered the area with a warm compress multiple times, you can try to get the hair to break the surface. Very carefully, use a pair of tweezers to gently nudge the ingrown hair to the surface. Try to straighten the hair to make it start growing the right way.Find the free end of the hair with the tweezers. Gently pull that hair out of the skin. Do not pull the hair all the way out. Just pull the free end out of the skin. If you pluck the hair out, another may grow in its place.
Don’t try to dig out the hair. If you can’t grab the free end, wait until the next day and try again.
Use tweezers that have been disinfected with alcohol., Once the free end of the ingrown hair has been pulled out, leave it alone for 24 hours. While the skin is resting, continue to place the very warm compress over the hair every two hours. Check to make sure the free end of the hair remains free.Using the warm compress helps to keep the hair and the skin soft.

Only spit when it's absolutely necessary.,

Spit at someone's feet to communicate insult.,
Don't spit on your hand to seal a deal.,

Spit tobacco juice into a receptacle.,
Spit on the ground to ward off bad omens.",How to Spit," Spitting needs to be done as cleanly as possible to be courteous to others who are around. It's typical to need to spit when you're sick with a cold, using tobacco, or are working physically.


Never spit indoors, unless you're using a receptacle of some kind. In the case that you are using a receptacle, as in wine tasting or tobacco chewing, it's important that you keep your receptacle concealed. Nobody wants to sit next to your empty water bottle filled with brown tobacco juice at the library. Put it away.
Don't make a habit of spitting just to spit, even if you're outdoors. If you're sick, or have a serious need, that's the only time you should be spitting in a courteous way.;
, There's no way around it: spitting is gross. To help make it less gross, it helps to avoid spitting in places where people will be able to see it. If you're indoors, spit into the toilet and flush it. If you're outdoors, spit into a hanky and put it away. If you're tasting or chewing, spit into a proper receptacle, like a bottle or a can, then dispose of it.


Sometimes, when you're outside working, it's just not possible or practical to spit into a hanky. If this is the case, walk a few paces away from where you're working and spit off the beaten path. If it's particularly gross, kick some dirt over it for good measure.

, Whether you're indoors or outdoors, it's rude to spit on the ground where someone might be walking and risk stepping on it. Don't do it, and if you're going to spit on the ground at all make sure it's out of the way.


If you're playing sports and spit on the field, it's sometimes common courtesy to stamp it into the grass so your gross loogie isn't sitting at the 50 yard line for everyone to fall in.

, Spitting is a social taboo and many others look on it as a disgusting habit. If you must spit, do it quickly, quietly, and get it over with. Drawing attention to yourself while you're spitting is rude in most cultures. Try to do it quietly and quickly, without a lot of preamble or fuss.

, You don't want to make a mess, so it's important to do most of the work before you spit. Gather the liquid or the saliva you're going to spit on top of your tongue to spit it out. Keep your cheeks in tight to your teeth to keep things in one place.

, Your lips need to be rounded to avoid spritzing your spit or experiencing any gross blowback. Nobody wants reverse fire. To keep it grouped and to keep your spit clean, round your lips as you prepare. Keep your cheeks caved and your lips tight.

, No drooling. Get it all out at once. Take a breath and quickly blow the spit out from your mouth as quickly as possible. It should stay together if you've done it properly.

, If you want to spit for distance, you need to arch your neck and put your back into it. As you snap forward, blow your spit out and see how far it goes. Be very careful with your aim.


Generally, it's best to spit as close as possible to the ground to avoid making it gross. Bend over at the waist over your receptacle and spit.

, In some cultures and especially in baseball, it's common to spit on the ground, close to someone's feet, when you want to insult them. This is a common way of expressing disgust.


This is always insulting. Because of this, it can also be provocative and confrontational, which could lead to an escalation in a tense situation. Be very careful if you ever attempt to do this.

, It's a common trope in hyper-masculine television shows that two men will spit on their hand before shaking to ""seal a deal,"" but this is purely a product of pop culture, not a common tradition in any culture.If you've just bought a house and want to seal the deal with the realtor, just shake hands in the regular way. No spitting necessary.

, To avoid consuming too much alcohol during a wine tasting, it's traditional to spit the wine out into a bucket after tasting each different variety. Buckets will often be provided at professional tasting events, but they may not be. If you'd rather spit, make sure you locate a receptacle before taking wine into your mouth and never just spit it onto the ground.


If you're only going to be tasting a few varieties, it's always perfectly ok to swallow the wine instead. Just get a designated driver.

, It's common practice to keep the sidewalk and other surfaces free of tobacco stains by spitting into a jar, bottle, or receptacle that you keep on your person, ideally out of sight. Even if you're going to be outside, it's a good idea to spit tobacco into a receptacle.


Old-style spittoons were first introduced to help control the spread of tuberculosis and other communicable disease spread by contact with bodily fluids. Spittoons are still common in some public buildings, including the United States Senate., In Northern India and some other regions, it's thought that spitting on the ground can help to ward off the possibility of bad omens. If you're a superstitious person and find a black cat crossing your path, a bird flying into your house, or you find yourself walking under a ladder, consider spitting courteously and quietly. It's good luck.

Try spot exfoliation.,
Moisturize with honey.,
Use moisturizer on the hair.",How to Remove Ingrown Hair on Your Face2," You may also use spot exfoliation to help remove the ingrown hair. Remember to be very careful with the area. Use gentle, circular motions to try and dislodge the hair. Make a natural exfoliant at home instead of buying something from the store.Mix ½ teaspoon of baking soda, sea salt, or sugar with one to two tablespoons of olive oil. Use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply the mixture to the infected ingrown hair.
Use the tips of one or two fingers to gently rub the exfoliating mixture using circular motions. First, rub in using three to five clockwise motions. Then reverse, using three to five counterclockwise motions.
Rinse off with warm water and pat.

, If you have an ingrown hair, you can start trying to get it out by using honey. Honey not only moisturizes the skin, but it also acts as an antibacterial. This helps prevent infection. The honey also helps to loosen and draw out the free end of the hair.Use a Q-tip to apply a small amount of honey onto the ingrown hair. Allow it to remain for 20 to 30 minutes, or until it is dried.
Rinse the honey off with warm water and pat dry. Repeat twice a day.

, One of the things you want to make sure you are not doing is over-drying your skin. Over-drying your skin can make the ingrown hair harder to extract. You want to keep the skin moist while you are trying to get the hair out. Use a bit of moisturizer on the infected hair after every treatment.This can help soften the skin and can reduce the risk of skin damage and scarring.

Refrain from digging out the hair.,
Avoid removing more hair from the area.,
Recognize the dangers of ingrown hairs.",How to Remove Ingrown Hair on Your Face3," Ingrown hairs are a nuisance, especially if they are on the face. You may be embarrassed, or they may be causing you pain; however, you should never try any bathroom surgery and use tweezers, needles, pins, or anything else to dig out an ingrown hair. This increases the risk of infection or scar formation.Don’t break the surface of the skin by digging, cutting, scratching, or anything else. This can cause irritation, infection, or scarring.
You can try to leave the hair alone to let it heal naturally.

, If you have an ingrown hair, don’t try to remove any more hair from that area. As soon as you notice it, stop shaving or waxing that area immediately. You should also stop shaving, tweezing, waxing, or removing the hair in the affected area until the ingrown hair has been cleared.Once you have removed the ingrown hair, try to leave that area alone for a few days. For men, if the ingrown hair was in are area you shave everyday, consider not shaving for a few days.
You may try alternate methods of removal, such as clippers or depilatories.

, Ingrown hairs irritate the skin and can form bumps that may be itchy or become extremely painful. Ingrown hairs may also become infected. If they get infected, they may become filled with a whitish or yellowish-greenish pus.Sometimes, the bumps get darker than the surrounding skin and this can cause permanent discoloration and scarring.
Ingrown hairs can also result in scars, especially if a person tries to use a needle, pin, or other object to dig out the ingrown hair.
Most of the time, you won’t need to see a doctor because of ingrown hairs. However, if you are afraid the hair has gotten too ingrown or hurts too bad, you can see your doctor.

Refrain from using alcohol-containing products.,
Use a warm compress before shaving.,
Massage oil or cream into your face using circular motions.,
Talk to your doctor about medications.,
Consider laser hair removal.",How to Remove Ingrown Hair on Your Face4," Ingrown hairs on the face happen more commonly in men after shaving. To help prevent this from occurring, avoid using any products that contain alcohol when you shave.Products that contain alcohol can dry and irritate your skin, which may lead to ingrown hairs.
Use a natural moisturizing shaving product based on plant oils or other hypoallergenic substances. This will decrease the chance that the product will irritate your skin and make acne worse.

, Another way you can prevent ingrown hairs from occurring is to use a very warm or hot washcloth to hydrate your face before shaving. The water will soften your facial skin and hair and make your facial hair easier to cut. If your hair is easier to cut, you will have less risk of irritating your facial skin, and a straight cut across the hair will decrease the risk of ingrown hair.Keep the warm to hot washcloth on your face for three to four minutes. If you need to keep adding hot water to keep it warm, do that.
You can also shave after you get out of a hot shower.

, Applying your shaving oil or cream the proper way can help soften the hair and get the hair ready to shave. The motions should be against the grain. This will ensure that the oil or cream gets to the base of the facial hair. You also should leave the cream on for a few minutes before shaving.Use light, gentle strokes while shaving, especially when shaving areas that have acne.
Make certain your razor has a sharp blade. Replace old razors often with a new razor blade or new razor as needed.
Moisturize your face after shaving using a natural moisturizer to avoid chemicals that may irritate your skin.

, Topical retinoids, low dose corticosteroids, topical antimicrobials, and alpha-hydroxy acids may help lessen the instances of ingrown hairs. You can also ask your doctor about topical eflornithine, which can slow the growth of facial hair.

, If you want to permanently remove the hair or if you have chronic ingrown hairs, consider laser hair removal. It is a quick treatment that works on short hair and can deliver permanent results. It can, however, also be costly, require multiple treatments, cause scarring or blistering, and be painful.Talk to your doctor or dermatologist about this possibility.


There are some at-home laser treatments on the market, but you may not want to experiment with these on your face, as you could cause damage without really realizing it. Leave the laser therapy to the professionals — your safety is work the extra cost."

Find your whole number.,
Put the whole number off to the side until the end of this problem.

,
Look at your fraction.,
Put the numerator ""in the house"" or inside of the long division symbol.,
Put a decimal point and zeros after the number inside.,
Use the bottom number (denominator) on the outside of the long division symbol.

,
Do the division.,
Once you find the decimal answer, place it next to your whole number from the original inches value.",How to Convert Inches with a Fraction into Inches with a Decimal2,"  Normally, it is the larger number next to the fraction.


For example, 2 1/2.  The 2 would be the whole number.

,,  Find the top number (also called the numerator).

,  


So for 1/2, you would put 1 inside the long division symbol.

,  


1 would become 1.000.

,, Make sure that the decimal inside the long division sign lines up with decimal on top.

,  (You may need to round the decimal to a few decimal places if it has a lot of them.)  


For example, put .5  from your calculation with the 2 from your initial value to get 2.5.

Use a toilet seat cover.,
Use automatic plastic seat covers.,
Make a toilet seat cover with toilet paper.",How to Sanitize a Public Toilet1," Public restrooms may have toilet seat covers made of lightweight wax paper that you can place on the seat. Use these covers to create a barrier between your skin and the toilet seat, which may help you from coming in contact with bacteria.These covers are usually on the wall of the restroom or in holders in each bathroom stall.
If there is any material on the seat or it is wet, wipe it off with some toilet paper before you place the cover on the toilet.
Place the cover with the center tab hanging down into the water so that it flushes away after use.
Consider carrying a personal single-use toilet seat cover for situations when no cover is available.;
, Some public restrooms now have automatic plastic seat covers that seal the toilet each time it is flushed. These will automatically create a barrier between your skin and the seat and don’t require you to touch the toilet in any way.


Consider resealing the toilet twice if you notice any material in the toilet. Some studies show that water from the flushing toilet may spray the plastic cover, making it less hygienic., Some public restrooms don’t offer toilet seat covers. If this is the case, you can easily make one out of toilet paper. This will create a barrier between your skin and the seat and may help protect you from any bacteria lingering on surfaces.Place a single or double layer of toilet paper around the toilet seat.Flush the paper cover so that it isn’t on the seat for the next user.

Know where to find the cleanest public bathrooms.,
Go for the first stall.,
Do not put your belongings on the bathroom floor.,
Do not be afraid to sit on the toilet seat.,
Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.,
Limit your contact with surfaces, such as door handles and sinks.",How to Safely Use a Public Bathroom," To limit your contact with bacteria and germs you should try to only use toilets in hospitals and buildings that are cleaned regularly. Hospitals usually have the cleanest toilets as they use disinfectants often and heavily.Avoid bathrooms in airports and on airplanes. Airplane bathrooms are very small, making it difficult for people to wash their hands, leading to bacteria on surfaces you cannot help touching when using the tiny bathroom on the plane. Airports are high traffic areas and their bathrooms may not be cleaned enough due to the high volume of people using them throughout the day.;
, People tend to use the middle and back stalls of the bathroom for a bit of privacy, so go for the first stall to limit your exposure to bacteria and germs. It will likely be less used and cleaner than the other stalls in the bathroom., A study found that the highest concentration of germs in public bathrooms are on the bathroom floor. The second highest concentration of germs are on sanitary napkin disposals and the sinks and water taps in bathrooms.Avoid picking up any bacteria or germs from the bathroom by hanging up your bag or coat on the hook rather than placing it on the floor, or leaving it outside with a friend while you use the bathroom.


If there is no hook on the back of the door of the stall, you can hang your bag around your neck or keep your coat on as you use the bathroom. These options may actually be more sanitary than putting your belongings on the floor.

, Skin contact with urine or fecal matter on the toilet seat may be unpleasant, but they are not clear health hazards. You are more at risk of picking up germs and bacteria through touching bathroom surfaces with your hands and then not washing them, rather than through your skin on your bottom.If the psychological implications of the toilet seat bother you, you can certainly still hover over the seat or use a seat cover in a public bathroom. However, you should avoid touching the toilet handle or the stall door with your hands as you can easily transmit bacteria from your hands to your face or your mouth without realizing it.

, This seems obvious, but it is essential that you always wash your hands well after you use a public bathroom. This will cut down significantly on the transfer of bacteria and fecal matter from your hands, via surfaces in the bathroom, to your face, mouth, or eyes.To properly wash your hands, use soap and lather your hands for 20 seconds. Then, rinse your hands well and dry with a paper towel or a hand dryer. Avoid touching the bathroom door as you leave, as some people may not have been as good about washing their hands as you and you don’t want to pick up any germs or bacteria.

, If possible, try to restrict your contact with surfaces in the bathroom so you do not get bacteria or germs on your hands. Use the automatic soap dispenser if it is available and the automatic taps to wash your hands. An automatic hand dryer can also be a good way to avoid having to touch the paper towel dispenser on your way out of the bathroom."

Brush your teeth for 2 minutes twice a day.,
Floss once a day.,
Use antibacterial mouthwash to clean your whole mouth.,
Stay hydrated.,
Chew sugar-free gum.,
Chew on fresh parsley to temporarily remove bad breath.,
Add more zinc to your diet.,
Visit your dentist and oral hygienist every 6 to 8 months.",How to Remove Bad Breath1," This is the number one thing you can do to fight bad breath. Using a toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste, brush in the morning and evening every day. Set a timer for two minutes or listen to a short song to keep time, since most people do not brush for long enough.If you are really worried about bad breath, brush after every meal.


Don't ""scrub"" your teeth hard -- hold the brush like a pencil and brush in light circlesHold the brush at a 45 degree angle, just along the edge of the gum line.
Be sure to brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth as well.
Replace your brush every 2-3 months.;
, Flossing is still the most effective way to remove food and plaque from between your teeth, where it can irritate your gums and lead to bad-smelling bacteria growth. Be sure to get each tooth from each side.


The floss should form a ""C"" shape around the tooth.
Only floss at the gum line. If your gums start bleeding, rinse your mouth and resume gentle flossing.

, Use antibacterial mouthwash a few times a week after brushing and flossing. Never use mouthwash with alcohol since it dries out your mouth and worsens your breath in the long-term.Mouthwash generally masks bad breath instead of curing it, so make sure you are still brushing and flossing frequently.

, Dehydration is a major cause of bad breath, but it is easily remedied. Make sure you drink 4-5 glasses of water a day to keep your mouth healthy and clean., Gum promotes saliva creation in your mouth, which helps keep your mouth moist and the bacteria in balance. However, gum with sugar in it will make your breath worse, as sugar feeds the bacteria in your mouth and creates worse breath.


Having a piece of sugar free gum right after a meal can help keep your mouth healthy., Leafy green herbs like parsley contain chlorophyll, which is known to naturally deodorize your mouth. Chew up several sprigs for a quick breath freshener.Fresh basil, cardamom, rosemary, and green tea also have similar deodorizing properties

, Zinc, found in some mouthwashes, helps fight halitosis and prevent bad breath. It can be found in pumpkin seeds and other gourds (like squash), cacao, and organ meats like liver. It is also an essential part of most multi-vitamins and can be purchased as a supplement at your local pharmacy.

, Professional cleanings will remove plaque and help you notice any issues before they become problems. Be sure to make regular appointments and ask your dentist any questions you have about your breath.

Get vaccinated.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Be as healthy as possible before entering the hospital.,
Shower with chlorhexidine soap.",How to Reduce the Risk of Hospital Spread Infections1," Some infections and diseases can be prevented with proper vaccinations. If you get the vaccinations you need each year, you can avoid catching certain infections, such as the flu. The flu can lead to serious complications, especially if you are trying to recover from a surgery or other serious health condition.Many adults do not have the vaccinations against hepatitis B and pneumococcal disease (which can cause pneumonia). If you have not had these vaccines, speak with your doctor;
, Doctors are aware that patients have concerns about contracting infections in the hospital, and they should be willing to talk to you about it. For instance, if you're going to have surgery, ask about how the hospital lowers the risk that you'll get an infection.Tell your doctor if you've been sick recently, as that can increase your chance of infection. If your doctor knows of your illness, the hospital can take extra steps to help prevent infection.In some cases, the surgery will need to be delayed until the infection is treated and brought under control, or else it can spread to the surgical site.Also, ask if you can be tested for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Many people carry this bacteria, but it can be introduced into your system when you have a surgery or are in the hospital, which can lead to a dangerous infection. If you test positive, your doctor and staff can work harder to prevent infection. You should have the test done at least a week before you enter the hospital., If you have a scheduled surgery or hospital stay, getting as healthy as possible before going in can help you fight off infection. One big step you can take is to stop smoking, as that can increase your chance of infection.Also, try exercising and eating healthily to boost your immune system and be at a healthy weight.
Monitor your blood sugar if you're a diabetic. If you keep your sugars in range, it can help you fight off infection.

, For at least three days before your hospital stay, shower once or twice a day with chlorhexidine soap. This soap is an antibacterial soap that can help remove bacteria from your skin before you enter the hospital. Often, infections are introduced to your body by bacteria on your own skin, so removing some of it can help prevent infection.You can usually find this soap over-the-counter at most pharmacies or from online stores. If you can't find it, ask your doctor about it.

Wipe the seat clean with toilet paper.,
Carry disinfecting wipes with you.,
Carry small alcohol wipes.,
Carry a travel-sized disinfectant spray bottle.",How to Sanitize a Public Toilet2," Use some toilet paper to wipe the toilet seat until it is clean and dry. This will create a dry surface for you and may help remove some bacteria and germs on the toilet seat.


You can use plain toilet paper or you could wet the paper with some water and a little soap.
If you carry hand sanitizer, you can also use toilet paper to wipe a few squirts of hand sanitizer over the toilet seat before use.

, Use flushable disinfectant wipes wipe surfaces in a public restroom from the seat to the toilet and door handle. These wipes may help prevent you from coming in contact with bacteria and germs.


Many companies offer travel size packages of disinfecting wipes that you can easily carry in personal bags.
Make sure the disinfecting wipe is safe for contact with skin. Wipe the seat with some toilet paper after disinfecting to dry it.
To prevent clogging the toilet, check the label on sanitary wipe packages before flushing.
Use more than one wipe if necessary.

, Carry alcohol wipes, which are effective at killing bacteria and germs, if you like. They are inconspicuous and may be gentler on skin than a disinfecting wipe.


Wipe the seat thoroughly and dispose of the alcohol wipe in the trash. Allow the seat to dry before use.
You can get alcohol wipes at most drug stores or grocery stores.

, Many cleaning product lines offer disinfectant sprays that can be transferred to a travel-size spray bottle for easy use in public restrooms. These sprays may help prevent you from coming in contact with bacteria and germs.


Apply the spray liberally and allow it to sit on the seat for as long as the directions recommend.
Wipe the seat with clean toilet paper after spraying sanitizer solution.

Squat over the toilet seat.,
Use a stall with covered toilet paper.,
Flush the toilet with a covered hand or your shoe.,
Sanitize your hands.,
Don’t touch the door when leaving the restroom.,
Ask the facility staff to clean the toilet.",How to Sanitize a Public Toilet3," In the event that a public restroom is unsanitary and there are no covers or disinfectants available, you can squat over the toilet. This will keep you from coming into contact with the seat.

Make sure to keep your underwear from coming into contact with the seat.

, One way to help ensure you come into less contact with bacteria in a public restroom is to seek out a stall with toilet paper that is either mostly or completely covered in a metal or plastic holder. This may help protect against splattering toilet water and bacteria or germs.If the toilet paper is not covered in any way, use any tissues you might have or paper that is as far off the floor as possible.

, The handle is usually the most unsanitary part of a toilet. Many public restrooms now have automatically flushing toilets, but some still require manual flushing. Covering the handle with toilet paper or your shoe may keep you from coming in contact with bacteria and germs when flushing manually.


You can use either a new seat cover or some toilet paper to touch the handle when flushing.

, A recent study showed that contaminated hands and fingers can easily transmit bacteria and germs from restrooms. Washing your hands properly or using hand sanitizer after using the bathroom will help protect you from viruses and bacteria.The proper way to wash your hands is to lather for at least 20 seconds and rinse under warm, running water.
Use a hand sanitizer either after washing, or if there isn’t any soap available.
Dry your hands with paper towels when available. Some studies have shown that air dryers may spread around more bacteria., The restroom door can also harbor harmful bacteria and germs, in particular if people who don’t wash their hands touch it. Use a piece of paper or your elbow to touch the door when leaving the restroom. This may help keep you from coming in contact with bacteria and germs.Also avoid touching hand dryer buttons and sink handles as much as possible for this same reason.

, Many public toilets are regularly cleaned with strong disinfectants. If the restroom is unsanitary, request that a staff member clean the toilet and stall before you use it.


If you regularly use the public restroom, check the cleaning schedule if you can. Try to time your trips to occur immediately after scheduled cleaning visits.

Avoid spicy foods, garlic, and onions.,
Quit using tobacco products.,
Cut back on alcohol consumption.,
Rinse your mouth after every meal.,
Eat a complete, healthy diet.",How to Remove Bad Breath2," Unbalanced bacteria in your digestive tract can lead to bad-smelling odors and gasses that make it into your breath. Probiotics, found at most supermarkets and pharmacies in the supplement section, help restore the balance of bacteria to your gut to improve your digestion, and your breath with it.

, These foods will cause bad breath no matter how much you brush your teeth. That's because, as they are digested, odor-causing chemicals seep into your bloodstream that are later breathed out through your lungs.If these foods are unavoidable then bring sugar-free gum or a small travel mouthwash and use it after eating.

, Many cases of chronic bad breath are cause by cigarettes or chewing tobacco, which stain teeth and damage your gums. This can lead to bacteria growth and bad breath., Beer, wine, and liquor can lead to bad breath 8-10 hours after you finish drinking.Alcohol dries out your mouth, and the sugar in most drinks feeds bad-smelling bacteria.

, This is especially helpful if you cannot get to a toothbrush quickly. After eating, swill around a few sips of cool water and spit it out to remove food particles that could lead to bad breath.

, Be sure to eat a full diet of natural fruits, vegetables, and grains. Foods and drinks with a lot of sugar, like sodas and candy, will contribute heavily to bad breath.


Low-carbohydrate diets (few breads, pastas, grains, etc.) will lead to bad breath as your body releases ""ketones,"" a foul smelling chemical.Fasting and extreme dieting can lead to bad breath which cannot be brushed away."

Check for gum disease.,
See the dentist immediately for any cracked fillings and cavities.,
Recognize potential stomach conditions that lead to bad breath.,
Check the side-effects of your medication.,
Know that certain chronic conditions will lead to bad breath.",How to Remove Bad Breath3," Periodontitis, or gum disease, is when your gums recede from your teeth and create pockets of bacteria. Not only can periodontitis lead to uncontrollable bad breath, it can damage your teeth if not dealt with quickly. Symptoms include:


Inflamed or sensitive gums.
Loose teeth.
Bleeding or pain while brushing., These are hotspots of infection that will cause bad-breath. If one of your teeth hurts constantly or becomes suddenly sensitive to temperature changes you should make a dental appointment as soon as you can.

, Conditions in your stomach like acid reflux can create bad smelling gas and chemicals that make it to your breath. Check with your doctor if you have a chronic upset stomach, trouble with digestion, and bad breath that lingers after brushing and mouthwash.


If your bad breath comes suddenly then if could be a sign of a larger condition. Make an appointment with your physician as soon as you can., Some medications can, unfortunately, lead to bad breath. Usually side-effects like ""dry mouth"" will lead to bacterial imbalance in your mouth, which in turn leads to bad breath.

Look for signs of infection.,
Keep an eye on your IV.,
Pay attention to how often you go to the bathroom.",How to Reduce the Risk of Hospital Spread Infections2," One of the primary steps you can take as a patient is to wash your hands thoroughly as often as you can. Always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. It's also important to wash your hands after touching railings or other public surfaces in the hospital,as well as both before and after you eat.Get your hands wet, and add an antibacterial soap. Most hospitals have antibacterial soaps available. Be sure to get the soap all over your hands, including between your fingers.
Rub the soap in for about 20 seconds. You can mark this time by singing the Happy Birthday song twice.
Run your hands under water to wash the soap off, and then dry them with a clean paper towel.If you can't wash your hands in the sink, ask the nurse for antibacterial hand wipes., It's equally important that anyone who visits you also washes their hands. Ask them to wash their hands when they enter your room and also before they touch you if they've been in your room a while and touched other surfaces.Hand sanitizer is also effective, but not against certain microbes. Ask people to wash their hands whenever possible.
Visitors should also wash their hands upon leaving, so they don't spread anything from you to anyone else.If one of your friends or family members is sick, ask them to skip visiting until they feel better., When your nurses and doctors enter the room, ask them if they'll wash their hands if you notice they haven't. If your doctor or nurse is worth their salt, they won't hesitate to do it. In fact, they know they should be doing it anyway, but some may forget.You could say, ""I notice you didn't wash your hands. I understand you're busy, and you probably just forget. I'm really worried about catching an infection, so would you mind washing your hands before examining me?""

, The most efficient way to keep it away is to try not to touch your mouth. When you're in a hospital, you are, of course, going to touch surfaces. Those surfaces can harbor bacteria, and bringing your hands to your mouth can allow them to enter your body. In addition, don't place anything you're eating with on the bed or other surface in your room., When a nurse or doctor brings equipment into your room, ask about cleaning procedures. Equipment like heart monitors should be cleaned between every patient, and some other equipment, such as needles, should be one-time use., Catheters can lead to urinary tract infections. Of course, they are necessary at times, but you should ask each day if it's still necessary for the catheter to be in. You want to get it out as soon as you possibly can., Of course, your doctors and nurses should be looking for signs of infection, but you should also keep an eye out, too. Look for swelling and redness near surgical sites, as well as near catheter insertions. You may also notice pain or warmth.If you notice these symptoms, talk to your nurse or doctor. They will take the appropriate steps to help you deal with the infection, such as removing the catheter or prescribing antibiotics.

, If you have an IV while in the hospital to receive fluids or medication, the site where the needle enters your skin should stay dry. If it looks dirty or wet, tell a nurse, who can come and change it, or at the very least, clean it up., If you have diarrhea in the hospital, that can be a sign of infection. If you're on an antibiotic and you have diarrhea at least three times in 24 hours, you should talk to your doctor about it."
"
Evaluate the patient's need for isolation.,
Determine other at-risk patients.,
Practice good hand-washing procedures.,
Wear gloves.,
Clean insertion sites.,
Clean stethoscopes.,
Keep the room clean.,
Keep patients on the same ward.,
Skip the white coat.",How to Reduce the Risk of Hospital Spread Infections3," Patients may need to be isolated for two reasons. Some patients may need to be isolated to protect them from infections from other patients. Other patients may need to be isolated because they have an infection that could be passed easily.Patients who may need to be isolated because they are a risk to other patients include those with epidemic strains of bacterium, those with skin rashes, those who have communicable diseases, and those who have diarrhea.
Patients who need to be isolated for their own good include those with compromised immune systems.
Isolate patients in rooms with tightly sealing doors. Patients who are a danger to others should have negative-pressure ventilation, while those who are more in danger of infection should have positive-pressure ventilation.

, Certain patients may have a weakened immune system or other condition that makes them more susceptible to infection. For example, people who are in shock or who have had major trauma are at a higher risk for catching an infection. You will need to be more vigilant with at-risk patients.Older patients and very young patients are also more at risk, particularly those over 70 years of age or young children (who are sick) and infants.
Other conditions that put patients at risk include those in comas, those who've taken antibiotics in the past, those on drugs that compromise the immune system (such as chemotherapy), and those with acute renal failure. Diabetes can also contribute to a compromised immune system., Studies have shown that most professionals think they wash their hands more often than they do. They also think they wash their hands for longer than they do. In other words, you probably think you are washing your hands enough for a long enough period, when in reality, you're not doing it as much as you should.Make sure to wash any rings and then remove them to scrub away as much bacteria as possible. Scrub your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, and rinse them under the water.
Wash your hands after every time you touch or deal with a patient, as well as after removing gloves after patient care. If you are doing an activity that may contaminate the hands, such as touching contaminated equipment or working on a person's bedding, then gloves should be worn, and hands washed immediately after removal.When entering a patient room, you should immediately wash your hands. When leaving a patient’s room, hands should be cleaned again.
While hand washing is better than hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer does reduce the spread of germs and can be done more quickly than thorough hand washing.

, When examining a patient, it's important to wear gloves in addition to washing your hands when dealing with any wounds or moist surfacesWhen you wear gloves, remember to wash your hands immediately upon their removal.Wear clean, sterile gloves for surgery and for sterile procedures. Wear non-sterile gloves when touching blood, other body fluids and contaminated items and any other potentially infectious materials.Change gloves when changing procedures on the same patient to avoid spreading infection from a contaminated area to a clean area.Remove your gloves after caring for the patient and change gloves between patients. Wash your hands after removing the gloves, and before donning new gloves for the next patient. Never wear the same pair of gloves to examine multiple people., When inserting anything into a patient, from IVs to catheter, it's important to clean the site first. Chlorhexidine is a good choice, though some hospitals also employ alcohol swabs to clean the skin before insertion., Stethoscopes can pass infections between patients if they aren't cleaned properly. Best practices suggest you should clean stethoscopes at least once a day with a cleaning agent such as a non-ionic detergent or isopropyl alcohol, focusing particularly on the diaphragm., Rooms should be cleaned thoroughly after each patient, including the floor and bathroom. While the patient is there, the room should be kept as dry as possible to lower the ability of bacteria to spread. Equipment should also be cleaned between patients.Patients' rooms need to be cleaned with hospital-grade disinfectants.Particular attention should be paid to all the surfaces the patient comes in contact with, including the television remote, the bed rails, the telephone, the doorknobs, and the faucet handles.

, As often as possible, patients should not be transferred. Of course, patients should be transferred if it's absolutely necessary, but every time a patient is moved, it increases the chances of infection spreading across the hospital., When examining wounds, skipping the white coat can be beneficial. These coats often harbor bacteria, particularly in the cuffs and pockets. A plastic apron is a better choice, so you should take off the coat and put on an apron when preparing to examine a wound.Though it looks nice, male doctors should also skip wearing neckties for the same reason."

Use a fine-toothed louse comb to help identify living head lice.,
Look for nits (head louse eggs) at the base of the hair shaft using the same technique.,
Use a magnifying glass to make identification of head lice easier.,
If you find lice or nits, be sure to treat the person showing signs of head lice.",How to Recognize Head Lice1," Head lice move quickly and avoid light, so a fine-toothed comb will be handy in a thorough examination.


You can check for lice with both dry or wet hair. If you're checking with wet hair, wash and condition your hair before going over you hair with a comb.
In order to check your hair with a fine-toothed comb, use these steps:
Use an ordinary brush to detangle hair
Switch to the fine-toothed comb and start combing at the front middle of the scalp
Comb the hair from the roots to the ends, examining the comb after each stroke
Do this over your entire head


People with thicker hair may want to look for lice after washing their hair. In this case, using conditioner, or one tablespoon of olive oil, may make running the nit comb through your hair easier.;

Try a non-prescription lotion or shampoo. Their main ingredient is often 1% permethrin. Apply the lotion of shampoo as directed, waiting 8 to 12 hours and then checking for active lice again.
Try a prescription strength lotion or shampoo. Malathion 0.5% may be prescribed in cases where non-prescription lotions or shampoos do not have the desired efficacy. It is supposed to be left in the hair for a period of 12 hours.
Make sure the lice don't spread:
Wash all clothing and bedding in hot water immediately
Remove any lice and eggs you comb out of the person's hair
Do not share clothing, especially articles like hats that are worn on the head

Communicate.",How to Be Ahead of Change (A Manager's Perspective)," This cost applies even to the front line managers charged with implementing the change event. The questions running through your mind possibly include: ""What is it?"", ""How to I feel?"" and it's possible that you're saying to yourself something like: ""I can't assist others if I am still wrapped up in my own resistance level."";
, Consider how you feel about the upcoming change and express it in your own words. Write down some key points of these feelings that you will be comfortable sharing with others later.

, It is perfectly normal and it is simply part of the process. Expecting it means that you'll be prepared with ways to work around it.

, Remember that you wrote down your feelings about the change? Now is a good time to share some of those feelings, along with how you have faced the concerns and have found the upcoming change to be a good outcome rather than a threat. After discussing the elements of change with your team, discuss with your team members one-to-one, so that you are giving individual attention to unique concerns. In advance, have reasons already prepared to talk about how the upcoming change will benefit the individual involved. If there is no benefit, be honest about what will happen and how the firm intends to support the person in question.

, Have all the reasons ready and be specific and focused.

, Find ways to ease the transition, including being available for your staff members at any time. Be as transparent as you are able to be, and where there are confidential issues at stake, be assertive with your bosses about how to address the unknowns with your staff.

, These fears are: failure and loss of control. Appeal to a person's need and how the change will help him/her in the long run, or even the short term.

, Allow time for questions, venting, both as a team and as individuals. Invite questions. Even if there are none, pose rhetorical ones about how people might be feeling and answer these. Make it clear that there is no such thing as a stupid questions and there is always a right time to ask questions.

,,,, At all times, keep the lines of communication to your employees open. Keep them updated on the change process as things unfurl.

Know the common symptoms of body lice.,
Examine your skin for any irritations.,
Check the skin for lice.,
Turn an article of clothing inside out.,
Examine the seams.",How to Recognize Body Lice Symptoms1," When body lice feed they can cause an allergic reaction in the skin. These reactions include:intense itching
rashes on the skin, particularly the armpit and waistline areas of the body
red spots or elevated bumps on the skin
thickened or darkened skin;
, Irritations on the skin can be caused by bites or by repeated scratching--both are indicators of body lice. Repeated scratching can also cause further blistering, which can lead to a bacterial or fungal infection.Be sure to check the waistline, upper thigh, and groin areas specifically.

, Sometimes body lice can be seen while feeding on the skin. Although this is not very common, you should nonetheless examine the waistline, upper thigh, and armpit areas of the body for lice. Body lice are the same approximate size, shape, and color of a poppy seed. Check any areas of the skin that are irritated.
Check any areas of skin that are darkened or calloused.
A magnifying glass will help, but is not absolutely necessary.

, Body lice live mainly in the seams of clothing.Only after hatching and maturing, do body lice invade the skin.Although it is rare, body lice can lay eggs directly on the human body., Mature lice cannot live longer than five-to-seven days after falling off a host. Because of this, it is more common to find lice eggs, or ""nits,"" in any article of clothing .


Nits are oval in shape, and can be yellow or white.
Nits are generally found in the waistline and armpit areas of clothing.Nits will hatch in one-to-two weeks."

Relax.,
Think positively.,
Be social.,
Avoid tobacco, alcohol, and drugs.,
Get a decent amount of sleep.,
Practice proper hygiene.,
Take your hygiene to the next level.",How to Rarely Get Sick," If you didn't have reason to diet before, now you do. Research shows that those who eat 25% less than normal rarely get sick. Your cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure levels will all lower, resulting in a healthier you.



Be careful. This is a diet that's incredibly easy to do incorrectly. It is not about starving yourself -- it's about eating a little less than the average Western diet.;
, Before you do this, it's advisable to talk to a doctor. What vitamins and nutrients does your diet lack? He/she will know what to recommend you. A diet that's high in all the good stuff -- especially vitamins A, C, D and iron and zinc -- will keep your immune system ticking on all levels.


Many believe in sprinkling Brewer's yeast into their morning breakfast. Just a tablespoon gives you all the B vitamins your body needs.

, You know how sometimes you feel like all you need is a breath of fresh air? It's your body telling you exactly what it needs! It gives you a break from all those inside germs and gets you moving -- and that gives your ""killer"" cells a much needed boost.


Take your run to the trails! Even if it's not workout time, make an excuse to get outside. Walk the dog, wash the car, go for a picnic, a hike, mow the lawn -- just breath that fresh, clean air.

, Do cardio workouts to get your heart pumping and your blood moving. They strengthen your immune system, in addition to helping with weight loss, inflammation, and fighting disease. But when it comes to developing immunity, it's because it ups your white cell blood count -- the stuff that fights bad bacteria and viruses.Or do some other form of exercise that strengthens and tones your body that will also increase the strength of your immune system. As long as you're up and moving, you're doing yourself a favor.

, The easiest way to do that? Eat less processed food. Proper nutrition will make your body stronger and help keep your immune system in good shape. Drink enough water, and try to eat organic foods -- the less processing your food has gone through, the better.


Aim for color in all your meals. Green, leafy vegetables are especially full of proteins that help your immune system stay strong. But every color group has vitamins and nutrients that your body craves.
Want a few super foods to stave off the illness? Go for apples, garlic, oranges, and ginger. They're jam packed with immuno-building vitamins and minerals.

, If all that's not enough, you might as well just buckle down and get the shot. Contact your doctor to see if you're a good candidate. One needle and you'll be good for the entire year.


The flu usually peaks around January or February. If you're interested, try to get your shot beforehand! Even your local pharmacy may be able to administer you the vaccination.

, One of the best things you can do for yourself is to avoid stress. Lower cortisol levels keep your body functioning as normal, but it's also about your daily habits: when you're stressed, you sleep less, exercise less, and eat more. Two things not good for impending sickness!


There are actually stress hormones called glucocorticoids. Over the long-term these hormones wreak havoc on your system, blocking other cells from doing their jobs.When this happens, you become more susceptible to even the weakest of viruses.

, Similar to the destress mantra, it's of utmost importance that you think positively. Research shows that happy people -- and those who don't worry about getting sick -- don't get sick! Turns out that positive thinkers produce greater amounts of flu antibodies, though scientists don't really understand why.Relaxing and getting happy may be all your body needs.


It sort of makes sense -- the happier you are, the less stressed you are. The less stressed you are, the better you sleep, eat, and exercise -- really, the better you do everything.

, Research has long shown a connection between loneliness and isolation and poor health.We as humans are meant to be social creatures -- when we're not, even our bodies suffer, not to mention our minds. So be social! Use it as excuse to go have fun with your friends. You'll destress and get happy at the same time -- double duty for your fighting responses.


Make it quadraple-y effective by going outside and exercising! Grab a few friends and hit the pool or go for a hike. Do something apart from staying in and drinking the night away. Do something different!

, Because duh. These things all wreak havoc on your health, not only leading to disease and, ultimately, imminent death, but weaken you on a smaller level every single day. They also stress you out, mess up your natural cycles, and just make simple things harder. So cut it out!


Cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol are all toxins. They get in our systems and wear them down. Sometimes the effects can't even be felt, but they're there. 1 drink is okay, but not more.

, This means every night. Adequate sleep relieves stress and allows your body to recover from daily activities. A 2009 study showed that anything less than 7 hours tripled your chances of getting a cold.So aim for a solid 7 hours (no interruptions) every night of the week. That might mean sometimes not going out, but it's worth it for your health.


The opposite end of the spectrum isn't great either -- too much sleep isn't good for you, either. So resist sleeping till the afternoon on the weekends -- it will just make you more tired during the week anyway!

, Apart from showering regularly, here's the down low:


Carry a hand sanitizer with you to use as much as you'd like. Stay away from bar soap as it can carry germs; opt instead for the kind with a dispenser
Always thoroughly dry your hands. Damp hands can cultivate bacteria.Brush, floss, and gargle. A lot of bacteria festers in our mouths. Aside from general health, poor oral hygiene and gum disease have been linked to more serious diseases, too, like diabetes., Though being a germophobe isn't a joke, picking up a few of their tendencies wouldn't be a terrible thing. If you're taking this not-getting-sick thing seriously, here are a few things to try:


Wash your hands when you come home.
Avoid doorknobs. Use a tissue to open doors.
Wash your hands after making contact with strangers.
Wear plastic gloves when dealing with food preparation.
In public areas, touch nothing. Use your foot to flush the toilet, a paper towel to turn on the faucet, etc.

Look for the following symptoms a tickling feeling or an itching sensation in your hair.,
Look for sores on the head caused by scratching.,
Look for small red bumps on the scalp.",How to Recognize Head Lice2," It's pretty much what it sounds like. Humans are allergic to the (very small) amounts of saliva that lice inject into the skin in order to retrieve blood.If you have intense itchiness in your scalp area, check for head lice.

, These sores can sometimes become infected with bacteria normally found on a person’s skin.

, These bumps are caused when the lice farm blood from your scalp. They may ooze or become crusty."

Maintain a regular personal hygiene regimen.,
Visit your physician.,
Use a pediculicide.,
Delouse personal items.,
Machine-dry articles of clothing in high heat.,
Seal articles of clothing that you do not want to destroy in a garbage bag.,
Vacuum upholstery, mattresses, and carpets thoroughly.",How to Recognize Body Lice Symptoms2," Most cases of body lice will go away once the body has been cleansed of any nits or lice.Unlike hair or pubic lice, body lice only invade the body when they need to feed and are not consistently present on the skin.


Nits are rarely laid on the body.

, Your doctor will be able to provide you with prescription creams and body-washes that will help reduce any skin irritations or allergic reactions that may have resulted from body lice feeding (or from excessive scratching).

, In extreme cases, doctors may recommend the use of a pediculicide. Popular over-the-counter pediculicides include ""Clear,"" ""Rid,"" and ""Nix."" Pediculicides are designed to kill lice in one of two different ways.


Ovicidal pediculicides kill nits and only need to be used a few times.
Non-ovicidal pediculicides kill mature body lice, but not nits. It is therefore recommended that non-ovicidal pediculicides be used on a regular basis to avoid re-infestation (from nits that hatch).

, Be sure to wash all articles of clothing, bedding, and towels in water that is at least 130-degrees fahrenheit.This will kill any lice or nits.

, Unfortunately, machine-drying certain articles of clothing may not be possible. Due to the high risk of re-infestation, however, you should consider destroying these pieces., Isolate infested items in a garbage bag for five-to-seven days, then rewash separately., Vacuuming will remove any lice or nits that may have made their way into the seams and cracks of furniture.Nits can lay dormant for up to two weeks, so it is imperative that you prevent them from being transmitted to another host by eliminating their presence in common areas."

Look for pain and stiffness in the plantar fascia ligaments.,
Consider whether the pain is severe, and gets worse following specific movements.,
Think about whether the pain becomes duller throughout the day.,
Consider other possible causes of pain.",How to Recognize Plantar Fasciitis Symptoms1," The main symptom of plantar fasciitis is the pain that arise from the inflammation of the plantar fascia ligaments, pain is known to be located at the bottom of the foot down the heel with about four centimeters from it in the direction to your toes.


The site of pain is said to be tender while physical examination with signs of heel stiffness, pain and heel stiffness come from the inflammation process happening from the continuous irritation and stress exerted on the ligaments that can cause tiny tears in them.
Tearing can lead to fluids escaping from the soft tissues nearby and out of the small capillaries to form heel swelling and localized edema in a degree according to the severity of your ligaments’ injury, this can cause the pain to be felt at the bottom of the heel with a degree of motion limitation, that can cause patients to limp in severe cases.;
, Pain is prescribed to be severe and in his strongest conditions in the early morning when the feet first touch the floor, other known times of strongest pain attacks are when standing for prolonged times, sitting or lying down too long then standing or moving, climbing up stairs or walking tiptoes, these all are because of heel stiffness then trying to move the foot, that can bring all the pain when moving the plantar fascia ligaments.


Climbing stairs cause sudden sole stretch while moving your both feet on the stairs, which can trigger the severe pain at the irritated and weak ligaments, while sleeping the hours of night; the plantar fascia ligaments become more short and get stiffed for a long time, when the patient wake up and take his first step out of bed, pain is said to jump to the extreme when he raise his heel off the floor.
This move cause a sudden stretch that force the plantar fascia ligaments to expand strongly after being shorted all the night, the over stretch or trying to lengthening the ligaments stimulate all the pain right under the heel, making it so painful to walk at the early morning.
That explains too why the pain seem to decrease after making few steps around as the ligaments start to get a degree of flexibility allowing the pain intensity to decrease a little bit, this pain is also felt after a long time of sitting on the working desk or standing through the daytime.

, Pain can return dull or decrease in its intensity during the day or after performing light activities for short times, the reason for this is that the joint undergoes a degree of suppression in its stiffness degree as a result of both muscles and ligaments acquire looseness and flexibility with daily moves.


However; pain degree can be increased to the maximum right after finishing any kind of physical activities or long walking as a result of the high strong inflammation that is formed right after stopping.
Patients describe their pain to be very severe after the activities or in the other previous examples that were mentioned previously like prolonged standing, sitting, climbing stairs or in the early morning; to be as a burning or stabbing sensation, while it can be dull or mild during performing the activities themselves.

, Patients can experience plantar fasciitis in one foot, or in both to be unilateral or bilateral, and pain to be decreased when resting, note that if you experience pain at nights, that is not from plantar fasciitis, other differential diagnosis medical conditions could be like arthritis (Inflammation of different body joints, in this case heel joint) or tarsal tunnel syndrome (Pressure on the tibial nerve running through the ankle, that can cause symptoms similar to the plantar fasciitis).


These could be more likely causes, the later can affect the tibial nerve functions to give numbness, tenderness, and weakness of the muscles and tendons, but these symptoms would be felt at the whole foot area, and in the toes too, not only under the heel like in plantar fasciitis.
Another condition is also called Calcaneal stress fracture that affects mainly the calcaneus bone at the heel, pain of this medical condition would be only restricted to the calcaneus area and to be tender on both its sides, and at the back of it too.
Achilles tendinitis is the inflammation of the tendon located at the back and above the heel, and so making its pain to be located mainly at these points, pain and tenderness can be radiated under the heel too that would be correlated with plantar fasciitis pain, doctor correct diagnosis is required to evaluate your medical condition and to follow a therapy plan that best suits your medical case."

Avoid peak hours, if possible.,
Don’t touch your eyes or mouth during a workout.,
Cover any cuts or broken skin with a bandage before you come to the gym.,
Wash your hands before, during, and after a workout.,
Disinfect equipment before and after use.",How to Protect Yourself from Gym Germs1," More people means more chances of catching germs. Try to avoid early mornings and evenings after work, since that's when the gym will typically be packed. Aim for late mornings (between 10am-noon), afternoons (between 4-6pm), or weekend mornings to find the gym less busy.;
, This is a good habit to have in all public places. The eyes and mouth are common points of entry for germs into your system. Try to keep your hands away from your face, unless you are wiping sweat with a clean towel., Your skin is part of the immune system and acts as a barrier for bacteria. Broken skin means a gap in your protection, so be sure to cover it up. An antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin can also be applied under a bandage for additional protection, and to heal a cut faster., Use soap and water to do this. Be sure to lather up for at least 15 seconds. When you wash your hands after touching different surfaces, the likelihood of introducing an infection into your system is lessened.Hand sanitizer will work as well.

, Your gym should have a spray bottle filled with disinfectant and paper towel. Spray the surfaces which come into contact with the body such as handles and seats, then dry with paper towels.


After your workout, spray the equipment again, as a courtesy to others.

Sanitize your linens when you have a cut or sore.,
Tell your healthcare providers that you have MRSA.",How to Prevent MRSA Infection," MRSA is usually spread to patients in hospital settings by other human hands - usually those of a healthcare professional who has touched someone with the infection. Since hospital patients frequently have weakened immune systems, they are particularly susceptible to getting an infection. While this is by far the most common way that MRSA gets spread, it's also possible to contract it in other ways.For instance:


MRSA can be spread when someone touches a contaminated object, like hospital equipment.
MRSA can be spread between people who use each other's personal items, like towels and razors.
MRSA can be spread between people who use the same equipment, like sports equipment and showers in athletes' locker rooms.;
, MRSA is actually carried by 30% of healthy people without them even knowing it.It lives inside the human nose, and often doesn't cause a problem, or leads to only minor infections. However, when it does take hold over a weakened immune system, MRSA does not respond to most antibiotics. This makes it very difficult to contain once the infection has begun to have negative effects.


MRSA can cause pneumonia, boils, abscesses, and infections of the skin. It can also get into the bloodstream and lead to serious health problems.

, People in hospitals - especially those who have had a surgical procedure of some kind, which leaves their bodies prone to getting an infection - have been at risk of getting MRSA for decades. Hospitals and other medical facilities now have protocols in place to decrease the risk of patients getting MRSA, but it is still a problem. A new strain of MRSA now affects healthy people outside of hospitals - especially in school locker rooms, where children tend to share equipment., Even people doing their best to keep their patients safe make mistakes every once in a while, which is why it's important for you to take the initiative to control your own environment. Here's how to do it:


Hospital staff should always wash their hands or use hand sanitizer before touching you. If someone is about to touch you without first taking this precaution, ask them to wash and use hand sanitizer. Don't be afraid to speak up for yourself.
Make sure that your IV tubes and catheters are inserted under sterile conditions - that is, that the person inserting them wears a mask and sterilizes your skin beforehand. Places where the skin is pierced are prime entry points for MRSA.
If the conditions of your room or the equipment being used seem unsanitary, alert hospital staff.
Always ask visitors to wash their hands, and ask people who aren't feeling well to visit another time, when they're better., Keep germs off your hands by washing them with soap and warm water or using a hand sanitizer containing at least 62% alcohol. When washing hands, scrub them briskly for 15 seconds and dry them with a paper towel. Use a separate paper towel to turn off the faucet.Be especially careful to wash your hands frequently in healthcare facilities, schools, and other public places.
Teach your children to wash their hands correctly.

, If you are being treated for a skin infection, ask your doctor if you should be tested for MRSA. Otherwise, he or she may prescribe medications that don't work on antibiotic-resistant staph, which may delay treatment and create more resistant germs. Getting tested may bring you closer to getting the antibiotic you need to treat your infection.


A general willingness to speak up in healthcare facilities is important when it comes to protecting yourself from MRSA. Don't assume that your doctor knows what's best.

, Take all of the prescribed doses of an antibiotic, even if your infection is healing. Don't stop unless your doctor tells you to.


Improper antibiotic use contributes to the bacteria's ability to resist the medicine causing them to morph against antibiotics that have the same composition as Methicillin. That's why strict adherence to antibiotic schedule, even if you're well, is advised.
Throw away antibiotics after you have used them. Don't use antibiotics that were used by someone else or share your antibiotics with others.
If you've been taking an antibiotic for a few days and your infection has not improved, consult your doctor.

, Children are more apt than adults to poke someone's cut, leaving both the child and the other person at risk of getting exposed to MRSA. Tell your children that touching someone where they're bandaged should not be done.

, Regularly clean and disinfect the following high risk rooms and surfaces at home and in schools:


Any and all sports equipment that comes into contact with more than one person (helmet chin guards, mouthpieces)
Locker room surfaces
Kitchen counter tops
Bathroom counter tops, toilets and any other surface that has come into contact with an infected person's skin
Hairdressing facilities
Daycare facilities

, Many teams share equipment like helmets and jerseys. If this is true for your team, take a shower as soon as practice is over, every time. Remember not to share towels.

, According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms include staph infections that appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that may be red, swollen, painful, warm to touch, full of pus and usually accompanied by fever. If you know yourself to be an MRSA carrier, even if you don't have a live infection, it's important to prevent it from spreading to other people.


If you think you may have MRSA, have your doctor test the site to determine what type of infection you have.
Don't hesitate to act if you are concerned. If you suspect you have an infection, it is not going away, or it is getting worse go to the hospital. MRSA spreads quickly through the body.

, If you have MRSA, washing your hands is vitally important. Wash with soap and warm water, and do so each time you enter or leave a medical facility.

, Keep them covered until they heal. The pus from infected sores could contain MRSA, so keeping your wounds covered will prevent the spread of bacteria. Be sure to change your bandages frequently, and throw them away carefully so that no one else will be exposed to them.

, Avoid sharing personal items like towels, sheets, athletic equipment, clothing and razors. MRSA spreads through contaminated objects in addition to direct contact.

, You can do this by washing your towels and bed linens in a washing machine set on ""hot"". Wash your gym clothes after each time you wear them.

, This is information they need to know to protect themselves and other patients. Be sure to tell your doctors, nurses, dentist, and any other medical personnel with whom you come into contact.

Consider whether your ligaments have been exposed to repeated stress.,
Know that the disorder is more common in older people and athletes.,
Think about whether you are an overpronator.,
Understand that obesity can contribute to plantar fasciitis.,
Know that wearing the wrong shoes can lead to plantar fasciitis.",How to Recognize Plantar Fasciitis Symptoms2," Being an inflammatory disorder; the plantar fascia ligaments can be inflamed when are exposed to continuous or severe stress, stress can cause minor injury to result in a kind of inflammation that make light pain to be felt under the heel, but repeated stress and continued shocks on the ligaments can actually make them weaker that can be irritated, persistent irritation would increase the risk of straining the ligaments and can easily cause tiny tearing to them, considered as a common heel problem; many people can get plantar fasciitis, if you are one of the people who have to stand for prolonged times on your feet, you may have higher risks than others.

, The disease is more common in middle aged populations in the range between 40 to 60 years but somehow younger people can also experience it like with athletes, who are at higher risks of making sudden wrong moves.


Foot twist or wrong landing that can hurt their plantar fascia ligaments in a way or another, in addition; runners can have this disorder in great chances especially if they run on rigid surfaces like asphalt.
These rigid surfaces create greater resistance power that come up to the runner’s feet, and can easily absorbed by their ligaments, muscles or tendons to be hurt badly if safety precautions weren’t followed correctly.

, Another condition that can help in developing plantar fasciitis could be like foot over pronation; a condition describes when the person’s foot roll inward in an unnatural way that can lead to lose of the normal arch of the foot.


Overpronated persons will depend more on their big toe and the second to push their foot off the ground in a trail to stabilize their body, that would make big stress on and irritation of their muscles and ligaments, including the Achilles tendon and as in this case; the plantar fascia.

, Obesity can also be a reason in developing plantar fasciitis disorder, over weighted persons are at risk to have it when their extra body weight is always loaded on the feet, that can cause continuous pressure and stress on the plantar fascia ligaments with every foot and heel joint move.

, The incorrect choice of your shoes can play a role in putting you at risks of developing the disease or not, shoes that don’t give the required support and protection to your feet, heel and ligaments can easily stress and irritate the plantar ligaments leading to plantar fasciitis.

Provide your doctor with your medical history.,
Allow the doctor to perform a physical examination.,
Go for an x-ray or MRI.The doctor may ask the patient to perform X-rays or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) on his affected foot, these imaging tests are not for confirming the diagnosis, but they can exclude other optional medical cases that can trigger similar kinds of symptoms like bone fractures.",How to Recognize Plantar Fasciitis Symptoms3," When visiting your doctor; he will first need to know some information on your life style, job nature and if you perform any kind of sports, tough types of sports that may involve strong or stressful sudden moves can over stretch the plantar ligaments leading to their irritation.


In addition to any history of previous injuries that may affect your feet, your medical profile and any chronic medical condition or medicines that you may have or take would be discussed too, before carrying physical examination.

, While physical examination; doctor will search for any signs of heel swelling, tenderness point under the heel, pain and inflammation that can be manifested while gentle foot moving.


When asking the patient to take few steps, the doctor will also ask the patient to describe his pain onsets, when does he feel it usually and its severity, having strong pain first at the morning, when climbing stairs and after strong activities are positive signs of plantar fasciitis.
He may ask the patient to make some flexes to his affected foot, pain can also arise while doctor exerts a kind of pressure with his fingers on the weakened plantar fascia ligaments.

Understand that treatment for plantar fasciitis takes time.,
Rest your ankle to allow the ligaments to heal.,
Ice the inflamed areas of your foot.,
Take medications to relieve any pain.,
Get a corticosteroid injection to decrease pain, swelling and stiffness.,
Provide more support for your foot.,
Wear a splint at nighttime.,
Follow a special training program to strengthen your muscles.,
Do a toe stretching exercise.,
Perform a calf stretching exercise.",How to Recognize Plantar Fasciitis Symptoms4," Plantar fasciitis treatment depends mainly on suppressing and relieving the inflammation at the plantar fascia ligaments area, then to build up the soft tissues again after ensuring full recovery from inflammation.


Through some stretching exercises to regain flexibility and normal range of motion, the full treatment plan may take several months to ensure complete recovery from plantar fasciitis that can reach to nine months up to maximum two years.
To prevent other chronic conditions that may develop if ignoring or not adhering to the physiotherapist plan, like permanent heel pain that can influence the patient’s walking way and his quality of life, this can be done by following the next points:

, Complete rest is required to allow natural healing time to occur, rest gives the soft tissues the opportunity to calm down and to get some comfort from stress and overload.


This is important to allow the inflammation to ease, forcing the ligaments or the weaken muscles to work can easily worsen the condition and delay the expected recovery time.

, Icing the affected heel area will make a great help in easing all the symptoms including the swelling resulted from the inflammation, and also the pain.


Ice effects come from its cooling effect that acts directly on the injured soft tissues with an astringent power, helping in reducing the amount of the escaped fluids to the nearby soft tissues, and so decreasing the degree of swelling, and suppressing much of the pain that would happen as a result of accumulated fluids pressing on the tiny nerve endings at the tissues around, causing the pain onsets to start.
Note that ice should never be applied directly on any part of your skin, it should be wrapped in a clean towel, then to be put on the affected heel, and on the upper portion of the affected foot too, ice should be applied for twenty minutes every two or three hours at the first three days, then to be applied only twice daily after, a physiotherapist would advise you to re apply ice after finishing your training program when recover or after finishing performing your sports.

, The doctor will prescribe some analgesics to relieve your pain, like non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are known to be powerful analgesics, anti pyretic and anti inflammatory agents, their effects come mainly from their actions in body by preventing the formation of prostaglandins, the main chemicals released during the inflammation process.


This is done by blocking the two enzymes responsible for their production named COX – I and COX – II, their effects can suppress the inflammation, irritation, swelling and pain stimulated at the affected foot, so that will help the patient to get over his painful times, and to achieve fast recovery, examples are as Voltaren (Declofenac salt) available as 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg tablets, effervescent sachets, injections, and topical applications, or Feldene (Piroxicam) available as 10 and 20 mg capsules, 10 and 20 mg dispersible tablets, injections and sublingual tablets.
NSAIDs can be taken as doctor’s orders or when ever needed, injections, sublingual tablets and effervescent sachets provide rapid relief from painful symptoms, topical gels as Voltaren gel can be applied on the upper or lower side of the foot, and around the heel to provide direct relief from pain and to get rid of inflammation.

, Foot supporters like orthotics, foot insoles or heel cups are excellent in treating irritated, inflamed feet, in addition to many other various medical feet conditions like over pronation or abnormal foot arch.


For these different medical feet conditions; different kinds of these equipments are designed to match and suit every case to provide maximum support, by being extra cushions to absorb different shocks and tension instead of being transmitted to the patient’s feet.
Orthotics are good solution to give complete support to the whole lower portion of the feet to provide comfort to the full area along the whole axis of the plantar fascia ligaments, and to support the normal foot arch during each step and with any physical activities being performed.
Insoles can be added as extra supportive cushions inside your current shoes as they act as shock absorbers, having the ability to distribute the pressure evenly that can come up from the ground with walking, jumping or running.

, Night splints are leg braces that their function is to keep the foot in a flexion pose, they can be applied during the nighttime to make stretching to the patient’s calf muscle and foot arch.


This aids in lengthening the Achilles tendon and the plantar fascia ligaments at the same time, helping in reducing much of the strong morning pain attacks, heel stiffness and rigidity.
Splints are usually prescribed by doctors during the first weeks of injury, to be removed according to the patient’s condition and his response to his treatment therapy, the doctor may need to re prescribe them again if the patient condition didn’t show the expected improvement.

, Special training program is needed to strengthen the lower leg muscles, to regain normal balance and to remove any pressure or unwanted load on the injured over stretched ligaments.


Exercises should be done at the morning after getting out of bed to decrease much of the heel stiffness and pain felt at this time, the exercises have to be repeated during the daytime too.
Exercises help also in stretching the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia ligaments helping to ease the plantar fasciitis, examples can be written as:

, The patient can perform this exercise while sitting on a chair, and extending his affected leg in front of him while keeping his heel touching the floor, now gently he can raise his foot up and with his hand he have to hold his big toe and pull it toward his leg, count to twenty, then release.


Repeat three times and switch to the other leg, then to do the whole exercise few times a day including the time after waking up, the exercise makes a full stretch to the plantar fascia ligaments, depending on the pulling power by the patient’s hand while pulling his big toe.
This would release the stress and irritation at the ligaments, helping in suppressing the heel stiffness felt at the morning, by loosen them and gaining some flexibility, by time this exercise would provide a degree of flexibility and strength to these ligaments., The patient can perform this exercise while standing against a wall, depending on his both hand palms on the wall being in his shoulders line, and extending his affected leg behind him keeping his knee straight while his foot and heel on the floor, now slowly he can bend the front knee till he feels a stretch at his lower back leg, count to twenty, then release. #*Repeat three times then switch to the other leg, and to do the whole exercise few times a day, this exercise depends on stretching the calf muscle, and the Achilles tendon that will create a free space for the heel joint to move freely without any stiffness, it is suitable to be done at the morning to relief morning stiffness, any stress or shortening in the tendon will directly affect the plantar fascia ligaments and the heel movements.


Performing these stretching exercises will relieve the tension in these soft tissues, and will build up the required strength to provide a nice degree of flexibility, to be able to resist any sort of sudden pressure or shocks in the future."

, Besides making you a more efficient swimmer, this will prevent water from potentially introducing harmful bacteria into your body which can cause recreational water illnesses (RWI). While most RWI-causing germs are killed by chlorine within an hour, an improperly managed pool can harbor and breed this bacteria which can lead to diarrhea, ear, or eye infections., Walking barefoot is an easy way to contract a fungal infection, such as athlete’s foot. Make sure the flip flops are comfortable and have a good grip, you don't want to slip on the wet floor., Bags pick up dirt from being set on dirty surfaces like locker room floors which can then be transferred to the items inside the bag. Washing your bag with soap and hot water is a good start. Follow up with disinfectant spray, or mist the bag with vinegar to kill bacteria., A washing machine cycle with hot water and detergent will make your outfit clean and fresh for the next time you hit the gym. Make sure you are not reusing sweaty clothes for your next workout.

, Items such as exercise mats, weightlifting belts, and resistance bands should be solely yours since they closely touch your body and absorb sweat. Sharing these items will promote the growth of fungus and bacteria.

Free weights, weight machines, and exercise balls are rife with bugs from being handled constantly.Cardio machines are more likely than free weights to get wiped down but can still harbor bacteria.
Exercise mats pick up fungus that causes athlete’s foot, and even organisms that cause hepatitis., Places where people congregate, and commonly touched surfaces tend to have the most germs. Hopefully, these places are regularly cleaned by gym staff, but play it safe by taking all necessary precautions to avoid picking up airborne or surface bacteria.


Locker rooms and showers are damp environments that cause germs to multiply rapidly.
Improperly managed pools can become contaminated by pathogens spread through fecal matter which can cause diarrhea, and eye and ear infections."

Visit with the elderly.,
Bring meals.,
Help out around the house.,
Drive the elderly to needed places.",How to Volunteer to Help the Elderly2," You may not want to go through formalized volunteering. Instead, you can volunteer to help those elderly individuals you know. Many elderly people experience loneliness or simply want to share their experiences in life. Taking some time to visit with an elderly family member, friend, or neighbor is a great way to volunteer to help the elderly.Go to the person’s home and do activities you both enjoy. You could watch a movie or TV show, do crossword puzzles, play board games, or even just sit and talk.
Take the person to a café, the movies, or another place if they are able. This helps get the person out of their house while spending some quality time with you. Even a walk around the neighborhood is an enjoyable way to volunteer your time.

Some things you can do to help an elderly individual around the house include:Cleaning
Fixing little things
Tending to the garden and raking leaves
Shoveling the driveway in winter

Invite local business to make donations or sponsor the event. This may invite further interest in the event or get your program some much-needed donations.

, Activity can help the elderly stay or get healthy. Different types of physical activities, including walking and swimming, can help the elderly maintain their health or even heal more quickly. Organizing an event for the elderly that focuses on physical activity can not only benefit their health and well-being, but may also introduce them to new people.Ask a local fitness center or school to host your event.

Decide which type of board you would like to serve on.,
Investigate board openings in an industry you’re familiar with.,
Choose a company to which you have something to offer.,
Research current board members.,
Meet with existing board members.,
Find out detailed information about the board and company.,
Attend networking events.,
State why you would be a valuable member of the board.,
Do not rely on a search firm to find you a director position.,
Ask for an appointment as a board member.,
Prepare your CV in anticipation of a meeting or interview.,
Explain your potential value as a director.",How to Be Appointed to a Board of Directors," Both for-profit and nonprofit companies have boards of directors. While it may be easier to find a board seat with a nonprofit, don’t assume that this position will make it easier for you to find a seat on a for-profit board in the future.If the company is publicly traded, members of the board of directors are elected by shareholders, which often includes the company’s founder, if the business is still in an early stage. board members can often be nominated for the position by an existing board member.For nonprofits and government agencies, board members may be directly appointed by the CEO or by a government authority (for example, a member of the Cabinet).
Publicly traded companies often have large boards, while private companies (often younger or smaller businesses) will have fewer directors.While large, publicly traded companies often pay their directors large salaries (or with generous stock options), smaller companies or nonprofits may give directors much smaller salaries.;
, Unless you already know the exact company to which you plan to ask for a board appointment, you’ll need to search for companies that would potentially welcome you to their board. The best place to begin your search is online. Check the directories of websites that will provide you with lists of boards that are looking for new directors.Check websites including: BoardnetUSA, Volunteermatch, and Idealist for nonprofit board openings.
Use personal contacts that you already have to enhance your search. For example, business professors, former employers, or startup CEOs will be valuable advisors as you look for a potential Board to work on.

, In order to be considered as a viable candidate for a board of directors, you’ll need to offer expertise and insight to the board. A successful board will be assembles of diverse members, each with their own strength.By selecting a company which you can directly benefit, you’ll improve your chances of an appointment.


Many nonprofits and companies will be looking for an individual with financial experience, or a degree in finances. Corporate social-media experience is also currently in high demand.Talk with a current director to see if you have credentials that the board is looking for.
Use your website findings to tailor your company search. The boards looking for new directors should make clear online which credentials they’re looking for.

, Looking into the existing directors—on a single board or across several—will give you a glimpse of what degrees, experience, and credentials are common among directors.Look to see:


If there are any gaps in the skills and qualifications of the current directors.
If any directors are approaching retirement.
If you could network with any of the directors, through mutual friends, a work associate, or other means.

, You’ll be far more likely to earn a board appointment if you have a professional and personal relationship with an existing director. Find out who is already on the board of directors, and arrange a meeting with one of these people. A face-to-face meeting will allow you to directly state your case for an appointment as a director.


Use your professional network to connect you with directors on boards you’d like to serve on. Perhaps you already know someone who knows someone who knows one of these people.
When you speak to a board member, say something like, “We know each other through Sally - she's my coworker. I’m interested in serving on a board of directors, and would like to learn about your board.”
If you’d like to be more direct, say, “I’m interested in serving on your board of directors. How can I pursue this opportunity and show my qualifications?”

, This will help you assess how you can present yourself and your skillset to maximize your appeal to the other directors. Ask for information regarding the current number of directors, how often new board members are brought on board, and the management style of the board.Invite one of the directors out to lunch and ask if they’re willing to share information about the company. Make it clear that you’re interested in serving as a director, and would like some information concerning their experience serving on the board.
When you meet, say something like, “I’m looking for a board position to serve on, and your organization intrigued me. Do you know if the organization is interested in taking on a new board member?”

, If you’re interested in making yourself available to a number of board positions at once, consider attending an event by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Events are open to members of the public, and you may be able to meet with (or learn about) multiple board members on a variety of board types., Especially if you do not already have a professional relationship with one of the directors, you’ll need to make the case for yourself. Explain what you can bring to offer the current board.


If the company serves a large portion of the country, you may wish to set yourself up as a regional representative, or a representative of a community that is not currently represented on the board.Say something like, “Although you do a lot of business in the south, I notice none of your directors are from there. I’ve lived in Alabama my whole life, and could help grow your business in that region.”

, Search firms are companies that find directors to serve on specific boards. While their services sometimes work in the other direction as well—finding a board for potential first-time directors—this approach is less common.You may get lucky with a search firm, so it’s not necessarily a bad idea to send your CV to one or two. Just don’t view this option as a guarantee to find you a board.

, You should present yourself as a potential Director to the company’s CEO or an existing board member. You’ll need to be able to show that you can help the company generate profit, and that you have strong oversight and management skills.Also be prepared to speak to your business experience.


When asking for an appointment, say something like: “If you have any room on the board, I’d like to serve as one of the directors. I care about the mission of the organization, and think that my skills and experience will make me valuable.”

, Tailor your resume so you can present yourself as a strong candidate for the specific board you would like to serve on. Highlight your leadership experience and your commitment to developing whatever industry or community the business or nonprofit works in.Use your CV to present your strengths and qualifications in areas where other directors may be less qualified. This will indicate that you will be valuable to the board, and not duplicate the skills of an existing board member., CEOs and shareholders will be looking for directors to enhance the existing board, and who can bring necessary skills to the table. Directors need to have professional diversity, so you can establish yourself as an expert in a field that will be helpful to the board.Say something like:


“I believe I would play a valuable role on your board, since I have had years of experience working in .”
“Since you don’t currently have a director who’s experienced with business law, I would be a valuable addition to the board, because I can fill that gap.”

Set a realistic weight goal.,
Use positive reinforcements to stay focused.Reward yourself as you make progress toward your weight goals.,
Make time to achieve your goal.Once you set your goals, you must work to achieve them.,
Don’t compare yourself to others.Everyone has a different body and different limits.",How to Turn Forty Gracefully1," A realistic weight goal should be based on the body and limits of your current self, not the self you wish you had or the self you had twenty years ago. Your goal should be specific and measurable, and limited in time.For instance, a goal to lose twenty pounds is a good goal. A goal that is vague like “I want to get fit” is not measurable.
Your goal should also be limited in time. For instance, if you wanted to lose ten pounds, you should also limit it realistically in time by deciding to give yourself ten weeks to lose the weight.
It might be harder to lose weight when you’re forty than when you’re thirty or twenty. As we age, our metabolism slows, making it easier to gain and harder to lose weight. Take this into consideration when setting your weight goals.
Focus on loving your body and meeting your personal weight and fitness goals. Worry less about meeting some social ideal.;
, For instance, if you want to lose ten pounds in ten weeks, go out for a nice dinner with your spouse after losing five pounds. When you’ve lost the entire ten pounds, celebrate again by attending a concert of your favorite band with some friends.

, At forty, you probably have a lot on your plate: kids, a spouse, a career, and so on. Getting fit requires scheduling a specific time when you will work out. Whether you go to the gym, use a home treadmill and weight set, or go on a bike ride, make sure you spend at least an hour each day making progress on your fitness goals.

, Maybe some people can lift 100 pounds at forty, while others can lift only 70. Similarly, some people lose weight quickly while others struggle to keep pounds off. Focus instead on your body and the ways you can achieve the best version of you.

The Fitbit, for instance, is a useful device for doing just that. Libra is an app for your phone that has similar capabilities. Use these to ensure you’re taking in and burning an equal number of calories.
Use the Nutrition Facts label on the side of packaged foods to monitor your calorie count each day.

Watching TV with friends can be fun, but if you find yourself binge-watching shows for hours on end by yourself, you should take a break and go out with some friends. In addition, you might not get as much physical activity as you need if you spend a significant amount of time watching TV. Limit your use of the television and ensure you are balancing your time in a healthy way.

, If you hit forty and have spent most of your life smoking, you might have as many wrinkles as a non-smoker at age sixty.To hit forty gracefully, take care of your appearance (and health) by quitting smoking.


Use nicotine patches or gum to help curb cravings.
Wean yourself off cigarettes gradually. For instance, if you smoke a pack a day, lower your tobacco consumption to half a pack every day. After a week or two, lower your consumption again to half a pack every two days. Continue to progressively reduce your tobacco consumption until it is eliminated.
Don’t replace one bad habit with another. Don’t, for instance, take up drinking or chewing tobacco instead of cigarettes. Instead, choose positive outlets to distract yourself from the cravings you have by going to a baseball game with your family, or going on a hike with your friends.

Forty is a great age at which to go through your closet and find the things you won’t wear again, things that no longer meet your quality standards, or things which don’t fit you anymore.Distribute them to interested friends and family, and give the rest to goodwill.


Learn to identify clothes that flatter your body type. Don't try to wear clothes in a size that doesn't work for you., Excess sun can lead to wrinkles and cancer later in life. If you are nearing forty and still hit the beach regularly, you should limit your exposure to the sun and use a high SPF suntan lotion when you do go out in the sun. Even when you’re just out shopping on a sunny day, use sunscreen on your face and arms. Try to cover your skin as much as possible.

, However, don’t feel pressured to try to cover up signs of aging, which are beautiful in their own way. Excessive makeup can actually accentuate wrinkles. Wear makeup that accentuates your face, not the face you had twenty years ago.


Use foundation in a way that doesn’t accentuate lines and wrinkles. After you reach forty, your skin becomes thinner, leading to a duller, paler complexion.With foundation, you can add some depth to your skin.
As estrogen levels start to drop at forty, your skin will become drier. To prevent drying out, use a hydrating liquid foundation.

Be authentic about what you like.If you don’t like playing baseball, don’t do it just to impress your friends or coworkers.,
Reflect on your priorities.,
Don’t fear change.If you decide that you don’t like where you are, you have two options.,
Spend time with the people that matter.At forty, your family might be a lot bigger than it was when you were 30.",How to Turn Forty Gracefully4," If you like eating desert, don’t deny yourself just because people expect you not to eat it. Being yourself will help you live a full life at forty and beyond.

, Are you engaged in work where you feel you’re useful, appreciated, and rewarded? Are you married to the person you really love? If you are, congratulations! If not, consider making a change. Ask yourself what you want from life. Many people go through what appears from the outside to be a midlife crisis when they reach forty, but is in fact simply a realization that they are aging and want to make the most of their lives., You could remain in an unhappy but stable situation, or you could be brave and take the leap into something new.


Many people choose to stick with what they know for fear of the unknown. However, you may (and likely will) regret this later.
Even if moving to a new job or a new city is challenging and uncomfortable, you should take comfort in the fact that by embracing change you are now better positioned for real happiness and the opportunity to live the life you want.
Don't be afraid to fail. Even if you do, it's no big deal. Nobody is perfect.

, Perhaps you’ve gotten married or added a child or two to your family. Whatever the case, spend time with the people who care about you and who you care about.


Keep important friends in your life, too. Friends can enrich our lives and give us valuable perspectives on our problems, whether they’re big or small.

Practice mindfulness.,
Utilize daily affirmations.Affirmations are little mantras or sayings that help you stay focused and mentally strong.,
Be thankful for what you have.If you’ve made it to forty, you probably have much to be thankful for.,
Smile more.Smiling makes you feel good and can help you stay positive.,
Avoid negative people.",How to Turn Forty Gracefully5," At forty, you may have some regrets. However, to turn forty gracefully, you should not dwell on negative thoughts of regret or obsess over things you wish you’d done differently. While it is important to learn from your past mistakes, do not let them ruin your life. Focus instead on the here and now, and the things you can do to move in a positive direction.For instance, instead of thinking to yourself, “I am too overweight to be attractive,” think about how you can lose weight by eating right, exercising regularly, and investing in clothes that compliment your physique.
When you encounter negative thoughts, envision them in your mind’s eye as red balloons. Then, picture yourself letting them go and seeing them floating away until they’re out of view. Then, imagine a group of new, blue balloons floating down representing positive thoughts.

, Try to begin each day with a positive affirmation. For instance, you might wake each day and, after brushing your teeth, say to yourself, “I have had forty full years of life and I will have forty more,” or “Today will be a great day.”

, Start each day by making a list of five things you are thankful for in your life. For instance, you might think about your family, your spouse, your home, or something else that gives your life meaning. You can choose to write the list down, or just compose it in your head. Tell people you care about that you love them frequently. At the end of each day, find time to reflect on your day and try to list at least three good things that happened., If you find yourself thinking negative thoughts, get rid of them by smiling. Don’t hide your emotions or avoid smiling, as some people do when they reach forty, in an effort to reduce smile lines on your face.

, If you have a coworker or family member that is constantly tearing you down or criticizing you, avoid them as much as possible. Surround yourself with people who want what’s best for you and support you in your endeavors. If you have to deal with a negative person on a daily basis, speak to them about your concerns.


Be polite but firm when telling people to stop criticizing you unjustly. Say, “I’m sorry you feel that way. I disagree with your point of view.”
Sometimes, it's good to listen to a critical friend or family member. People who are close to you generally want what's best for you, and criticize what you're doing because they worry you might do something wrong. If several of your friends or family members come to you with the same concern, you should take their criticism seriously and find a way to address it.

Understand the business.,
Know your market.,
Stay within budget.,
Obey local laws and regulations.,
Be an innovator.,
Keep up with technology.",How to Be a Bar Manager1," Part of being an effective bar manager is having a full understanding of the business. Knowing what it takes for a bar to be successful will help you best direct your staff, menu, bar function, and focus your efforts overall. Even though you are technically a manager you should be ready to understand how every thing in the bar business comes together.Understand each role that your staff plays.
Be ready to work late or long hours.
Learning more about the theme or direction of the bar can help.
Have an active hand in creating and maintaining any menus.
Learn what your customers want and try to meet those needs.
Knowing business functions such as ordering, inventory, cash register operation, bookkeeping and marketing will be essential to your success as a manager.;
, If you don't understand your potential customers, there is a good chance they will never visit your bar. You will also need to learn more about your local competition and how best to pull in customers that would otherwise go elsewhere. Spend some time learning more about your local market in order to increase the number of customers and better meet their needs.Visit other bars in the area to see what they are doing. Try to offer things they don't.
Understand which part of the public you are catering too. Decorate and price your bar to meet the needs of that demographic.
Always think about things that can make your bar stand out to customers.

, Although you might not directly own the bar, running it as if you did is a good attitude to adopt. You will need to strictly stay within any budget you have been given, try to lower operating costs when possible, and maybe even create a budget yourself.

Try to reduce waste in order to reduce operating costs.
You can have your bartenders use standard measuring tools to prevent over-pouring.
Ask for any budgets to be made clear to you and have them fully explained.

, Bars are required to follow many laws and regulations due to the legal restrictions that are attached to alcohol. As a manager of a bar you will need to be fully aware of local laws and regulations, taking care that your bar is always operating under these legal requirements. Failure to abide by these laws can result in fines, lost profits, legal actions, or even the closing of the bar.Laws will vary between locations.
Serving alcohol to anyone underage will have serious legal repercussions.
Some states will have laws that dictate what types of alcohol your bar can serve and when.

, Even if things are going well it's important that you keep things feeling interesting and fresh for your customers. Keeping things moving can also prevent you and your staff from becoming too complacent, which can result in your service and standards to fall in quality over time. As a manager, you should always strive to improve or develop your bar.Think of new ways to promote your bar.
Come up with signature or themed drinks.
Think about offering daily specials.

, Businesses these days are making great use of new technology. While you may feel confident using a computer, certain technologies may require more specialized knowledge. Staying up to date can also help you gain the advantage over competitors by adapting time and cost saving technology before they do.A general knowledge of computer software such as spreadsheets should be had.
New point of service or TAB systems will require you to have an understanding of how to work with them.
You may need to know how security equipment works.

Avoid the water cooler.,
Get clear instructions on new projects.,
Push aside worries about what others think.,
Work hard.",How to Avoid Office Politics1," Although it is certainly fine to go get a drink of water now and then throughout your work day, what can get you in trouble is heading over there—or to any break room situation—when other coworkers are gathered there. The water cooler has become the symbol for communicating office gossip, and steering clear of it can prevent you from getting embroiled in the politics you are trying to avoid.Opt for water breaks when the cooler isn’t surrounded, or for breaks when the break room is empty.
To further fortify your avoidance of politics, be strict about who you take breaks with in general, limiting your lunches to trusted coworkers.;
, If you do your research before you get started on a project, you can avoid crossing boundaries into interpersonal issues. For example, if you are assigned to a project without asking any questions and you encounter a problem a couple of days later, you can upset the office equilibrium if you ask the wrong coworker for help. Get all your instructions from the get-go.Ask lots of questions when you get a project. Even go so far as to ask the boss or supervisor for a meeting so that you can ensure that you aren’t impinging on their work time.Ask the person who assigned you project who they prefer you ask questions of before starting the project. This can minimize offense if you go to someone your boss doesn’t like.

, In order to stay out of office disputes and politics, you have to not care what they think. Getting in the mix and defending yourself can just add fuel to the gossip fire, not to mention create a reputation for yourself of being a time waster.Recognize that work isn’t about who is most well-liked, like it was in high school. Coworkers who form cliques are bad examples, so stay away from them.

, Instead of worrying about what coworkers like you, focus on doing a good job. If you’re looking for a promotion, the best way to ensure one is to perform high-quality work. A diligent worker does not need to degrade others or pit people against one another in order to advance, because a good performance speaks for itself.


Some office politics are related to disputes about who deserves a promotion or more power in the workplace. Stay out of these conversations and build up your reputation as a hard worker.

Understand what an E.A.,
Schedule a specific period of time every day for performing E.A.,
Utilize tools of the trade.,
Organize your processes for incoming correspondence, especially e-mail.,
Establish a proactive tracking system.",How to Be Your Own Executive Assistant," does. Consider E.A.'s professional organizers, time managers or simply “professional keepers”. An Executive Assistant manages day-to-day workflow, organizes and prepares paperwork, establishes priorities, manages incoming correspondence (phone, mail and e-mail), performs general customer care, and that’s just the beginning. In general, an E.A. maintains the sanity of your day. A good one can truly act as an “alter ego”, taking your place in meetings and filling in on tasks when you’re unavailable. Being your own E.A. does limit that capability (unless you’ve already mastered the art of being in two places at once) but at least knowing the skills will set you in good stead for keeping organized as best you can.;
, type tasks. These are the kinds of tasks that are easy to put off, however, once they pile up, they become a daunting and overwhelming project. Schedule time (generally about an hour) each day (preferably in the morning) to complete the basic office maintenance that your business requires. This may involve filing paperwork, scheduling meetings, sorting through mail, or reviewing and prioritizing task lists. Simply sit down and take care of these things one by one, before you get busy “doing business”.

, As your own assistant, it’s critical to develop routines and standard procedures that are rigorously and consistently followed. This will help streamline your daily activities. It helps to use a variety of detailed checklists to make most activities “standardized”. For example, when gathering materials for a meeting, run through a checklist to make sure you always has the same things with you. Of course, there is some minor tweaking for each meeting, but the basics always remain the same. Taking the time now to standardize your processes will save you time in long run. Download checklists from the internet to help you organise your activities. Find a good free information source that provides how-to articles, resources and useful links for Personal Assistants and Executive Assistants - search the internet for personal assistant tips or advice.

, Below are a few tips for how to do this. Most of these ideas can be set up on any email program:



Establish files for all incoming email. There are a number of ways to do this. Some people sort everything into two folders: FYI only - no reply and Reply needed. Once everything is put into the appropriate folder, you can then go through them and reply as needed, then re-file into another group of folders. You may want to label these folders by project or client. Here’s an example of some: Travel Arrangements, Client Projects, Board Activities. Each folder also has sub-folders, further breaking down each category. This also makes searching for past e-mails much easier.
Flag emails that require follow up actions - set a date and time for a reminder to pop up.
You can set up most programs to automatically file correspondence from specific people into a particular folder. For example, if you are working on the Blue Project with Joe Smith, you can ask the program to file all incoming correspondence from Joe Smith automatically into the Blue Project folder. The number of unread messages in each file shows up beside the folder icon.
Set up the program to automatically add color coded flags for correspondence from specific people. For example, any email that comes in from certain people can automatically have a red flag by it. That way, you can scan through your in-box and it catches your eye right away if that person’s sent something. You can set up different colors for different people.

, Executive Assistants are great at making sure things don’t fall through the cracks. There’s nothing worse than having a client call you to ask the status of a request that you’ve let go by the wayside. As your own E.A., you will need to create a system for following up on client requests and other time-sensitive tasks. These days, the best practice is to use some kind of electronic calendar system (such as Outlook). During your dedicated daily E.A. time slot (see number 1), do the following:




Review your pending task list.
Rank each by priority level.
Make note of the next action for each and create a firm deadline.
Review progress of established next actions and make note of what has been completed.
Gather your next action tasks for the day and rank them by priority.


Daily review will ensure you are keeping on top of the various projects you work on at any given time. It will also make sure your day is spent working on the tasks you should be working on, not just the tasks that caught your eye first.

Be a good leader.,
Find a balance with rules.,
Understand the roles of your staff.,
Watch for any substance problems.",How to Be a Bar Manager2," Without proper communication and leadership skills you won't be able to effectively manage a bar, even if you have the technical knowledge.

Keep some of the following points in mind when considering your communication skills:Foster a sense of team work with your co-workers.
Manage and balance personality types of your staff.
Know how to manage conflicts effectively.
Make your meetings clear and helpful.

, As a manager you will need to develop and implement certain rules and policies for both you and your staff to work with. Having too many rules can result in your staff working inefficiently or a loss of morale. If don't have enough rules your bar can easily get out of control. Strive for a balance between being a stern enforcer of policy and allowing for some freedom in your bar.Be very clear and direct about what is required of each staff member.
Write down every responsibility or rule that you want to implement.
Listen to and seriously consider any grievance your staff brings to you.
Don't forget to let your staff know they are appreciated.

, Even though you may be the manager of a bar you will still be expected to take on many additional roles. You should feel comfortable or at least have an understanding of what is involved with any other position in the bar. Knowing what each position in the bar involves can help you both manage your staff better and fill in if there is an emergency.For example, you should be able to step in for your bartender if need be.
You might need to wait on tables if you find yourself short-staffed.

, Although it is the main function of a bar to serve alcohol, there may come a time when that function creates an issue. Whether it's a staff member or a customer, you should be vigilant for anyone who is having difficulty with alcohol addiction or overconsumption. Keeping an eye out for people who need help can allow you to avoid trouble and do the right thing.It may be necessary that you work with a staff member to find them help with an alcohol addiction.

Treating your costumers with courtesy and making them feel welcome will go a long way in making sure they keep coming back. Keep some of the following tips in mind when dealing with your customers:Always greet and welcome customers.
If you are unable to immediately take a customer's order, let them know you will be with them soon.
Learn who is a regular customer and what they prefer when they visit.
Try to learn what your customers want as individuals. For example, some want to chat while others may want to speak only with their own company.

, There will almost certainly be a time when you will have to handle a customer complaint during your time as a bar manager. Knowing how to handle the situation properly can prevent the issue from becoming a serious problem. Remember the following steps when dealing with a customer complaint:Give that customer your full attention and listen to the complaint.
Keep calm and openly listen to the complaint.
Try to summarize the complaint and ask the customer if you understand correctly.
Try to honor legitimate complaints with refunds or other compensations.

, There may come a time when a customer has had too much to drink. These situations can be difficult. However, you and your staff can confidently handle such a scenario using some of the following techniques:Respectfully tell the customer that they have been cut off. Saying something like “I'm sorry but I'm unable to serve you another.” can work well.
Always inform the customer in a friendly and understanding tone.
Make eye contact and keep your voice low. Speaking too loudly can embarrass them and make the situation worse.
Offer to serve them water or food instead.
Don't be afraid to call the police if needed.

Avoid office trigger words.,
Use “reply all” only if everyone needs to know.,
Pay attention to what is said.,
Vent at home instead of at work.",How to Avoid Office Politics2," Every office has sensitive issues that trigger others to react, potentially working themselves into a frenzy. What you want to do is avoid topics that make coworkers and managers think about these issues. Such discretion can save you from gossip and situations that make you look like you’re taking sides.Watch and listen to others when they seem to be in conflict in the office in order to determine what these issues are.

, Hitting “reply all” on an email allows everyone on the list to read what you are saying. Restrict your use of this button to information that every single person needs to know.Using “reply all” is also a tactic for showing off, thus making it a bit of a political move.
When someone uses ""reply all"" to ask an unnecessary question or to display how much extra work they are putting in, you know they are using it to get ahead.
Be sure to use the single “reply” button on mass emails, or go talk to the sender in person.

, Although you should do your best to stay out of office gossip, you do need to stay informed so that you don’t find yourself embroiled in an office scandal, or offend someone, or become an office outcast.Don’t seek out gossip conversations, but it is ok to eavesdrop once in a while so that you can stay informed.
Gossip isn’t the only time important information is imparted. Read between the lines when a coworker gives you instructions or your boss makes an announcement. Watch body language for positive or negative attitudes, for example.

, Complaining about your job at work is never a good idea, especially not if you are trying to stay out of office politics. Restrict work complaints to those you live with so that you don’t give anyone fodder for gossip, or expose your stance on an issue—this can place you in a camp with a specific person at work, involving you in the politics.If you have a truly important issue that you repeatedly complain about, it might be best to take it to your boss, especially if it is an issue that is disrupting your personal life.

Steer clear of gossip.,
Find out the facts of gossip.,
Avoid coworkers who cause drama.,
Make office friends wisely.,
Find positive role models.,
Choose not to retaliate.,
Observe the unspoken rules.",How to Avoid Office Politics3," Discussions about the behaviors, habits, weaknesses and appearance of others can backfire, exposing you to the politics you are trying to avoid. If a coworker approaches you with a story about another employee's mistake, try to understand the motivations behind the storytelling. The goal may be to belittle another person, chat out of boredom, or to help the coworker. If the intent is to degrade the person, find a way to avoid the topic.


Change the subject. Find ways to change the focus from the weaknesses of others to more productive topics.
Staying productive and committed to your work tasks will make it easier to be less available for fruitless discussions.
A consistent pattern of not engaging in the criticism of others lets people know that you prefer to avoid office politics. It also might increase the trust of coworkers when they realize that you do not spend time discussing them.

, If approached by a coworker about the negative motivations of someone else, ask for the facts. Determine how the negative conclusions were reached and if there are misinterpretations.


For example, if the person complaining is referring to a recent memo from the department head, read the memo together. Arrange to meet with the department head to achieve greater understanding.

, Confiding in a coworker who tends to make a big deal out of things or create interpersonal conflict can add to a political struggle situation. It is better to identify this type of coworker and keep your relationship with them restricted to neutral topics, like the weather and pop culture.To identify these corkers, ask yourself questions like, “Is this someone I should think twice about before emailing?” Sometimes you should not involve coworkers in a situation unless you are forced to.
Or, “Is this someone I should always talk to in person instead of emailing them?” Some people are bad about misunderstanding the tone in emails, so going to them in person prevents misunderstandings and drama.

, Although to stay perfectly neutral and out of workplace politics you would need to remain aloof from most people in an office, such impersonal behaviors can also alienate you and make work unbearable. It is wise to make some friends in the office. However, you must be sure to choose them carefully.Find people you can trust, such as those who don’t gossip and tend to have a positive attitude.
Choose friends who have a positive reputation in the office.
Look for people you can be friendly with, though not necessarily close friends with., Observe the behaviors of respected employees and company leaders. For example, managers who treat everyone with respect, speak well of others, and show appreciation for tasks well done are positive behavioral examples.


For instance, these individuals usually avoid office politics by maintaining a positive attitude and dealing truthfully with people.

, When a coworker performs a wrong against you, unless it is unethical or causes damage to people or property (or they threaten violence), do your best not to seek revenge. Avoiding retaliation makes you look like the bigger person, as well as keeps you from getting involved in politics.


For example, a boss legally cannot retaliate against employees for taking action against what they believe to be discrimination., In some work environments, working long hours is a sign of commitment and dedication. In other offices, an employee who consistently stays late may be considered inefficient. Paying attention to these dynamics helps to avoid becoming the target of criticism.


Criticism can involve you in politics whether you like it or not, so try to avoid other actions that invite criticism, like being antisocial and choosing obvious sides in a dispute.

Calibrate performance ratings across the organization.,
Consider whether the performance management system and associated RDM functionality flexible enough to support different ratings scales and models.,
Link performance processes to career development and learning While the output of the performance management process is a finalized performance review between a manager and his/her direct report, the process also identifies employee skill, competency, and behavior gaps.,
Select educational and training activities as developmental goals in the performance management system to improve skills, competencies, and behaviors.,
When linking these various talent management functions, ask yourself:


Can an employee create a new development plan directly within the performance review process, or, jump directly into his/her existing plan to amend it?,
Enable pay-for-performance.,
Understand the required pre-integrated components for P4P.,
Drive continuous improvement by leveraging workforce analytics Traditional transactional reporting and spreadsheet-based tools have been available to HR for many years.,
When evaluating approaches to workforce analytics, ask the following questions:


Does the performance management system leverage a robust and industry standard analytics engine which provides interactive graphical displays of all data?,
Configure, don’t customize.,
Delineate between configuration and customization.,
When implementing configuration, consider:


Can non-technical users such as HR administrators leverage configuration tools that do not require technical programming skills or IS/IT involvement?",How to Align Employee Development and Goals With Corporate Objectives," Use Ratings Distribution Management (RDM). Also called ratings calibration, this gives you the ability to calibrate ratings to ensure that the dissemination of performance scores is more consistent across an organization. In a typical diverse, global organization, performance rating scales differ from division to division. RDM ensures that employees are rated consistently and fairly across the entire organization, and as a result, incentives and rewards can be applied more appropriately.


RDM also eliminates the age-old problem of managers rating all of their direct employees as 4s or 5s on a five-point scale (often to get a bigger chunk of the bonus pool). It “forces” managers to make often times difficult decisions about the performance of their directs. The resulting ratings calibration typically resembles a bell curve (e.g., few 1s & 2s, many 3s, few 4s & 5s).;
, For example, different divisions or geographies may have unique ways of managing their performance processes.


Does the performance management system mandate the use of RDM functionality? Ideally, the functionally should be optionally enabled with a simple configuration switch, since the concept of ratings calibration is controversial to some organizations.

, Along with other forms of self-assessment, as well as 360 feedback (if used within the organization), a clear picture of employee gaps emerge. With this picture in hand, employees are better able to build career development plans that focus on improvement in their current role, better prepare them for a future role of interest, or both.


The importance of career development cannot be underestimated. According to a survey of global HR leaders conducted by SumTotal, fully 97% of HR leaders believe that a systematic career development process positively impacts employee retention and engagement. HR leaders also believe that providing career advancement opportunities as well as dedicated career development planning to employees are the two most important mechanisms for retaining high performers.

, Indeed, many organizations are moving closer to linking career development and learning management. In fact, nearly two-thirds of organizations have tied or plan to tie employee career development planning to learning management in order to facilitate training and course work.

,
Does the career development process stand on its own as a separate process to enable off-performance review cycle planning?
Is the transition between Performance management, career development, and learning management processes seamless to users (e.g., same user interface, look and feel, does not give the user the impression of a disconnected process)?
Is systems integration effort and cost required to tie all these talent functions together, or do the functions all reside on a common technology platform that natively connects them out of the box?
Can you easily run cross-functional reports to identify the impact of career development and learning on employee performance?

, Build a merit-based culture. Programs that align employees’ compensation – merit increases, bonuses, long-term incentives – to their performance have proven to be very effective in driving actual performance. Often called pay-for-performance (P4P), the concept is to build a culture of top performers by aligning goals, performance, and rewards across an entire organization. Motivating, rewarding, and retaining top performers is a key business objective for any company that seeks to successfully maintain or exceed growth expectations.


Best-in-class organizations focus on a performance-driven rewards system that compensates individual contributors directly proportionate to what they achieve and what they contribute to the bottom-line. The challenge lies in effectively aligning employee goals with organizational objectives, automating performance management processes, and linking them with complex compensation policies or time-based incentive plans at an enterprise level.
P4P and merit-based pay programs – especially those that relate to executives – have received renewed interest lately due to emerging legislative and regulatory compliance pressures stemming from the global financial system crisis. Yet only 36% of organizations have made significant technology investments to automate and improve P4P processes. Clearly, there is an opportunity to both espouse the virtues of a merit-based culture while at the same time working toward becoming compliant as new regulations are put into effect. The latter issue will be particularly important for publically-traded companies.
Ideally, a single, centralized HR platform that natively connects all of the required components for P4P is required because it facilitates cross-functional reporting and eliminates the technical challenge and cost of integrating and managing disparate systems.

, They are:


Use workforce performance management to automate and optimize performance processes and align employee development and goals with corporate objectives. Performance management enables organizations to plan employee efforts in support of organizational goals and strategic initiatives, and to evaluate outcomes, performance, and core competencies.
Understand how to use compensation planning in compensation management. This simplifies and standardizes the planning, modeling, budgeting, analysis, and execution of global compensation and reward policies. Compensation Management enables organizations to develop and apply consistent compensation plans and rewards to all employees.
Reporting and Auditing: Provides accessible and secure cross-functional compliance reports and audit trails of all transactions related to compensation and performance. Reporting and Auditing aggregates key information to facilitate timely decision making.

, Often inflexible, difficult to use, and inaccessible, these tools nevertheless are what HR professionals currently rely on for critical workforce metrics (e.g., employee retention, time-to-hire). But they can hardly be classified as strategic. And given the global economic conditions, HR leaders are under increasing pressure to consistently measure and communicate the impact of their HR programs, especially to secure funding for strategic initiatives. Unfortunately, transactional reporting tools provide little help.


Strategic workforce analytics, on the other hand, provide more meaningful methods for measuring HR efficiency and effectiveness. New, pre-integrated technologies have emerged that enable HR professionals to focus more on analysis, insight, and action rather than on data collection and manipulation. For example, what HR leader would not like to know the true impact of learning and training programs on employee performance, or the effect of employee engagement programs on workforce productivity?
Part of the challenge facing HR leaders is the fact that data is spread out in various silos across the organization and there is no common employee system of record. A single, fully-connected HR platform that covers the gamut of talent functions including Performance management can alleviate some of the problems, since the data is all in one place. And with a robust analytic and reporting function, along with pre-defined metrics, previously unavailable insight can be gained.

,
Does the Performance management system abstract the complexity out of the analytics engine so that non-technical users can conduct their own analyzes via an intuitive, web-based interface?
Is there an ability to compare and relate deep analytical views beyond the Performance management system – in other words, across the entire talent management platform – to glean insight into more strategic HR metrics such as the impact of training on employee performance?
Does the analytics system reduce administrative overhead by leveraging the same comprehensive security access rights and rules as the Performance management system so that security policies only have to be established once?

, The elements of a Performance management system must be fully configurable to suit each organization’s unique needs. The sections of a performance management form, such as goals, competencies, and development activities, as well as the number of steps in the process (i.e., workflow), must be selectable by the organization, division, or even geography. Configuration includes which actions can be performed at each step of the process, security controls over who can read or edit the form, and the text of automatic e-mail notification messages.

, Different platforms and technologies tend to favor one approach over the other.


Customization: Making programmatic changes to an application. Customization is a development-centric exercise that extends an application beyond what it was designed to do. Custom code can be useful but also dangerous since it has implications on future upgrades and tends to increase total cost of ownership.
Configuration: Making declarative changes to an application. Configuration entails changing system parameters to affect application change. Configuration is often preferable to customization since it does not jeopardize future upgrades.
Advancements in technology have made a pure configuration approach the preferred option for most organizations. Configuration is achieved through parameter-based utilities and wizards that do not require technical programming expertise, thereby providing customers with flexibility and complete control to configure every aspect of the Performance management system, including menus, forms, workflows, look-and-feel, and security. The benefits include lower total cost of ownership as well as more seamless future upgrades.

,
Do the configuration tools enhance the overall flexibility of the Performance management system by providing very granular configuration options, including changes to menus, forms, workflows, look-and-feel, and security?
Do the tools enable rapid deployment of customer-specific requirements and the flexibility to make changes on-the-fly? For example, how easy is it to create a new performance process or adapt an existing one for use in a new division or geography?
Are configurations preserved between Performance management system upgrades, thereby reducing the time, effort, and cost of upgrading to new versions?

Figure out what is going to change about your role now that you are a manager.,
Prepare for the transition: This will become confusing and frustrating... perhaps not immediately, but managers are often pulled in multiple directions.,
Identify your goals: What, specifically, are your measured goals?,
Know your team: You need to know individual strengths and weaknesses for each team member.,
Match tasks with staff: Use the information you gleaned from the above steps to match people with work.,
Meet with your team members: Regular one-on-one meetings are critical to good management.,
Be visible: You must not isolate yourself from the team.,
Document team activities: Your personal performance review will focus largely on your team’s performance so make sure you keep a written record of issues and accomplishments.,
Reward performance: This doesn’t mean money… although money is nice, it’s not a primary motivator for on-the-job performance.,
Learn coaching: There will inevitably be times when you need to correct behavior.",How to Learn to Manage People," What significantly sets managers apart is the migration away from a concept known as ""individual contribution."" Managers are not, primarily, individual contributors. That means that you are going to be responsible for the work of others; your success depends on how well your team performs. You are now responsible for far, far more work than you could ever possibly produce by yourself (see warnings). You can’t fix all the problems – don’t even try… that’s not your job anymore.;
, You may have a different dress code to follow. You will have new rules to obey (particularly in the area of Human Resources).



Find a mentor: Not your immediate manager, but find another manager with lots of experience and ask that person to help you transition. This is a very important and often overlooked tool. It will also gain you considerable esteem in the eyes of the upper level management team. It shows maturity.

Join a networking group: There are lots of these (Toastmasters for example). Ask other managers and executives about local clubs. Take advantage of the networking opportunities in your area.

Contact HR: Go to the Human Resources department and ask if there are any HR books or training courses you can use to help you. Read a bit about being a manager. There is a mountain of literature on the subject. Read some of the more well-known books (""The One Minute Manager"" and ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" are management staples).

Help your staff cope: It's possible the people you will manage used to be your peers and that will be the cause of envy (possibly resentment) and friction. You can't prevent it but if you keep the lines of communication open it will reduce the issues. However, you must remember that you are now management and while you don't want to flaunt it, you can't let your former peers take advantage of your previous relationship. Even if they weren’t your peers, getting a new manager is always disconcerting. Address the staff and let them know your plans. Establish the manager/staff relationship early. Even if it seems a bit awkward at first do not be bashful about it... just follow the steps, be yourself, and don't forget where you started.

Don't neglect family: Your husband-wife-playmate-whatever and children, if any, and friends still need your attention just like they did before. You will have a lot more on your mind now - management is a hard transition. Keep your priorities in check. If you hear people mentioning that you're distant - take note. You don't want to let your career ruin your family relationships (you wouldn't be the first).

Don't neglect your health: OK, you've discovered that this is actually fun. The work is exciting, you're working longer hours, maybe working more at home, staying up a little later, getting up a little earlier, doing a great job handling the family and kids... are you sleeping enough? Are you sure?

, Do you have hourly, daily or weekly targets your team must meet; what about your new goals such as reviewing productivity? Write down everything and post it prominently (see tips). This will be your checklist. A word of caution here, this list will change over time; it is a living document. Some things may stay the same (service levels, for example) but other things may change depending on the strategies handed down to you from the Executive Management suites. Review your list frequently, with a critical eye, and revise it when necessary.

, John works extremely fast but occasionally misses some of the details. Jane is incredibly thorough but has issues with the volume of work processed. Bill has spectacular customer relationships but can never say ""no"" to the clients whereas Mary has excellent technical skills but falls short in people skills. You really need to know all this very, very well. You will use this knowledge to balance the productivity of your team.

, This is termed skill-based work assignment. You want to play into each person’s strengths and minimize work assignments that would target his or her weaknesses. If you have the opportunity, put people together that have complimentary skill sets. You might put John and Jane on a project together, or have Mary and Bill consult together on a presentation.

, These meetings have several purposes.



Give feedback on job performance: Discuss the previous week’s objectives including what went well, what areas might improve for next time and how that improvement might be obtained. This will lead into…

Outline the goals for the next meeting: These are typically referred to as ""action items"" and will form the basis for the next weekly production review.

Learn about staff issues: You’re going to be a bit out of touch now and you absolutely must realize that. The only way to keep track of issues that affect the performance of your team (and therefore your job) is to listen to your employees!

Ask for ideas: Your staff wants to feel engaged. Without exception, the number one motivating factor behind people leaving a job is poor management – that very often stems from feeling ignored. You will be graded not only on your team’s performance, but also on your turnover rate.

Motivation: In Peter Scholtes' lectures, he points out that people motivate themselves. The best managers find ways to get their people to become motivated to do their jobs well and with pride. Use these sessions to find out what motivates your employees and use that feedback to improve their contribution.

, Sometimes the initial workload will seem overwhelming and you might have a tendency to sequester yourself away from the staff to keep up – especially with the new paperwork load you’ll have. You absolutely must not give the appearance of being an ""ivory tower"" inhabitant. If your team members don’t see their leader, they’ll develop an attitude of anarchy. Things will go very badly for you. Even if you’re managing remote staff, you need to make sure they ""feel"" your presence. If you manage multiple shifts, make sure you visit all shifts regularly.

, This will be especially important if there are significant issues that arise. Problems are expected; how you and your team handle those problems must be a focus of your efforts.

, Recognition is much more effective. If you have the authority, perhaps grant performance leave (an extra day off for doing something exceptional). Make the rewards regular and make them attainable but difficult. When you give a reward, make it well known (reward publicly, admonish privately).

, Learn to do this properly. If you do it correctly, you will get the results you want. If you do it poorly, things can go horribly wrong. See How to Give a Feedback Sandwich for ideas.

It may be beneficial to have generic separation information packets to give to resigning employees. If they come to you with their resignation, they will probably want to talk to you about making the steps required to make the transition out of your company go as smoothly as possible. Offer them professional advice and maintain a structured outline for items such as severance packages, leave notice requirements, provision of a forwarding address for final pay, and final dates of employment.;
, Each resignation is different and involves varying factual scenarios. As an employer, you have to determine when counteroffers are acceptable and when you will simply let the employee go. Some employers have a policy of never trying to retain an employee that seemingly doesn't want to be there. However, a policy that allows for some negotiation may be advantageous, particularly when the employee is valuable to your team.

For example, if the individual that sends a resignation letter is a high ranking officer or executive in your business, you may want to understand his or her concerns and correct them so the employee stays.

, Included in your standard resignation acceptance system should be a reply letter. The letter should state that you regret the loss of the employee, but respect and understand their decision. Inform them of the date you received the letter and date of their final workday. Be cordial and wish your outgoing employee the best.


A sample reply letter might read:
“Dear ,
I regretfully received your resignation notice on . Your resignation has been approved and your final work day will be . It has been a pleasure working with you and on behalf of the entire company, I want to wish you good fortune in all future endeavors. Please direct any questions to this office. Thank you for your many years of service.
Sincerely, .”

, If your company has given an individual access to company credit cards, bank accounts, automobiles, or laptops or other electronic equipment, ensure that these are returned. After they depart, eliminate the employee’s access to the office via security cards and change system logon info.Protecting your company and its property should be at the top of your priority list when considering how to accept a resignation letter.


If employees are required to sign a non-compete agreement as part of the hiring process, review this document with the employee at the time you accept their resignation. This will ensure they are fully aware of their limitations in releasing company information and contacting clients or associates of the company.

, If the resigning employee is in the middle of a project or deal, get them to finish it. If it is impossible for them to complete their current workload before they depart, get them to draft a report outlining what has been done and what has been left undone. Let them know what is expected of them before they leave the company.


Instruct the employee to provide a list of important email addresses, phone numbers, and computer files for their replacement.
Request that the employee provide a forwarding address for their tax statements and final paycheck.

, Usually, human resources guidelines mandate that the employee provide at least two weeks’ notice before resigning. At the end of the two weeks, the employee is free to leave. Based on what you know of the employee’s current workload, you may or may not request to extend that deadline.End dates may vary with the employee’s position within the company; individuals with more responsibilities will typically have to wait longer before officially leaving the company than junior rank-and-file employees.


Different states have different laws regarding notice. For example, in Kansas, an employee does not need to provide any notice when he or she quits.However, some states may require advance notice. Be sure you check your local laws to ensure the established end date is valid.

, The path toward replacing the employee who is leaving with another employee should begin immediately. Search your firm’s roster for an acceptable candidate. Ask the outgoing employee for suggestions as to who they think would be a good fit for the position. If no qualified employees exist within your company, open the hiring process to external candidates. Locating and training the outgoing employee’s replacement in a swift and timely manner will ensure that workflow interruption is minimized.


If you can hire the departing employee’s replacement before they leave, allow them to train under the outgoing employee. This will guarantee a smooth transition.

, An exit interview gives the departing employee a chance to talk about their experience with you and express what they felt worked in their specific department or in the business at large.Encourage your departing employee to be honest in their evaluation of the company, his coworkers, and management during the exit interview. Listen carefully and use their insights as an opportunity to learn how you can best identify their replacement and adjust the expectations for the person assuming the position.


Don’t forget to find out more about why the employee wants to leave when you conduct the exit interview. There will usually be a reason provided in the resignation letter, but it’s a good idea to delve deeper into what could be done to make the employee stay.

, Bargaining with an employee to stay is usually a good idea if you can afford it, especially if they have many years with the company, lots of institutional knowledge, and valuable contacts who may follow him or her to their new position., Use this explanation to decide if the employee can be bargained with. If your employee is leaving because they hate their job, don’t try to keep them around. However, if they are leaving to pursue a better job – with more freedom, better pay, or more prestige – you might consider talking them out of it by making a counteroffer., Often, a counteroffer to retain an employee will not keep them at your firm in the long run. There may be reasons beyond the ones they admitted to which make them want to leave your firm. This is not to say that your employee is lying, but they may actually believe that their current position is worth keeping for money alone. Typically, employees are not leaving solely due to the size of their paycheck.Keeping them around is a temporary solution best avoided., If other employees get wind of the fact that you made a counteroffer to your resigning employee in order to get them to stay, the others may see you as desperate to keep people from jumping ship. Furthermore, they may feel that they should be looking at other work opportunities as well, and threaten to leave in order to get a raise or promotion., If their mind is made up, you will gain nothing by leaning on them to stay. Do not disparage or raise doubts about the quality of the firm your outgoing employee is joining. If the employee is less sure of his or her decision to resign, making them feel stupid, guilty, or selfish by quitting is not only unprofessional and manipulative, but is not in your best interests. This underhanded behavior is unbecoming of a leader.Pressuring the employee to stay is bad for both them and you. Without solving the underlying reasons for the employee’s dissatisfaction, you’re creating a recipe for later disappointment when they decide to leave.

, Do not promise a resigning employee new responsibilities or a change in the office culture if you can’t deliver on it. Such mendacity will needlessly embitter your outgoing employee, and leave them with a bad taste in their mouth when they finally realize nothing will change.Even if you’re well-intentioned, step back and ask what is possible and what is not possible in your workplace. For instance, if your employee wants a job already filled by someone else and it would be redundant to create an identical position, be honest and let the employee know that you cannot give them what they want.

, Handle the resignation professionally.This is especially important when you are handed the resignation letter in person and are receiving the first notice of the employee’s leaving. Do not react emotionally. If you respond negatively, the employee may become offended and lash out at you or their coworkers.


A sour employee can make the few weeks they remain at the company a nightmare.
Responding with sadness, shock, or grief, while understandable, could make the situation even more stressful and difficult for the resigning employee.
Do not add to the employee’s stress and discomfort by asking them to stay (unless you offer an improved salary and benefits as well).

, These should accurately describe what the employee’s responsibilities were. Work with them if they desire specifics in their letter about the work they did for your firm, but be honest and sincere. Keep your letters of recommendation brief and to the point. If the company receiving the letter has questions, they will contact you.Letters of recommendation will vary, but a standard form consists of a salutation (“dear so-and-so”); a description of how you know the resigning individual in which you describe your experience working with him; and a litany of qualities which make the employee attractive to you and, presumably, to another employer. Declare that the employee will continue to excel in their chosen profession. Provide your contact information at the foot of the letter and suggest that if the prospective employer is interested, you are available to speak more about the employee in question.
Provide concrete examples to back up each statement of praise you make. For instance, you might write, “John persistently showed creativity in solving design problems.” Then, you should cite three or four instances in which John creatively solved the aforementioned design problems.

, Send out a memo or email to the resigning employee’s coworkers announcing the resignation. Let them know regretfully that the employee in question is leaving, and on behalf of the company you wish them well in their future endeavors.


An announcement email might read something like, “It is with deep regret that I must inform you that will be moving to another position. Their last day will be . Please join me in wishing him/her well in all future endeavors.”

, Even though you are disappointed to see a good worker (and maybe even a good friend) leave, it is important that they know their work and contributions were valued. Throw a work party at the end of their last day to let them know. If you don’t want to take office time away from everyone, arrange for everyone to meet for drinks after the end of the employee’s last work day. If you think a more intimate send-off is appropriate, have a small team lunch on the employee’s last day., Let them know they will always have a home at your business.


Cultivating good relationships with outgoing employees is good business. When outgoing employees feel their work was appreciated and they were valued, they will act as goodwill ambassadors for your firm and recommend your company to other potential employees and partner businesses or agencies.The connections your employee gains in his or her next position could benefit you as well, and they may send clients or other potential employees your way.

If you value numbers and production over customer service or time spent on other tasks, make this very clear so your employees don’t go above and beyond on the wrong tasks and then are confused when you’re disappointed. If there’s something you want or expect, then be very clear about it instead of sugar-coating your real expectations, even if they’re lofty.


If you want your employees to produce five reports per week, for example, make it clear that this is what you expect instead of just telling them to keep up the hard work and that they’re doing a great job, and then later giving them poor performance reviews.
One important thing is to actually know what you want before you address your employees so that you don’t end up changing your thoughts in the middle of a conversation.
Sometimes, your expectations do change, based on where the company is headed and other internal changes. If this does happen, be open about it instead of letting your employees figure it out on their own.;
, If a change has happened at the company, employees really appreciate knowing why. If an important person in the company was fired, employees may want to know the reason (even if they don’t get the nitty gritty) just so they don’t feel threatened about their own jobs. If you’ve decided one employee isn’t a great fit for a certain project, be honest about your rationale instead of leaving him in the dark. Your employees like to be a part of things and would really appreciate being in the know instead of being left in the dark.


You don’t want your employees to see everything you do or say as a mandate handed down from the Gods; add a human touch to your decisions and show your employees why doing something a certain way is the best for the company instead of just telling them what to do.

, It’s important to keep your employees up-to-date with the progress that the company is making, whether it’s good or bad. Don’t just tell them that things are getting better week after week; show them specific numbers, data, or feedback to prove it. If the company has started managing accounts differently, if a new person has been hired, or if any other changes had been made, then it’s best to let your employees know about it instead of leaving them in the dark. This will help them feel like they’re a part of things and they’ll think more highly of you as a leader in the process.


You can even hold meetings where people who work for different departments of the company come in to talk to your employees to give them a sense of how the entire company is running. Your employees will be more connected to their own projects once they see the big picture.

, Though you may not want to hear about how you can do your job better, asking for feedback can actually help you be a better boss and learn what your employees really need. You can tell them, “I’d like to know how to do my job better” and really mean it. They may be shy about telling you what you could really do better, but you can send out monthly anonymous surveys, ask them in individual meetings, or even shoot them quick emails asking how they think certain projects went. They’ll respect you for having asked for feedback, and their responses will make you better at your job.


When you get the feedback, even if it’s harsh, thank your employees for their honesty. If you make them feel like they’re being punished for being up-front with you, then they’ll never tell you the truth or trust you again.
If you hear the same feedback from many employees, such as the fact that they deserve much higher pay for the work they’re doing, or that they feel like they don’t have any tangible goals, then it’s important to address that. If you just ignore something that is clearly not working in your company, then your employees will think that you’re pretending to care without really caring.
Of course, you can’t address all the feedback and make every employee perfectly happy, especially if you’re getting conflicting messages. If there’s something that they’re complaining about that you absolutely can’t fix, let them know why it has to be a certain way.

, You may think that taking all the responsibility upon yourself will make you the best boss possible. You may think it’ll show how smart, capable, and hardworking you are. However, taking all the responsibility on yourself will not only overwhelm you and stress you out, but it will give your employees the idea that you don’t really value or trust them. When you are faced with a task that you think another employee can do, you should delegate it to the employee, even if it means a bit of training and micromanaging are required, at first. This will make your job much easier and will show your employees that you know what they’re capable of.


Of course, delegating responsibilities may seem like more effort, at first, because you’ll have to transition your employees to doing new tasks. But in the long run, you’ll be saving a lot of time — and you can spend this time on making your employees feel more valued.
That said, if times are tough and your employees are not doing well with the extra responsibilities, step up and be accountable for it. Talk to them about how you can help them succeed instead of blaming them.

, It can be hard not to obsess over numbers as a boss, whether you’re trying to write hundreds of blog posts or selling shoes. While numbers are important, they are not the only key to your success; you should focus on each individual employee and their own work style and personal goals and try to make that fit in to your production goals. When it comes to being a boss, you have to remember that “one size fits all” is almost never the case, and that you have to look at each employee individually to see how he or she can help you reach your number goals.If you’re the head of a major corporation, of course, it can be tricky to look at each and every employee as more than just a number. Still, if you can’t do this yourself, you should have a manager below you who is responsible for the human element in how you treat your employees.

, If one of your employees has gone above and beyond, then you should make sure to acknowledge the hard work he or she has put in to his work. You can send around an email, make an announcement, give a monetary reward, or even give the employee a card and flowers. This should be meant to motivate other employees to succeed, not make them jealous. If your employee has worked extra hard, rewarding his actions will have a big impact on his happiness in the workplace and his idea of you as a boss.Of course, money is a great motivator, and sometimes no reward can be better than a cash bonus. However, money can’t be the only thing that motivates your employees, or they will be so focused on getting more bonuses that they will overlook the methodical, careful work that needs to be put into their job.

, Tangible goals are often more of a motivator than cash rewards, and you don’t have to spend any extra money to give them to your employees, either. Your employees should have goals to work toward, whether it’s reaching out to X amount of clients by the end of the year, making Y amount of sales, or having Z amount of revenue from their latest project. Give them their goals, talk about how they can meet them, and even discuss any rewards they’ll receive for going above and beyond. If your employees feel like they have something to work toward, then they will be much more motivated when they come to work every morning.


Tangible goals should be based on achievements, not on amount of hours worked. If you give your employees the goal of working a certain amount of hours per week, they may technically put in the time, but they may not use it wisely.
Each of your employees has a different work style and they may not be motivated by the same goals. One may be motivated by producing as many reports as possible, while another may be motivated by being told that he should produce the most thorough or comprehensive report he can on a given subject. Some people actually get stifled or discouraged if their only goals are time or numbers based, instead of based on the quality of their work.

, Though you may feel like you really don’t have the bandwidth, if you want to be a better boss, then you should schedule individual meetings with your employees to better understand their work style and to show that you care. Try to schedule these at least monthly, if you can, and they’ll appreciate the fact that you took the time to chat with them individually. Even if you only meet with each employee for fifteen minutes, this will be a sign that you’re a caring boss.Show a personal interest in your employees when you meet with them. Though your meetings can focus on asking how they’re doing at the company and asking for any feedback on current projects, you should also ask a bit about how they’re doing outside of work.
You don’t need to pry into your employees’ personal lives, but if you know they are married or have kids, ask about how their family is doing, whether their kids have started school, if they have any family vacations coming up, or anything else that shows you care without seeming too personal.

, Of course, everyone has favorites, but if you want to do the best you can at your job, then you have to be able to hide your preferences. Remember that everyone at your company is contributing something, and that if you clearly favor some employees over others, then your preferences will be known and your less-favored employees will resent the people you favor and will feel like they can’t win. Though you may clash personalities with some employees, you should try to be equally kind to everyone, and offer the same rewards to employees for doing the same thing.Don’t let one employee you like take a longer lunch break while chastising another for being out for too long. Don’t set different expectations or timelines for two employees who have to get the same job done. This is unprofessional and will make your employees trust you less.

, Though you don’t have to do all of this yourself, having someone in charge of a social committee can help your employees feel more like they’re part of a team. You don’t have to go to work happy hours or out to lunch with your employees if that feels weird, but attending a yearly Christmas party, having a work softball league, or being part of a volunteering work organization can help you get to know your employees and can make them feel happier in the workplace, too.Social events can help your employees get to know each other better and to also work together in a new way, whether they’re figuring out how many appetizers to order for the table or how to paint the side of a house.
Your employees will feel happier for getting to know each other better and they’ll also be more grateful to you for caring that they get along with each other. A good boss cares about his or her employees building strong relationships with each other.

, Though it may sound kind of silly, sending around an email, bringing a birthday cake, or writing a card can really make a difference in whether or not an employee feels valued at a company. These little acknowledgements will show your employees that you see them as people and that you care about their lives and accomplishments. It also shows them that you see them as people, not just machines, and makes them feel cared for and valued.


You can even send around a card for all your employees to sign for a special occasion for one employee, to show that not just you, but the entire company, recognizes this employee.

, You may not think that getting in to the office 15 minutes earlier will have an impact on how your employees view you, but in fact, this can change the course of your entire day. Getting in earlier will give you time to get settled, will keep you from forgetting an important appointments or meetings, and it will make you feel less stressed and overworked when your employees want to talk to you. This will help you be on top of your game and will make you look more approachable to your employees; they’ll be more excited to talk to you if they don’t feel like you’re going to say that that things are “super busy” all the time.Getting in earlier also sets a good example for your employees, who will see that you must really care if you get in to work so early. You shouldn’t, however, pressure them to get in even earlier, or you’ll be back where you started.
The truth is, the morning can be the busiest time, because that’s when you’ll have to check your email, make your calls, and have to talk to 20 employees who all want to meet with you. You may find that, if you get in earlier, you can even wrap up your work earlier.

, Of course, we all lose our tempers and it happens to the best of us. If you’re in charge of a company, then there are plenty of reasons for you to lose your cool once in a while. Still, if you feel yourself getting heated, then you should excuse yourself and return when you feel more calm. You may even need to shut yourself up in your room and take a few deep breaths before you can return to what you’re doing. And if you lost your temper in front of employees, do the mature thing and apologize.This happens to the best of us, and you don’t need to feel like a complete failure if it happens. That said, learn to recognize the signs that you’re about to go off the deep end so that you can excuse yourself before it happens in the future.

, If you’re the boss, then everything that goes wrong at the company is your fault to a degree. If an employee is underperforming, then it may be because you hired someone who wasn’t a good fit for the job, or because you weren’t clear about the expectations you had for a certain project. You should make it clear that you could have done your job better whenever the moment arises, and if you’ve flat-out made any mistakes, like insulting an employee, missing a meeting, or being late, then apologize for that as well.Even if your schedule is packed, you should still apologize if you miss a meeting with an employee. Don’t just say, “I had too much going on,” but, “I’m sorry that I didn’t give you the time you deserved.” Don’t make the employee feel bad about how busy you were.
Deal with problems quickly. If you see that something has gone wrong, address the problem head-on before it gets worse instead of putting a band-aid over it. If you see a failed report, an upset employee, or a new program that’s just not working, don’t wait a month for it to get even worse, hoping that it will blow over. Instead, find a way to address the problem so your company continues to run smoothly — your employees will be impressed by your hard work.

, Another thing you can do to be a better boss is to be more consistent about your expectations. If you want employees to focus on customer service, don’t get angry with an employee for spending a long time with a customer who didn’t buy anything. Make your priorities and expectations clear, so that your employees know what you want. Don’t praise them for something one week and then ask them to do it differently the next. If they feel like you’re not consistent, they’ll get the sense that they can never win.


If you’ve changed your priorities or expectations in some way, you should tell your employees about it up-front instead of letting them figure it out. It’s okay to change focus, but important for your employees to know about it right away so they can adjust their style accordingly.
Along with being consistent, it’s important to follow through on the goals you set and the promises you make. If your employees think all you do is make empty promises, then they won’t trust you.

, You may think that being a boss is all about giving out mandates, telling your employees exactly what to do, and spouting off numbers, but in fact, it’s far more important to listen to employees so you can have a better sense of how to run your workplace. If you take the time to hear them out during meetings, ask them lots of questions, and ask for ample feedback, then you’ll be getting a lot of ideas for how you can run your workplace more smoothly. What’s more, your employees won’t see you as a talking head, but as a person who really cares about what they have to say.


When your employees are trying to tell you something, don’t scarf down your lunch, check your Blackberry, or read over reports right in front of them. Give them your full attention to show that you care. Even if you can only give them 5 minutes of your time, that’s far better than giving them 15 minutes that you spend mostly multi-tasking.

, You don’t have to try to be BFF with your employees — and in fact, you don’t want to be that boss who hangs out with his employees all the time, because that can send mixed messages in the workplace. Still, nothing is stopping you from saying hi to your employees, stopping to chat if you have a minute, or just having a smile on your face if you walk by them. If you storm by them without even looking in their direction, they may not think that you care.


It goes without saying that dating your employees or making romantic advances at them is completely unprofessional and should be avoided in almost all cases.
Give your employees compliments and make them feel welcome in your office. Have them see that you’re happy to be there, and that you’re more than just the average boss.

Listen to some music.,
Take notes to stay concentrated on a task.,
Turn off your phone while working.,
Take set five-minute breaks.,
Chew gum or eat a peppermint.",How to Improve Concentration at Work1," Keep a pair of headphones at your desk and put them on for breaks. As you listen to music, try to remove all work-related thoughts from your mind, take a few deep breaths, and listen to the music. Then, once your break is finished, dive back into work. Listening closely to music (of any genre) will help sharpen your focusing skills, and will also allow you to return to your work with greater concentration.If your office is loud, you can also use headphones to cancel out all of the noise. Simply put them on and then resume your work.
No matter what genre, it is important that you like the music that you are listening to. Your fondness for the music can directly impact how it helps or hinders your productivity. So, choose what you like!Some people also find that listening to music without lyrics helps them to concentrate while they work. Try listening to some classical, electronica, new age, or even some white noise while you work.;
, If you’re losing focus in a meeting or conversation, jot down a few of the speaker’s talking points to sharpen your focus. You can also record meetings and then play back the recordings for reference.If you are in a meeting, take a pad of paper for notes. This way, you’ll be prepared for jotting down thoughts or talking points when you need a boost of energy.
Even doodling can improve cognition and concentration. It keeps you more awake and prevents you from completely disengaging due to boredom.You might even consider working with an accountability partner to help you take notes and stay on task if you think that would help you more. However, if you think you might get distracted more by working with a partner, then stick to keeping notes on your own.

, When you arrive at work, place your phone within a closed drawer. Or, turn it off and place it screen down on your desk. Make a point to only check your phone on breaks. Frequently checking your phone will provide a constant distraction, and will result in lower productivity and concentration.If your office phone is a distraction, see if you can place it on silent as well. Check your voicemail at particular times and respond to messages then.
If you rely on your phone as a way for family to notify you in case of an emergency, then you might want to designate a coworker as the person your family can contact in case of emergencies.

, Watch the clock and take breaks of five minutes for every twenty-five minutes of concentrated work. You can make a bathroom run, walk around the office, grab a quick snack, or even just stand and stretch. Having these set break times will keep your off-time under control and allow you to focus better while working. Timed breaks will also give you something to look forward to.Some people find it useful to keep a kitchen timer or even an hour glass at their desk to keep track of time. If you miss your break, make sure to extend the next one., If you feel your concentration slipping at work, pop a piece of gum in your mouth. If you don’t have any gum, eat a piece or two of peppermint candy. Both gum and peppermint have been shown to effectively boost individuals’ concentration and energy levels while working on challenging tasks. If you chew peppermint gum, you’ll be able to capitalize on the benefits of both gum and peppermint.Keep in mind that the benefits of gum are short lived: performance and concentration only increase for about a 20-minute period."

If you're willing to pay your employees more than a competitor would, they'll be less likely to leave for other work. An added benefit of increasing your employees' pay is that it allows you to ask more of them — well-paid employees have an incentive to work harder and commit themselves to their job, while employees who are making relatively little won't usually have the same level of dedication or loyalty.


If you don't have the cash to pay your employees more than the competition, be creative. For instance, offering company stock options or equity plans is a relatively low-cost way to increase the long-term earning potential of your employees. As an added benefit, these sorts of options give employees a real financial stake in the company — if they work hard and help the company do well, their stock value will go up and they'll make money.;
, Employees like to feel like their hard work is being rewarded. As a manager or business owner, part of making sure your employees feel this way is compensating them fairly for their work, but another part is giving them the opportunity to achieve the non-tangible benefits of recognition and advancement. Reward exceptionally smart, resourceful, and hard-working employees by gradually increasing their responsibility and giving them more important titles. An employee who's advanced from an entry-level position to a manager role is much more likely to be loyal to your company than one who's done the same job for years in spite of her hard work.


It’s not enough to simply ‘’offer’’ the potential for advancement — it’s also important to make sure that employees understand how they can advance in your business. If you're having a hard time communicating this to your employees, try inviting a career counselor into the workplace once or twice a year to discuss this with them.
Try to promote from within your workforce, rather than recruiting outsiders into management roles. While this may sometimes be unavoidable, hiring an outsider to fill a management vacancy when there are qualified employees with years of experience who could conceivably do the job can give the impression that you don't care about your employees' accomplishments.

, If an employee's work is stressful, monotonous, or extremely difficult, different jobs with comparatively easy work loads will start to look very attractive. Never work your employees to the point of exhaustion — this is one of the easiest ways to cause your employees to start looking for other work en masse. In addition, it's also often financially inefficient: employees with very long or stressful jobs will require significantly higher pay levels to retain than employees with ordinary duties and hours.


There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that working your employees extra-hard can actually cause their net productivity to plummet — even to below the level of productivity from a normal 40-hour week in some cases! Some research has found, for instance, that excessively long hours can cause employees to take longer to perform the same tasks as they normally would, deal poorly with problems requiring critical thinking or creativity, make more mistakes, and waste time engaging in recreational or personal activities at work., Increasingly, people looking for work don't just consider the salary being offered by a potential employer, but also the benefits provided. By offering affordable benefits like health insurance, dental insurance, 401K plans, and, as mentioned above, stock options, you can make a job at your company more appealing than one at a competitor's, decreasing employee turnover. Reviewing your benefits package is something your company should do regularly — at least once a year.


Be aware of the benefits your biggest competitors are offering their employees. If they start offering more generous benefits than you, they may be able to steal some of your best employees, so don’t let them get the jump on you!
In the U.S., millions of employees depend on an employer's health care plan to make their medical care affordable. Offering a good employee health insurance plan can make a job with your company especially attractive, decreasing turnover and making it easier to hire. In addition, ensuring your employees have decent health coverage can be a wise investment in the long run — healthy employees are productive employees.

, To long-time employees, coworkers and bosses can function like something of a family, providing friendly relationships, conversation, and sometimes even emotional intimacy. Don't let your employees' jobs become a source of a source of boredom or dread for them. Instead, try to foster a warm, open environment at work. Employees should be comfortable talking, joking, and making outside-of-work plans with each other as long as it doesn't interfere with their work.


If your employees seem ""cold"", standoffish, or emotionally distant, try sponsoring a fun workplace outing to lighten the mood. Going out for drinks, catching a movie, or playing sports after work can be a great way to bond with your employees and allow them to bond with each other, even if you can only do so once or twice a month.

, People tend to work hardest (and smartest) when they think their jobs matter.Though this is often forgotten by even the best managers, it's surprisingly intuitive. Consider this: who is likely to work harder — a mail room clerk with little responsibility or a heart surgeon with responsibility over other peoples' lives? Try to make an effort to give the employees with even the most minor jobs some sense of importance or responsibility. If they understand exactly how their work is essential to the business's success, they'll have added motivation to succeed in their jobs.


Ironically, giving people added duties that increase their responsibility can actually make their jobs more attractive to them. However, if you do this, be open to the possibility of promotion or a raise in the future — employees don't want to deal with increased responsibilities without ever being rewarded for their work.

, Most business experts agree that one of the very best ways to keep your employee turnover rate low is to ensure that the people you hire are right for the job in the first place.Picking employees that have exactly the right qualifications and personality for the job you're hiring for ensures that they'll learn quicker, perform better, and, most importantly, feel happier in their new role. Below are just a few of the most important types of criteria you’ll want to carefully review and vet for each candidate before hiring:


Skills — does this person have what it takes to increase your business’s value?
Intelligence — does this person have the smarts or creativity necessary to perform under pressure?
Personality — does this person fit your company culture?
Commitment — does this person’s life make it possible to offer the sort of commitment you’re looking for?

, If your business is suffering from high employee turnover, one of the best reasons to find out why is simply to ask your employees. Having regular review sessions in which you (or another qualified person) meet with each employee and talk about what they like and dislike about their job is a great way to make sure the employees feel valued and see their concerns being acknowledged. If you don't feel that you're up to this task as a manager, don't worry! For a fee, a third-party HR agency can handle the process for you.


As an added benefit, these review sessions can also give you great ideas. For instance, if one employee who's sick of sitting at her desk all day has a great idea for putting a standing desk in the break room, doing this might make her significantly more happy in her job for a relatively small one-time cost.
Your reviews should involve a healthy back-and-forth of information sharing. Don’t use reviews merely as an opportunity to critique your employees — they should also be an opportunity for your employees to critique you. Be willing to ""meet your employees in the middle"" as long as their demands are reasonable and their intentions are good.

, Even friendly, open companies with great work environments occasionally have to let people go. When your business has to do this, take the opportunity to conduct a thorough exit interview with the employee being dismissed before he's gone for good. Some business experts have found that employees are more willing to be candid at exit interviews, though others have found that many employees will be less critical in hopes of getting a good recommendation.In any case, an exit interview is your last chance to learn what went wrong with an unhappy or unproductive employee, so take advantage of it. Below are just a few of the sorts of questions you'll want to consider asking:


""What was your favorite/least favorite part of the job?""
""Was there anything that made it difficult for you to perform your duties properly?""
""In the future, how could we avoid the types of problems you faced in your job?""
""Is there anything you wish the company had done that it didn't do?""

, Merely asking your employees what makes them unhappy isn't enough — to keep them feeling valued, you'll need to make a reasonable effort to address their concerns and, most important of all, show them that you're making this effort. If your employees can see that their comments and suggestions are being taken to heart, they'll feel like they're being listened to and that their opinions matter in the grand scheme of your business, which can make even a low-level employee feel happier in his job.


For example, if you notice that many of your employees are complaining about the fact that they feel disconnected from the rest of the company — in other words, that they can't see how their individual jobs affect the success of the business as a whole — you may want to consider having monthly team-building events where employees from one part of the company work with employees from another part for the day. This can help give your employees an ""bird's eye"" view of the company's inner workings.

, Sometimes, high turnover may not be a problem for the entire company, but instead only for certain divisions or departments. In this case, the root cause may be something the heads of this department have no control over (for instance, pay levels or deadline schedules set by upper management), but it may also be the management style of individual supervisors that is causing the problem. If this is the case, strongly consider re-training the problematic managers before firing them and searching for replacements. The one-time cost of a short management course is usually much less than the time and money wasted replacing an employee in a high-paying, highly-skilled management position.


Some business experts argue that an employee's manager can have a greater effect on his overall job satisfaction than even his wages, hours, or benefits.In any case, effective managers are vital to a company's success, so making an investment in the ones you have can substantially reduce turnover.

, Sometimes, otherwise productive employees just aren't a great ""fit"" for the job they've been given. While they may work hard, their personality or skill set may keep them reaching the full potential of their role. In these cases, try to avoid dismissing the employee until you've considered other roles or duties for them. Don't fire an employee who's well-suited for some other important role in your company — if you do, you'll be forcing your company to undergo the costs of finding and training a replacement without getting your money's worth out of a perfectly competent employee.


Be aware of how you present a role change to an employee. To avoid hurt feelings, for instance, don't tell the employee that she's performing poorly and that the company thinks she'd do better in a different role. Instead, focus on the positive — tell her that you've found something more important for her to do! Being aware of the language you use in this situation can make the difference between your employee thinking of her new role as a promotion or a demotion.

, In many cases, finding new roles for old employees can be something that leads to increased productivity and satisfaction. However, large-scale corporate reorganizations are usually something that employees fear, and with good reason. Most company-wide reorganization efforts result in some layoffs (sometimes many).Frequent reorganizations can lead to a culture of fear and uncertainty in your workforce and encourage them to seek other, more stable jobs. To avoid this unfortunate situation, try to avoid frequently re-structuring your workforce. Slow, gradual changes are almost always better-received than sudden, wide-scale ones.


If you do have to have a major company-wide reorganization, minimize the morale damage by clearly communicating to your remaining employees why the reorganization had to happen and explaining that their jobs are not in danger in any way. Though there will probably still be some lingering unease, good communication can help keep the damage as minimal as possible.

, In the words of the old cliché, ""Sometimes, to save the hand, you have to lose the finger."" Getting rid of exceptionally problematic employees is a must for any business looking to keep turnover at a minimum. Employees that perform poorly, have a negative attitude, or are grossly incompetent can hold your company back. Worse still, they can contribute to other employees developing negative attitudes towards work by sharing their negative views or demonstrating (through example) that bad work can go unpunished. Don't be afraid to get rid of employees with bad attitudes — if you do this, you'll usually have to fire less people in the long run.


Don't ignore workplace negativity! Research shows that more people in a workplace vocalizing negative thoughts, the more likely that otherwise happy and productive employees are to adopt them."

Start with the tough tasks.,
Work on a single task at a time.,
Discover when you work best.,
Set your own deadlines.",How to Improve Concentration at Work2," You will likely have the most energy at the start of your work day, so jump right into those jobs that require additional concentration. Focus on tasks that are new to you or need a high level of creativity. Leave the mindless or basic work until the end of the day or when you feel as if you are lagging.Avoid procrastinating or putting off difficult tasks. Your concentration throughout the day will be diminished if you’re worrying about a challenging task that you put off until the afternoon.

, Multitasking, or jumping from item to item and trying to juggle many tasks at once, quickly drains your energies. Instead, choose a particular task and concentrate on finishing it. Don’t get caught up in making it perfect, just aim to finish it and then clean it up later. “Single tasking” will also help you to set reasonable goals and resume work despite interruptions.While single-tasking, you can also break down a large task into smaller pieces. If you have a large task that needs attention, spend some time thinking about how that task could be segmented into a series of smaller projects. Then, decide on which tasks to complete first, and start working., Every person has a few hours during which they typically work the best. For a week, keep a chart where you write down your energy level from 1–10 each hour. Then, look over these numbers to see where your peaks of energy and productivity lie. In the future, spend these hours on your most challenging tasks.For example, many people find that they work best between 9:00 and 11:00 am, and are at their slowest right after lunch. Take advantage of this to save mindless tasks for after lunch, and start on harder work in the morning.
Make it clear to your coworkers that you do not want to be disturbed during this time unless it is urgent.

, It is likely that your boss or employer will create big-picture deadlines for you. But, to avoid procrastination and to increase concentration, look over your work and create your own deadlines for each project. This will give you ample time for each task with time added in for breaks. You can also add in extra time if you are worried a particular project might be problematic.For example, if your boss sets a deadline of Thursday, you could set personal deadlines to complete a third of the project on Monday, a third on Tuesday, and a third on Wednesday, then use Thursday to proofread and revise.
You can also make to-do lists at the beginning of each day or at the end of the day (to use the following day). Order your to-do list according to importance. Place the most important tasks at the top of the list and the less important ones below these. Work down the list from most to least important. Keep the list short so that it is reasonable for you to accomplish what is on it.
You can also vow not to take your work home with you to provide yourself with a deadline. If you cannot bring work home, then you will be more inclined to stay focused and get your work done so you can go home.

Keep your work area clean.,
Meditate on a happy thought.,
Keep the temperature mild.,
Sit in a comfortable chair.,
Lock your computer when you’re not using it.,
Decorate with fresh flowers and plants.",How to Improve Concentration at Work3," It’s hard to stay focused and apply yourself to work if your work space is messy and cluttered. Spend the last 15 minutes of each day organizing your work space. Stack or file any miscellaneous papers. Throw away trash. Clear out the extra open windows on your computer. You can even set out the next day’s work, if you know what it will be. This will help you to start each day fresh with a welcoming space.If you feel the unstoppable urge to clean mid-day, then give yourself a maximum of five minutes to tidy everything up. Don’t let these breaks become a distraction.Also, make sure that you have everything you need in your work area, such as tissues, water, coffee, pens, paper, etc.

, Sit at your desk. Close your eyes and take a series of deep breaths. Focus on a thought that makes you happy, such as relaxing on a beach or reading a good book. Keep that thought front and center and banish any work worries. Repeat this practice for just 10–20 minutes total each day.Office meditation has been shown to boost concentration and to lessen signs of depression and anxiety., The ideal temperature for a work environment is 71° Fahrenheit (21° Celsius). If you cannot maintain that exactly, try to keep the thermostat between 68–77° Fahrenheit (20–25° Celsius). If the temperature is too high, you could overheat or become sluggish. If the temperature is too low, you may jitter or feel ill., A comfortable chair can help to make it easier to concentrate as well. Make sure that your desk chair allows you to sit upright and that it provides good back support. Also, make sure that it is the appropriate height for your desk., If you are working on a task that doesn’t require the computer, go ahead and turn off the monitor. Only turn it back on when you need to use it. When you are on your computer, limit distractions by placing limits on web browsers and social media sites, and try to have relatively few browser tabs open at once.You may also want to turn off email notification settings as well. Email can be very distracting and it is difficult to resist the urge to constantly check and respond.

, Place a small plant on your desk or a larger one on the ground. Look for a plant that requires little light, unless you have a large office window. The plants will help to provide fresh air, which can help your mind to stay clear.The presence of a plant may also encourage you to open up your windows, which will have the benefit of exposing you to healthy sunlight as well.

Develop a calendar system.,
Give yourself time to recharge.,
Maintain healthy habits.,
Focus on practical applications of your work.,
Work alongside organized people.",How to Improve Concentration at Work4," Keep track of all of your commitments in one place, whether on a paper calendar or on your phone. Log your phone calls, appointments, and meetings, including the amount of time spent or required. Look over your entire day each morning, so you know what to expect.You may also want to consider not attending certain meetings, if that is possible. Carefully consider whether or not the meeting will be productive and worth your time.Remember that you do not want to overcommit yourself. It is okay to make your personal needs known to your employer and avoid taking on more than you can handle.

, Make sure to spend time relaxing in your free time outside of work. Getting outside can be especially helpful if you work in an office. Participate in a hobby that you enjoy or spend time with friends. Go out to a restaurant that you enjoy. Get together with family and friends. Investing in yourself can lead to improved concentration at work., Eat balanced, healthy meals, especially breakfast. Exercise regularly and take good care of your body, and exercising in the morning can be even more beneficial for your concentration. Avoid smoking and drinking. All of these activities will increase your endorphin levels, assisting in boosted productivity. Getting enough sleep can also improve your energy level and concentration at work.Be careful turning to caffeine to boost productivity. It may increase your pace, but could lead to jitters and dehydration as well.
Try to get up and move around throughout your work day. For example, instead of sitting in your chair all day, try to do some work standing up. Or, perhaps catch a quick work-out over your lunch break., Over time, it’s easy to lose focus when your daily work feels like an abstract, bureaucratic process. However, you can energize and concentrate by thinking of daily practical applications of the job you’re doing. For example, if you work in the publishing industry, focus on the usefulness of the published materials to the people who will read them. Whenever you feel bogged down, recall this reason to keep going and focus on it.Think about what exactly fascinates or excites you about your current tasks. For example, if you are doing a job that could help someone, you might repeat, “I am helping others.”

, This may not always be possible but, if you can, try to surround yourself with people who share your work ethic. They can push you when you feel lazy. They can kick back with you when you are relaxing. It will also help you to feel like a member of a team."

If your friend wants to talk about things after they've gotten an opportunity to cool down and think about the situation, make yourself available to meet for a drink or a bite to eat after work and talk more, but keep the actual conversation as brief as possible.


Isolate your role as employer from your role as friend. Be the boss, not the friend, when you tell your friend that his or her job is terminated. This is important both for your own state of mind and for the way your friend perceives the action.;
, Be direct about the decision to let him or her go. Beating around the bush or using humor will likely not soften the blow and can actually give a false impression that things can be turned around so that he or she might be able to stay. Creating this sort of uncertainty is unkind and ultimately can damage your friendship even more.

, Make it clear that the friendship is a separate issue and that you, or the company, are paying for job performance, which hasn't been met. The job is a purely economic issue. Soften this reality by explaining that as far as you're concerned, your work situation will not interfere with your social relationship and reassure him or her that your extra-curricular friendship will remain on the same footing as always.

, Explain severance pay, help him or her move his or her stuff, keep the security guard from bugging him or her, and do all the other small kindnesses you would want your boss to do for you in such a circumstance.


Offer to do what you can to help your friend to find work elsewhere. As part of your friend-role, consider offering an excellent reference and being available to help him or her work through cover letters and CV revamps. Look for job openings before having the conversation to have something else set up in advance.

, Your friend may be hurt and upset and pestering them with phone calls to continue your regular football-watching routine might make the matter worse. Make yourself available, but let it be on your friend's terms.


Shoot your friend a text to let them know you'll be watching football and would be happy to have some company, but let it be their decision. Avoid guilting them into socializing.

, Regardless of who does the firing, your friend will probably feel hurt and embarrassed for losing the job and may say things out of anger to anyone who will listen. The fact that a friend is doing the firing, though, will obviously complicate the matter. If you don't want to lose the friendship, you need to go into the process understanding that your friend might blame you, and prepare to deal with that response.


Imagine the worst or most hurtful thing your friend might throw at you in anger. Assume this will be said and don't take it personally.

, Consider writing a script and memorizing it. Stick to the script. Don't use the confrontation as the time to struggle for words. Lay out the course of action as succinctly and honestly as you possibly can. You need to lay out the case just as you would any other employee.


If a boss told you to fire your friend, it's ok to pass the buck. Present the reasons as honestly as possible for the firing and offer your sympathy to your friend. Even if you agree with your boss's rationale, it's probably not the time to voice it:

""It's not my call to make. I wish it could be some other way, but my hands are tied.""


If your friend has done something unethical or harmful for the company and it's your decision to terminate their employment for the good of the company, focus on the other employees to whom you owe as much as to your friend:

""We go way back, and you're my friend, but it can't work this way. I have to think about all my other employees, too. If I don't listen to them, this business could fall apart.""


If your friend is underperforming or unsuited to the role assigned, focus on the conversation as a favor and an opportunity to succeed elsewhere, rather than a failure:

""I want to see somewhere you'll be happy and your talents can be used like they deserve to be used. I'm sorry that place can't be here.""



, At least your friend doesn't have to be fired by a jerk who doesn't care about their feelings. Approach the task as an unfortunate opportunity to use your knowledge of your friend to make the termination process as smooth and as painless as possible.

, If it's possible to give your friend another chance, creating a concrete time frame for them to improve performance by coaching or training them toward a specific set of goals. Schedule weekly meetings to discuss improvement.


Make it clear that your friend's job will be terminated if the new set of goals is not met in the time discussed. If it doesn't happen, go through with the termination knowing that you gave them as much of a chance as possible.
Document your discussion and keep this report with your employee records. You may need to deal with objections by referring to the documentation of your previous conversations, so keep good records.

, If it's in your power, you might consider reorganizing your friend's job to essentially demote your friend, or give them an opportunity to save face by quitting. You'll need to have a similar conversation, letting them know that their performance isn't up to par, but that you value their friendship and wanted to offer them this opportunity in a job with fewer responsibilities.


Organize the position such that your friend's weaknesses might be lessened by the new position, making it a win-win. Your friend either gets to leave the company for greener pastures, or stay on in a position in which there is an opportunity for success.Alternatively, consider a promotion or a transfer. While this might be considered ""passing the buck,"" if you can get rid of your friend without firing them outright, you can avoid the ugly confrontation. If you can get your friend a new job with a similar company, you'll have solved both your problems.

, It may be that there is too much conflict of interest involved in your firing your friend. In this case, talk to either a supervisor, subordinate, or the HR department at your company to plan for another course of action.

Evaluate your daily and weekly workload and identify things that you can offload onto your assistant. Common tasks include organizing and filtering e-mail, setting up appointments, responding to general inquiries, booking flights, or managing your blog and social media.If you are working in a highly technical position, it's possible that your virtual assistant will need experience within your particular industry.
Programs like Evernote allow you to track tasks that you complete on a daily basis so that you can better understand what you do each day.;
, Ensure that hiring a virtual assistant wouldn't put a financial strain on you. Calculate how many hours per month you would have to invest in an assistant and how much time they could free up for you. Think about whether you want to hire someone from your country or outsource the job to another country to save money.


While getting a virtual assistant has upfront costs, the opportunity cost or amount of time you save by not doing lower-level tasks, allows you to make more money over the long run.Outsourcing can save you money. Average pay for virtual assistants from countries like the Philippines is only $2 - $4 an hour, though if you can afford it, you should pay them at least the federal minimum wage.The average pay for US-based virtual assistants is $10.16-$29.79., Your assistant may not know how to do things, so it's important that you have an organized system laid out for them. By creating the steps on how to complete tasks before you hire them, you'll save valuable time and money training them. Consider creating tutorial videos or generating a document with instructions.Compile the materials in one place and provide the information to your virtual assistant as a reference.


For instance, if you want your assistant to use a specific scheduling software, you could create a word document with step-by-step instructions.
You will also need to create an invoicing process to pay your new assistant.
Plot out the responsibilities of your virtual assistant on a daily, weekly, and monthly calendar. Share it with your them so that they have an understanding of their workload.

, While your virtual assistant may already be proficient at some of the applications you'll have them use, there's also the chance that they may not understand or do things the same way as you're accustomed to doing them. For this reason, it's important that you allocate enough time each day to get your virtual assistant up to speed about the most efficient methods on how to do the work you are assigning them.


Set aside a day or two to get your virtual assistant up to speed and allow them to download the apps and software they will need.

, You will need to use different software applications to effectively work with your virtual assistant. This could include calendar programs or documents that provide passwords for the accounts they will need to use. It's also a good time to create a login for your virtual assistant. Having to constantly relay login names and passwords for different applications can waste valuable time.


Some common virtual assistant tools include, Google Apps for Work, Dropbox, Boomerang, and Doodle., A freelance contract lays out terms of the job with your virtual assistant. In the agreement, you can declare how much the assistant is paid, the scope of the project or service provided, a timeline for the project, and offenses that could result in termination.If you are working on something that shouldn't be kept secret to the media or public, it's important that you contact an attorney to draft a non-disclosure agreement. This binds your virtual assistant to keep confidential materials secret.


If there is a violation of an NDA you can sue for damages incurred as a result of breaching confidentiality.A breach regarding the freelance agreement could be considered grounds for termination.
You must also issue a 1099 tax form by January 21st if you've paid your virtual assistant more than $600 and you've hired them as an independent contractor., Determine the most desirable personality traits based on what you need for your industry. For instance, in a high volume business, you'll want to make sure that your assistant can meet timely deadlines, can hustle, and is resourceful enough to overcome problems. If your assistant will have to interact with clients or colleagues, it's also important that they have solid communication skills and can make people feel comfortable. Determine the ideal traits for your assistant, and keep them in mind during the interviews.


Other character traits to look for in a virtual assistant include being reliable and having good time-management and organization.Just because you like an assistant doesn't mean that they are the best candidate for the job. Determine what it will take to get the tasks completed the most efficiently and select the candidate that can get it done.

, Now that you have your personality traits and tasks written down, you can create an accurate and detailed job description. Your job description should have the responsibilities, duties, hours of work per week that you expect, and required qualifications.You should also have information on who you or your company are and the industry you specialize in. Before you get ready to post it, double check and make sure that all of the tasks you'll require your new assistant to perform are listed in the description.


Double check your work for misspellings or typos.
Things you can have as requirements include special certificates, required education level, years of experience, or knowledge of specific software programs.
While posting the person's pay is not always required, it may help you on freelance sites because job seekers will throw on filters based on their desired salary.

, You can post your job ad on popular job boards like CareerBuilder, Monster, Craigslist and Indeed. Some of these postings will cost money. Another option is to use websites like UpWork or Freelancer, where freelance assistants are looking for projects to work on.


Job posts are free on some websites like Indeed but can go up to $500 for websites like LinkedIn., If you've have had a hard time finding quality talent or don't have the time to go through resumes and applications, then a freelance agency may be your best bet. Search for freelance companies online and find a company that specializes in virtual assistants. Look for websites and candidate pools that can efficiently complete the tasks you create for them.


The benefit of going through a freelance agency is that freelancers are vetted which will ensure a higher quality candidate pool.
A drawback for hiring an assistant through an agency is that are typically more costly than working directly with the freelancer.
Some of the most popular freelance companies online include, 24/7 Virtual Assistant, Fancy Hands, FlexJobs, and Virtual Assistant USA., After you post a job ad, you should receive emails from candidates with their resumes, cover letters, and applications. Sort through them and try to find candidates that meet your criteria. Many candidates will most likely not meet your expectations, so it's important to go through all of them so you can find the best candidate for the job. Once you evaluate the applications, choose the best five to ten candidates for the job.


It may also be a good idea to request references and salary requirements to narrow your search.
If a candidate requires a salary that's more than you can afford, see if you can come to a compromise. If an agreement can not be made exclude that person from the running.

, Contact each candidate and set up an interview time that works for both of your schedules. For virtual assistants, a live video call is usually one of the most effective form of interviewing for remote employees.When you are on the interview with the candidate, make sure that take notice of their skills and experience. Determine if they would be able to fulfill the duties you require of them and ask them specific questions on the software applications they will need to use while on the job. If they seem like they have experience and are confident in their ability to use it, weigh that heavily on the decision of whether to hire them or not.


You can ask questions like, ""What is your experience with Github and PHP?"" or ""What software programs did you use in your last job?""
Make sure that you take their tasks into consideration. For instance, if they need to communicate with potential clients or partners it's essential they can enunciate their words and clearly communicate. If they are tasked with more organizational or editing responsibilities, this aspect of their personality is not as important.

, Once you thoroughly interview each candidate and check their references contact the candidate that best meets what you're looking for. Set up one final talk and provide the documentation that your personal assistant will have to fill out. This should also be accompanied by an official offer letter that outlines their duties and pay.


You can say something like, ""Henry, out of all the candidates I interviewed I was impressed by you the most. I'd like to offer you the position.""

, Take your time and implement the training plan that you had mapped out earlier for your new virtual assistant. Train them on the most critical aspects of the job and make sure that they have what they need in order to be successful. For instance, if you are requesting that they work inside of a certain software application, it's important that they have the permission and access to that software.


Training a new employee takes time and patience. Unless they have extensive experience doing exactly what you are asking them, it will take time for them to become efficient at it.
Never be afraid to give positive or negative feedback on how your virtual assistant is performing their job.
Try to remedy any miscommunication with your virtual assistant as soon as it occurs.

, Make sure that they fully grasp key concepts and can complete the work that you've laid out for them. If you notice that they seem confused or are under-performing in some way, talk to them and provide them with additional training to improve. Compare how many hours they invoiced to the amount of work that they completed. If it seems like they are taking an exorbitant amount of time or is consistently inaccurate, have an open and honest conversation about their problems.You can say something like, ""I noticed it took you three hours to organize the emails for the day. Are you having a problem with the app or is something else taking up all your time?""
If your virtual assistant is not meeting the goals you've set forth for them, consider finding a new one.
Set reasonable deadlines and see if your virtual assistant can accomplish them.

, Because you are both working a remote environment, details could become confused or lost during communication. Make sure to constantly check in with your virtual assistant and ask for feedback. Sometimes they will request a greater level of clarity or instruction on a certain task and other times they'll tell you about important time sensitive information. Either way, having clear and frequent communication will make sure you're getting the most out of your virtual assistant.


Video conferencing once a week can make your interaction with the virtual assistant more personal and allow them to ask questions that they have.

"
Hear the responses listeners give you.,
Don't take yourself, or your ideas, too seriously.,
Make sure you aren't equating agreement with understanding.,
Be clear and concise.,
Speak clearly.,
Remain calm.,
Respect the viewpoint of others.,
Ask your co-workers and friends if they see you as an effective communicator; better yet, ask your boss.",How to Measure the Effectiveness of Communication," If your audience (be it one person or many) tells you they don't understand what you are saying, hear them. Many a good point is lost on listeners when a speaker refuses to stop pressing on with their speech to clarify a point they've made. Stop and clarify what you are saying even if it means it'll take longer to make your point(s).;
, If feeling ""misunderstood"" defines your life-long interaction with others, that's not a communication problem. It's probably an emotional and psychological problem.

, Humans understand an amazing amount of stuff, but they don't necessarily agree with what they see and hear. Communication is about the expression of ideas and thoughts, not gaining acceptance and agreement with every assertion made.

, You may have a million thoughts spinning through your mind as you communicate with others, but it is best to limit your expression of thought to one or two (related) things at a time. Attempts to de-clutter your head by talking to someone (unless you warn them first) will likely result in muddled communication. If your audience shows signs of being confused, frustrated, or inattentive, you may be drifting and need to stop talking and gather your thoughts before proceeding. Remember, the more you pack into a communication session, the less people will remember of it without prompting.

, If the words you speak are garbled, your grammar is poor and you speak too loudly or too softly, your communication is negatively affected. Practice reading into a recorder and listening to yourself talk to find the pitch and volume necessary for people to hear you easily, and refine your cadence and enunciation of words. There are many education websites, online, that offer help in grammar and phonics; take a few minutes each day to brush up on your skills.

, The more agitated you become while speaking or writing, the more difficult it is for you to clearly communicate your thoughts. If your voice rises and quakes, your listener will be distracted from what you are saying and retain little of it. If you find anxiety kicking in while you are speaking, stop for a moment, take a deep breath and let it out fully, then try again; no doubt your listener has been in your shoes and they'll be patient until you're ready to go on speaking.

, If you want to be a good communicator, you must learn to accept the strongly held views of others. People are not mentally weak, morally bankrupt, or inherently evil, merely because they disagree with the ideas you feel very strongly about. If you conclude arguments with others by saying ""Well, you must be stupid"" or ""You're just scared"" you've succumbed to the temptation to bully others, rather than keeping good perspective and allowing for dissent. To communicate more effectively, try playing devil's advocate with yourself over your most strongly held philosophical beliefs; bully yourself into seeing the opposing viewpoint.

, Those with whom you speak regularly can best tell you how well you relate to others, including people you don't particularly care for. Ask them if you tend to bully others. Ask if you most often persuade them to agree with, or inform them of your opinions. Ask them if they believe you are honest in your communication. And finally, ask them if they consider you trustworthy or in need of a major character overhaul.

Poll the employees.,
Project the savings.,
Document performance requirements.,
Retrofit the employees' home offices.,
Identify the positions and people that will migrate.,
Migrate in phases.,
Manage, manage, manage.,
Continue to evaluate.",How to Virtualize Your Workforce," The number one reason companies do not virtualize their workforce is that the management is afraid they will not be able to effectively monitor and motivate remote workers; they lack faith in their own management abilities. Managing a remote workforce is not significantly different from managing local employees – most communication is done on the phone and by email, anyway. Your managers will adapt quickly.;
, The number two reason people do not virtualize their workforce is that the management is afraid people will not do their jobs; that they will ""slack off"" and still collect a paycheck. If you truly believe that about any of your employees, then maybe you should look for a different person to fill that slot. The fact is that most people are motivated by achievement ... isn't that why you hired them in the first place?

, Learn about how to make telecommuting an effective work environment. You'll find that it's not significantly different than what you already have. There are plenty of companies that offer teleworking technology options for the sole purpose of helping companies, like yours, become virtual. The more you learn, the less frightening it will be. And don't forget to include support. Access to top technical support, preferably available 24x7, is critical to ensure high employee productivity when working remotely.

, Take the approach that virtualization is a requirement: any position must have a strong justification to avoid it. There are some types of jobs that simply cannot be virtualized, of course, but look at each one that isn't an obvious ""no"" and start with the assumption that it can be effectively done from a remote location. Jobs where the individual spends the majority of their time communicating by telephone and working on the computer are good matches. Of course, there are exceptions (virtualizing a call center is a major endeavor) but analysts, project managers, systems administrators, and programmers are examples that can fit easily.

, Who already has the ability to work from home? Most of your workforce probably can. There are some people who cannot and justifiable reasons would include distractions at home (e.g., young children), lack of access to high-speed Internet, no available space to create a home office, or some disabilities that require highly specialized accommodations.

, This is going to take some work – make no mistake about that. You may take into account such things as electrical savings for not having to run personal computers. If you are highly successful in this effort (virtualizing nearly the entire workforce), then HVAC savings could be substantial. Liability insurance may be decreased. Will you save on security? Don't forget the water bill. Remember that employees that don't drive to work may have a huge immediate savings in transportation expense so you can consider this an employee benefit – a direct compensation increase - but offset by their additional costs of electric and HVAC now that they are in a home office. Talk to your HR department about the potential savings in cost-of-living increases.

, This is critical. To effectively manage a remote workforce you have to have the expectations of the job clearly defined. Not just when people are to be ""at work"" but an actual performance outline. Migrating to remote management is like moving into management for the first time. The use of a task tracking system helps teleworkers manage their assignments easily. It also gives managers a more objective evaluation of performance with reports about completed tasks.

, It might be necessary (or desirable) for some (or all) employees to make use of their existing work computer at home. If their home computers are outdated or do not have required software (including security software) it may be more cost effective to check out the office computer to their home. Make sure telecommunications are in order, too; it's not unfair to have them pay for an extra phone line out of their own pocket because of their reduced commuting costs. They will already have increased HVAC and electric costs running a home office they may not have had previously due to setback thermostats and keeping lights off during commuting hours. You may want to have someone look over their home technology from both a safety and an efficiency viewpoint. Some companies do an OSHA review of the home office.

, Make a list, but don't post the entire list all at once. Post only the first few people that will migrate. Make it a curiosity and make it desirable. Only post the people that will migrate within the next week. This will attract attention and make being on the list feel like winning the lottery. That is the effect you want.

, Don't expect to drop everyone into a remote environment at once; a gradual change will show you how to tweak the process. On the other hand, don't do this on a one-by-one basis either. Select a group of people to start: either a small department or a person or two from several different departments. After your first migration, let a couple of weeks go by before the next phase, but don't take too much time; that can cause the process to become suspended. Proceed steadily but not aggressively.

, This is the most critical post-migration activity! While the skill sets to manage remotely are the same as other good management skill sets, you will need to be dedicated to making the new environment a success. Make sure they feel a strong management presence and feel completely comfortable that this is just like working at the office. At least initially, you'll need to dramatically increase your contact with the teleworkers, so they don't feel abandoned. If they begin to feel like they have no guidance, they'll become afraid for their jobs. Make sure they know, every day, their job requirements. Hold telephone one-on-one meetings weekly with each employee (30 minutes is a good block of time for that).

, Don't stop with your first evaluation. You might find that you missed some jobs that can be virtualized. Conversely, you might find that you made an incorrect assessment and some of the jobs are actually most efficiently done on site. Don't jump too quickly to reverse your decisions, but if you find that something needs to be rolled back, don't be afraid to make that change.

Set a budget.,
Do your homework on how to monitor the program.,
Establish a set of rules.",How to Reward Employees with Company Gifts1," Employee rewards can range in prices. First determine an annual budget for employee rewards, then assign a portion of this budget to each reward or program implemented.


When setting a budget, make sure you consider the motivation behind the program. Do you want to reward excellent customer service, good behavior, or increases in productivity? Make sure you know what your goal is before you start giving rewards or gifts.;
, It’s crucial to follow up with regard to how employees feel about the remuneration or gifts, how much your company is spending, and even with whether or not the program is consistently and fairly distributing the perks.


One way to keep tabs on the program is to distribute a survey to employees to get their feedback. The feedback can include how they feel about the types of rewards, the frequency with which they receive the reward, and the difficulty (or ease) of getting a reward.
Make sure you review the financial side of the reward system, which you can do in two ways. On one hand you’ll want to make sure you aren’t going over budget or burning through the budget too quickly. On the other hand, keep track of productivity and employee performance (if you aren’t already doing this). This way you can see if there is a correlation between specific rewards and positive or negative fluctuations in work. You might find, for example, that productivity rises by a few extra percentage points when specific types of gifts are given.

, Having a well-structured reward program can work quite effectively. Likewise, a poorly planned and executed program could have a negative impact on your business.


You need to be consistent and fair, so establish a universal set of eligibility requirements. Rewards need to be based on a set of criteria, such as having the highest sales. This is a great way to ensure complete transparency, eliminating possible favoritism.
There should also be a specific time limit for distributing rewards, as well as a particular time and place for each reward to be used. For example, it may not be the most optimal to have an employee to utilize a spa day certificate when the VP of Sales is conducting and audit.
Try to get the word out to your staff by promoting the reward program. Use emails, flyers and meetings to inform the employees of the new program. Ensure they know the qualifying criteria and how they can earn the reward.
Decide what to give. There are almost too many reward options to list, so plan ahead and review all of your options in advance.

Encourage prompt thinking.,
Link ideas to action items.,
Incorporate humor into your work environment.,
Offer special incentives for creative ideas.,
Engage employees from all departments.",How to Spur Employee Creativity1," This means asking employees to think on their feet. Meetings should possess an element of prompt responses; encourage employees to share ideas off the top of their heads in a fast rotation when discussing possibilities for a project. Promote the thought that every idea is welcome.These ideas should be documented, and then analyzed to see if they could actually be practical and effective. The focus should be on which idea most effectively solves the problem, rather than which idea is good or bad.;
, While coming up with ideas is great, coming up with ways to implement those ideas is better. Encourage employees to not only come up with ideas, but also to link those ideas to action agendas.You could have the action ideas be a group effort; when someone comes up with a good idea, you can designate a team to come up with how that idea could be put into effect.

, Using humor and fun in your creativity sessions can make exercises more engaging. Encourage people to be a little silly, but to also stay on track.Laughter can promote the production of dopamine and endorphins, both of which can help to keep your meeting low on tension but high in morale.

, Employees are more likely to participate if they are to be rewarded. To awaken the real creativity, the most workable ideas should be rewarded through incentives that could be as simple as a weekend getaway, or a bonus for the rendered contribution.


When employees receive appreciation for creativity and successful contributions, they will most likely be more quick to contribute in the future.

, Open up the floor for ideas from employees in all different departments. Sometimes having a different background can lead to ideas that others might not have thought of.


Encourage employees to chat with one another and seek help from other employees who are in different departments. Promote department mingling by setting up casual dinners or whole office outings.

Know your subject well.,
Use statistical references.,
Do not present points that do not support your position.,
Give the appearance of being intellectual.,
Be upbeat.,
Be ready for fallout.",How to Communicate Bad News Professionally1," You are going to make bad news sound like good news. To do so effectively, you must be knowledgeable of other facts and issues that are close to the situation. If, for example, you are presenting bad news about the deterioration of a forest due to extensive lumber harvesting, you must also know about other environmental impacts (e.g. fauna habitats). In this approach, you will be questioned about ancillary items. Be prepared.;
, Using numbers to back your presentation is a powerful tool. The truth is that, if carefully prepared, statistical references (this is different from real statistics that might weigh against you) can be used to back nearly any position. That doesn’t make the position right, but it does add power to your presentation. It’s a Sophist approach (Sophists focus on being able to argue either side with equal effectiveness – usually categorized as individuals without regard for ""truth"").

, Having said that, it is possible there are points you know will be raised. It may be desirable to diminish those points during your presentation. If that is appropriate, do not disparage or ""brush off"" the opposition, but rather indicate why those opposing points are either irrelevant or incorrect. Don’t spend a lot of time on this – the more time you take the more solidly the opposing positions will be anchored. Address them and move on. ""To address animal protectionist concerns, we have thoroughly studied the impact on local fauna and conclusively proven it to be negligible. We will make our studies available to appropriately qualified reviewers."" End of story – no questions.

, You don’t have to be a Rhodes Scholar to make your point, but it’s important that the audience believes you are well versed on this, and other related subjects. References to obscure but pertinent facts can have a powerful psychological impact. ""As most of you know, the six-year-old gymnogyps mates in the early fall and our efforts are clearly sensitive to this important event.""

, There is a line, often crossed, between an upbeat presenter and a snake oil salesman. ""Trouble with a capital ‘T’ and that rhymes with ‘P’ and that stands for pool!"" Even if you are selling snake oil, you don’t want to come across that way, right now. Remember, this is a bad news presentation.

, This technique is almost always transparent on an intellectual level. You are appealing to an immediate emotional reaction. After that reaction fades, the hope is that your sound bites will have enough exposure to carry. You will definitely get commentary on the ""glossed over"" areas. How you handle that is not within the scope of this document.

Directly ask your employees what they want.,
Keep your ear to the ground.,
Ask another company.",How to Reward Employees with Company Gifts2," Collecting information about employee preferences can save you a good deal of time and energy choosing reward options.


Put out a box or send a company-wide email asking for suggestions. This also serves as a way to promote the program.
It would be wise to actually choose a few of the staff’s suggestions and include them in the program. For example, Linda from Purchasing might be over the moon that her idea to allow Twitter time was chosen. In the event someone suggests allowing 20 minutes of quality Facebook or Twitter time during the workday, you can kick it up a notch and give them 2 or 3 periods of 15 to 20 minutes each as an extra reward for having met a serious deadline.

, By paying attention in general to employee behavior, you can use what employees say and do to predict what they’ll like.


You can deduce what makes the bees buzz by listening and observing behavior as you make your way to the restroom, or to get a cup of coffee. In fact, is there even coffee to get? The best reward may be the most obvious one.

, It’s a good idea to talk to a colleague or friend at another company to ask them how they reward their employees. Even if the business is not entirely similar to yours, you can adapt elements of their program to your company. Ask specific questions about what their employees appreciate, what amount they customarily offer, how frequently they give rewards, and also how they keep track of their reward system.

Give employees swag that represents your company.,
Buy a round of golf.,
Let them choose the gift.",How to Reward Employees with Company Gifts3," Picks items that your staff is likely to enjoy, and then make sure the items are made well.Cheaply made coffee mugs won’t impress, but putting on a 100% cotton shirt with a customized design on it may turn some heads. You can also give high quality metal travel mugs instead of the flimsy plastic ones. Make sure you shop around for quality swag as some websites, like Uncommon Goods or Personal Creations, allow you to custom order by gender and occasion.
You can also order items from sites that specialize in making printed goods, like photo mugs and t-shirts from Shutterfly or larger retailers like Walmart.com, both of which have options available in a number of price ranges. What’s more, these sites are easy to use, and after a few clicks, your personalized gift is on the way.

, Many employees enjoy getting out on the course. You can set a great example by buying a round of golf for two at a local club. It’s a good idea to get a round of golf for two people, and to include the golf cart. If that proves too detailed, it may be simpler to pick an amount that fits your budget and buy a certificate, allowing your employee to decide how to spend the money.


If you’re looking for something for top employees, consider giving a decent set of golf clubs. You can get a decent set of clubs for about $199 to $299, plus customization, and each time your staff member uses the clubs, they will be reminded of their hard work and your recognition of that.
You might also consider expanding this gift to include the entire sales team, or to sponsor an event, like a shotgun scramble.Alleviate the cost by rewarding an elite number of employees with tickets to the event, and sell tickets to the rest of the staff in order to cover the greens fees, food and beverages.

, You can put a company logo on almost any gift, so why not have a few options available for the employee to choose? Some people prefer hiking to golf, so you may think to include a quality daypack for the office weekend warrior."

Provide a car rental.,
Customize a digital water bottle.,
Impress them with a Fitbit.,
Buy a membership.",How to Reward Employees with Company Gifts4," Whether for a few days or the entire week, renting a luxury car or something unique, like a Porsche, may have employees looking forward to coming to work, not just heading home after work.

, Many high quality bottles have a digital display that tracks water consumption. Research shows that not staying hydrated at work can seriously affect productivity, so show you are invested in the well-being of your staff in addition to your bottom-line by promoting the consumption of the most important substance we consume., We live in a health-conscious world, and many companies agree that their employees should stay healthy. With a Fitbit, they can track their health and show off the swag they have won for being a great employee.

, Health clubs are more common now than ever, and competition has made them more affordable. Offer a one-year membership to a local gym or health club and really show your support for the health of your employees.

Buy employees a book.,
Send them to school.,
Pay for a conference.,
Pay for a professional membership to an organization.",How to Reward Employees with Company Gifts5," Many jobs require professional development. Help the process by purchasing a book that helps your employee grow. Examples include technical manuals, reference materials, and other educational resources, like computer software or hardware.

, A company that supports employee education is only going to grow stronger. Offer to cover continuing education courses, language classes, or other industry-specific seminars that will help your staff develop professionally.


Companies also provide reimbursement for education costs if their employees sign a contract stating they will remain for a minimum about of time. Even better are companies that provide unlimited tuition to their employees., Each field or industry has numerous conferences that people can attend or even present at. Cover conference related costs like travel, lodging, and meals. You can also offer two types of reward coverage. For example, the company would reimburse up to $500 for attending a conference, and $750 for presenting at the conference. By offering more to those who present, you’re fostering an environment of creativity and progress.

, In addition to taking classes and conferencing, it’s not uncommon for certain fields to require membership to a professional organization. For example, many humanities professors belong to the Modern Language Association, which requires a yearly fee that is based on your income.

Give a gift card.,
Allow employees to take a day off.,
Take them to a concert.,
Treat them to a meal.,
Reward the team with beer.",How to Reward Employees with Company Gifts6," A gift card is an excellent way to let someone think about what they want to do with what they’ve earned. Great possibilities could be Target, Overstock, or Amazon. Places like this have a great selection of items, convenient online ordering, and flexible return policies.


Massage certificates and going to the spa are great options to help people relax outside of work. Take it to the next level by also giving them a day off to use the reward. For those staffers who are not into massages, give tickets to a ballgame or a certificate to a popular local restaurant.
Cash is king. A cash reward is more than an old-fashioned way to say “thank you’. In tough economic times, cold, hard cash goes a long way to motivate your employees.

, It may seem counterproductive to reward hard work by allowing someone not to come to work, but there is more to this than meets the eye. A day off of work is an excellent way to show employees that you value their well-being and want them to relax. If missing a day is too much for the company to offer, or if it does more harm than good, perhaps offer a “work-from-home” day.

, Treat a staff member to a concert of their choice. The great part about music is that many smaller venues retail tickets for $20 or $30 each. However, since an Elton John ticket costs a touch more than an indie rock group, you might want to provide a few examples of concerts in your price range to show how much you are willing to spend, or you could just set a flat dollar amount.

, Even though a gift card to Applebee’s or Outback is a nice treat, find a popular local restaurant that is sure to impress. Maybe consider choosing a nice restaurant or a well-liked Gastropub. Also, make sure the certificate covers dinner for two! Whether it’s a spouse or coworker, people tend to dine with others.

, Some companies are taking rewards to another level by giving their employees the gift of beer.This can be done in very distinct, useful ways.


Go ahead and organize a play date. Many places now exist for people to brew their own beer. It’s simple: they show up, pick a recipe, and a professional brewer walks them through making the beer. So organize time for the employees to make their own brew. Take it to the next level and have them form teams to turn it into a competition.
Bring the fun into the office. Some places keep a keg of ale around the office to motivate and reward. If your team has met an ambitious quota or has just made it through a difficult time in the office, throw in a special microbrew IPA instead of the usual domestic draft and watch those frowns turn upside down. As a side note, set rules and guidelines to let people know there is a limit.

Encourage teams to get to know each other.,
Promote team walks.,
Make creativity a team effort.,
Let your teams showcase their ideas.,
Give your employees the freedom to take initiative.",How to Spur Employee Creativity2," Each team member should be familiar with the other members’ personalities. This can help to set the stage for both respect and openness, both of which are needed for fast brainstorming sessions.When team members know each other well, they may also arrive at more creative ways to think collectively.

, These walks could focus on problem solving, or on general conversations. Sharing experiences they have had can help employees to develop a deeper understanding of each other.


At the same time, walking (and moving in general) can often help to spur on creativity. Walking, particularly through nature, can help you to see things in a different way.

, Involve every team member in the process of identifying solutions. By doing this, individuals will feel more comfortable sharing ideas and positive criticism with the rest of the group.

, Give your teams whiteboards or other things where they can write down ideas so that they can have those ideas right in front of them.


Each time an individual has an idea, have him or her write it up on the whiteboard. You could even consider numbering the ideas so that your team can assess them in order during the next meeting.

, After evaluating the ideas, let both individuals and teams try implementing the ideas. Be open to letting your employees learn from their mistakes.

Identify common references.,
List every good thing that was done.,
Focus on the future.",How to Communicate Bad News Professionally2," You want to find other, similar events that had less favorable outcomes. You will use these as comparisons. Generally speaking, the more the better, but don’t use the entire list – keep some in reserve for backup. Definitely, the worse those other things are, the better the comparison. ""The outcome of our efforts was phenomenal when you consider that three of the other teams failed to recover over 30 times as many.""

, You’re not going to ignore the bad news, but you want the focus to be on the effort rather than the result. ""Despite the hazardous working conditions and the lack of proper funding and the obvious lack of local support those men and women persevered and overcame - they deserve our deepest thanks!""

, Catastrophes are nothing more than opportunities to improve. When you start talking about the future, you must expand on recent efforts. Don’t point out the things that weren’t done, but rather stick to how this lesson showed how the good things that were done can be improved and can be done better and faster. ""I'm going to work even harder to make sure the fallout from events like this are minimized, even further!""

"
"
Identify the good news.,
Present the facts.,
Outline the positive results.,
Avoid excuses.,
Avoid finger-pointing.",How to Communicate Bad News Professionally3," Before the negative event, what was going well? Find something that was on the upswing that is related to the bad news. It’s important to present this first. Do not ever present the bad news first. If you do that, the audience will often focus on that and you will lose their attention – they won’t even hear the good news. Give them something interesting so they’ll want to hear more.

, After the initial good news, lead directly into the bad news. Don’t segue with ""and now the bad news"" or you’ll deflate the positive impact the previous good news brought. When you state the bad news try to be be somewhat monotonic in nature but don’t waiver and don’t be apologetic.

, You’ve stated exactly what happened. Now, most importantly, what did you learn from it? Bad things do happen; accept it. But you can use those events to improve. This is most commonly called a post-mortem analysis. Done properly, such an analysis can lead to dramatic improvements. When you present your summary of the post-mortem, you will be telling the audience how this negative event poses a future benefit.

, Yes, it happened. No, it wasn’t a good thing. No, you’re not trying to dodge responsibility. Your objective is to state the news and nothing but the news. You’re simply going to put it in such a way that the audience recognizes you as a person of integrity. When done properly it’s likely you’ll get a round of applause by using this method.

, Instead of a blame fixer, be a problem fixer. Don't try to assign the bad news to someone - not even to yourself. Quibbling over who did what to whom behind which barn isn't going to solve anything. We were having a good day, something bad happened, here's what we're doing about it.

Gather the materials listed.,
Open up one end of the spring by cutting it, if it is not already open.,
Take the other end of the spring, cut it and slightly squeeze the end, by bending it inward till it looks something like this.,
When you get something that looks ok, you may need to file smooth any pointed edges with a fine threaded file.

,
Work with it till it looks safe enough to enter your nose without any danger of a sharp edge poking out from the spring.

Find a place to keep it.,
Take care to keep it clean and show it off where you know people will appreciate it (or not).",How to Make Your Own Nose Hair Plucker1," The little extension spring with the diameter of a drinking straw is the most important part, which is why you should be the most meticulous when choosing one.


It should be stainless steel, with smooth round coils, that fit tightly together in its relaxed state. It should not be a weak spring. It should be kind of tough, so you might want to try a few different kinds to see what suits your own quality and taste.





;
, Like this:

,


You may need to use more than one form of pliers to do this.






If you screw it up just cut the end off and try again till you get it right. It might take a few times for practice.







,,, Filing the nail will take a little bit of time.


You may want to use a grinder to help speed the project along.

, The nail should be about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) longer than the spring.


Pushing will open the spring's coils just a little bit. It shouldn't take much pressure, pushing on the nail, to do this. The spring's coils should not open more than a millimeter (about the thickness of 4 sheets of printer paper).







, Take your time.


The tape need NOT be very tight. Wrap a bit more of the tape around the end of the spring near the plunger (nail-head).






This will provide a holding spot for your fingers while your thumb can push on the plunger. :







,, You may keep it in your pocket, but it is recommended to use a little pouch or container to keep the parts together, as well as for sanitary purposes.


The nail will easily fall out of the spring as it is, within this set of instructions. :

, Either way, now you can have a healthier nose with cleaner nostrils, the way you had when you were young. :

Protect your skin from the sun.,
Avoid smoking.,
Practice good shaving habits.,
Moisturize your skin.,
Use anti-wrinkle creams.",How to Look Healthier1," Anytime you're in the sun, you expose your body to ultraviolet (UV) rays. In addition to increasing your risk of skin cancer, UV rays cause the skin to look older and more worn out.If you must be in the sun, be sure to cover up your skin with long sleeves/pants and a brimmed hat whenever possible. It's also important to choose a sunscreen that will protect you from UV radiation.Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Be sure your sunscreen has an SPF rating of at least 30,and reapply sunscreen at least once every two hours.Try to avoid being in direct sunlight between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM. That four hour window is when the sun's UV rays are strongest.Choose protective clothing that offers UV protection. You can also buy a laundry additive that will coat your clothing with a layer of UV protection. Check online or ask your local retailer about UV protective clothing and laundry additives.;
, Smoking is one of the biggest causes of premature aging of the skin.That's because daily exposure to cigarette smoke constricts the blood vessels in your skin's outer layers, decreasing blood, oxygen, and nutrient supplies to your skin. Smoking also reduces your skin's elasticity by reducing your body's collagen and elastin, and pursing the lips or squinting the eyes while smoking can cause premature wrinkles over time.Daily exposure to smoke and the facial expressions associated with smoking cigarettes can, over time, cause the skin to appear leathery and wrinkled.The best way to protect your skin from the effects of cigarette smoke is to quit or avoid starting altogether.Talk to your doctor about a treatment plan that can help you kick your habit.

, For many people, shaving is an important component of a daily hygiene plan. But depending on how you shave, you could be causing stress and irritation to your skin. Some simple, everyday practices to help protect your skin during shaving include:


using warm or cool water, rather than hotusing shaving cream or lotion, rather than using soap or attempting a ""dry shave""changing your razor blades frequently so you always use a clean and sharp razorThe ingredients in many soaps can quickly clog razors and dull the blades.
shaving in the direction hair grows, rather than against the grainpatting your skin dry to prevent excess moisture after shaving, Keeping your skin moisturized is an important part of maintaining a healthy appearance. That's because dried out skin cells shrivel and constrict, causing wrinkles, fine lines, and potentially reducing blood and oxygen flow to your skin.Moisturizing your skin won't prevent wrinkles forever, but it will help your skin look healthier and maintain elasticity., Another way to look healthier and improve your skin is by using skin care products like anti-wrinkle cream. These products won't instantly fix wrinkles or sun-damaged skin, but they may help improve elasticity and reduce wrinkles over time as part of a larger skin-care regimen.If you have dry or sensitive skin, be cautious when using these products. Some common ingredients in wrinkle creams include:


retinol, a vitamin A compound that helps neutralize free radicals and prevent skin cells from breaking down prematurelyvitamin C, which may help protect the skin from damage caused by the sun's UV rayshydroxy acids (alpha-, beta-, and poly-hydroxy acids) are exfoliants that help remove dead skin cells and allow new, smoother skin cells to growcoenzyme Q10 can help reduce wrinkles, especially around the eyes, and may reduce or prevent damage caused by the suntea extracts contain antioxidants, and may have anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe irritated or damaged skingrape seed extracts also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and may help wounds heal fasterniacinamide is related to vitamin B3 and can help prevent the skin from drying out, which improves the skin's elasticity and appearance"

Consume fiber-rich foods if you have constipation.Fiber can help prevent IBS symptoms because it improves intestinal functioning.,
Avoid sweets, fatty foods, and any food or drink containing fructose syrup.,
Try an elimination diet.Even with the above guidelines, each body reacts differently to different foods.",How to Live with Irritable Bowel Syndrome1," It may decrease bloating, pain, and other symptoms by softening your stools so that your body can pass them more easily.Good sources of fiber are fruits, vegetables, whole grain breads, and whole grain cereals. Try to eat something containing fiber with each meal. Add fiber to your diet slowly to minimize bloating and gas that can be brought on by a sudden increase in fiber. Work with your doctor and possibly a dietitian to find a diet that is healthy and that works for you.
Sources of soluble fiber may also help, such as dried beans and other legumes, oats, barley, and berries. These work to slow down the passage of food from the stomach to the intestines.
If you suffer from diarrhea caused by IBS, then this diet modification is not for you. You don't need to avoid fiber entirely — you need it as part of a healthy diet — just make sure you're eating soluble fiber (found in peas, oats, dried fruits, and more) rather than insoluble fiber (found in wheat, corn, the skins of root vegetables, and more).;
, All of these can make IBS symptoms worse, including diarrhea.Specific foods to avoid are dairy, honey, chocolate, sugar-free candy and gums, and wheat and rye breads.Also, vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts may trigger bloating and gas.Beverages to avoid include alcoholic beverages, dairy, anything containing chocolate, anything with caffeine such as coffee, tea, and soda, and anything with fructose syrup., Elimination diets are a very effective way to pinpoint foods that trigger negative reactions. Make a list of possible food triggers, then eliminate one food at a time for 12 weeks. Another option is to try a gluten-free and/or a lactose-free diet, as these are common triggers for IBS symptoms. See if bloating and gas decrease. If you switch to either diet permanently, make sure to research and work with your doctor to ensure you're getting appropriate nutrition.

Moisturize the rest of your body.,
Turn on a humidifier.,
Take an antihistamine.,
Sleep on the other side.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Look Sexy in the Morning1," For healthy skin, make sure your nighttime bath or shower is warm, not hot. If it's too hot, it can strip your skin. Plus, make sure you don't scrub your skin too much, as it can irritate it.Make sure you pick a gentle soap for your skin. Look for ones that say ""for sensitive skin.""However, make sure your bath or shower isn't too long, as it can dry out your skin.Instead of rubbing your skin dry afterwards, pat it dry. Rubbing can also dry out your skin. In addition, apply a light moisturizer after you dry off.;
, If you don't shower or bathe at night, make sure you wash your face. If you don't, the makeup and grime on your face from the day before will end up leaving your face looking worse in the morning. Try an oil-based cleanser, which will remove your makeup more easily with less rubbing., You don't want to wake up with terrible morning breath and plaque on your teeth. That is not sexy. You should floss between your teeth and brush for at least 2 minutes before going to sleep.Try using a paint-on whitener at night to wake up with even brighter teeth.

, To keep from waking up with dried, cracked skin on your face, use a moisturizer before you go to sleep. You can use a thick, oil-based cream if your skin can handle it. You can also use oil-free creams. Basically, using any type of lotion to moisturize your face can help plump out wrinkles and fine lines. Just rub it on before you go to sleep., If you have dry skin, applying a moisturizer at night can help cut down on dryness. Try picking a thick, oil-based cream, and rub it all over your body. Focus on tough areas such as your hands, feet, and elbows., Humidifiers help keep the air wetter. In turn, that helps keep your skin moisturized. As moisturized skin shows fewer lines, you'll have sexier in the morning., If you have allergies, you can wake up with puffy eyes. Tame your allergies by taking an antihistamine before you go to sleep. In turn, your eyes will be less puffy, and you'll feel sexier.Old-style antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and chlorpheniramine can help you sleep, as they cause drowsiness, but they may leave you feeling groggy in the morning if you're not used to taking them.You can also try non-drowsy antihistamines, such as loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or fexofenadine (Allegra)., If you always sleep on one side, try sleeping on the other. Sleeping on the same side all the time causes wrinkles, and you can give that side a break by turning over., Simply getting enough sleep can help you appear sexier in the morning. In one study, people who didn't get enough sleep were rated less attractive than those who had. So make sure you are getting the required 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night."

Develop a Request for Change (RFC): This may originate from problem management where an issue, or a series of related issues, is identified and a mitigating change is necessary to prevent (or minimize) future effects.,
Obtain Business Change Acceptance: The decision to make a change is typically a business decision where costs vs. benefits are weighed.,
Initiate the Development Project: Development of the change (including testing) is an IT-guided function.,
Pass the Change Management Gate: The Change Advisory Board (CAB) reviews all changes before they can be put into production.,
Implement the Change: If the CAB does not approve the change, the reasons are listed (this is always because certain risks have not been mitigated or communications have not been planned) and the development team will be given time to fix those issues and reschedule a meeting before the CAB.,
Report the Results: Either the change was implemented successfully with no issues, the change was implemented with issues that were corrected during implementation, the change was implemented with issues that were deemed acceptable, issues arose that were unacceptable and the change was rolled back, or in the worst case the change was implemented with unacceptable issues and could not be rolled back.,
Link Problem Management to Changes: Issues that arise should be compared to the CAB documentation of changes so any unanticipated adverse effects of a change can be isolated.,
Periodically Audit the CMP: At least once each year an audit of the CMP should be conducted to assure that all change documentation is maintained and available.",How to Develop an IT Change Management Program," The RFC may also originate as a result of a business decision that will require some modification (add, delete, change) to the supporting technology. An RFC may also be necessary due to outside influences (i.e. governmental regulations or changes made by business partners).;
, Even in situations where the change is strictly infrastructure oriented (component or system failure) the decision to spend money resides with the business, not with the IT department. There are occasions when procedures are developed in advance to preauthorize changes such as emergency system maintenance, but regardless of the timing of the authorization, the decision still rests with the business management.

, In the event of an emergency change (server is down) those functions are typically predetermined. When a new system is to be developed, there is a collaborative effort between the business users and the IT team. The systems are designed by IT, the design is approved by the business partners (users), developed by IT, tested by a combination of IT and the users, and the final product is approved by both. Careful attention must be given to ancillary effects the new change may have on existing systems.

, Normally, the CAB will consist of a group of people with different perspectives, backgrounds and areas of expertise. Their function is to review the change from a process and governance standpoint to assure that all foreseeable risks have been identified and mitigated, and that compensatory techniques are in place for any elements of exposure (things that could go wrong). The development team and the change sponsor will present the change to the CAB. Evaluation of risk will be the focus. Implementation strategies, communication to affected stakeholders, backup plans and post-implementation monitoring are elements on which the CAB is required to focus. The CAB is not responsible for determining if the change is appropriate – that decision has already been made. The CAB is also not responsible for determining if the change is cost effective. Again, that is strictly a business decision.

, If the change is approved, the implementation is scheduled. It is not normally the case that the CAB is represented at implementation although it is possible that some members of the CAB have expertise that is necessary during the implementation, but they will not be present as official CAB representatives, but rather as subject matter experts (SME). How the change is implemented, the checklist and steps, are predefined and were presented to and approved by the CAB. The entire process must be thoroughly documented and the approved process must be precisely followed.

, Whatever the result, that is documented and returned to the CAB. The CAB is then responsible for distributing that information to the stakeholders and for storing and maintaining those results in the Change Management system (that may either be an automated database or a paper filing system, but the documents must be maintained for audit purposes).

, It is often the case that undesirable effects of a change are not noticed immediately, but are identified by the emergence of problems in ancillary systems. For example, the addition of several fields to a database might not have a direct negative effect on the users but could impact network performance that would be apparent to other users who are not directly involved with the modified system.

, Every change approval document should be examined to assure that the proper signatures are in place and that the results of the implementation are properly documented.

Watch for allergic reactions.,
Think about how your eyes feel.,
Look at your eyes.,
Consider your risk factors.,
Contact your doctor.,
Get an exam.,
Wash your eyes.,
Replace your eye makeup.,
Wash your linens.,
Get medical treatment.",How to Know if You Have Eye Mites," Eye mites carry bacteria that can cause infection, especially if you have rosacea. If you have rosacea, pay attention to any changes in your eyes. Signs of an allergic reaction include:Watery eyes
Eyes that hurt
Red eyes
Swollen eyes;
, Most people know when they have an eyelash in their eye because it feels like something is in your eye. Eye mites can also make you feel like a foreign body is in your eye. Your eyelids may also feel itchy and you might experience a burning sensation in your eyes.You should also consider if your vision has changed. If your eyesight becomes blurry, you may have eye mites.

, Unfortunately, you won't be able to look at your eyelashes and eyelids and tell if you have eye mites. They're so small that they can only be seen under magnification. But, you may notice your eyelids become thicker or crusty if you have eye mites. And, you might lose eyelashes if you have mites.Your eyelid can also look red if you have eye mites, especially along the margin or edge.

, The risk of eye mites increases as you age. Some studies estimate that over 80% of people over the age of 60 have eye mites and that these tiny creatures may are present on many children too. People with the skin disorder rosacea often have eye mites.Eye mites are just as common in men as in women with a similar distribution worldwide regardless of race.

, If you experience any of these symptoms, you might have eye mites. Unfortunately, they're so small that you can't tell if you have them just by looking at your eyes. And, since many of these symptoms could be caused by other eye problems, you'll have to go to the doctor to know if you have eye mites.


You can also ask your eye doctor to make an eye mites diagnosis or check your eyes for another eye condition that could be causing your symptoms.

, Your doctor will have you sit at a slit-lamp. If you've ever had your eyes checked, the eye doctor used a slit-lamp. You sit with your chin and forehead on a support while a bright light and microscope examine the front of your eye.The doctor will look for the small mites which will be attached to the base of your eyelash. Sometimes, the doctor will pull out an eyelash or two to examine under a microscope.Some doctors will pull an eyelash in order to show you the mites under the microscope.
If the doctor doesn't see any mites, you'll be checked for other conditions that could be causing your eye irritation (like allergies or a foreign object in your eyes).

, Mix equal parts tea tree oil and an oil like olive, castor, avocado or jojoba. Dip a cotton ball in the mix and gently scrub around your eyelids and eyes. Leave the solution on your eyes as long as you don't have any stinging. If you do feel stinging, rinse with warm water. Re-apply the solution every four hours for one week and then every eight hours for three more weeks.You need to continue washing your eyelashes and eyes so that you account for the lifespan of the eye mite (four weeks).
Since tea tree oil can irritate, you may want to ask your eye doctor about using it.

, It is not clear if wearing eye makeup increases the risk of eye mites, but if you do wear make up (especially mascara) make sure the mascara is not old and is well-sealed. Don't forget to wash your makeup brushes at least twice a month. Follow this makeup replacement schedule:Liquid eyeliner: every three months
Cream eye shadow: every six months
Pencil eyeliners and powders: every two years
Mascara: every three months

, Because mites can survive on clothing and bedsheets (but are very susceptible to heat), wash all clothing, towels, bedsheets, pillowcases, handkerchiefs, blankets and any other material that may have come into contact with your eyes and skin in hot, soapy water. Dry them at high heat. Do this at least once a week.You should also have your pets checked for mites and wash their linen.

, Your doctor will probably talk to you about washing with tea tree oil. Although your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter product like permethrin or ivermectin, more research is needed to determine their effectiveness.You'll also need to keep up good hygiene for several weeks, so that the mites don't hatch eggs and repopulate your eyelids.


If you think you have eye mites, see your doctor before starting any treatments. This is especially important if you have rosacea since the eye mites can cause a bacterial infection.

Research employee motivation strategies.,
Brainstorm motivational techniques.,
Consult with management.,
Ask your employees what they want out of a motivational program.,
Make plans to improve the working environment.,
Consider offering incentives.,
Be open about everything.,
Examine your resources.,
Pick the best aspects of the strategy.,
Meet with your management team.,
Work with the entire organization to implement your strategy.,
Be open to revisions.",How to Write an Employee Motivation Strategy," A massive amount of research has been done and is still being done into employee motivation strategies. Search online to identify scientific studies, articles, and books that deal with motivational techniques. Then, take the time to study them carefully and take notes. Throughout your research, you will see many different techniques and behaviors that can be used to drive employees to action.


Some of these may conflict with each other, requiring you to decide which will be better for your organization.
Make a list of possible techniques so that you can evaluate them with your own thoughts and those of your management and employees.For example, you might look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Herzberg's hygiene theory, and McGregor's X and Y theories as a start.;
, Use what you have learned from your research to identify employee motivational techniques already in use in your organization. Think about which strategies have been most effective for you and your employees. Not all researched techniques will be effective for your organization, so think back to those you have used and identify those that have worked or have not worked for you in the past.


Write down a list of effective and ineffective strategies. Remember to note any strategies that you have not used and those that were met with indeterminate success., Speak to your peers in management or your management team if you are in charge of one. They will have thoughts on the best strategies for motivating employees as well. Ask them to provide support for their theories and talk about times where each strategy was successful. In some cases, they may believe to have used successful strategies, but employees found them less so.


Talk to your boss or mentor if you have one. This can be another useful source of motivation advice., Provide an opportunity for them to share ideas as you build your strategy. If employees have a way to provide anonymous feedback, you may get some helpful honest input about what would motivate them. They will also be more likely to participate in the motivational programs enthusiastically if they have some control over their creation.


Consider using one-on-one meetings, surveys, or performance appraisals to get employee input.
Try simply asking what your employees want. For example, they may want more respect, recognition, pay, benefits, or opportunities for growth. Or they may wish their work were more interesting, challenging, or meaningful.Think about inviting a counselor/ psychologist to the workplace. This can give employees a chance to discuss their issues related to work or behavior that demotivates them or make them less productive. Psychologists can also give them suggestions to cope with calm and positive behavior and move on.

, Realize the impact that a supportive and productive work environment has on motivation. Employees seem to feel most dedicated to their jobs when they feel heard in the workplace and are supported in doing their jobs productively.


Try to eliminate red tape and issues or processes that make your employees less productive. Being able to make an impact on their projects in the most effective and efficient ways possible is motivating in itself to many people.
Avoid punishing employees for mistakes and errors. Instead, support them by providing a remedy for the error and using the experience to teach them.This can also include the physical working environment. Consider improving the visual attractiveness of the office with more color, additional open space, and artwork., While cash incentives or raises can sometimes be somewhat effective, other recognitions of success can motivate employees more strongly. Some of these include:


Simply celebrating or congratulating an employee on their achievement.
Providing extra perks for employee's extraordinary work (flexible scheduling, extra time off, gifts and products, etc).
Giving awards for high achievers. For example, creating a program that recognizes the Employee of the Month.
Offering bonuses and incentives (monetary bonuses, stock options, retirement contributions, etc).
Offering advancement opportunities.
Giving top-performing employees a chance to attend a workshop or conference to improve their skills., Employees can sometimes lose hope when it seems like management isn't listening to them or that their contributions are not important. To remedy this, make an effort to improve your transparency and communication with them. Share the business's goals, progress, and success with them, showing how their contributions have added up to get you to that point.


If possible, relate positive customer feedback to your employees. Hearing what customers have to say will reinforce positive behaviors and lead to even better customer service., What do you have to offer employees that might motivate them? Is there extra money around for bonuses, or the opportunity to provide employees with other perks like stock options or promotional products?


If your business or company doesn't have a lot of extra revenue, there are still other ways to motivate people fairly cheaply, like offering group/social events for the team, or using awards and small rewards to help keep people focused.

, After considering the preceding strategies and incorporating employee, manager, and outside feedback, choose the strategies that you think will work best for your organization. Check through your list to make sure that no strategy conflicts with any other. Compile your strategies into an overall employee motivation strategy. This strategy should explain the different changes that need to be made and what resources to allocate to making them., Hold a meeting with your managers to present the new motivation strategy. They must be taught the strategy and associated behaviors before they can begin to use them. You and your management team will also need to lead by setting an example for them to follow. This means displaying the work ethic, values, and attitude required in the motivational strategy.


This helps to create a more motivational culture that adds to and improves your strategy. An effective workplace culture can lead to a self-sustaining source of employee motivation., In the interest of transparency, present the changes being made to all of your employees. Note any office, managerial, or procedural changes being made. Bring up new opportunities for advancement, professional development, or employee involvement. Educate employees on how to take advantage of these new opportunities.


Involving employees in these changes will help them to accept the new strategy and commit to improvement., Even if you write up a plan and think it's ideal, in reality it may or may not prove to be motivating to your employees. If you find it doesn't work in the long run, or if you employees have suggestions for change, go with the flow; there's no point in a motivation strategy that doesn't motivate people, so be open to changing the strategy in the future.


Provide managers and employees with feedback on how the changes have affected productivity, output, or another metric.
Allow for feedback about what is working and what isn't. You can use this knowledge to improve your strategy over time."

Care for your teeth.,
Bathe or wash regularly.,
Wash your hair.,
Wear clean clothes.",How to Look Healthier2," Taking care of your teeth can go a long way towards having a healthier appearance. Poor dental hygiene can lead to plaque, gum disease, tooth decay, and bad breath.Brush your teeth twice each day.To brush your teeth, squeeze out a pea-sized drop of toothpaste onto your toothbrush and scrub the inside, outside, and underside of each tooth's surface. It should take you about two minutes to thoroughly brush your teeth.Use dental floss. Flossing helps remove food debris stuck between your teeth and can also reduce gum disease and halitosis.To floss, take a strand of dental floss about 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) in length, wrap the ends around each index finger, and gently work the floss up and down as well as side-to-side between each tooth. Unroll a little floss from one finger while tightening the wrap on the other to ensure that you are not simply spreading plaque and debris from one tooth to the next.Use mouthwash, especially a mouthwash that contains fluoride. This will help kill germs, get rid of bad breath, and prevent tooth decay.To rinse, measure out about a half-cap to a cap full of mouthwash from the bottle, swish it around in your mouth, and spit it out without swallowing any., A shower or bath is ideal, but a sponge bath (wiping down with a wet sponge or washcloth) is a good alternative if they are not available.For best results, use a soap or body wash that you like. Try to balance fragrance with moisturizing capabilities so that your skin does not become irritated by the soap.
Daily bathing is a social norm, and not necessary for health or hygiene. In fact, some dermatologists say that daily washing strips your skin of natural oils and beneficial bacteria. Most adults can stay clean and healthy by washing every other day instead., It's important to wash your hair with shampoo or soap at least once each week, though many people prefer to wash their hair on a daily basis.Having clean hair is an important part of personal hygiene maintenance, and it will help you look healthier and feel more confident.


Thoroughly wet your hair.Squirt a glob of shampoo into the palm of your hand. A quantity about the size of a quarter should be sufficient, though if your hair is very long you may need more shampoo.If you tend to have dry, frizzy hair, try using a moisturizing shampoo. Look for haircare products that contain natural oils like olive oil, or other moisturizing agents like glycerin and shea butter. Avoid products containing mineral oil and petroleum, as these may further dry out your hair.Rub the shampoo into your hair and gently massage your scalp. Don't scrub your scalp too hard, though, as this may cause pain and irritation.Rinse all the shampoo out of your hair. Make sure there is no more shampoo remaining in your hair, as this may cause irritation.Let your hair air dry, or use a towel to gently dry off your head. Try to avoid using a hair dryer whenever possible, as it can dry out or irritate your hair and scalp., Clothes can carry dirt, germs, and unpleasant body odors. Re-wearing clothes multiple times can cause you to appear dirty or unhealthy. For best results, wash your clothes with laundry detergent any time they become soiled or have been worn more than once.Using a dryer or hanging your clothes directly in the sun can help kill germs that may have lingered through the washing machine. If you are using an unclean water source to wash your clothes, you also run the risk of carrying microscopic parasites in your clothing, even after washing. Use heat or direct sunlight, rather than simply air-drying your clothing indoors, to prevent the spread of germs and parasites."

Eat a balanced diet.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Look Healthier3," Nutrition is important for your body's overall health, but it can also play a role in how healthy and cared for you look. That's because the nutrients you receive through food are used by your body to grow and make new cells.If you consistently eat an unhealthy diet, your body may not be getting the nutrients it needs, which can result in body weight issues like obesity, or in deficiencies like anemia.Anemia can cause a pale appearance, fatigue, and other health problems.Get two to seven ounces of lean protein each day. Protein can come from lean meats (like salmon, tuna, of low-fat chicken) or meat-alternatives (like tofu or seitan). You can also get protein from nuts, beans, and eggs.Be sure to get at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day.Keep your fat intake below 30 percent of your total energy intake.Try to consume only “good” fats that are unsaturated and are especially beneficial to improving your skin’s appearance. These fats can be found in: fish and shellfish, flaxseed, hemp oil, soya oil, canola oil, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, leafy vegetables, walnuts, sesame seeds, avocados, salmon and albacore tuna.Aim for two to three servings of dairy products each day.Eat three to eight ounces of grains each day. Whenever possible, choose whole grains, such as whole grain breads or pasta.Avoid foods and drinks with added sugar, including processed and packaged foods., Exercise can help you look and feel healthier.A rigorous workout routine can help you lose and manage health conditions like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, anxiety, and arthritis.For best results, try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise each day.Talk to your doctor about starting a workout program that's right for you. You can also ask your doctor for specific workout recommendations that will help you meet your goals., Drinking water does more than just satisfy your thirst. It also helps your heart pump blood more efficiently, which in turn helps your muscles work better. Hydration can also reduce inflammation like swollen feet and prevent painful symptoms like headache or dizziness.A general rule is that you should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day. However, if you are physically active and/or live in a warmer climate, you may need considerably more water each day.
Monitoring your urine is the best way to gauge dehydration. If your urine comes out clear or pale yellow, you are adequately hydrated. If the color of your urine is a darker shade of yellow, or if you produce little to no urine while going to the bathroom, that is a sign that you may already be dehydrated.

Practice good posture.,
Use clothing to highlight your body shape.,
Pair your tops and bottoms.,
Choose the right colors.",How to Look Healthier4," Posture is the general term for the ways in which you hold your spine, neck, and shoulders upright. Your posture affects the way you walk, stand, sit, and lie down. It also has an impact on your digestive system and your heart and lung function. Poor posture can result in misaligned bones/joints, arthritis, pain, and fatigue.Practicing good posture will help you look and feel healthy and remain active.When standing, try to pull in your abdomen and keep your back somewhat straight. Let your shoulders relax, but don't let them slouch down or forward - instead, try to keep them back somewhat, so your arms fall straight at your sides. Balance your weight across both feet, and try to keep a stance approximately hip-distance apart.When sitting upright, keep your back straight and your shoulders pressed back. Try to keep your knees bent at a 90 degree angle and your feet flat on the floor. Avoid sitting in the same position for more than 30 minutes without standing, stretching, or adjusting your position.Try to sleep in a posture that allows for some curvature of the back. For example, lying on your side with your knees slightly bent is a good and natural position, whereas lying on your side with your knees pulled up towards your chest will be painful and uncomfortable.If you need to pick something big and heavy off the floor, practice good lifting posture. Squat down in front of the object with a wide stance, then grab hold of the object and stand straight up, using your legs (and not your back) to lift your body and the object upright. Avoid twisting your back while lifting, and never bend at the waist to lift something off the floor, as these acts may cause serious injury.Proper ergonomics is important to maintain back health.

, Slimmer clothing has a tendency to highlight an individual's body shape in a more flattering way. While overly baggy clothing may appear ""frumpy,"" slimmer clothes can emphasize the hips, legs, or overall figure of the person wearing them.At the same time, though, some fashion experts caution that wearing clothes that are too tight may cause a person to look larger than they actually are.The trick may be finding the right degree of tightness for a slim, tailored look.


Pairing skinny jeans with a slightly looser shirt is one way of balancing your wardrobe to highlight your body's features without causing the wardrobe to appear constrictive., It's fine to wear tighter, low-rise jeans or a tight crop top, but if your body stores excess fat in the midsection and you combine low-rise pants and a crop top, your clothing will squeeze your body into a distorted shape. This may cause you to look heavier or more out of shape than you are, which may in turn affect your self confidence.If you are more comfortable and feel better about yourself wearing a certain style of clothing - say, tighter jeans or a more cropped top - then by all means, continue to dress the way you're comfortable. Making simple changes like the color of your clothing can make a big difference no matter what style of clothing you wear., Often times the colors of a shirt, dress, or blouse have a stark contrast with the skin color of the person wearing those clothes. While this may be intentional and could have a positive effect on some individuals, it could also make your skin appear very pale or discolored, which may look unhealthy or malnourished to the untrained eye.Try matching your shirt's color to your skin tone to achieve a healthier, more natural appearance."

Ask about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).,
Prioritize time for relaxation.,
Use exercise to relieve stress and to improve overall well-being.",How to Live with Irritable Bowel Syndrome2," CBT helps IBS patients to cope with the stress and anxiety that often come hand-in-hand with the condition.It trains people to identify and to change inaccurate perceptions they may have of themselves and of the world around them. People are trained to analyze negative, distorted thoughts, and to replace them with positive and realistic thoughts. CBT has been used as a strategy to help IBS patients ease symptoms and improve quality of life.


Many IBS patients show symptom improvement after undergoing CBT. In one study, 60% to 75% of participants had improvement in their symptoms after a 10-week CBT program. Some patients who suffer from prolonged anxiety and/or depression as a result of the challenge of living with IBS find it helpful to try antidepressant medication.Speak to your doctor if you feel this may be a helpful option for you.

, Stress is a well-known trigger for IBS symptoms. In times of stress, nerves in the colon can contract and cause abdominal pain. People with IBS are more sensitive to stress-induced abdominal symptoms. Learning relaxation techniques may help to alleviate IBS symptoms.


Try setting aside time every day to do something that relaxes you, such as taking a nap, reading, or listening to music. Another option is to try meditation. Stress-relieving meditation has been shown to suppress the activity of genes that contribute to inflammation in people with IBS. One study showed that people who did yoga and meditation regularly for two months had fewer symptoms as a result., Regular exercise is even more important for people with IBS than it is for others. In 2011, researchers reported that people with IBS who exercised with the support of a physical therapist several times a week experienced improved IBS symptoms compared to a control group that did not exercise with a physical therapist.Exercising also helps the digestive system to work properly and it may help to decrease constipation. Another study showed that IBS patients who performed moderate exercise for 30 minutes a day, five days a week, had significantly less constipation symptoms.Aim for exercise that gets your heart pumping. Try cardiovascular activities, like biking or walking. These activities will improve your overall health and help to release tension and stress."

Take probiotics.,
Inquire about hypnotherapy.,
Opt for acupuncture.,
Try peppermint.",How to Live with Irritable Bowel Syndrome3," Probiotics are ""good"" bacteria that normally live in your intestines and are found in yogurt and some dietary supplements and can be bought in drink form or pill form. Some studies suggest that probiotics may relieve symptoms of IBS like abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.Probiotics can be bought at your local health foods store either in pill form or in liquid form. The pill form is normally taken once per day; for the liquid form, follow the instructions on the bottle.
Another option is to consume more fermented foods such as Kombucha or sauerkraut, which offer the benefit of ""good bacteria"" without having to take probiotic supplements.

, Hypnotherapy is another proven method of coping with IBS and reducing stress.The hypnotherapist gives the patient methods of coping. In some studies, people with IBS had a 52% improvement of their symptoms after 12 weeks of hypnotherapy. , Acupuncture may help to ease symptoms and to reduce stress. Certain acupuncture points along the meridians of the stomach and large intestine are selected, causing IBS symptoms to diminish or even disappear in some cases., Peppermint may offer some relief from IBS symptoms. It is a natural antispasmodic that relaxes the muscles in the intestines and may relieve diarrhea and pain.Study results have been inconsistent, although some people find short-term relief. If you'd like to try peppermint, be sure to use enteric-coated capsules (otherwise it may worsen heartburn).One option is to take ""enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules.""These are specifically designed in a capsule so that they do not dissolve in the stomach (which could lead to symptoms of heartburn), but rather, travel into the intestines before dissolving and having their antispasmodic effect.
Taking a enteric-coated peppermint oil pill before each big meal has been shown in clinical trials to be helpful for patients suffering of IBS.

Appreciate that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are not the same.,
Know that employee morale is directly connected to their work situation.,
Attend to the factors at play.,
Look out for signs of low morale.",How to Raise the Morale of Employees1," They can co-exist, independent of one another. By decreasing dissatisfaction, one does not necessarily increase satisfaction with a job. You might think of it as the presence or lack of rewards (satisfaction) versus the presence or lack of unpleasantness (dissatisfaction). You might grow to hate children, but still continue teaching grade school for the benefits.A job with a great benefits package can't change the fact that an employee still might not be satisfied with the actual profession itself, however much they may be satisfied by their position within that profession.
A person may be willing to suffer through very dissatisfying working conditions given a great satisfaction in the work they do.;
, While individual and group morale can vary, and not every morale problem stems directly from work, there are some qualities that play a large role in cultivating high morale in the workplace.


Credibility refers to the larger society's perception of the company and position itself.
Respect corresponds to level of respect among coworkers in the workplace.
Pride is a quality that a worker must have in the work and role they perform.
Fairness must exist between the employer and the employee.
Companionship must exist among coworkers in order to foster a workplace community., There is more than just one piece of the employee morale puzzle. If you attempt to solve a morale problem by thinking about it from just one angle, you won't have a clear picture of the problem. Think about the different elements that can contribute to employee morale.


Attitudes of executives and managers towards subordinates.
Working conditions, including pay hours of work and safety rules
Effective leadership and an intelligent distribution of authority and responsibility in the organization
The design of the organization’s structure which facilitates the flow of work
The size of the organization.

, These may not appear all at once, and they may not indicate low morale related to work. However, if you notice these patterns among many employees, you may have a morale problem. Pay close attention to:


High rates of absenteeism
Tardiness
High turnover
Strikes and sabotage
Lack of pride in work

Prevent nail fungus.",How to Know if You Have Nail Fungus," Nail fungus is most often caused by a dermatophyte fungus, but the infection can also stem from yeasts and molds on your nail.The fungi, yeasts, or molds that cause nail fungus can infect you and thrive under the following conditions:


Invisible cuts on your skin or a small separation of your nail bed
Warm, moist environments that can include swimming pools, showers, and even your shoes.;
, Although any person can get nail fungus, certain factors can make you more prone to developing it.Your risk may be at a higher risk because of:Age, which can reduce blood flow and slow nail growth
Gender, especially men with a family history of nail fungus infections
Location, in particular if you work in a humid or moist environment or if your hands or feet are often wet
Heavy perspiration
Clothing choices, such as wearing socks and shoes that don’t allow proper ventilation and/ or absorb perspiration
Proximity to someone who has nail fungus, especially if you live with an infected person
Having athlete’s foot
Having a minor skin or nail injury or skin condition like psoriasis
Having diabetes, circulation problems, or a weakened immune system

, Nail infections exhibit some typical symptoms that can help you quickly know if you have the condition. Nails infected with fungi, yeast, or molds may be:Thickened
White or discolored, with or without speckles of white in the nail bed
Brittle, crumbly, or ragged
Distorted in shape
Dull and lacking any shine
Dark in color, which is a result of debris build-up under the nail
Nail fungus can also cause the nail to separate from the nail bed

, Pay close attention to your nails to notice if any changes occur to them over time. This can help you more easily know if you have nail fungus and get timely treatment.Notice white and yellow patches or streaks under and on the sides of the nail, which is one of the first signs you may notice.Look for changes to the texture of your nail such as brittleness, thickening, or loss of lustre.Remove nail polish at least once a week so that you can check your nails. Polish may make it difficult to effectively recognize nail fungus symptoms.

, More advanced cases of nail fungus may cause pain and possibly inflammation to your nails and surrounding tissues.Thickened nails may accompany pain, making it easier to know if you have a nail fungus as opposed to an ingrown toenail or another condition.You may experience pain while walking or wearing shoes if you have an infected toenail.


Feel for pain directly on your nail or around it. You may want to gently press on your nail to see if you have any pain.
Make sure the pain isn’t a result of too tight shoes, which can cause pain in your toenails.

, Dead or dying tissues build up under your nail(s) or nail separation can cause your nails to give off an odor.Detecting any unusual odor may help you figure out if you have nail fungus and get proper treatment.Smell for a particularly foul odor that may resemble something dead or decaying., If you are exhibiting symptoms of nail fungus and aren’t sure of the cause or self-help measures aren’t working for suspected nail fungus, schedule an appointment with your doctor.Your doctor can examine your toes and possibly run tests to confirm the type of infection you have, which can help her formulate the best treatment for you.Tell your doctor how long you’ve had symptoms and explain any pain and odor you may also have.

These drugs, including terbinafine (Lamisil) and itraconazole (Sporanox) can help a new, infection-free nail grow, replacing the areas with nail fungus.Take this treatment for six to 12 weeks. Be aware that it may take four months or longer to kill the infection.Understand you may have side effects including skin rash and liver damage. Speak to your doctor about other medical conditions before taking oral antifungals., Cutting your nails and thinning them out can help relieve pain and pressure on your nails and nail beds.This can also help any treatment more easily penetrate and heal the infection.Soften nails before trimming or thinning them. You can do this by applying urea cream to the affected nails and covering it with a bandage and then washing off the product in the morning. Use this procedure until the nails soften.Protect the area around your nail with petroleum jelly., Some studies have found that rubbing Vicks VapoRub on nail fungus may help treat it.Apply a thin layer of the product every day to help kill nail fungus.Use a cotton swab to apply the VapoRub to your nail.Put the product on at night and leave it on overnight. Wipe it off in the morning.
Repeat the process until the infection subsides.

, There is some evidence that alternative herbal remedies may help treat nail fungal infections.Two herbal remedies that may kill nail fungus and keep it at bay are:Snakeroot extract, which comes from the sunflower family. Apply every third day for one month, twice a week the following month, and once a week for a third month.
Tea tree oil. Apply twice a day until the fungus disappears., If you notice white or yellow markings or patches on your nails, apply an over-the-counter or prescription nail cream or ointment. For more severe cases, have your doctor prescribe a medicated cream.This may help nip the infection in the bud before it spreads or gets more serious.File off the surface of the nail, soak the affected area in water and dry it before applying the treatment.Follow packaging and doctor’s instructions to most effectively kill the infection.

, Your doctor may suggest applying a medicated polish to your affected nails.This can help kill the infection and prevent fungus from spreading.This must be done consistently for months to have any effect.


Apply ciclopirox (Penlac) to your nails once a day for a week and then remove and repeat the polish.It make take a year of this type of treatment to control the fungus., Severe fungal infections may require more invasive treatments. Speak to your doctor about other procedures such as nail removal or laser therapies to help kill your nail fungus.Your doctor may want to remove your nail if the fungus is particularly severe. In this case, a new nail may grow back within a year.Some studies have shown that laser and light-based therapies can help treat nail fungus, either alone or in conjunction with other medication.Be aware that these therapies may not be covered by insurance and are expensive., You can help prevent the spread or re-infection by nail fungus if you take prophylactic steps to minimize risk of the condition. Adopting the following habits can help minimize your risk for nail fungus:Keep hands and feet clean and nails short and dry
Wear absorbent socks
Wear shoes that promote ventilation
Get rid of old shoes
Apply antifungal spray or powder inside of shoes
Avoid picking skin around the nails
Wear shoes in public spaces
Remove nail polish and artificial nails
Wash your hands and feet after touching an infected nail

Communicate effectively.,
Tell your employees what you think of them.,
Explain to your employees how to reduce stress in the workplace during times of duress.,
Give your employees something to feel good about.,
Empower your employees.,
Start an Employee Volunteer Program.",How to Raise the Morale of Employees2," Research suggests that a lack of communication impacts employee morale more than differences in communication style and frequency. It matters less how you do it, so long as you do. The existence of a superior's effective communication with their employees is the single most influential factor in enhancing job satisfaction and group cohesiveness is superior-subordinate communication.Give clear expectations, by outlining employee roles exactly. Careful consideration should be put into training. Provide your employees with a means to understand where their job begins and ends.
Provide a vision. Let your employees see what you're progressing toward.
Don't feel you need to know everything.

, Be forward. Employees can feel lost without feedback, and that can contribute to low morale. If an employee's job security relies on how you perceive them, it can make him very insecure, contributing to low morale.


Instate a regular performance review process.
Coach/mentor your staff by giving them your help and encouraging them. Be available and supportive. Take time to communicate and check in with each person.
Celebrate accomplishments. Revisit past progress. Let your employees know you appreciate them by saying it., Ensure they take a 15-minute, paid break during the day. They can get some fresh air or chat on their cell phone in the break room to clear their heads. Standard diffusion of anger techniques can also work, such as walking away and counting to 10, before responding to a co-worker who is aggravating them. Learning how to deal with these situations can lower individual stress and raise morale in the workplace.

, This can boost performance and increase output. By celebrating attainable goals, or by participating in an office fundraiser for a local charity, you offer employees an intangible benefit: a good feeling. This is called intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation uses the natural good feeling that comes with certain activities as a motivational tool.

, Many companies ask that their employees get a manager if there is a problem with a customer. By allowing employees to make some decisions, like price adjustments within reason, you empower them and give them a sense of independence. This can, in turn, improve loyalty.

, “EVPs” are planned, managed efforts that receive funding and personnel from a business to motivate and enable employees to volunteer in their community. By contributing to employee satisfaction, volunteer opportunities have been shown to increase morale, improve employee recruitment and retention rates, enhance productivity, and ultimately positively impact profits.

Fund education.,
Give raises.",How to Raise the Morale of Employees3," Offering a better retirement plan or health insurance can give them an extra incentive to work hard and keep their jobs. Giving dedicated individuals a way to earn extra vacation time can also boost employee morale.

, It doesn't have to be all the time. Utility costs can be cut down by having employees work from home. There is no commute, and you cut down on office social distractions.

, Annual bonuses and bonuses based on goals can really give your team a morale boost. Bonuses aren't as much of a commitment as raises, given that they are one-time payments. This can feel like a raise, but it has only a temporary effect. Beware providing regular bonuses and then eliminating them. Employees may feel a morale boost leading up to getting a bonus, not just after. It can be very deflating to lose a bonus one was expecting. Also, research indicates that only substantial bonuses have any positive impact on employee behavior., If there are none, offer them. Your employees will be healthy, increasing their morale. They will feel that their position has more worth. It can contribute to a feeling of security, especially when spouses and children are covered. It has been shown, for both the public and private sector, that employee satisfaction and productivity can be enhanced by providing health care benefits., This may seem like an excuse to slack off, but it reality it can result in productivity, as vacation improves health and focus.It can also save money, as for some companies the average worker has an accumulated $2-4,000 in unused vacation.It also fosters loyalty, as the perk is difficult to give up. Abuse is controlled by the employee's desire to keep their job and to appear diligent.


Gohealthinsurance.com implemented this policy, and in the same year reported a 200% in growth.
Virgin Group, Netflix, BestBuy, Prezi, and Evernote all have implemented limitless vacation policies for employees.

, By giving employees the opportunity to better themselves through your company, you can improve morale. When an employee feels like he is not going anywhere, it is very demoralizing. In funding, even in part, education, you will get smarter, happier employees.

, This is the quickest way to increase morale. Consider setting scheduled, bi-annual raises, based on performance. Review employee records to see who may be overdue for a raise.

Change the environment.,
Break up the monotony.,
Set up games or contests for the employees.,
Have a company outing or vacation.",How to Raise the Morale of Employees4," Companies, like Google, famously employ a fun, open, relaxed work space. Add a pool table. Build a bar for coffee or drinks. Take out that florescent lighting. Bring in a living wall. I has been found that the quality of the working environment outweighs professional experience as a predictor of the quality of client care and employee morale. Additionally, those in management positions are more likely to rate the environment positively than employees working under them., Reward your employees for a job well done. Pizza lunches, casual Fridays and half days may increase motivation if you offer these perks occasionally. Make some of these things regular, and make some of them a surprise. This way you can avoid the rewards becoming monotonous, too.

, If part of their job duties includes sales, this can include sales goals. Having something to work toward can increase motivation, up-selling and profit potential. Give out a small prize or publicly recognize the winner for their accomplishment, however small. It's a win-win situation for the employees and the company.

, Don't make it mandatory, make it desirable. You won't know what your employees find worthwhile if you force them to do everything. Gauge your outing's success, not your employees' success, by the level of interest.


Go camping.
Have a bar crawl.
Go skydiving.

Groom yourself.,
Soap it up.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Package the package properly.",How to Keep Your Private Parts Clean1," The 70s are over, and untrimmed pubic bushes are either a sign that you are stuck in the past, or just don't care. Either way, it's not a real plus for your partner, so trim it up. Do this before you shower, so that all the trimmings are washed away.


If you have hair clippers, set it to a depth that suits you—1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) suits a lot of people. Trim carefully all the way around and under for a clean look.
No clippers? Use a pair of sharp scissors, and snip away evenly to a length that suits you.
Some people have taken to shaving the hair down there. If you and your partner favor this look, go for it!

Soak in a bathtub for a bit to soften the hair up. It'll make it a lot easier to shave.
Trim with scissors before lathering up the shaving cream and pointing sharp objects at your privates.
Be careful. It's easy enough to nick yourself when shaving your face, and shaving is something you do every day!
Note that when you shave, within a couple days it could get really itchy. If you're scheduled to give a big presentation to the board then, you might want to think twice, and save the shave till after the meeting. Alternately, use an unscented moisturizing lotion to minimize the itch.

;
, When you shower, or bathe, don't go light on the soap when you wash your crotch.


If you're circumcised, taking care of your penis is pretty straightforward. Soap it up, rinse it off.
If you're uncut, clean under the foreskin. Neglecting this will cause a buildup of a whitish substance with the oddly unpleasant name of smegma. It's harmless, but not something you want sticking around.
Scrub (somewhat gently) from tip to tail, and all the parts in between.

, Who needs soapy buildup, or a soapy smell? For a lot of people, it can be just as unpleasant to smell perfumed soap as eau de nether.


Some people enjoy a natural (i.e., clean but not overly fragrant) smell from their partner. When in doubt, it's a good idea to favor neutral over perfumed.

, Wear a fresh pair of underwear daily.


Keep your clean, unused undergarments in a cool, dry place. Whether you prefer boxers or briefs, make sure you dry them as soon as you wash them. Otherwise, you risk your clothes smelling worse than you (did).

, Staying active is another important way to stay busy during retirement. A physical activity like tennis, golfing, swimming, or jogging, done once a week, can keep you healthy and grounded.

Or choose a destination on the map close to your home and look for a scenic route or a route with natural wonders or man made oddities (the world’s largest paper clip?) along the way.Going on a road trip will introduce you to new sights and people, and fill your time with new experiences. Having access to an RV will allow you to take longer trips, to farther destinations, in comfort.

, Maybe you have relative you’ve been meaning to visit across the pond or in another country. Or perhaps you have always wanted to see Michelangelo's sculptures in Florence, or the pyramids in Egypt.

Shower daily.,
Wear natural fibers.,
Be wary of certain foods that can make your sweat smell worse.Foods with strong scents, such as garlic, onions, and spices like curry can contribute to body odor.,
Apply a deodorant after showering to control underarm odor.Deodorants typically work by masking body odor with various scents.,
Use an antiperspirant to control sweat and odor.,
Try baking soda.,
Follow a recipe to make your own deodorant.,
Shave regularly.,
Try a depilatory cream.,
Wax if you want a more long-term solution.,
Consider electrolysis if you want a permanent prevention of hair growth.,
Lighten underarms using simple remedies.,
Change your deodorant if your underarms are irritated or bothersome.,
Consult a doctor if you have unusual or persistent symptoms.",How to Keep Your Underarms Fresh and Clean," The skin is your body’s largest organ, and washing it frequently will help protect you and your underarms against harmful bacteria, odor, and illness. Use warm water and a mild soap.;
, Fabrics made of natural fibers (cotton, wool, silk, etc.) rather than synthetic ones (nylon, polyester, etc.) allow your skin to “breathe” easier.This means sweat will evaporate quicker, keeping moisture, bacteria, and odor under control. Make sure to wear clean clothing and wash your clothing frequently.

, Other products like coffee and tobacco may also be contributing factors. Limiting how much of these you eat or use will ultimately keep your underarms feeling and smelling fresh.


If you want to determine if a particular food is causing offensive body odor, eliminate it from your diet and see if the problem goes away. If it does not, try eliminating other foods one by one until you determine which one has the effect.
Chewing on leafy greens like parsley, or taking wheat grass supplements with meals may also reduce the problem, as these foods are natural deodorizers.

, One with baking soda as an ingredient will also help to neutralize odor.

, Antiperspirants work by blocking sweat glands. The lack of moisture from sweat will deter bacterial growth and resultant odor. This means that a antiperspirant will also control odor, while a deodorant alone may only mask it.Most antiperspirants contain aluminum compounds. When you apply the deodorant, these compounds block your sweat glands, preventing perspiration. Some research, however, suggests that there may be a link between aluminum and issues like breast cancer and Alzheimer’s.Other research draws more mixed conclusions.If you are concerned, talk with your doctor.

, If you are looking for a more natural or additional preventive, try baking soda as a deodorant. Baking soda will neutralize odors, not simply cover them up. Take approximately an eighth of a teaspoon of baking soda in your hand, then add a few drops of water to make a paste. Once the baking soda is dissolved, simply apply lightly to your underarms., If you want to avoid any harsh chemicals in manufactured deodorants, there are numerous recipes available for making your own using natural ingredients, most of which are easily available.


Try this easy recipe. Mix one part baking soda to one part cornstarch. Then add four parts coconut oil to each part of this baking soda/cornstarch mixture. If you want an additional scent, add a few drops of an essential oil, like tea tree, lavender, or violet. Store in a glass jar and apply as a deodorant., This helps underarms dry more quickly, keeping odor down.Many also believe it improves appearance. You can choose an electric razor, a non-electric razor with disposable blades, or a disposable razor.


Begin by washing. Shave after showering and drying your underarms. The warmth will open the pores of your skin, making it somewhat easier to remove hair.
Apply shaving cream, if desired. Many people prefer to use a shaving cream to make the shaving process easier and to reduce irritation. Follow the directions your cream supplies, but generally speaking you will only need to apply a thin, even coat.
Unscented cream is best, because it lessens chances of irritation and allergic reaction. Carefully use the razor to remove hair from your underarms. Go slowly and carefully, as your underarms are curved and difficult to shave. You do not want to cut or nick your skin in the process. Shaving in the direction that the hair grows will reduce the chance of razor burn and ingrown hairs.
Use a mild astringent afterwards. Apply a mild astringent, such as witch hazel, after shaving to reduce irritation.
Exactly how often you will want to shave depends on how fast your hair grows, your personal preference, and other factors.
Replace your razors regularly. It's time to get a new one when you see an accumulation of waste in the razor. This waste can introduce bacteria to your pores and cause an infection., Depilatory or hair-removal creams keep hair away for several days to weeks. They work by dissolving hair from off of the skin so that it can be rinsed away easily.


Many people find such creams to be harsh and to have offensive odors. The strong chemicals used in these creams are potentially caustic to the skin and can cause irritation.Carefully follow all directions provided with the cream. Due to the harshness of the chemicals, it is safer to leave the cream on for less than the lowest recommended time.Always test a depilatory cream before a full use. Apply to only a very small portion of your skin, then wait 24 hours. If you do not have any allergic reactions like redness, swelling, or itching, then it is likely safe for use on your skin., Waxing is somewhat painful, and can leave skin irritated for a time. However, it will keep hair away longer than shaving will.Hair should be neither too short nor to long for optimum waxing—about ¼ of an inch is a good estimate. Trim the hair before waxing if it is longer than that. Clean, exfoliate, and dry your underarms before waxing.
Using a quality cosmetic wax, apply a strip or thin layer in the opposite direction that your hair grows in. Remove according to the product directions.
Use a cooling moisturizer, aloe, or ice afterwards to ease the pain and irritation.
Waxing requires skill and can be painful and even dangerous, so you may want to have a professional take care of this. Be sure to go to a reputable and clean salon, In the process of electrolysis, a thin needle is inserted in the skin near the hair follicles. A low-level electrical charge destroys the hair follicle so that the hair does not grow back.The process is slow and expensive, but results in permanent hair removal., Darkening of underarm skin can have a number of causes, including dead skin accumulation or a reaction to a deodorant. If you find this darkening disagreeable, you may want to lighten the skin. There are commercial skin lightening creams, but these are not well-regulated and may contain harsh chemicals.Luckily, there are natural ways of lightening the skin. Some of the simplest and most effective include:


Try using honey as a simple and safe remedy that may help lighten skin. Apply raw honey over your armpits and leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes. Then, rinse it away. You can also combine a ½ tablespoon of honey with a tablespoon of yogurt or ½ teaspoon of lemon juice to intensify the effects.Often, dead skin cells cause underarm skin to darken, so regular exfoliation can also help. Exfoliants can dry out and irritate the skin, so choose a mild one.

, You may have an allergic reaction to a component of a deodorant if you notice persistent itching, redness, swelling, etc. on your underarms. Research has shown that a deodorant containing glycerol and sunflower seed oil can reduce irritation after shaving. If your deodorant does not seem to reduce underarm perspiration or odor, or if you have a reaction to it, talk to a medical professional about stronger or alternative products., Sweating, hair growth, odor, and darkening of the skin are all minor issues that normally arise related to underarms. These can be safely taken care of using the steps above. However, if things are out of the ordinary, it could be a sign of something more serious that needs professional attention.


If sweat smells fruity, it could be a sign of diabetes, while liver or kidney disease can cause sweat to smell like bleach.Consult a doctor if you notice an unusual smell or a marked change in smell.
Darkening of the skin of the underarms can happen to anyone, but is found more often in people with insulin problems, pituitary problems, certain infections, and a range of other issues. Contact a physician if you are concerned or if the darkening arises with symptoms of another problem.

Teach skills.,
Provide for all.,
Go on excursions.,
Cater food.,
Accommodate the lonely.",How to Start a Senior Citizen's Group," You can’t complete this gigantic endeavour on your own, you need more hands to lighten the load. Get to searching for volunteers who are interested in giving back to their community. You could pin-up notices at hot spot areas like cafés, restaurants or supermarkets advertising this new opportunity. This doesn't necessarily mean they have to be over twenty they could be as young as fourteen. Anyone who can help should be welcomed. .;
, The most important place is to find a place for you all to meet. The atmosphere should be welcoming, comfortable and relaxed. You could hire and deck out a building or you could do it in your own home. It’s best to find a place that has all necessary amenities like bathrooms, a kitchen and enough car parking space.

, It’s important to keep them all entertained, that’s the whole premise as to why you wanted to make this group in the first place. The Elderly are known to be easily impressed and easily entertained. Old fashioned board games or a deck of cards a great place to start. The more experience with them, the more aware you will be with what activities they enjoy and want to do.

, If the women like knitting, create a project for them all to make their grandsons or granddaughters a jumper for winter, whoever’s is nominated the best one wins a prize. Don’t forget the gentlemen as well, you could create a project for them all to bring in something that reminds them of positive events of the past and share it with the group.

, It’s always good sharing around information and allowing skill workshops can help with that. If some people know how to cook really well, one week they could all try cooking the certain dish someone comes up with. Other workshop ideas could be; How to knit, How to play chess, How to clean.

, Everyone is different and it’s important to provide for everybody. It’s important to provide activities for those who aren't as social as all of them, perhaps they just don’t want to be home alone all day and want to hear and see people. You could provide a book shelf with books from your home you don’t read any more and let them read. The bookshelf could also be a place for the group to leave books they don’t need any more for the rest to have a peek at.

, After the group is well established, you can take the team down to the local golfing range or park for a BBQ lunch. It’s a great way to get out and even build on numbers by taking them on outings to their favourite places to visit.

, You can’t go all day without food so it’s important to provide enough food for the group, whether you provide snacks, drinks, breakfast, lunch and supper is up to you. Don’t forget to supply both generic and healthy options because some senior citizens have chronic health issues and often times they must abide by strict eating routines. These people still need to eat, and you can take the strain of providing for themselves off their back. Ask each person upon initiation if they have any diet requirements or preferences to get a demography of how to provide for the group.

, If there are individuals who are immensely lonely in the four walls of their home, you could provide a unique service by letting them stay the night at a low cost. Sometimes people, especially the aged, feel miserable by themselves day after day. By providing a place for them to commune with yourself and others for a night, let’s them return to their lives with a fresh and open mind about things like purpose and happiness. You’ll need to provide beds, closets, bedside tables, radios and anything else you can think of that would make the short lived getaway relaxing.

The person stands on a machine with a vibrating platform, using a railing for support. The intensity of the vibration can be adjusted; beginners should start with a low intensity vibration and work up to higher intensities.You should not use vibration therapy if you are prone to blood clots, have a pacemaker, are pregnant, or have inner ear problems.

If it's too high, contact a plumber to have a new toilet installed.A low toilet can be hard on a senior's knees.A high one may create a falling hazard.
It's also a good idea to add a grab bar on both sides of the toilet to further increase safety and accessibility., Not surprisingly, the shower is a very common place for a fall. Install a grab bar in the shower in case someone starts to slip.Using a shower seat is also safer than standing in a slick tub.Installing a shower mat or or non-slip decals to the bottom of the tub is also a good idea.Install a hand-held shower head to make it easier to shower, especially when seated.
If possible, install a shower with a step-free entry.This reduces the risk of tripping while getting in and out. If that isn't possible, and you have a high-sided bath tub, consider a transfer bench for easier and safer use of the tub., Place bright tape or decals on clear glass shower doors, as it is not easy for those with poor eyesight to see that there is a door at all, or to determine if it is open or closed.

, Place no-slip mats around the shower and sink, or install a floor that makes slipping less likely.


Wood, vinyl, or tile floors with a lot of grout are ideal to prevent slipping., Label the hot water faucet or paint it red to prevent accidental scalding.


You may also wish to consider lowering the water temperature by a few degrees to make scalding even less likely.About 120 degrees Fahrenheit is recommended., Install a door knob that can be unlocked from the outside.

Replace rugs if the edges begin to curl, as this creates a tripping hazard.Non-skid wax can be used on waxed floors such as hardwoods., Make sure all area of the house, especially walking areas are clear of clutter that could cause tripping or other accidents.Secure electric cords and other wires to the wall so no one trips on them.
Frequently clean up toys, newspapers, and other items that have been left on the floor.
Make sure seniors can easily get around by leaving plenty of space between furniture items.If necessary, eliminate excess furniture, especially any items that are too large for the space.

, Make sure all seating is sturdy, eliminating any wobbly chairs or other unstable furniture.It's also a good idea to make sure that at last some of the seating is at a level that make it easy to sit down and stand up--not to high and not too low., Cover sharp corners on tables or countertops to avoid serious injury in the event of a fall.You can do this with tape and foam, as depicted here, or buy commercially available corer covers, which are more durable and attractive.

, Make sure all areas of the house are adequately lit. Make sure lamps are within easy reach of seating, the bed, and so on.Install non-glare, 100 watt (or higher) light bulbs, and promptly replace any bulbs that burn out.Adequate lighting is important everywhere, but it is especially important on stairwaysand anywhere that sharp tools might be used, such as the kitchen.If necessary, install additional lighting in these areas.
Nightlights can also be a good idea in areas that a senior may need to use during the night, such as the bathroom and the hallways., Ensure the smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are in good working order. Check that they have fresh batteries. Make sure that they are throughout the house — one on each floor and one in each bedroom at minimum.


Ideally, it's best if these are hard-wired. Even then, it's important to check the batteries regularly in case of a power outage., If the person lives alone, it might be a good idea to buy a medical alert system in case the person falls or is injured and can't get to a phone. These systems provide wearable devices (such as a necklace or a watch) that the person can press to place a call for help. There are many types of medical alert systems, so choose the one that makes the most sense for your situation.If you don't want to invest in a medical alert system, try a buddy system, in which one or a few people check in on the elderly person daily to ensure they are okay.

Break up your sedentary time by running errands, gardening, or doing housework.,
Engage in physical activities you enjoy.,
Get someone to exercise with you.,
Look for ways to make your daily routine more active.",How to Remain Active As You Get Older1," These activities won’t count toward your 150 minutes, but they will help your body stay awake and lively. Any time you spent not sitting still is time well spent for your body. Avoid spending long stationary periods reading or watching television.If you want to spend lots of time reading, listening to music, or watching TV, consider using a treadmill or stationary bike with a book stand. You can read while you exercise, or you can keep the machine in your TV room and exercise while you watch.;
, The best way to ensure that you keep up your exercise is to do activities that are fun for you. Make your exercise regimen into a hobby, or find a way to make your hobbies part of your exercise regimen.Golfing, tennis, or pickle are good examples of activities that older adults can do and that they may enjoy.

, Instead of sitting and chatting, for example, you and your buddy can chat on a walk. If you’re nervous about signing up a for a yoga, Tai Chi, or water aerobics class, find a friend to sign up with you. Or introduce yourself to new people in your class. Exercise is a lot more fun with your spouse or a friend.


There are programs at fitness facilities called “Silver Sneakers” these programs help adults get more active and involved both physically and socially.
If you have grandchildren, playing with them is another great option. They’ll enjoy it and it will strengthen your bond together.
Dogs are wonderful exercise buddies as well. They love to be active outside. Try throwing a ball or Frisbee for your dog or taking it for extra or longer walks. If you don’t have a dog, ask to borrow a friend’s dog. You might even think about adopting a dog—lots of older dogs need loving homes and aren’t as high-energy as younger dogs., You don’t have to go out of your way to be more active. There are lots of ways to add activity to your daily life without changing too much. Lots of little moments of motion and exercise can add up to big improvements.


When you’re out, try parking a little further away than usual, to increase your walk. Get off the bus or train a stop or two before your usual stop. Choose the stairs over an elevator or escalator. If you live within walking distance of your destination, walk instead of driving.
Move around while you wait. Do neck rolls or practice balancing on one foot while you wait in line. Practice knee bends while you wait for water to boil. Do some toe-touches while your bread is in the toaster.Studies have shown that no segment of the population can benefit more from physical exercise than the elderly."

Talk to your doctor to make sure you’re healthy enough for vigorous exercise.,
Start slow and gradually build up your exercise regimen.,
Keep yourself motivated.,
Don’t ignore problems.",How to Remain Active As You Get Older2," This is especially important if you have a chronic illness or a history of heart disease. Most people can handle some amount of exercise, but some people need to keep it milder than others, at least at first. Ask your doctor what level of physical movement is best for you and what the best way to get active might be.The most important thing is to make sure you avoid being sedentary where you can.With your doctor, make a plan to accommodate your lifestyle change. For example, if you’re diabetic, you may need to alter your calorie intake or meal times.

, If you haven’t exercised in a long time, don’t try to do too much right away. Start off with just ten minutes of aerobic exercise at a time. You can space these out into different times of the day if you feel comfortable doing so. Gradually work your way up to 30 minutes a day.Make sure to warm up before your aerobic exercise by gently stretching your muscles.
Stay hydrated as you work out.
Cool down after you’ve finished your workout. You can do this by continuing to move at a lower rate for a couple minutes after you’re done exercising. You should also gently stretch your muscles again.
Your goal should be to exercise for at least 150 every week, preferably doing some level of moderate physical activity every day for at least ten minutes.Another option is to do de-weighted training, especially if you are obese. This involves seeing a physical therapist and doing exercises inside the pool. This is different than water aerobics. Some therapy facilities also offer classes for people with arthritis and musculoskeletal problems.

, It’s natural to dislike or even dread exercise at first if you’re not used to it. The key is to keep at it, even if you don’t like it right away. The more you do it, the more you’ll look forward to it and enjoy it. In the meantime, work at thinking positively about your new regimen.


Focus on short-term goals like stress reduction and mood improvement. You will see these results much faster than you’ll see long-term results like weight loss and muscle strength. Focusing on the short term will help you to see the immediate improvement that regular exercise can cause in your day-to-day life.As you exercise, pay close attention to how your body is moving and feeling. Pay attention to your breathing and heart rate and try to focus on the moment, rather than how long you have left until it’s over. This will help you to keep track of improvements and problems. It will also reduce stress and make the time go by faster., Exercising may be difficult, but it should never hurt. If you feel sharp pains or experience shortness of breath, dizziness, or chest pains while exercising, stop right away and talk to your doctor.You should also stop if a joint swells or changes color or hurts when you touch it."

Choose aerobic activities you enjoy.,
Engage in strength training activities.,
Work on your flexibility.,
Improve your balance.,
Take a break if you need to.",How to Remain Active As You Get Older3," Aerobic activities elevate your heart rate and are key to getting the most out of your exercise routine. They help you to better regulate your breathing and feel more awake as well as improving your endurance in day-to-day life and activities.Aerobic activities include swimming, jogging, riding a bike, dancing, and tennis.
You should try to do 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week, preferably in 30 minute blocks most days of the week.
Aerobic activity can help to decrease your risk of heart disease and obesity, as well as lowering your chances of developing type 2 diabetes. If you already have diabetes, aerobic exercise can help keep your glucose levels under control. Moderate aerobic exercise also promotes bone strength and can reduce joint problems like arthritis.Try to do two to three days of resistance training each week. This may involve using Nautilus machines or doing some isometric exercises against a wall or chair.

, Strength training builds up your muscles and bone mass through repetitive motion using weights or resistance. They can help you keep your balance better and avoid falls and help you maintain your ability to do simple, everyday activities like sitting, standing, and lifting things.You can strength train with exercise bands or small weights. Cans of food work in place of weights. You can also engage more in everyday activities like carrying moderately heavy loads around the house or grocery store.As you become more comfortable with weight-lifting, build the amount of weight you lift or the number of reps (times you lift the weight). This will increase your strength over time and improve the benefits of your strength training.You should do your strength training in addition to your 150 weekly minutes of aerobic exercise.Don’t replace aerobic activity with strength training, because they help your body in different ways.

, Improving flexibility helps you to be able to use your joints and muscles more fully and with less pain or risk of injury. This is useful for day-to-day activities like playing with grandchildren and tying shoes.


Yoga is an excellent way to improve your flexibility. Sign up for a yoga class aimed at seniors or, if there aren’t any in your area, find yoga videos for seniors online and follow along carefully.Do this in addition to your other exercise, not in replacement of any of it.
Do some gentle stretches in the morning when you first get up. This will help wake your body up and prepare it for the day as well as helping to increase your overall flexibility.

, This is one of the best and easiest ways to keep your body in good working order.Working on your balance will help you to maintain your ability to sit and stand with ease, in addition to helping you avoid falls.Work on your balance at least three times a week. You can do this by sitting and standing without using any support and by practicing standing on one foot.Yoga and Tai Chi are also good ways to improve your balance.Sign up for a class for seniors or follow along with a video online.

, If you hurt yourself or start to feel achy, it’s okay to take a day or two off. Don’t keep exercising on a swollen joint or injured limb. If you’re not sure whether or how to continue, talk to your doctor.\


If you don’t have time to do your full workout, try to at least do something. Even ten minutes of exercise a day is better than nothing. And don’t give up if you’ve gone a couple of days without exercising. Your body will forgive you!"

Stimulate your brain.,
Exercise regularly.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Don’t stress.,
Maintain your relationships, and build new ones.",How to Remain Active As You Get Older4," Any mentally engaging activity you engage in helps keep the neurons in your brain firing. Take a class or read a book about something you don’t know much about. Do puzzles, crosswords, or Sudoku. Play games that get your brain working, like Trivial Pursuit or Scattergories.If you like to play games on a phone or tablet, there are many applications that can be fun and enjoyable.

, Regular, vigorous exercise keeps your cardiovascular system healthy, which keeps the blood flowing properly to your brain. Regular exercise has been shown to keep Alzheimer’s at bay.It also helps keep your brain working at a steady level.Plus, it’s good for you!

, Feed your brain omega-3 fatty acids with fish and nuts. Eating antioxidant-rich foods like fruits and vegetables, especially leafy-green vegetables, also keeps your brain nourished.Omega-3 fatty acids are great for brain health and development. They have also been implicated in reducing inflammation and pain.
Add whole grains into your diet by eating whole wheat bread instead of white and brown rice instead of white rice.
Dark, leafy greens like kale, spinach, and collard greens are high in fiber and iron-rich. Eat them as a side dish or extra ingredient with your meal.
Instead of cookies or chips, try eating a handful of nuts for a snack. They’ll stave off hunger longer and are better for you.

, Stress can cause memory problems and make you feel crummy, which isn’t good for your ability to focus. Try activities like exercise, meditation, or deep breathing to reduce your stress levels.Try meditating for ten minutes every morning. Sit up as straight as you can in a comfortable chair and relax your body. Close your eyes and clear your mind. Count your breaths: one in the inhale, two on the exhale, three on the next inhale, and so on to ten. Then repeat until your time is up.Do some deep breathing when you get frustrated or overwhelmed. Breathe in deeply through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth. This will help you (and your body) to calm down.Mild exercise like a brisk walk or even some mild stretching can help shift your focus to your body and release endorphins, a type of mood-lifting hormone., Studies show that people who are socially engaged experience less mental decline. This is because being around other people stimulates your brain and provides social support, reducing stress.Visit with friends and family as regularly as possible.
Try volunteering. You’ll meet other volunteers and maybe interact with the people you help. Most communities have lots of volunteer opportunities—look for something that relates to a hobby or skill you already have or something you’d like to learn more about.
Senior centers are great places to make friends and participate in group activities like dance nights and bridge games.
Join a club. There are all kinds of clubs in most communities—book clubs, garden clubs, puzzle groups. Look for one that relates to something you love to do.
Take a class. Learn that language you’ve always wanted to speak or improve on your knitting. The class can be something you’ve never tried before or something you want to get better at; the key is to interact with other people with similar interests. "

Make arrangements for medication.Bring adequate supplies of any medications your aging parents might need.,
Pack travel essentials.It’s a good idea to bring along certain things that could make the trip smoother.,
Get travel insurance.Older people are at greater risk of sickness and injury.,
Make accommodations for wheelchair-bound parents.,
Break up your flight.Sleeping and being comfortable on airplanes can be hard, especially for aging parents.,
Book aisle seats.Since aging parents, especially, should try to move around often, try to book aisle seats so they can get up and down more easily.",How to Plan a Trip With Aging Parents1," Keep medications in their original bottles whenever possible. Place each bottle or container in a clear plastic bag labeled with its name, dosage size and frequency, and administration instructions. Medications without this information might not be allowed through airport security checkpoints.


Your parents should have prescriptions and medication descriptions translated into an appropriate language if traveling abroad. For instance, if traveling to Brazil, the prescription info should be in Portuguese. In the event of a medical emergency, this information could save their life.
Take your parents’ doctors’ numbers, too, just in case you need to get hold of them.
If traveling by plane make sure that you carry on your prescriptions and do not pack them in baggage that you are checking in. This way, if your luggage is lost you will still have your medication.;
, Painkillers like aspirin are a good idea to have on hand, as are small snack bars for occasions when you’re off on a tour without something to eat.


Ensure aspirin and other over-the-counter medicine will not interfere with your parents’ prescriptions.
If your parents have specific foods that they can’t live without, or need to be on a soft-food diet for medical reasons, be sure to pack them.Bring anti-diarrhea medicine if you think it might be necessary, especially if you're traveling to a foreign country where you are not used to the water.

, Therefore, it’s always a good idea to plan against something bad happening by getting travel insurance. Encourage your parents to contact their regular health or life insurance companies about taking out a policy that covers them while traveling.


Some travel insurance companies don’t offer policies on individuals beyond a certain age. Be sure to check a particular policy for restrictions according to age
Other companies don’t offer policies to people with certain pre-existing conditions. Again, check the fine print on any policy and have your parents ask specific questions relating to their health to ensure they get the most comprehensive travel insurance coverage.

, If your aging parents use wheelchairs, you have several options. You could contact the airline about carrying a wheelchair onto the flight with you.This might be your best option if you want to bring an electric wheelchair or a wheelchair that has functions that others might not.


Alternatively, you can often rent a travel power wheelchair, which makes traveling easy. These wheelchairs can be disassembled in one place and reassembled in another.
Finally, you could arrange a wheelchair rental at your destination with the help of a travel agent. Hotels often loan wheelchairs to guests.
Be sure to factor the added time wheelchairs may add to your itinerary when deciding how long you’ll need to connect to flights, catch trains or buses, and make other travel arrangements.
Traveling in a wheelchair will probably, for instance, extend the time it takes to clear security checkpoints in airports. Plan on pre-boarding.
Carrying your own wheelchair onto an airplane is often free.
Airports also have agents whose job is to aid people with disabilities and help them get around the airport. They can also help you get through the TSA checkpoint, perhaps faster. Check with your airline to see if you can have a wheelchair or golf cart ready for your parent when you get off the airplane. This can make it easier to get your baggage or to get to a connecting flight.

, Avoid long direct flights so that your parents can decompress and avoid achy, cramped joints and muscles.


If you do get stuck on a long flight, encourage your aging parents to get up and walk around frequently. Moving once every 30 minutes or so keeps the blood circulating and prevents stiffness and pain later.
Be careful doing this with people that have Dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease. It may be better to have a direct flight. People with these conditions get confused easily and there are potential dangers if they do not fly directly.

, Try to be specific when booking aisle seats. If your parent suffers from cramping in his or her right leg and needs to stretch it often, choose a seat with an aisle on the right so they can stretch it comfortably without getting up.


If no aisle seats are available, try to book another flight where they are available, or talk to a customer service rep with the airline of your choice and explain your situation to see if there are alternatives that you hadn’t considered.

Plan on stopping frequently.If you’re traveling by car, you should plan to stop at least once every two hours.,
Check the condition of your car before you hit the road.Ensure the tank is full and the headlights, tail lights, and signal lights are operational.,
Pack emergency supplies.Even if you get a tune-up and everything looks fine, there’s always the chance that you car breaks down.,
Get to your destination early.Most aging parents tend to wake up early and go to bed early.,
Bring creature comforts.A long road trip can be made more enjoyable if you and your parents are comfortable.,
Schedule slow-moving tours.Most tour agencies are catered to travelers with limited time who want to see everything they can as quickly as possible.,
Book your hotels carefully.,
Be careful of steps.Depending on your parents’ health, they might not be able to accommodate going up steps.",How to Plan a Trip With Aging Parents2," This will give your aging parents time to stretch, use the bathroom, eat, and get something to drink as needed.


Getting out of the car also helps prevent deep-vein thrombosis (blood clots that can cause swelling) in the legs. This is also a problem on planes. You may want to encourage your parent to get up and stand or walk around a bit while on the bus or plane.
If you’re traveling by bus, you’ll have no control over how often you stop, but most buses stop every two hours or so. Encourage your aging parents to get off the bus and stretch when the bus stops.

, Test the brakes, heat, and air conditioning. Take the car to a mechanic for a tune-up, and explain to him or her that you’re going on a trip and want the vehicle in shipshape. Nothing will make the trip more unpleasant -- or, depending on the weather, dangerous -- than a car that breaks down.

, Pack jumper cables, a tire iron, and a spare tire in case the worst happens.


Other things that might come in handy include a GPS, an ice scraper, a quart of two of motor oil, and a spare gallon of gasoline.

, Therefore, try to plan your trip in such a way that accommodates their natural rhythms. Book passage on a bus or train that leaves early, or plan on getting in the car early in the morning. This will give you time to unpack, eat, and relax at the end of the day.

, Bring pillows and blankets, especially if traveling during cold months. Bring a portable DVD player or tablet to watch movies. Books are also a good way to pass the time on a long trip.

, However, there are tour agencies that offer “gentle” tours. Talk to your travel agent about the availability of tours specifically aimed at older folks, or tours that move at a more relaxed pace.


Cruises make excellent, slow-moving trips for elderly people.Cruise ships offer many comforts and amenities on board, and allow passengers to explore the various ports of call at their own pace for a limited amount of time. Talk to your parents about going on a cruise together.

, Call ahead and ensure that the hotel has an elevator and/or wheelchair ramps. You might also need to consider booking hotel rooms with disabled access or safety-equipped bathroom facilities.


It is important to give both your parents and yourself a comfortable amount of privacy when traveling. Book separate rooms for you and your parents., While it is often difficult to know exactly where you’ll encounter steps in a historic city or tourist attraction, try to anticipate which places will be off-limits. Mom and dad will probably want to pass on, say, tours of lighthouses and castles.


Look for workarounds for areas that seem impassable due to the presence of stairs. Going around the block or looking for ramps could help.
If steps are an issue, opt for subways and taxis rather than trains and buses.

Pick a destination together.Plan a vacation with aging parents that you will all enjoy by letting your parents help choose the destination.,
Plan the itinerary together.,
Stay at least four days in each place.Whether you’re traveling on an extended tour with your aging parents or just heading a few hours away, it’s important to give your parents time to settle in.,
Schedule periodic breaks.Plan for rest stops and breaks throughout the duration of your trip.,
Don’t feel locked in to a particular itinerary.If you schedule two days in Beijing but decide you want to spend an extra day or two there, go for it.",How to Plan a Trip With Aging Parents3," Brainstorm locations you've always wanted to visit, a country that's central to your family's ancestry, or a trip to a special place from your childhood. Picking the destination will help your parents feel involved and allow them to voice any concerns they have over traveling to certain areas or activities.

, The itinerary describes what you want to do when you arrive at your destination. Your trip will be more organized and less stressful if you write out an itinerary about exactly where you’ll go and what you want to see or do.Choose specific sites and think about how long you want to visit each.


Setting an itinerary will keep you all on the same page and make it easier to make arrangements with hotels, airport shuttles, or taxis.
Be sure to schedule free time into the itinerary. This will give both you and your aging parents time to explore or relax independently of each other.Be realistic. Don’t try to plow through a tour of Europe when your parents aren’t up to it. Instead, go relax on a beach somewhere for a week or so.
You may need to exercise diplomacy when setting the itinerary. If your parents are not realistic about their own limitations, try to frame your decision to avoid certain places or limit the extent of the trip in terms that express your own disinterest or dislike of a place or places.
Print a copy of the itinerary for everyone on the trip.That way everyone can refer to it and know where the group is going next.
If you are an elderly adult traveling alone, let your sons or daughters know. If you are planning a trip with your parents, then you may want to have a direct flight so that they do not get confused with a transfer, connecting flight, or bus trip.

, Rapidly unpacking, rushing about to see the sights, and then repacking and jumping on a plane or bus every few nights can be tedious even for the hale and hearty. For aging parents, this exercise can be even more exhausting. Plan on at least four days in each location.

, This will give your older parents, who will likely tire faster than you, a chance to rest, eat, stretch, take medications, and hydrate themselves as needed. A break will also allow you to assess how the trip is going and make sure your parents are having fun.

, However, always think about how adjustments to your itinerary will impact the rest of your trip. You might have less time in Shanghai or another location, and might lose money if you’ve booked hotels in advance.

Be patient.Traveling with aging parents can be slow and difficult.,
Stay positive.Vacations are meant to be relaxing and enjoyable.,
Be helpful but not overbearing.Even when parents get older and need help, they often like to feel that they have some degree of independence.,
Enjoy your time with your parents.",How to Plan a Trip With Aging Parents4," You might be frustrated by your parents’ inability to do what you do. Try to put yourself in their shoes. Recognize that their advanced age means they cannot do what you can.


When you feel yourself becoming frustrated, take in a deep breath through your nose, then blow it out through your mouth slowly over the course of five to eight seconds.
When on vacation, it does neither you nor your parents any good to get frustrated or impatient. Remember, your aging parents are not deliberately moving slowly, and are doing the best they can. Be patient!

, And while it’s always a good idea to be polite, respectful, and kind to your parents, these qualities are even more important when you’re traveling and in close proximity with your parents over the course of several days or weeks.


Try to make inconveniences into something positive. For instance, instead of bemoaning the fact that you have to move through each destination so slowly, enjoy your opportunity to really soak up the flavor of each place your travel to.Be deferential and don’t dredge up unpleasant memories unnecessarily.
Even if you and your parents don’t always see eye to eye, do your best to keep things civil while traveling together.
Think before you speak. Don’t say anything that you might regret, or that might sour the mood of your parents for the rest of the trip. Before saying something potentially upsetting, ask yourself if it might be hurtful or unpleasant.

, Be respectful and don’t insist on helping them with every piece of luggage or every step up into the train or bus. Don’t patronize. Let them ask you for help before intervening.

, As your parents age, you should become more conscious that they won’t be around forever. Take advantage of the time you have with them to make great memories and show them that you really love them.Don’t wait forever to propose a trip with your aging parents. They aren’t getting any younger.

Instead, they may experience more complaints, especially about their health. Physical complaints such as worsening arthritis or continual headaches are often the main symptom of depression in elderly adults.Be on the lookout for increased bodily aches and pains as a trigger for depression.


If you or someone you love experience increased discomfort from physical symptoms, this may indicate emerging depression. Check in with a physician about pain and how to treat it.
You may also notice some less obvious signs of depression, such as losing interest in activities they used to enjoy, not wanting to leave the house, having trouble focusing and completing tasks, having difficulty sleeping, and experiencing extreme fatigue.;
, Older adults may develop chronic conditions that affect their day-to-day functioning and abilities. Chronic conditions can lead to depression and make the symptoms of depression worse. Some chronic conditions that can interact with depression include Parkinson’s disease, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, among others.Having a chronic condition can lead to increased feelings of sadness or loss, which can then trigger symptoms of depression.


If you or a loved one has a chronic condition, take treatment seriously. Take any necessary medications and follow through on any recommended lifestyle changes given to you or your loved one by professionals.
Keep in mind that an invasive surgery may also lead to depression from things like a reaction to the anesthesia, hormonal or chemical changes triggered by the surgery, or surgical traumatic stress syndrome.

, Some older people have more difficulty sleeping well through the night or may have problems falling asleep. Often, older adults may sleep less soundly and wake up more frequently during the night.Problems getting restful sleep can lead to symptoms of depression. If many nights are restless, this can indicate a trigger for depression.


If nights are difficult to sleep through, daytime naps can be restful.

, Nutrition can affect the onset, severity, and duration of depression. Skipping meals, having a minimal or absent appetite, or craving sweets can be indicators that precede depression.Be aware of any changes regarding food habits as potential triggers for depression or as signs of depression.


Make nutrition a priority if you suspect an onset of depression based on changes in appetite or eating.

, Older adults may feel lonely or alone, especially if family is far away or cannot visit frequently. Isolation can bring on symptoms of depression and also worsen them. Older people may experience isolation and depression especially if they outlive their friends and families. If you notice yourself or a loved one isolating from others, recognize that this may be connected to depression.Make an effort to stay in touch with family and friends, even if it’s through emails, phone calls, or video chats.
Find ways to stay socially connected. Attend game nights with other older adults, arrange weekly meetings with family members, or attend spiritual gatherings.

, Older adults may move to assisted care facilities or move in with family members for caretaking. These changes can be difficult to a once-independent adult. If living arrangements change, the older adult may feel like a burden to family or experience a loss of self-worth or dignity. Struggling with these changes can be difficult and lead to feelings of depression.If you or a loved one is struggling with changes to living space and lifestyle, find some support. Talk to your family about needs for independence and how to meet those needs.
Look into counseling services that might be available to your loved one. They may be able to see a counselor on site or at least have visits with a counselor covered under their insurance.

, Loss of independence or mobility can affect how a person feels and what activities they do. If an elderly adult prides themselves on living independently, they may feel helpless or sad when they need to depend on others to fulfill their needs. Changes in work, income, mobility and flexibility can alter their sense of who they are and leave them feeling sad or worthless, increasing the risk of depression.Acknowledge losses and the toll they take on you or a loved one. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help from family, friends, medical providers, and therapists. Asking for help is okay when struggling with the emotional side of these changes.
You may also want to look for accommodations to help keep them active, such as a senior shuttle to take them shopping if they can no longer drive or a local senior center where they can attend events and socialize.

, Older adults may experience a greater degree of loss in this time of life. Many older adults outlive their families and friends, which can make them feel isolated and alone. Or, it can be difficult to keep up with friends and family if you or they are no longer able to travel and visit one another.Watching loved ones pass can increase feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, or helplessness. If you or a loved one is having a tough time dealing with loss, this can trigger depression.


It’s okay to talk about feelings related to loss. If you or a loved one feels uncomfortable talking to friends or family, consider seeing a therapist.

, An older adult may begin to take less care in their personal hygiene and health due to depression. For example, they may shower less frequently, skip meals or not have proper nutrition, or forget to take medications regularly. Taking care of oneself may feel less important, even if it’s affecting health and well-being. These changes in personal care can be a symptom of depression.If you or a loved one is having problems remembering to do things (like meals or laundry), set an alarm or engage in a daily routine to not forget these important tasks.
It is extremely important for your loved one to remember to take their medication, so you might create reminders for them or arrange for someone to visit and help them.
You might also consider having someone to come and help your loved one with their laundry and housekeeping to take this off their plate.

, While any two people may experience depression differently, there are some common indications to look out for if you think you might be depressed. You or a loved one might feel sad or have a consistently low mood, cry more easily, feel irritable, or experience less enjoyment in activities.

Lifestyle changes are often complimentary with medication or therapy and can help with long-term treatment of depression.

You may have to do the majority of the calling, but putting in this effort and staying in touch often can have huge benefits on the senior.
If your elderly loved one has trouble hearing, look into phone options for the hearing impaired, such as amplified speakers. Additionally, phones that feature larger buttons and screens can help those who have vision problems.Headphones can also be quite helpful because your loved one can wear them and turn up the sound as high as they need to.

Additionally, senior cell phones can offer 24/7 access to nurses and doctors, medical alert features, heart monitors, and a speaking keyboard., The internet is a simple way for seniors to stay in touch with their friends and families.

Know that prolonged isolation can lead to depression.,
Recognize that socialization can impact physical and cognitive health.,
Know that isolation jeopardizes the elderly's access to medical care.",How to Provide Social Interaction for Elderly Relatives3," The elderly are particularly prone to experiencing depression as an effect of isolation. These intense feelings of sadness can contribute to health deterioration physically, emotionally, and mentally. This depression often causes many seniors to become suicidal.


Symptoms of depression in the elderly include an increase or decrease in appetite, fatigue or loss of energy, changes in the amount one sleeps, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and the inability to concentrate or make decisions., Spending time with others can not only improve your mood, it can also make you healthier as well. Seniors who have social interaction on a daily basis have a lower chance of developing memory-loss symptoms. Additionally, seeing and talking to others regularly can reduce stress and anxiety levels, which can lead to better physical health.


For instance, a good amount of social activity can reduce a person’s blood pressure, lower the risk of cardiovascular problems, and prevent certain types of arthritis. This likely occurs because social people are typically more likely to stay active and eat a healthy diet.One study also showed that increased social time was linked to improved health, and decreased social time was linked to decreased health and mental decline. Increasing your loved one’s social opportunities and even doing something simple, like finding them a pet, may improve your loved one’s mental and physical health., When a senior doesn’t spend much time around others, they are more likely to have medical conditions that go undiagnosed.


For instance, they may not be aware that their hearing is diminishing if they don’t talk to many people. Additionally, not being able to hear or see well may make them weary of leaving home, which can stop them from regularly going to their doctor."

Depending on your age and the length of your employment, you may be eligible for full benefits, partial benefits, or no benefits at all.The age at which you are eligible to receive social security benefits depends on the year in which you were born. You can choose to receive benefits a few years earlier as well, but you will not receive as much money. For example, if you were born after 1960, you can receive full benefits starting at age 67 and partial benefits starting at age 62.
To estimate your social security benefits, visit the Social Security Administration's website.You may have to talk to the HR representative at your company to get detailed information about your pension plan. As with social security benefits, you may be penalized if you choose to begin receiving a pension before a certain age.;
, If you are a United States citizen and a medical condition causes you to retire, you may be eligible for social security disability benefits. In order to qualify, you must be able to demonstrate that your medical condition has prevented you from working. You also must have enough work credits, which are earned each fiscal quarter that you pay into social security.If you are over the age of 60, you need to have worked at least 10 years to qualify for social security disability benefits.
If you are under 60, there are also additional restrictions that require you to have earned a certain number of work credits within recent years.
If you get approved for social security disability, you will be able to collect social security retirement income at age 62 without a penalty.

, If your health issue is work-related at all, you may be eligible for worker's compensation. In addition to providing benefits for short-term and long-term disability, worker's compensation also covers medical bills that are incurred as a direct result of your work-related disability.Work-related disabilities include acute injuries, illnesses caused by long-term exposure, and aggravations of existing injuries.
You may have to file an appeal if your employer's worker's compensation carrier does not initially approve your claim.
Be aware that if you get worker's compensation, you will typically not be eligible for social security disability.
Each state creates its own laws regarding worker's compensation, which may affect how much you are entitled to.
In most cases, worker's compensation is the only compensation that you can get if you were injured at work. However, in some specific cases, you may be able to sue for more benefits. This option may be available if a third party was involved in your injury, if your employer does not offer worker's compensation, if you were injured by a defective product or toxic substance, or if you were injured as a result of intentional or egregious acts on the part of your employer. Contact a lawyer if you believe any of these circumstances apply to you., Insurance is crucial, especially if you are experiencing health issues. In order to retire comfortably, you will need to understand how you will maintain your insurance in retirement and what the insurance you have will cover.Find out if your employer offers insurance coverage to retirees.
If you are under 65, you will not be eligible for Medicare, so you will have to maintain private insurance or apply for Medicaid.
Be sure to think about your medical needs. If you need a lot of care and there is no one at home to offer you that care, you may need to enter an assisted living facility. If you have long-term care insurance, this may be covered, but it is important to contact the provider to verify your benefits.

, If you find yourself retiring earlier than you had planned, you will need to take a good look at your finances and determine how much you will need to live on each month. If you don't create a monthly budget, you risk running out of money during retirement.Calculate all of your regular monthly expenses, including housing, transportation, utilities, food, and anything else you spend money on.
Don't forget to include variable expenses (things that you don't pay for every month). This may include things like insurance or water bills, which you only pay a few times a year.
It's also important to set some money aside for unexpected expenses, like car repairs and medical bills. It can be difficult to plan for these expenses, as you never know exactly how much they will cost, but do your best to create a healthy emergency fund.


, Once you have determined how much money you need to live on each month, take a look at your retirement savings portfolio and determine whether it is large enough to cover these expenses for the duration of your retirement. If it is not, you will need to look for ways to earn more money or spend less money in order to sustain yourself through retirement.Don't forget to include any benefits you may get from social security or a pension.
To avoid depleting your assets, you should aim to withdraw no more than 4% of your assets each year. Theoretically, this strategy should remove the risk of your outliving your savings.
When calculating how long your savings will last, don't forget to factor inflation into your projections.

, If you already had a retirement plan in place that was based on withdrawing a certain amount of money each month before your health became an issue, think about how retiring earlier will affect that plan. If you are not retiring much earlier than expected, you may be able to adjust your withdrawals slightly to accommodate for the change.Be sure to consider how you will live on less than you had planned. You will need a solid plan for reducing your expenses in order for this strategy to work.

, If you can't make your current retirement savings last for the entire projected length of your retirement, you may want to consider looking for new ways to invest the money you already have. You will most likely want to look for investment opportunities that are low-risk since a volatile market can leave you with nothing overnight.For example, you may want to consider investing in lifetime income annuities, which will provide you with a predictable source of income each month.
If you have equity in your home and are over the age of 62, you may also want to consider a reverse mortgage, which will provide you with monthly payments while allowing you to continue living in your home., If you don't have enough saved to sustain your current spending habits throughout retirement, you may need to get used to living on less. The more wasteful spending you can cut out of your budget early on, the more comfortable your lifestyle will be. In addition to not buying anything you don't need, you can also find ways to spend less on the everyday things you do need.Always comparison shop to make sure you're getting the best deal on everything, from groceries to insurance.
Stop buying things out that you can make at home, such as coffee and meals.
Don't buy things that you can borrow for free, like books.
Look for other monthly expenses that you might be able to cut, like your cable subscription or a gym membership you never use.

, If cutting down on everyday expenses isn't enough, you may want to consider moving to a smaller home. Housing expenses are typically a huge part of an individual's monthly budget, and reducing this expense can help ensure that you have enough money to continue living comfortably throughout retirement.If you own your home, downsizing may leave you with a significant amount of cash that you can put towards your everyday expenses in retirement.
Downsizing will also typically reduce other costs associated with housing, such as utilities, insurance, and maintenance.

, If you live in a very expensive area, moving somewhere where the cost of living is lower may also be a good option. Be sure to consider the lifestyle changes this kind of move will bring with it. For example, you may have to live further from your family or from everyday conveniences.In some cases, this may simply mean leaving the city for the suburbs or leaving your exclusive neighborhood for a more modest one.
You may also want to consider moving across the country or even to a different country.

, If you don't have enough money saved to sustain you through your retirement, you may need to think of other ways to earn income. The right option for you will depend on your skills, your assets, and your health.Depending on your health issues, you may be able to work a part-time schedule to avoid retiring completely.
Even if you're not in good enough health to work a regular job, you may be able to do some freelance consulting work.
You may also be able to earn income from other investments. For example, if you own property, you may be able to rent it out, which will provide you with reliable income each month.

, In addition to financial considerations, it's also important to think about your health. If you're retiring due to poor health, be sure to consider what changes you can make to your lifestyle that would make your life easier and more comfortable.


In some cases, moving may improve your lifestyle. You might want to move to be closer to family members who can help care for you, to be closer to doctors and/or hospitals, to be in a home that is safer for you if you have physical limitations, or to be in a climate that is better for your health.
If you don't want to live completely alone, you may want to consider moving into an independent living or assisted living facility. Alternatively, you may decide that you need to hire someone to help you with certain tasks, like cleaning or laundry.

, If you want to ensure a comfortable retirement for yourself, it's best to avoid taking on as much debt as possible. This means not financing an extravagant car if you are able to buy a more affordable one without borrowing money. It also means only using credit cards if you can afford to pay off the balances,Taking on certain kinds of debt, such as a mortgage or a loan for college tuition, may be worth the investment, as they are likely to pay off in the future.

, While there is no way to prevent all health issues, being proactive about yourself can help protect you against many ailments. Start taking care of yourself when you are still young to avoid having to deal with a forced retirement due to poor health.Eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly to maintain a strong body and a healthy weight.
Get plenty of sleep.

Reduce stress as much as possible.
Follow your doctor's recommendations for preventing specific diseases. Common recommendations are to avoid smoking, to protect yourself from the sun, and to maintain low cholesterol and blood pressure.

, The earlier you start saving for retirement, the less you will have to worry if something happens that forces you to retire earlier than you had planned. Start contributing to a 401k or IRA as soon as you can.Starting an emergency fund in addition to your retirement fund can help you deal with unexpected medical expenses without having to withdraw from your retirement savings., One way to protect yourself in the event that you may need to retire earlier than you had planned is to start investing in long-term care and disability insurance.These insurance options may be available to you at a reduced rate through your employer. If not, you may also be able to purchase a policy directly.

Over the course of the next two days, we investigated citations 1-3 and established corrective actions. On November 7, we rectified citation 1 (improper use of fume hood) by replacing the equipment (see enclosed receipt and photo).""

, Send your letter along with any supplemental paperwork that will help you close your case. This may include purchase orders, receipts, monitoring results, vendor/contractor contact information, photographs, or any other document that verifies the changes you’ve made. , Arrange to have the letter sent by Certified Mail (with a receipt signature request), or by private courier. Don't forget about your five-day deadline!, If you have not heard anything on your complaint by the end of three business days after your anticipated date of receipt, call and follow up. Have your case number ready, and ask for a status report., It is possible that an OSHA inspector may show up without warning to your facility. Be kind, professional and courteous, and only answer specific questions addressed by the inspector., Depending on the nature and severity of the complaint, you may also be asked to pay a penalty. This penalty must be paid within 15 working days from the receipt of citation by sending a check directly to OSHA. Until your payment is received, you case will not be resolved., If you are considering contesting your complaint, it is strongly encouraged for you to call and request an informal conference with a local OSHA representative. During this conference, you will be able to get a better sense of the nature of your violation, discuss methods for correction, discuss settlement options, and possibly even resolve disputed citations and penalties.This can be also be done if your intention is to comply fully, or if you are not sure what course to take.

, Your letter must state exactly what is being contested—the citation, part of the citation, the fee amount, or the abatement date—as clearly as you can. Then send this notice by way of certified mail.For example, you might say, “I wish to contest the citation and penalty proposed for items 2 and 3 of the citation issued November 5, 2015.”

, As soon as your Notice of Intent to Contest is received, your case will officially be in litigation. Your abatement and fee dates will be suspended until a decision is reached, and your case is forwarded to OSHRC. OSHRC is an independent agency separate from the Department of Labor. The OSHRC will schedule a hearing for your case., Once your hearing date is set, you will want to begin preparing for your hearing, and make sure you can attend. You may want to obtain legal council, who will help you to present your case. Both employers and employees are eligible to participate in this hearing., At this hearing a decision will be reached, either upholding the initial citation and fees, modifying them to account for your specific contestation, or dismissing them. Either party then has the opportunity to accept the decision or to submit an appeal for further investigation by the OSHRC. If the case is still not resolved, it would then move on to the Federal Circuit Court."

Put formal safety policies and procedures in place.,
Put someone in charge of safety in your company.,
Communicate your expectations for a safe work environment.,
Inspect your facility regularly with your safety coordinator.,
Have the right tools available so that you or your employees don't have to improvise.,
Schedule regular training for all scenarios that pose a risk for accidents.,
Be prepared for a fire in your workplace.,
Consider investing in first-aid training or, at the very least, a first aid kit.,
Create incident reports after each workplace accident.,
Make sure your workplace entrances and exits are fully operational and easily accessible.,
Clearly mark potential safety concerns with the proper signage and instructions.",How to Reduce Accidents in the Workplace," Create a company handbook that lists out the steps that must take place in order to prevent accidents in the work place. Include instructions such as how to store dangerous and toxic items and where certain product should be stowed to ensure safe storage and retrieval.;
, Discuss the current safety policies with this safety coordinator, and work on a plan to make sure that they are adhered to. Confirm that the person is aware of all the responsibilities associated with safety. Express your support to this person and arrange to meet on a regular basis to discuss concerns about and solutions to further accident prevention.

, Let your staff know on a regular basis that safety is a major concern in your business. You can do this verbally and you can reiterate your expectations in memos. You can also post safety information throughout your facility.


Words are one thing, but act accordingly, too. If someone encounters a possible safety hazard, move quickly to correct it. Don't wait for it to correct itself or assume that someone else is going to do it.
Ask your employees whether they have any suggestions about improving workplace safety. One safety coordinator is certainly helpful, but a handful of ears and eyes is almost always preferable to just one. Create an anonymous input form that employees can fill out at their discretion.

, Make certain that your staff is following safety policies at work. Check areas that are of concern and ensure that precautions have been met. If you see an area that is cause for concern, discuss it with the person responsible, and then arrange a meeting with all the staff to further communicate the concern and ensure that it does not happen again.

, Asking your employees to improvise pretty much says that you don't take safety seriously.


For example, if you have a storage area that includes high shelving, ensure that you have a safe ladder or step-stool available so that you or your staff members are not forced to climb on boxes of furniture to retrieve items.

, Training should involve methods in picking up and carrying heavy objects and how to use mechanical equipment and tools.


The type of training will depend on the type of business you are running. Some businesses such as restaurants and warehouse facilities will have more training than others.
Trainings should be scheduled for all new employees and for all employees annually. Employees may think of it as a hassle, but they should be reassured knowing that the company takes their health and safety seriously.

, Fires are potentially devastating occurrences, putting many businesses, especially restaurants, in jeopardy. Ensure that your workplace is properly protected against the possibility of a fire to cut down on accidents:


Make sure smoke detectors are installed and have batteries.
Make sure that fire extinguishers are present and properly charged. Ask your fire department, if necessary, to give you training on how to use a fire extinguisher.
Plan your escape routes. Know where your nearest exits are and how employees can access them quickest.

, First-aid training won't keep the accident from happening in the first place, but it could help keep any injuries incurred during an accident from getting out of control.


Invest in a first-aid kit for each floor of your workplace. Place it in a strategically central location that is easily accessible.

, If an accident occurs in your workplace, write up an incident report. Investigate what happened, who was involved, how the accident might have been prevented, and recommendation for further procedures. At the very least, an incident report will foster awareness and possibly act as a deterrent for future accidents.

, If your employees need to get out of the building quickly, make sure that their exits aren't blocked by any large or unmovable objects. This is more than just a workplace violation: this is a potential life or death matter.

, If an electrician is rewiring an area of the workplace, or if a crew is doing construction on a piece of railing, inform your employees by memo and by placing an appropriate, visible sign near where the potential hazard could occur. Don't assume that people are smart enough to act accordingly. Spell it out for them very clearly.

Use each of the suggested home remedies at your own risk.",How to Use Home Remedies to Protect Your Skin After a Sunburn1," Many of the remedies below have not been sufficiently scientifically verified, and should not replace scientific medical treatment. Avoid using egg whites, peanut butter, petroleum jelly, and vinegar in particular."
"
Obtain a length of 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plastic electrical conduit or similar plastic tubing.,
At the 1.5 and 4.5 inch marks, cut a notch in the tubing.

,
Cut through the tubing at the 3 and 6 inch marks to make two 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces, each with one notch.

,
In one piece, drill a small hole all the way through the tubing so that when this hole is parallel to a flat surface behind the tubing, with the notch facing up at about a 45 degree angle.,
Place the two 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces on opposite sides of the Doorknob and run 2 inch (5.1 cm) drywall screws through the pre-drilled holes to connect the tubes together behind the knob.

,
Return to the tube you marked in step one, and cut it off at the 13 inch (33.0 cm) mark, now 7 inches (17.8 cm) from the end after cutting off the two 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces.,
Notch the tube to about half the diameter so that the notch will fit over the knob.,
Drill a small hole all the way through the tube on each side of the notch, so that the line of the holes will be perpendicular to the door when the notch is placed over the knob.,
Place the 7 inch (17.8 cm) piece you just completed over the knob with the screws run almost as far in as they can go.,
Screw the 7 inch (17.8 cm) piece to the 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces.",How to Make a Low Cost Door Knob Extender for People with Hand Pain," Mark off intervals from on end of 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, and 13 inches (33.0 cm).;
,,,


Enlarge the hole on the side away from the notch so that the head of the screws you will be using will fit entirely through the hole, so the screw head ends up inside the tube.






On the other piece, drill only a small hole through one side of the tubing, positioned so that the tubes can be screwed together as shown in the photo for the previous step.







,, Place this against the Doorknob with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) extending beyond the knob on one end. Mark the edges of the knob.

, Getting a smooth cut isn't essential and is difficult if just using a hacksaw.

,


Enlarge the holes on the side away from the knob so that the screw heads will pass through, leaving them inside the tubing.







,


Rotate the two 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces already attached to the door, so that the screws in the 7 inch (17.8 cm) piece contact the 3 inch (7.6 cm) tubes in good spots for attaching.
Mark these spots and drill a small pilot hole there. The 7 inch (17.8 cm) tube will be at about a 45 degree angle to the 3 inch (7.6 cm) tubes.







, Optionally, place a piece of rubber shelf liner between the knob and the 7 inch (17.8 cm) piece. It probably won't be necessary if the notch in the 7 inch (17.8 cm) piece fits closely to the knob. Done.

Determine the type of job or industry your workplace is identified with.,
Know the various regulations that are common to any business or work place such as Bureau Of Worker's Compensation.,
Create a list of all machinery, equipment and work tasks required in your company.,
Go to the OSHA web site and review it carefully.,
Use a simple heading description with the CFR number such as Personal Protective Equipment - 1926.28 ACTUAL COPY.,
Know that your circumstance may require local or state regulations that are also necessary.,
If you still have trouble, you can request a visit for them to help you without fear.

",How to Write an OSHA Work Place Safety Manual," For example, construction, industrial, mining, transportation, ship building, longshoreman, etc.


This is important because the US Department of Labor  may through its division, OSHA (Occupational Safety & Health Administration) have specific or unique standards that are regulated by one or more agency. OSHA has published their standards in the Code Of Federal Regulations (CFR). This information is grouped and identified by Titles.  

For Example, the construction industry is Title 29 - CFR1926, Manufacturing is Title 29 - CFR1910. As earlier mentioned general provisions are Title 29 -  CFR 1910.The OSHA web site has many many tools and a very good search engine that will assist you.  Also you can highlight and copy the standards.;
,  Additionally a few regulations such as ""Employee Rights"" or ""Minimum Wage"" are required to be posted.  


You may obtain an OSHA Poster at the following link.
OSHA has a specific requirement to establish and maintain records of safety training, accidents, and testing of work specific equipment. You can review these requirements at http://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping.
Typically this information is required for completing  OSHA forms annually; OSHA Form 301 and OSHA Form 300A.
Failure to maintain OSHA recordkeeping can be expensive. https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/RKforms.html 
When creating an Employee Safety Manual you must realize that a great deal of information regarding standards and regulation is available from OSHA.
You must edit this and allow it to remain complete, but only as it would apply to your circumstance.
As an EXAMPLE, OSHA requires the use of PPE (personal protective equipment). Hearing , eye, footwear, passive respiratory or other items are required where needed.
Rather than define each work place location that requires PPE, is needed, consider whenever located on company property. PPE must be worn.

,  Additionally you should create a listing of any testing of equipment or machinery that must be done. This list will be valuable to you when searching the OSHA site.

, Although it is not required, you can create a user name and password to obtain a few privileges. You can also order many products writings, training guides free of charge.  This web site will actually be your best friend at creating your safety manual.

, The employer is responsible for requiring the wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment in all operations where there is an exposure to hazardous conditions or where this part indicates the need for using such equipment to reduce the hazards to the employees. Feel free to modify it for your company, but be sure not to alter the context.ABC Construction Company requires the wearing of the appropriate personal protective equipment in all operations where there is an exposure to hazardous conditions or where this part indicates the need for using such equipment to reduce the hazards to the employees. Each step is basically as simple as the example given here.

, Contact your local authorities for their regulations or standards.

Take note of any changes to the employee's working day performance.,
Search for slower productivity--often a sign of employee stress.,
Look for a decline in the employee's quality of work.,
Recognize consistent weariness and irritability in an employee's demeanor.,
Notice whether your employee is showing signs of poor judgment regarding issues that he is usually responsible for, or maybe he is demonstrating uncertainty when it comes to making even the smallest decisions.

,
Pay attention if it seems that a usually witty employee has suddenly lost his sense of humor.,
Be wary of constant complaints of headaches, nausea, and other types of physical illness in an employee.,
Remain attentive when you notice a usually reliable employee become habitually late.,
Listen to what your employee is saying when he complains about his workload or threatens to leave, even if he attempts to speak in jest.,
Establish whether your employee takes regular vacations.",How to Tell if an Employee Is Under Stress," For example, he is suddenly not completing his work as usual and so he has to stay late or even take some if his work home.;
, If an employee is under a lot of stress, he will feel so overwhelmed that he cannot keep his usual pace of work because he is distracted by that same feeling of being overwhelmed. It's a vicious circle that he cannot escape from because his mind is consumed.

, You can recognize this in the extent of errors that you are finding, in addition to the type of errors. Only you would recognize whether the mistakes are out of character.

, Maybe he is unnecessarily short in his responses to your queries or he loses patience easily. But any form of jittery behavior should not be ignored.

,, Maybe his usual extroverted personality has gotten quiet and reserved, or his optimism has turned into a strange cynicism.

, Additionally, increased sick days and requested sick leave should be a cause for concern about an employee's stress level.

, Also, if an employee cannot seem to meet deadlines or cannot fulfill specified timelines, he may be under stress.

, If these comments are out of character, then he may be indirectly communicating his anxiety.

, Taking your role and responsibilities seriously at work is admirable, but when that attitude reaches the point of obsession, you may have a stressed employee in your team.

Identify the problem behaviors.,
Intervene quickly.,
Review the company’s Employee Handbook.,
Speak with the Human Resources Department.,
Gather all necessary documents and facts.",How to Speak to an Employee About a Tardiness Issue1," Closely watch the employee to see if tardiness is the only issue of concern with their job performance. If they are also sloppy in their work or disagreeable to their coworkers, then you may need to address these problems as well in your meeting. Pay attention to see if their productivity has clearly suffered as a result of their lateness.Make a quick note in your phone or jot down your observations in a small notepad that you keep on you. This will allow you to recall everything clearly later on.;
, It is key that you not allow this issue to go on too long. Begin planning a meeting as soon as you see your employee behaving in problematic way. If you wait, there is a possibility that it will only get worse. You also run the risk of alienating other employees who have to pick up the slack from the slacker., If you work at a larger business, there is likely a detailed manual to guide your actions in situations of employee discipline. Skim through the book to see if there is a section that pertains to tardiness. Ideally, you will find a statement outlining a clear, coherent attendance policy.If your place of work does not have an employee manual, then you will need to rely on your personal observations and past practices to guide your actions. For example, if the employee consistently comes in 15 minutes late, then this is an obvious violation of the schedule.

, Send a quick email, make a phone call, or drop by in person at your company’s HR Department. Tell them about the situation, ask for their advice, and ask them what they need from you in terms of paperwork. It is possible that they will need an acknowledgement signed by the employee or a summary of the conversation from you for the employee’s record.It is also possible that the HR people know something regarding the employee’s personal or medical life that you do not. For example, the employee may have approached them regarding using part of a medical leave. Ask HR to educate you regarding any company leave policies that could pertain to this employee., You’ll want to get your hands on any payroll records or timesheets showing additional absences or attendance overall. You may want documentation showing prior incidents of lateness, their impact, and the reasons provided by the employee. Having employee performance evaluations in-hand is also a good idea."

Choose the right time.,
Be as comfortable as possible.,
Speak about your disability in practical terms.,
Make them aware of the accommodations that you need.,
Ask for certain courtesies.,
Remind them that your impairment does not define you.,
Ask them if they have any questions.,
Offer training opportunities.",How to Talk to Your Employee About Your Visual Disability1," If your visual impairment is preexisting, and you have recently hired a new employee, you may wonder when the best time is to discuss this disability. The longer you wait, the more you open the door for potential confusion or run the risk of your other employees disclosing your disability for you. Get ahead of this by telling your employee as soon as possible.Tell them on their first day of work when you begin meeting with them to assign them tasks and acclimate them to the office.
They may have already noticed or picked up on it anyway, but telling them will ensure that they are not confused or left wondering.
Tell them in private. Though you may be comfortable with your impairment, this may be new for them. Allow them time to process away from others.;
, Though talking about your disability may be a sore spot for you, try to be as at ease as possible with your employee. It is your job to make sure that they feel as comfortable as possible in this working environment and having an awkward conversation with you will not aid in that.Take a few breaths beforehand. Review and rehearse what you will say. Stick to the facts and answer any questions they might have.

, When speaking about your impairment, avoid injecting emotion into the discussion. Speak to them as factually and practically as possible. Describe the nature of your impairment and the impact that it has.For instance you might say “Though I am not legally blind, my vision is severely impaired. I am able to discern light and dark as well as colors, but I do have to do all of my readings via braille or electronics.”

, During this conversation, it is important that you inform your employee of any accommodations that you might need them to abide by. For instance, perhaps you need them to send you any information prior to meetings electronically rather than giving you a hard copy.You might need other accommodations like larger print.

, In addition to certain professional needs, don’t forget the other niceties that make or break an office. Ask them to be mindful of your disability in returning items to their proper places so that you don’t have difficulty locating them. Remind them to never leave items in walkways. Think of any other requests that you could make to this employee to ensure that you can do your job without limitations or difficulties.


You might say something like “It’s really important for me that all office supplies stay in the same location. So if you use the stapler in the back, just be sure to put it back exactly where you found it.”

, Though your disability is certainly a part of who you are, it does not define you exclusively. You might want to discuss the ways that it has helped you so that they can understand the strengths of it.For instance, perhaps you have noticed that you are more detail oriented because of it or more knowledgeable about technology.
Perhaps your office has a culture of inclusion and acceptance.

, After you have spoken to your employee about your visual impairment, now is the time to see what questions they might have. It is likely that they have not had a boss before who this disability, but bear with them. Allow them to learn more about you by asking questions.


Encourage your employee to be open with you. They may feel uncomfortable asking you questions about your visual impairment. If they do ask you questions, be honest so that they are not afraid to approach you with questions in the future.
Tell them that even if they don’t have questions now, they can ask you later in person or via email.
Remind them that you are there for them and want to develop them professionally.

, Many companies offer workshops to employees on working with those from backgrounds different from them. Others offer workshops on how to be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Inform your new employees about any such trainings and tell them that they can attend if they would like so that they can learn more.Do not make this required. If they do attend, count it as hours worked.

Survey your employees about their happiness.,
Institute a grievance process.,
Explain unpopular decisions.,
Recognize employee contributions.,
Stop if you learn there is a union drive.",How to Prevent Unions1," One good way to head off a union drive is to investigate how satisfied employees are with your workplace. You can send out a questionnaire and ask for anonymous responses to the following questions:How responsive is management to employee concerns?
How happy are employees with their compensation level?
Are there health and safety concerns that they want addressed?;
, You should have some formal process employees can use to make complaints. You should also include the grievance process in your employee manuals and handbooks. By providing for a grievance process, employees will feel like their voices are heard at work.Make sure that supervisors and managers have an “open door” policy. State that no retaliation will take place for lodging a complaint.You might also create a grievance committee. This committee is then tasked with investigating and resolving disputes.Create a flowchart of who the employee should contact. State clearly the steps an employee must take. For example, you might require that the employee try to work out the dispute on their own before contacting their direct supervisor.Then you could instruct the employee to contact the grievance committee if the direct supervisor does not resolve the dispute.

, Every business has ups and downs. If you need to make an unpopular business decision—such as cutting employee benefits, laying people off, or no longer giving employees free coffee—you should be transparent as to your reasons for taking the action.


Employees want to be treated fairly. They also understand that businesses sometimes have to make difficult decisions. The worst thing you could do is try to hide the reason why you made the unpopular decision.
Explain why the action was necessary for the business’s health and future.If you fail to explain the actions, then employees may speculate and think the worst of management.

, You can try to prevent disgruntled employees from forming a union by creating bonus/incentive plans.Bonus plans include lump sum bonuses for employees who hit certain targets.You can also award other productive behavior, such as perfect attendance. Let the employee know why he or she is receiving the bonus. In this way, the employee feels like their efforts have been recognized. You also create an incentive for the employee to continue the good behavior.
Think about creating an employee of the month award. You probably see these every time you go into your grocery store. Usually, the store has a picture of an employee on the wall. These awards are a good way of recognizing the contributions of your employees and cost very little money.

, You should try to address employee concerns as a way to keep them from forming a union. However, once you find out that your employees are actually unionizing, you should stop all attempts to change the workplace.


This may sound irrational. After all, you simply want to make things better for your workers. However, federal law prohibits employers from trying to “coerce” employees during a union drive. Your attempt to improve employee wages, for example, could be interpreted as an attempt to induce employees to reject the union.You should contact your attorney and ask how to proceed.

"
"
Meet with the employee in private.,
Explain the reason for your meeting.,
Lay out the details of the attendance policy.,
Explain the ramifications for future tardiness.,
Tell them what you expect from their future performance.,
Answer their questions.,
Send a copy of all documentation to Human Resources.,
Pay attention and reward any improvements.",How to Speak to an Employee About a Tardiness Issue2," It is best if your first conversation is one-on-one. You definitely want to meet somewhere where other employees will not be privy to your conversation. You can ask the employee to meet you in your office at a certain time. Some supervisors prefer to casually ask the employee, “How are you?,” a few times before setting up anything formal.If you know the employee quite well and think a casual approach may be best, you could leave the office together to go grab some coffee and discuss everything.
To set up a meeting, you might say, “Hi, Tom. Good morning, would you mind stopping by my office after lunch?”

, You can open the meeting with some general niceties, but it is a good idea to explain why you asked them in early on in the conversation. You might explain that you’ve noticed a change in their work patterns and wanted to get their take on everything. You could also describe how productivity had dropped and you noticed their tardiness might be a contributing cause.Be tactful here as you want to leave plenty of room for them to explain, especially if they are an otherwise good employee. You might say, “Tom, I’ve noticed that you’ve been late quite a bit lately. Can you tell me what’s been going on?” Then, “Tom, your coworkers very much rely on your good work and I’ve noticed a slowdown in productivity lately.”

, This is where you explain what you found in the employee handbook. Or, you can tell them what is acceptable in terms of lateness and absences and where the line is drawn. This is also important to do quite early on in the conversation, as it is possible that the employee didn’t understand the policy fully or misinterpreted something from HR.


You might say, “Tom, we do need at least 24-hours’ notice if you are going to be late for a work day.”

, This is where you will need to lay down clear rules and consequences while also being as flexible as you can. You might ask them to make up the time each week. Or, you might issue a written warning leading eventually to termination. You could just ask them to leave immediately if they arrive late and dock their pay. Make sure to match your response to the issue.It also helps to know your employee. Some people respond best to very clearly established consequences while others do better if you just ask for their assistance in complying., This is where you both can work on a positive and proactive solution. Discuss flex time as an option. Or, maybe see if they can carpool with others for accountability. Talk about working from home, if needed, or perhaps even taking a leave of absence.If the lack of notice is your real concern, perhaps set up a system where they can text or email if they’ll be running late in the future.
This is also where you’ll want to talk about any other behavioral issues, such as poor attitude. However, be careful not to overwhelm your employee or you could get a negative, defensive reaction.

, Before you conclude the conversation, make sure to ask them if they have any questions or concerns that they would like you to address. And, whatever they ask, do your best to give them as much information and guidance as you can without appearing condescending. If you don’t know the answer, refer them to HR or someone who can help.


You might say, “Before we wrap everything up, do you have any questions for me? I want to make sure that you are clear on everything we’ve gone over.”

, Get any documents signatures that you need. And, make additional copies for your own records and those of HR. It is a good idea to keep general summaries of disciplinary conversations within an employee’s work file. These documents will serve as a record in case you need to have another conversation or pursue termination of employment.

, It is highly likely that your employee will begin to improve their performance following your conversation. As you watch to see how they are doing, make sure to note any progress and encourage it, no matter how small."
"
Stay calm.,
Do not tolerate personal insults or abuse.,
Bring in a witness, if needed.,
Give them a written explanation option.,
Direct them further up the chain of command.",How to Speak to an Employee About a Tardiness Issue3," Remember that you are the person setting the professional tone for your conversation. Take a deep breath or count to ten in your head if you need to calm down. Stick to the issues at hand and try not to veer off subject. Remind yourself that you are trying to help them, but you also need to do your job.

, The employee may respond negatively to your comments and may react by lashing out. If this happens, it is best if you both step back for a bit. Ask the employee to leave for the day and state that you will resume the conversation tomorrow with HR present as well. You must maintain a degree of authority here or you will lose the ability to guide this employee’s behavior and ensure the company’s productivity.This is another reason why you want to have this conversation sooner rather than later. If you wait too long before talking with them, they may feel as if you should’ve warned them earlier.

, If you feel that the conversation may go badly, it is probably a smart idea to invite a member of HR or another supervisor to sit in on the talk. They can help to reinforce what you say about the rules. An employee will also be less likely to get agitated when faced with two calm people., If the employee is uncomfortable talking with you about their situation, you might want to allow them to write an official letter stating the reasons for their actions and their desire to improve in the future. Request that they explicitly agree to specific measures of improvement in the future.


This letter should also be placed with an employee’s official file with HR.

, If the employee seems unwilling to change or refuses to talk civilly with you, it may be necessary to put them into contact with your supervisor or HR directly. Give the other party a heads up if you do this, so that they’ll know what to expect.

Learn more about your visual disability.,
Chose the setting you’re most comfortable with.,
Discuss these changes with your employees.,
Request accommodations.,
Ask for help when needed.",How to Talk to Your Employee About Your Visual Disability2," Perhaps your disability is as new for you as it is for your employees. In this case, before you have a discussion, you will need to develop a full articulation of the disorder so that you can best share it with your staff. Discuss your vision with your doctor to better assess what is going on.Take notes if you need to.
Avoid doing a lot of research online as this can be misleading and can lead to confusion and fear.

, If you would prefer to get the conversations over with quickly, doing so in a full staff meeting might be the best course of action. However, if you would prefer a more personal approach, you can do so individually.If you have a large staff, you can also consider meeting with the heads of your departments and then entrusting them to give any necessary details to their own staff.

, After you have a better understanding of the changes to your vision, have a talk with you employees. Tell them about what is going on with you and let them know that you will share any important updates with them as they develop. Tell them what you need from them right now.You might say something like “I’ve recently been having some problems with my vision and my doctor tells me that I am going blind. The timeline for this is unclear but I will share that when I know more. At this time, I do need all of you to please print everything in large print or send me documents electronically.”

, Talk to your doctor about what accommodations they might suggest that you utilize at work so that your visual impairment doesn’t worsen and so that you can still maintain your career. Share any information that relates to your employees with them.You might ask your doctor about what types of products can help you at work. For example, you might start using a speaking bar code scanner to identify items, or you can use a talking calculator.One small request to make would be to ask everyone to identify themselves when in meetings. You may no longer be able to make out their faces or voices if they are new.

, Though life with this visual impairment is likely difficult, don’t forget that your staff is there to push forward the work of your company and part of doing that is making sure that their boss is okay. Ask for help when you need it during this time of adjustment. Your staff is likely more than willing to help you.


Remind them of the newness of this for you.
If your duties are starting to overwhelm you, do not be afraid to delegate tasks to your employees.

Start early.,
Create a general prohibition.,
Enforce the prohibition consistently.,
Prevent employees from advertising union meetings.,
Refuse to provide the union with employee information.,
Understand that employees can organize during non-work periods.",How to Prevent Unions2," You can prevent employees from distributing union literature at work. However, you must have a general policy against solicitation in place before you hear the first rumblings of union organizing activity. If you wait, then your attempt to limit solicitation and distribution might look like an unfair labor practice.

, The best way to prevent union solicitation is to have a general policy in place early. Don’t specify that only union solicitation is prohibited—that would be discriminatory against unions and illegal. Instead, limit all distribution of materials and solicitation.


For example, you should adopt a policy like the following: “Distribution of advertising material, handbills or other literature in working areas of this facility is prohibited at any time. Solicitation by one employee of another is likewise prohibited if either employee is on working time.”This prohibition is sufficiently general. It applies to a variety of distribution and solicitation.
By contrast, stating “No union material or information may be distributed in working areas” directly singles out unions. You can’t use a prohibition like this.

, It’s one thing to draft a prohibition and tell employees. You also need to consistently enforce it.If you start enforcing the prohibition only after a union drive starts, then it looks like you are targeting unions.


Put the prohibition in your employee manuals and handbooks. Make sure that employees see it.
Punish any employee who violates the rule. Also document the punishment. For example, you should reprimand an employee who tries to sell her daughter’s Girl Scout cookies to her coworkers.

, If there is a union drive in your workplace, then you can prevent the employees from posting notices about upcoming meetings on your bulletin board. You are not discriminating against the union if you have restricted postings on your bulletin board in the past to certain topics (like advertisements to sell goods).Don’t allow the bulletin board to serve as a general forum for your employees. If you do, then you might have to allow the union to post meeting notices on the board., You do not have to give the union information about your employees, such as their names or addresses. The union has to rely on its own efforts to contact employees.However, if the union gets enough votes to qualify for a government-supervised election, then the law requires that you disclose the information at that time.

, Although you do not have to allow solicitation during work hours, employees are free to engage in union activity during non-work hours, such as a lunch break.You don’t want to overstep and have employees accuse you of engaging in unfair labor practices. For this reason, you should understand that employees can talk about the union during their breaks.

"
"
Stick to facts, opinions, and examples.,
Research the union.,
Highlight your company’s good features.",How to Prevent Unions3," Federal law does not prevent management from expressing views about the union. However, you are limited in what you can say. In particular, you should stick to facts, opinions, and examples.Facts. You can factually state, “Employees who strike can be permanently replaced.” That is a fact.
Opinions. You can also say, “I don’t think you should sign a union card.” This is solely your opinion. You cannot follow up the opinion with a threat or with questions about what the employee will do. Nevertheless, you can state your opinions.
Examples. You can also give examples of what has happened in unionized workplaces. For example, you could say, “In the 1990s, our largest competitor was unionized. They shut down only a year later.” If this statement is factually correct, then you can state it. However, make sure your facts are accurate.

, You have the right to inform your employees about the union’s history and record.You can be sure that the union is presenting a rosy view of their success. However, you can counter with facts and examples which tell a different story.


Perform basic background research on the union using the Internet. You can find out the history of the union and any embarrassing incidents (such as criminals who have worked for the union).
Use more advanced search engines. For example, you can use Lexis-Nexis, which is an online search engine with a repository of newspaper stories.
Look for businesses which had to close after the union was formed. You can then use them as an example.

, One legal way to counter a union drive is to emphasize everything that is good about your company: the pay, benefits, job security, etc.This is a subtle way to remind employees that they don’t need a union.


You can also compare your company’s wages and benefits to those of unionized workplaces. If your compensation compares favorably, then you should emphasize that fact. Some employees might assume they will get a huge raise if they join a union. You can puncture that dream with well-sourced facts.
However, you cannot threaten to lay people off. You can’t say, “If this union goes through, I’m going to have to lay a bunch of you off.” That sounds too much like a threat (even if it accurately describes the economic realities of your business).
You also can’t lie. Don’t make up statistics or loosely quote things you might have heard on television. If you aren’t sure whether your wages and benefits are competitive, then don’t state that as a fact.

"
"
Hire a lawyer.,
Train managers and supervisors.,
Tell employees they don’t have to agree to the union.,
Inform employees of a union’s costs.,
Answer whether a union assures job security.,
Clarify that a striking employee is not paid.",How to Prevent Unions4," The line between legal and illegal employer conduct is very thin. For example, you can state your opinion about a union but not ask the employee what he thinks about the union. In everyday conversation, it is very natural to follow up an opinion with a question. However, in the union context, you could inadvertently commit an unfair labor practice if you do.


To help you understand what you can and can’t say, you need an experienced labor lawyer. To find a qualified labor lawyer, you can get a referral from another business which has recently undergone a union drive. Ask the company’s management if they would recommend their lawyer.
Before hiring the lawyer, make sure that the lawyer has experience representing companies (and not unions).
Also check that the lawyer is experienced in training managers and supervisors. You need all management at the workplace to understand what is not allowed. Many labor lawyers can present training seminars where they coach your staff.

, The law closely limits what you can say or do, and your supervisory staff must know how it can respond to the union drive. In some situations, a supervisor can commit a labor violation so serious that a union election won’t need to be held.Employees will often approach your front-line management to discuss the union. Your staff must be prepared to answer questions lawfully., One common question employees ask supervisors is whether or not they must sign the authorization card the union gives them. In order to hold a union election, a certain percentage of employees must sign the card. If employees are confused, they might ask their immediate supervisor if they have to sign.


The answer is “No.” Every employee has a legal right not to sign the authorization card., Employees might also ask whether it costs money to join the union.


The supervisor can tell the employee that the union charges dues in addition to potential fines and assessments. For example, the union can assess fines for working if there is a strike. A union can also fine members for not attending a union meeting., Some employees might think a union guarantees job security. In this situation, they might ask their supervisor to confirm their suspicions.


In fact, a union does not guarantee job security. Your frontline supervisory staff can tell employees that the best way to assure job security is for the company to continue to grow and remain competitive in its market., Your employees might also wonder whether they will be paid if they strike. Your staff should be prepared to answer accurately.


An employee has no right to payment. Furthermore, the employee has no guarantee of continued employment if they strike."
"
Don’t punish employees.,
Avoid making promises of increased benefits.,
Don’t poll your employees.,
Avoid attending union meetings.,
Don’t prohibit the wearing of union buttons.",How to Prevent Unions5," You can’t discriminate in any way against an employee who participates in union activity.Accordingly, you shouldn’t demote, lay off, or refuse training to an employee engaged in the union drive.


Nevertheless, you can still discipline employees if they make job mistakes. An employee trying to form a union must still perform his or her job competently. You can discipline an employee who fails to fulfill their job requirements., You can’t try to ward off a union by promising to increase benefits, wages, or vacation time. You also can’t promise to improve working conditions in exchange for abandoning a union drive.If you had planned to improve benefits or wages before you learned of the union drive, then you should meet with a lawyer to discuss whether or not to go through with your plans.
It is possible to continue to go ahead in some situations, e.g., if you had informed the employees of the change before learning of the union drive. Nevertheless, proceed carefully under a lawyer’s guidance.

, You shouldn’t question employees in any way about whether or not they want to join a union. For example, you should avoid the following:


Don’t ask, “How do you feel about the union?”Although you can give your own opinion—“I don’t think you should join a union”—don’t follow up with a question about what the employee thinks.
Also avoid asking, “Did you attend the union meeting?” Don’t try to get employees to tell you the status of the union drive or who is participating, either.

, No member of management should attend a union meeting. This looks like spying. Also, if the employees know that the supervisor is there, they might claim to have been intimidated.If an employee voluntarily comes up to you and tells you what happened at the union meeting, then you are free to listen. Nevertheless, you shouldn’t say anything in response., Unless you have a legitimate reason (such as the employees wear a uniform), you shouldn’t try to prevent employees from wearing union buttons or clothing."

Address the employee verbally.,
Be direct, but polite.,
Review responsibilities.,
Avoid assuming an employee is lazy.,
Offer ideas to measure accountability.,
Articulate clear consequences.",How to Manage a Lazy Employee1," Don’t allow an employee's laziness or lack of enthusiasm to become a recurring issue. Tell the employee you’re hoping to speak with them about workplace expectations and performance, and schedule a time to sit down together. Your conversation will likely prove helpful in identifying the cause for the employee’s waning work ethic.For instance, “I’ve noticed a decline in your effort and I want to make sure you’ll be able to keep up with your responsibilities moving forward. Can we set up a time to meet and talk about it?”;
, Make sure you don’t come across as accusatory by acknowledging that everyone’s productivity fluctuates. Say something like, “I understand that there may be factors I’m not aware of. Is there something going on I should know about?”If there is something going on outside of work, ask the employee whether you can help, and what they’re planning to do. Personal issues arise for everyone, and you should be understanding of that, though you also deserve to know when an employee is struggling with something that affects their ability to work.

, Sometimes, simply sitting down with an employee and talking about what is expected of them is enough to motivate them to get back on track. A good way to go about this is reminding an employee of their role, and pointing out how the business is affected when they don’t meet the responsibilities associated with that role.For instance, mention something like, “When there’s a drop in production in your department, Jeff isn’t able to meet his quotas. We need everyone to stay on task in order to keep this business running smoothly.”

, Sometimes, managers mistakenly assume an employee is lazy, when the employee may simply require further guidance. Specifying priorities for their position may immediately lead to greater productivity.For instance, productivity issues are sometimes the fault of mistaken priorities. Your employee may simply be spending too much time doing minor, unimportant tasks.
Additionally, it's important to have realistic expectations of your employees. Often, managers will sometimes compare their employees performance to their own, which is not necessarily fair.

, Most people's attention wanes at some point during the day, and this is even more likely if no one else is monitoring their productivity regularly. Establish a method of accountability that might help keep the employee on task without having to actively monitor them.Deadlines are perhaps the most common measurement of productivity. If your employee isn’t working within clear, specific deadlines, assign certain tasks or projects to be completed by a certain day.
Similarly, you could assign a series of tasks, or benchmarks, or be accomplished each shift.

, Hopefully, clarifying expectations and accountability mechanisms will help get your employee back in the saddle. However, it is worth mentioning that there may be repercussions for continued laziness. Articulate these repercussions in advance (ideally by referencing the employee manual), so it is clear that changes in the employee’s behavior need to occur or there will be concrete consequences.For instance, say something like, “It sounds like we agree that these expectations are fair. Let’s check in with each again in a few weeks, with the understanding that if your performance hasn’t changed, I may have to reduce your hours.”

Put out a press release.",How to Lay Off an Employee," Make sure that the people that remain will be able to cover the work of those who are being laid off. Layoffs, unlike firings, are typically about the company performing poorly and needing to let part of the workforce go. With layoffs, employees will be able to claim unemployment benefits. Firings, on the other hand, are usually about the poor performance of the employee.How exactly will the downsizing work? Will people be changing offices, or are you moving to a smaller space? Think very carefully about layoffs because you don’t want to regret losing key people., You need to know the best way to go about laying people off. You should know your rights and responsibilities as an employer. You will also need to know your employees’ rights and responsibilities, and how they can go about collecting unemployment benefits., If you’re going to be laying off people, chances are it’s because your business is not doing well. Discuss the health of your business with your staff before doing layoffs. They might have good ideas about how to turn it around or find some creative solutions to the problems you are facing. It might turn out that you don’t need to lay off people (or at least not so many as you thought). If you do end up doing layoffs, at least your staff will be aware that this is part of a larger problem and not due to their performance.”I’m sorry to have to tell you all this, but our business has been dropping for the last two quarters. I am considering layoffs, even though I really don’t want to do it. We just don’t have the money to pay everyone going forward.”
”We’re looking at bankruptcy if we don’t make some changes in the staff. I don’t want to lay anyone off, but I think it’s going to be necessary.”
”The recession has made our client list almost dry up. If you have any suggestions, I’d love to hear them. But if we don’t make some changes, I’m going to have to lay people off.”

, Some business experts suggest Tuesday morning. It’s early enough in the week (but not Monday) that you’ll be able to control the response in the office. People can talk about it and think about it during work, rather than getting upset alone about it over the weekend. Avoid Fridays at the end of work and first thing Monday morning -- both are times when it will make people feel more resentful. Also steer clear of announcements right before holiday weekends for layoffs., Try to think of ways to explain the situation compassionately. Imagine possible responses to being laid off and strive to find good answers or replies to different reactions. Be honest and respectful. Think about preparing a script to follow and memorizing the key points you want to make., Once you know it’s unavoidable, plan the time and place for your meetings with employees. It’s better for everyone to get it over quickly., Even though it’s going to be uncomfortable, you have to tell each employee to their face that they are being laid off. This way you can have a conversation, listen to each other, and try to find ways that you can help the employee move forward.”Jan, I am so sorry, but I’m going to have to let you go. You’ve been a great employee, but we’re going to be closing the department you work in because of budget problems.”
”No one wants to hear this, but we’re going to have to lay you off. We can only operate with a skeleton staff going forward, and this means that we are going to eliminate your position.”
”This is really hard, but I’m going to have to let you go. You’ve worked so hard for us, and I’ve seen how much you’ve grown. I know that wherever you find your next job is going to be so lucky.”

, You need to be empathetic in dealing with your employees, who will almost certainly be very upset by the news. Make sure to detail the fine work they have done for you and how much you have valued it. Think about preparing the following:Tissues and water
Times when the employee can come and clean out his or her desk when other employees are not there. (If they want a chance to say goodbye to coworkers, figure out a time for that as well).

, If you have the capability, you could also offer to connect the employee with career advising and placement assistance, but not all companies are able to do so. Refer the employee to the Human Resources department (or whoever is in charge of the layoff details) if they have further questions about filing for unemployment or finding a new position., Based on your employee handbook and their contracts, different employees might be entitled to different amounts and benefits. Familiarize yourself with each contract so that you can be sure of the details. Go over the package with the employee to make sure he or she understands it completely.


If you are asking them to sign a waiver, give them some time to think about it. If you offer severance, they have to sign a waiver saying that they will not come back to the company at a later date and sue, demanding more money., You might even want your lawyer with you as you conduct the layoffs. Workers are protected by both federal and state law. Determine if your business and layoff plan fall under the WARN Actor the Older Workers’ Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA)at the websites cited below. Make sure that you are not giving your employees cause to sue you at a later date. Discrimination is one of the main causes laid off employees sue -- gender, race, and disability laws cover these situations., Everyone will be talking about the layoffs -- allow it. Give employees a few days to deal with it and then ask that the conversations at work stop.”I know we all need time to think about these changes. That’s fine. Let’s take this week to deal with it, and when we get back on Monday we can be ready to move forward.
”I am saddened by the layoffs, as I know you are. Talk about them with your coworkers now and over the weekend. We’ll have a meeting Monday to talk about how our company is changing and how you are a part of that.”
”Layoffs are terrible for all of us. Let’s take some time today and tomorrow to talk about them with each other. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.”

, Send an email or call a meeting to talk about what the company will be doing going forward. Thank them all for their work and ask for their help.”I want to hear from you about how you think we should deal with the changes. Email me with ideas or to set up a meeting for a discussion.”
”I’d like to call an all-company meeting for Tuesday afternoon. I want to hear from anyone who has questions or concerns so that we can deal with them publicly.”
”What should our company do to prepare for the future? Email, message, or call me to let me know. Employees often know better than management what a company and its clients really need.”

, Communicate with your public honestly. Let them know that your layoffs happened, and how your company will be changing.

Assign tasks you know they’ll enjoy.,
Offer incentives for increased performance.,
Don’t do their work for them.",How to Manage a Lazy Employee2," One of the most common factors that causes laziness is boredom. Though it seems counter-intuitive, an employee may be putting in less effort because they aren’t feeling stimulated. Get them excited about their job again by assigning tasks they’ve conveyed interest in, or that will challenge them in a different way.An employee that seems to be wasting time may simply be getting what they need to do done quickly, and may even be ready for greater responsibilities.

, If you’re generally happy with one of your employees but you know they could be getting more done, consider offering performance-based incentives to work harder. For instance, offer a slightly higher commission on sales beyond their regular quota, or a longer daily lunch break if they can get more done each morning., Maybe you have an employee who does their work, but never quite to the level of quality you’re hoping for. Don’t jump in and finish a task or tweak it to meet your standards. Point out the difference between what they’re doing and what needs to be done, and show them how to they can improve. If it helps, think of yourself as a coach, as opposed to the clean-up crew.Say something like, “Andrew, I’m glad to see you’ve kept up with this week’s assignments. I noticed a recurring roughness in your finished product though. Take the time to sand each piece thoroughly and they’ll be coming out beautifully.”

Document poor behavior.,
Be strict about schedules.,
Don’t talk about it with other employees.,
Let employees go when you need to.",How to Manage a Lazy Employee3," If you have an employee that always has an excuse, or aren’t able to continually monitor all of your employees, it’s worth keeping a record of their performance. Most importantly, this will enable to you to clearly and definitively show an employee any recurring issues with their performance.Things like tardiness should always be recorded. Additionally, take note when you or someone else has to re-do work that an employee didn’t complete sufficiently, or any incidents in which you have to speak with an employee about behavior or performance.

, Schedules are the type of accountability measuring stick that are the easiest (and arguably the most important) to enforce. While you may want to be relaxed about certain things, maintain a strict position regarding deadlines.Standardized time frames - such as a week to complete a certain task - work especially well. By assigning the same sorts of things to multiple employees with the same time frames, you can identify issues with productivity fairly and concretely.
When deadlines aren’t met, and there isn’t a good reason (sometimes there is - but deadlines shouldn’t be missed consistently), there need to be repercussions. State them beforehand, in the interest of clarity and fairness.

, This one is pretty straightforward. One employee’s productivity is not your other co-workers’ business. If an employee’s laziness is affecting others’ working environment, they already know about it. It’s in everyone’s best interest to address the employee directly.Further, gossip and complaints are unprofessional, and can lead to misunderstandings, and even conflict.
If you need to talk to another employee about a certain employee’s productivity, preface the conversation by saying something like, “I was hoping I could ask you some questions as your manager, and that you might be able to give me some neutral, objective insights and keep this conversation between us.”

, Firing people can be one of the worst parts about managing other people. That said, if an employee is intentionally and consciously avoiding things they are responsible for, it may be time to let them go. Even if you have developed a personal relationship with them, remind yourself that your own and others’ livelihoods - and workplace comfort - are undermined by an employee that is not willing to pull their weight."

Follow the usual progression of warnings.,
Follow the organization's code.,
Gather information about the issue.,
Talk with the employee.,
Determine if it is your duty to issue or write the warning.,
Include the necessary information.,
Be as specific as possible.,
Deliver the written warning in person.,
Make sure the employee understands the warning.",How to Know When to Give an Employee a Written Warning," Warnings that are issued to an employee are generally issued following a certain progression or escalation. By sticking to the progression you can help the employee understand exactly what level of discipline they are currently receiving and just how serious the issue is. Review the following progression of employee warnings to learn if it is time for a written warning:Verbal warning
Written warning
Final written warning
Termination of the employee.;
, Before you issue the written warning to an employee you will want to consult your organization's disciplinary code. Make sure that the code agrees with your decision to issue a written warning. Match the severity of the issue to the disciplinary code that your organization uses before you submit your written warning.Some issues may not be very serious or are a first time occurrence with that employee. These may require a simple verbal warning.
Other issues may be quite serious and could warrant a written warning, bypassing the verbal warning. These might include theft or threats of violence.

, Before you create a written warning you will need to collect all the relevant information regarding the employee and the issue at hand. Collecting this information will allow you to judge if the written warning is appropriate as well as allow you to write a detailed and effective warning.


Learn the dates and times of any employee infractions.
Detail any conversations or previous verbal warnings about this issue.
Collect old documents which the employee signed, documenting their acceptance to company terms and illustrating their violation of them.

, Before you complete and issue your written warning you will want to speak privately with the employee in question. This meeting will allow you to further understand the situation and accurately judge if the next step is to issue a written warning to the employee.The conversation may reveal that the issue was a misunderstanding and no further action is needed.
You may be able to collect more information about the incident, allowing you to better issue your written warning should it be necessary.

, In larger organizations it may be unclear as to who should be the one to deliver the written warning, especially if the employee has more than one supervisor or manager. Make sure that it is company policy that you are the one required to write or deliver the warning to the employee.Generally, the direct supervisor will issue the letter.
In some cases, the decision to issue the written warning may be decided by a group meeting.

, Although requirements may vary amongst organizations, there are some common elements that you will want to include in your written warning. Review the following points of information to build an informative and effective written warning:Include the names of any parties involved.
The nature of the offense.
The date and time the offense occurred.
Details of the warning and the time period involved in the warning.
Instructions for the employee regarding how to remedy the situation.
Consequences of this infraction as well as the consequences of future issues.

, When you are writing your warning you will need to be as specific and detailed as possible. Including clear and concise details in your warning will help convey the exact issue at hand and allow your employee to better make corrections and avoid further offenses in the future.


Include clear statements that describe the issue at hand. For example ""On June 23rd, you were reported as having been involved in a physical altercation with another employee"".
Warnings should make clear what will happen if the employee's behavior is not corrected. For example ""If another infraction occurs, we will issue only one final warning before termination.""

, Although the warning is written, you won't be sending it through company mail or email. Delivering a written warning will need to be done in person, during a private meeting with the employee in question. This will allow for direct conversation between both parties and a clear communication of the issue at hand.Make the meeting for the earliest date available.
Give some positive feedback as well. Don't just focus on the negative during the meeting.

, Once you have written the warning and delivered it to the employee, you will want to make sure that the employee understands the warning. Discuss the terms of the warning, the duration it will last, why they are receiving it and how they can work to correct their course of action in the future.


Most written warnings will have a place for signatures. Have your employee sign the warning, declaring that they understood and agree with it.Allow the employee the right to dispute the claim as well. Some information may not be correct and they should have the right to question the warning.

Find your employee a 'battle buddy'.,Remember, anything that requires an arrangement in a strict order, such as the alphabet, may pose a problem to an otherwise competent member of staff, so just a few hours' help from an assistant now and then can make all the difference.",How to Support an Employee with Dyslexia," The reason dyslexia is sometimes referred to as 'word blindness' is that they can find text-based instructions, be they handwritten or otherwise, difficult to comprehend. Therefore, the employee may prefer instructions to be given verbally, face-to-face, or by telephone.;
,


If using a PC to provide written communications to a dyslexic, such as by email or a text produced by Microsoft Word, keep things simple. Avoid writing in BLOCK CAPITALS, italics, and underlining, as these disrupt the shape of words. Use bold for emphasis instead.
Take care as to the font you use. Verdana and Tahoma are acceptable, as is any font which uses rounded, evenly-spaced lettering that is distinctive and easy to tell apart. A simple test is by checking how the word 'ill' appears if you use a capital 'I' - if it looks like the number between 110 and 112, perhaps try a different font! , Some of these, such as Open Dyslexic, are open-sourced and free to download. , As long as you write evenly and remember to dot the i's and cross the t's, your employee should be able to understand your writing. The shape of each letter is important to a dyslexic, so ensure a letter with a tail, such as 'g' or 'y' gets its tail!

,


As well as encountering problems with reading, writing can also cause a dyslexic trouble. Gel pens, which leave a thicker text than ordinary biro pens, can help, as can pen grips, which allow the employee greater control over their writing.
The traditional black text on white paper style of writing is problematic, as the whiteness can dazzle a dyslexic and overwhelm the text. Softer tones, such as yellow, pink or light blue, are preferable, so order a supply of paper in these colours. If white paper must be used, then matte is a better option than gloss. If using a computer, try to provide some form of tinted screen, or word processor software that gives other background options than white.

, This device converts speech into text via a microphone plugged into a PC. This is particularly useful if the employee is in a role which involves letter-writing.

, A dyslexic employee may have difficulties in structuring a task, especially if a number of different tasks are expected of the employee.

,, Keeping your work area tidy seems easy enough to many people, but this can be beyond the reach of a dyslexic employee, for who arranging things in order can be a struggle.

, An assistant, in the form an existing employee, can make things easier in a number of ways. These can range from ensuring a folder of notes is in correct alphabetical order or making sure a fax is sent correctly, to tidying a store cupboard or putting together a pack to be issued to a client.

Think about whether the employee asks for help.,
Consider whether this person can find each person’s unique talents & delegate tasks when needed.,
Think about whether this employee sets realistic goals and clear expectations.,
Look for the ability to help other colleagues and juniors when needed.,
Pick someone who holds themselves accountable and doesn’t blame others.,
Consider whether this employee has the ability to inspire others.,
Think about whether the employee looks at the big picture.,
Look for an employee who makes professional development a priority.,
Ask yourself whether the employee is flexible with their time.,
Look for the ability to recognizes effort in others.,
Understand the benefits of considering existing employees for managerial positions.There are definitely some advantages to promoting from within the company, rather than hiring a new boss.,
Help the employee with a career development plan.,
Encourage the employee to continue to learn and improve.",How to Tell if an Employee Will Be a Good Boss," An employee who would potentially make a good boss should be self-driven but shouldn’t mind asking for help either.


Though this person can easily manage things on his or her own, he or she should be open enough to seek advice or comments from other colleagues or team members.
If the person doesn’t ask for help, it signals that this person is unlikely to reach out to staff for support, which is a poor quality in a potential boss.;
, A good potential boss will recognize which tasks to do on their own and which to delegate. These delegation skills show that the employee will be able to assign responsibilities and possesses the capacity to balance both operational and strategic areas of business.


This also shows that the employee closely observes each person’s unique talents and talks about which job aspects they enjoy the most. When the person understands each employee’s life, he or she is sympathetic and can successfully manage assignments and time allocations. In doing so, the person makes employees feel that he or she cares.
If the person doesn’t delegate, this indicates he or she might feel reluctant to work in teams and socialize with other colleagues. And if the person is unable to identify talent and assign other employees to the right task, this shows the he or she is not making a personal investment in discussing their employees’ goals and helping them achieve their ambitions.

, If the individual is capable of identifying opportunities and prioritizing them from both an employee and management perspective, then the person shows potential for being a good boss.


This shows that the person discusses performance goals and sets clear expectations which allows others employees to achieve them.
When the person regularly gives clear instructions and sets realistic timelines for subordinates or other co-workers,, he or she is sure to perform well in the role of boss.

, People feeling ignored by their boss in the workplace is one of the main reasons behind low employee engagement and high staff turnover.


Therefore, the employee who lends a helping hand to other co-workers is definitely manager material. It shows that the employee understands the challenges others face.
If the employee doesn’t help others in addition to his or her own tasks, this indicates that he or she is not able to think beyond their own work.

, As a responsible employee, he or she doesn’t look away if things go wrong but has the courage to take ownership for their mistakes.


When things go terribly wrong with a project or people in the workplace, he or she is the first one to figure things out and take action, without wasting time on assigning blame to others.
If the employee doesn’t embrace mistakes, this signals that he or she is less likely to take steps to streamline workplace issues and solve problems in an efficient manner, making them unsuitable for a managerial position.

, The employee who inspires others, irrespective of his or her position or title, will definitely be a good boss. If an employee can inspire others, it shows that such an employee is highly passionate for the workplace and is ready to use his or her leadership qualities to foster business growth.

, The employee who not only meets daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly targets, but also keeps the overall mission of the company in mind at all times is usually the one nominated for promotions.


This is a rock star employee that frequently exceeds expectations and creates short-term goals; that helps other staff members move closer to progressively accomplishing the company’s overall strategy.
If an employee is not able to see the big picture but only focuses on dealing with the tasks at hand, the person is less likely to be successful as a future boss.

, A successful potential boss knows every bit of his or her job and understands where and when development is required. This person takes initiative to ensure both personal and professional development.


Employee who pay attention to improving their skills are strong candidates for management positions because their skill development effort contributes to achieving business goals in the long run. They are self-starters and always keep professional development a priority.
If an employee doesn’t demonstrate the urge to improve at a professional level, he or she should probably not be considered for promotion.

, Employees who are ready to give up more of their time (on top of normal work day hours) when demanded by the company should be considered for promotion.


This doesn’t mean that the employees stay late every day, but only when there is a crucial need to meet business goals.
When an employee consistently dedicates additional time to business endeavors when help is needed, without complaint, this person should be regarded as a good future boss.

, An employee possesses the quality of a good boss if he or she doesn’t wait until the formal performance review to give feedback.


In addition to this, he or she doesn’t focus on negative feedback, but provides positive reinforcement. The person understands that their subordinates and coworkers thrive on recognition, so they ensure that the efforts of others are recognized and rewarded. .
When the employee creates an environment based on trust, respect, creativity and encouraging feedback, subordinates and other co-workers are likely to grow. This is an excellent quality for a potential boss to possess.

, These include:


External hires are usually paid more and they are more likely to get laid off than those promoted from within.
Internal employees tend to have existing relationships with bosses, which is key in getting work done efficiently. People hired from outside the company usually take more time to find their way.
Since people already working within a company tend to become good at what they do, you may genuinely wish to reward them with a promotion.
It’s easier to analyze current employees on a day-to day basis and test their managerial potential through challenging assignments.

, Once you identify promising managerial qualities in an employee, you should consider assigning them more responsibilities through a career development plan.


This will not only make the employee ready to perform as a good boss in future, but will also allow you to assess their abilities even further.
Maintain a consistent feedback loop, so the employee can use your feedback and constructive criticism to create a personal and professional development plan.

, It should be noted that employees are not always born with innate leadership qualities, so you should make an effort to foster leadership skills in employees you believe have a lot of potential.


Be patient - people have to learn the craft of being a good boss, so you should encourage your most promising employees to continually improve themselves through training, seminars, reading inspirational books and using other tools for self-assessment.

Be as succinct as possible without sacrificing necessary details. Your audience may be pressed for time. Try to convey your message in a couple of sentences or bullet points instead of lengthy paragraphs.If you are publishing a book, for example, list significant information such as “book tour slated to begin in September” and ""holiday sales expected to increase by 15%"" in bullet points so that the key information is obvious to the reader.

"
Begin with an end in mind (the ""what"").,
Know why a particular product or service is important for your client and may be for your client's clients (the ""why"").,
Know who are other key stakeholders in the project (the ""who"").,
Take a deep breath - it's time for the ""how"".,
Consider the ""where"" next.,
Consider the ""when"" of your project.",How to Write a Project Scope," Out of the seven habits as Stephen Covey described in his all time classic book ""Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"", this habit is absolutely key to success of any project. As you work with your stakeholders, ask very pointed questions about ""what their product or service is expected to bring to the market or the organization?"". Know the outcome and its planned benefits. This is the critical milestone your project will aim to achieve.


For example: Let's assume that in response to your ""what"" question, your client told you that they are looking to roll out a web-based software to sell widgets online, with potential customer base in North America and Europe. Through out this article we will continue with this example.;
, ""Why"" you might ask... well, if you know the answer to this question, then you can draft the scope in a way that will ultimately influence the design of the product.


Continuing with the example taken above, in your discovery session you figured out that the customers of your client are multi-national organizations with foot-prints spanning across two continents. Your client is a major supplier of those widgets for them. In order to streamline their supply chain management and reducing cost while enhancing the customer satisfaction, it is important for your client to move their business online. Order acquisition, order processing and payment collection all these aspects will drive their cost reduction strategy. Once you know this level of detail, you gained additional understanding of the scope that the end product should have a user interface for order capture and receipt of the payments, it will also become clearer that since user base is spread across continents, you may need to care for additional language on the front-end tool and currency conversion when processing payments.


Do you see how important it is to capture these facts in your scope to ultimately influence the design?

, Stakeholder by definition, is an individual or an organization who has a vested interest in the project; in other words, the existence of the project will have an impact on their day-to-day business and potentially profitability. A few examples of stakeholders in the example we have taken may be end users, back office order processing unit, a shipping company who will deliver the widgets, a third party payment processor, the finance unit of your client organization who may look for very clear metrics and reporting of orders etc. How does it impact scope? As you assess different user bases of the application your client is looking to build, you will realize that the application is going to touch a lot more areas of your client's organization over and above the primary customers. You will also note that there are back office processing requirements. Since there are external payment processors involved you will need to include connectivity, networking and payment gateway requirements in your scope. Missing one of the key stakeholders can have a significant impact on the success of the project.

, How you are going to approach the project is the question you will end up spending most of your time during discovery session. Answering ""How"" will bring you closest to the design and might make you feel like you are stepping outside of your ""comfort zone"", but that's not the case. It is important to know about ""how"" of the product delivery at a high level because when you gathered information on the ""what"", ""why"" and ""who"", you documented part of scope. however, say one of the customers is in a country where credit cards processing is not widely accepted or have substantial amount of chargeback if paid thru credit cards. Obviously this may not make financial sense for your client.


At this point, your role is not to identify what the alternative payment processing solution may be, rather it will be important for you to note that an alternative payment processing method will be essential for the success of the project and that is the direct impact on the scope of the project.

, One of the key success factors for any project is its location strategy. Where is the project going to be developed? Where are the supporting systems going to be held? Where will the back office operations such as order processing, packaging, accounting etc. located? What about any customer service center? From a scope perspective, it is important to know the ""where""  because it could impact strategic partnerships your client may need to establish to hire talent and management staff for an ongoing business. Your project plan is not complete until a capacity plan is complete and human capital pool is identified. Inclusion of ""where"" in scope is the foundation for a project plan that will likely have a successful impact.

, If there is one question your client is very eager about is ""when"" will this project be delivered. The scope you define based on your discovery has a direct impact on when can it come to fruition. Alternatively, you can ask your client ""when"" do they want it delivered. Sounds contradictory however, if you know with what level of urgency your client is pursuing the delivery of the project, you will be better positioned to negotiate the scope itself.


Going back to the example, during answering ""what"" your client mentioned customers will be in North America and Europe. one of the things you are asked to include is multi language support in the front-end tool. Then the client turns around and demands the project be delivered in six months. You might say that it is possible however, you recommend reducing ""project scope"" to English only in the first cut and in subsequent rollout you will introduce other language support. Answering to ""when"" is the key to adjusting project scope either to include more or less than what client is asking for. It is also a great way to manage your clientele expectations and positively impact their bottom line.

Open-ended questions are also a good way for you to find out some basic qualifications of the candidate, and to get some cues as to what to ask next.
Try for questions like: “Tell me about the relationships you’ve had with the people you’ve worked with. How would you describe the best ones? The worst?” This question will immediately give you a good idea of well the candidate might fit on a team in your workplace. Candidates typically don’t like to speak badly about coworkers or bosses, especially in an interview. This question lets you see how this person navigates those waters.

, You want to make sure that your interviewee did homework and learned about your company. And you should want to find out if this person just learned facts, or really understands you.


Questions that ask the candidate to visualize being in the role of an existing employee will quickly show you how well this person knows your company. You might ask “Pitch to me as if I were buying your product or service.” This question will immediately show you how well this candidate knows what you do and if this person has the ability to speak with the company’s voice. Depending on the position you’re hiring for, be lenient on how well the candidate pitches your company. If you’re hiring for an internal, non sales position, all you want to know is if your candidate did the homework.
You could also ask “If we were to sit down a year from now, reflecting on your year with the company, what would you like to have achieved?” A question like this will allow you to gauge how well the candidate sees the bigger picture of the work you do, and that this person has not only done the homework, but is committed to being a part of the company. A question like this will help weed out candidates who just read the job description.

, Repeating what the candidate just said will give you a second to digest the information and can allow you to press this person with your next question.


You want to find out of the interviewee is actually knowledgable on the subject at hand. For instance, if a candidate said “I managed a large system implementation project when I was with my last company.” You could repeat the answer and move on to your next question which will both follow up and get more information about how this candidate would perform in your company.
After you repeat the answer (you shouldn’t just repeat it word for word, paraphrase it) you could as ask “Could you tell me some of the key activities you were engaged in when you managed that project? And how do you think that experience would relate to this job?”

, During your interview, you’ll want to gauge how well a person’s resume translates to real life. Have a list of questions that will give you an idea of the candidate’s basic skill level for the job.


Ask the candidate to describe some basic responsibilities and functions of the job. Ask what the candidate might find challenging about the job. You want to have a list of basic questions that have a correct answer.
For example, if your candidate listed Adobe Photoshop as a skill, you may ask how long this person has been using Photoshop. Or, if you know Photoshop and know that using it is part of the job, you may ask a specific question related to using the program. You might ask “If I needed to create a banner and wanted to place a picture of someone’s body from another photo onto the banner, how would I do that?” If the candidate can clearly explain the process and use the right terms, you know this person possess a certain skill level.

, You want to formulate questions that will allow you to see how the candidate performs under pressure and give you information on this person’s ability in the role.


You may want to ask something simple yet potentially challenging at first like “Is it better to be perfect and late, or good and on time?” The candidate’s answer will show you what kind of employee this person is. It will also show you how well the candidate knows your company, depending on your answer to the question. Ask the candidate about a time this person screwed up, and how the candidate fixed the problem. This is an old and good interview question. You’ll get to see how self-aware the candidate is and this person's problem-solving skills.

, Test soft skills. You’ll want to know about a candidate’s personality, dedication, loyalty, communication skills, etc. These are the so called “soft skills” for the job.


When writing interview questions, you’ll want to create your questions so that there’s an ebb and flow to the interview. Your first questions are meant to ease the candidate into the interview and allow you to gain knowledge on this person’s history. Then you want to have questions that tell you about a candidate’s actual skill level for the job. Now you’ll want to ease back up. write down a few questions to pick from during the interview that allows you to see this person’s personality.
Feel free to have a list of questions to pick from that don’t even have much to do with the actual job. You could ask “Who is the smartest person you know personally? Why?” A question like this will test the candidate’s values and aspirations. Having the candidate explain why the person is so smart will give you an idea of how this person perceives others.
Ask the candidate “What is something you’d be happy doing every day for the rest of your career?” This will let you find out what makes this person happy at work. If the answer is boilerplate you know that this person isn’t going to be very happy. If the answer is thought out and applies to the job, you know you could have someone who would be loyal to you.
Consider asking “If you worked with us, were paid the salary you wanted, and loved everything about your job, what kind of offer from another company would you consider?” This question will give you insight into what the candidate values. Depending on the answer you’ll know if the candidate can be bought. Or if this person values loving the work and the company.

, Depending on the answers to previous questions, you may have good knowledge of the candidate’s past experiences. But it’s a good idea to write a few questions you can throw in to find out a little more.


You may ask the candidate to “Discuss a specific accomplishment you’ve achieved in a previous position that indicates you’ll thrive in this position.” Someone’s past performance will be a good indicator of future success with you.
Ask the candidate about a time when this person succeeded professionally but didn’t like the experience and wouldn’t want to do it again. This kind of question will let you know how the candidate will act when getting the job done isn’t always fun. And it will let you see if this person understands the value of certain roles or functions.

, When writing interview questions, plan to leave time at the end to let the interviewee ask questions.


The questions a candidate asks will be very valuable. These questions will show you how much this person has prepared and how this person views the role of the job.
During the actual interview always make sure to thank the interviewee. Then explain your next steps and when you’ll be in touch.

”Why did you feel like you would never reach your goal?” “What motivated you to keep trying when you hit speed bumps?” “How do you feel about that experience now?”

, Look at the questions you plan to ask. How many are the same or too similar? If you notice that you’re writing a lot of the same questions, you may want to search for one that’s different.


Your curve ball question doesn’t have to be an attacking question on your subject. It can be as simple as a fun unrelated question like “What’s your favorite indulgence food to eat when you’ve had a bad day?”

, Look over all of your questions and rephrase ones that still need a little work, or that don’t help you reach your objective.


During an actual interview rely on these questions to guide you, but don’t feel like you have to ask each one word for word. Let the flow of the conversation help you form your questions. Use the ones you’ve written as much as you can, but be prepared to ignore some that become irrelevant.

Send your letter out.",How to Write a Job Justification," Before you start writing the letter, make sure you have a way to define the position you're outlining. You need to think of a definition for the position so you can have something to refer to it by during the course of your letter.


Think about the function of the job. Do you need someone to proofread articles for a magazine you're writing? That person could be called an editor or a copywriter.
How much responsibility will this person have? If they will be answering to a higher up editor in the department, maybe the position title could be Junior Copywriter.;
, You want to make sure you know your facts before writing a business proposal. You'll have to include certain specifics, like a budget and salary, in order to make the proposal realistic and informative.


Make sure you can justify why this position is necessary. You may, for instance, feel that establishing this job will help the company cut costs. Let's return to the Junior Copywriter position. If your company hires a great deal of freelance writers, and pays them by the hour, they may have to edit their own work. If your company had a copywriter, whose salary was slightly less than a freelance writer, writers would not work as long. But don't stop there: there are other justifications besides cost. This may include a lower cycle time so that articles appear in print faster, higher quality by ensuring proper grammar and content, etc.
Figure out a fair salary. Whether you're outlining a job for yourself or someone else, you want to make sure the salary you propose is reasonable. Spend some time researching the average salaries for similar positions. Keep in mind starter salaries are low, so you can aim to propose a salary or pay rate on the lower side of average.
Review your company's budget. You want to know how this position will be paid for. If the positions eliminates some costs, estimate how much money will be saved. You can put that money into a budget for the new position. You can also find areas where your company has excess money, which they may occasionally put towards new job openings. See if you can use some of this money to fund a new position.

, You want to make sure you format a job proposal like a business letter. This will keep things looking professional, increasing your chance of having your proposal accepted.Pick a letterhead. If you're writing a justification for yourself, you should use the same letterhead you use for your resume. This will keep things consistent when submitting your materials.If you're writing a justification for a position within your own company, use the letterheads typically used for office memos and other business related writing.
At the top righthand corner of your letter, write your name, your address, the date, the address of the business, and the name of the letter's recipient.
Make sure you choose a proper salutation. If you're addressing a group of people, you can address all of them by their appropriate name and title and then add a colon. For example, ""Dear Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Fox:""

, When opening your job justification, the first thing you want to do is show how it will benefit the company. Those reading the proposal are primarily interested in the wellbeing of a company. If they don't see how this position benefits them, they'll lose interest. Get to the benefits right away when writing a job justification.You can start by identifying an inefficiency or problem in the company that may need a solution. The consequences of the problem should be spelled out in detail, whether these are higher costs, poor quality product, etc. If there's a role you know needs filling, for example, you can point that out right away. You can also use some research here to backup your claims.
Let's look at another example. Say your company has a lot of data entry to do for an upcoming event. Those working in customer service have been doing data entry in their spare time, but given their other responsibilities there have been a lot of errors and the process is moving slowly. Point out that the data entry would get done quicker and more accurately with a specific individual responsible for the job. Also, keep cost in mind. Your boss is probably interested in cost effective changes. Note the customer service reps have been putting in a lot of overtime hours, and the cost of a temporary new employee would be much less than paying so much in overtime.
In the above example, you can do research on concentration. You may find some studies that say people work more efficiently and accurately when they concentrate on one task at a time.

, From here, describe the potential job in great detail. This is where you'll be using the title you came up with earlier. Outline what exactly the job entails and what kind of person would be ideal for the role.


List what tasks the job requires, and what kind of skill set is necessary. You should also outline if the job is fulltime or part time and how it pays. You may want to include a brief profile of the type of person you're looking to hire.
For example, ""I propose we hire a part time data entry specialist to help with this workload. We need someone who's well-organized, pays close attention to detail, and has preferably had some data entry experience. This job would be great for a college student with a somewhat flexible schedule. We could pay this new employee an hourly rate, somewhere in the range of $10 to $13 an hour.""

, You may be writing a job proposal for yourself. If you've been working in a company for years, you may be volunteering to oversee a new project. You may also be applying from the outside. Sometimes, you can help yourself stand out by proposing a new job for a company for which you believe you'd be the ideal candidate.List your experience. Talk about what your background is, briefly overviewing your education and career experience. This is similar to a cover letter. Only include experience relevant for the job you're proposing. If you're proposing to do market research for a non-profit, definitely talk about your marketing internship for a local refugee center in college. However, it's probably unnecessary to disclose that you waited tables over the summer, unless the skills learned apply to the proposed job.
You should also list any specific awards or achievements. This can be particularly helpful for an academic job. For example, if you're proposing you teach a new art history class at a university, you might want to mention any articles you've had published, grants you've received, or other honors you've obtained.

, You want to make sure you convey you've done your research. People are likely to dismiss a proposal that does not seem well conceived. Outline how much the position will pay and point out how the company would afford these costs.


Ideally, some of the costs should come from the money saved. If a chunk of overtime pay is no longer being given to customer service representatives, some of that money could go towards paying a new employee. A part-time employee at an hourly rate will cost much less overall than multiple full-time salaried employees receiving overtime pay. Make sure you clearly quantify just how much money they would be saving with this change.
Try to focus more on how much money your company will save, in addition to non-financial benefits. Using the above example, you could write something like, ""Not only will this change save our company an estimated $2,123 a month, I believe it will boost morale. Without the stress of data entry, customer service reps will have more downtime. This will allow them to be more upbeat with customers. Less stress and higher job satisfaction leads to a better performance.""

, You want to leave the readers of your letter feeling enthusiastic about the new position. End your letter with a call to action, encouraging employers to create this new position.Reiterate the points you made previously. In a few sentences, wrap up the main benefits of the position and talk about how it's necessary for the company.
Talk about how you'll be in touch. Say you'll call later in the week to follow up, for example, or request a business meeting with your boss to further discuss the position.

, You want to make sure you write a few drafts of your proposal. After writing the initial draft, set it aside for a few days. Then, look it over after you've had time to think. Rewrite the letter, adding in any new information or insights you thought of. If you have time, try to write at least a few drafts of your justification.

, You should not turn in a job justification with typos. Proofread the letter a few times, making sure it's free of spelling and grammatical errors. It can be difficult to catch your own typos, but there are some tips and tricks that can help.Give yourself some time. You're more likely to catch typos if you set your work aside for a few days. If you don't have a few days, try setting it aside for an hour and then rereading.
Print out your letter. Changing the format from which you're reading can help you better check typos. If you don't have a printer, consider changing the font type or color. You can also try reading your letter from the last paragraph to the first.
Force yourself to reach each word by placing the tip of a pencil against the screen or page. Reading your letter out loud can also help you focus on each word.

, A second set of eyes can catch typos you may miss. People often go ""typo blind"" when reading their work, meaning they miss their own errors as they read what was written in their head. Having a friend read your letter over can help you catch typos., Once your letter is professional and polished, send it out. Make sure you send it out the proper way. If your company uses wooden cubicles for physical mail, print it out and put it in the cubicle. If your company prefers e-mail attachments, e-mail the letter to your boss.

Understand the reasons for contracting with an engineer, rather than hiring.,
Keep 3 important things in mind: budget, scope and schedule.,
Communicate frequently and personally.,
Address staffing concerns immediately.,
Be a leader.,
Ask questions.,
Give constructive criticism.,
Create a trusting environment.,
Address problems immediately.",How to Work Effectively With Consulting Engineers," There are some inherent frustrations caused by working with someone who is new to your organization and works independently. However, if you are also aware of the advantages, you may find it easier to deal with the disadvantages.


Consulting engineers are hired and paid for delivering a completed project. An engineer will have greater incentive to complete a project within a specified length of time. These engineers are especially motivated to deliver quality work.
Consulting engineers bring fresh ideas and experience into the equation. Studies have shown that changing teams and infusing a company with new talent can make them solve problems more productively. Your consulting engineer may have different ideas than the company generally uses, and that might be a good thing.
Engineering consultants are often experts in their field. An engineer who works by contract must be organized, excellent at problem solving and have a good track record.
You don't have the overhead required for employees. Consulting engineers are paid according to their bids based on the project scope. They usually require payments at intervals decided by their contract, which don't include the overhead costs a regular employee would produce.;
, These things should be outlined in the contract. Before you communicate with a consulting engineer about a new aspect of a project, ask if you are changing 1 of these variables.


The budget for the project should be set and discussed with the engineer. You should outline a process to approve additional costs.
The scope of the project is the definitions within which the engineer must act. Read the contract and the project descriptions before working with the consulting engineer, so you know what fits into the scope of the project and what does not. For example, your company might be working on a project to create a parking structure. If lighting the street is not within the scope of the project, the engineer should not be asked to undertake it without additional expense.
Create a schedule together. Someone from the organization and the engineer should sit down and write up a schedule that both sides can agree on. When there are changes in budget and scope, this is also likely to affect the schedule. There should be milestones, periods of review and progress reports included in your schedule.

, Do not abide by the same communication rules most employees use, where email is the only mode of discussion. Consultants often have more than 1 project, so you should call the engineer when you need to speak, in order to be more efficient and let them know you have something to discuss.


Poor communication is 1 of the main complaints people have with engineers. Text and email communications are easily ignored and misconstrued. Phone and in-person meetings are the best way to address important topics because there is less of a risk of misunderstanding.
Request and review progress reports at regular intervals. You should ask for a short update from the person every week, 2 weeks or month. You can review the scope, budget and schedule at milestones once you have a feeling for changes in the project from these reports.

, Create a staffing plan for larger projects with your consultant. Some engineers do not have a large staff, so you should ensure that they can cover the hiring of new employees.

, Make your importance on the project known, if you are the main contact. It is your job to come forward, suggest ways to meet, communicate and work together effectively, since this person has most likely had contact with many different people in the company.

, Since you come from different environments, you should not assume anything. Don't allow anything to be left up in the air concerning the project, dates or budget.

, It is normal to ask consulting engineers to revise something; however, it is your job to deliver this news in a professional manner. Establish what you like about it and what changes you would like to see without using personal digs or suggesting someone is at fault.

, Respect the person and be professional and courteous so that you get respect in return. If there is a problem, figure out a way to address it together, rather than blaming that person for your sake.

, You may not be working in the same environment or on the same schedule, so always communicate as soon as you notice a problem. They should be dealt with early, before too much time and money is spent with problematic work.

List the necessary experience and qualifications.,

Post the ad.",How to Write an Ad for a Job," A job analysis entails figuring out exactly what you need for the job you're posting. You'll have to decide what duties the job involve. Doing so will ensure you can write an effective ad that attracts the kind of applican'ts you're looking for.Why does this job exist? What makes you think that you need someone to fill this position? Sometimes companies who don't do a proper analysis like this can actually end up hiring someone they don't need, which will cause problems.Think about the physical and mental requirements the job entails. Is there heavy lifting, or is it more of a sedentary position?What sorts of skills are required to carry out those tasks? If the job has a lot of physical tasks, you'll be looking for a different applican't than you'd want for a desk position.
What qualifications will be needed? Will your applican't require a particular college degree, or just a high school diploma?
If you're not sure what a particular job entails, try asking people from different companies who do similar jobs., After you do a job analysis and figure out exactly what a job entails, then you need to decide who your ideal choice for this position would be. Doing so will help you decide where to post the ad, how to write it to attract your ideal candidate, and recognize that candidate when he or she enters the room.Everyone's ideal candidate will be different and based on the particular job. To come up with a picture of your ideal candidate, pay close attention to your job analysis. For example, if you're hiring a sales representative, you'll want someone with great interpersonal skills and speaking ability.

, An understated part of a job posting is coming up with a title, but it's very important. This is the first thing candidates will see, and it will decide whether they click on a posting or pass it over. You need to come up with an effective job title to have a successful ad.Pick a title that is a good description of the job, but also not weighed down with jargon or useless words. For example, ""Entry-Level Architect"" is a simple title that tells applican'ts exactly what they need to know.
Use generic words. While you might catch some people's eye by being creative, this hurts the visibility of your job. Using uncommon words or phrases in your title will mean that your job will show up lower on the list of search engines. Job seekers will be using more generic words to search.

, Even if you don't put this information on the job posting, you'll need an idea of what you're going to pay the applican't you choose. There are a number of things that go into setting a salary for your employees.What can you afford to pay the person? If your yearly revenue is $100,000, you can't afford to pay a new employee $70,000 annually. Use your budget to figure out what's in the affordable range for you.
Will you pay per hour, or is this a salary position?
How much will this new position increase your revenue? For example, if you hire a great sales representative, your revenue could go up a lot. In this case, you can offer a higher pay rate because the person will bring in a lot of money.
How skilled is this position? Is it a position that requires a lot of skill, or can you replace the person easily? Higher skilled positions usually demand more compensation.
If you're having trouble, you could use a site like PayScale to find out what the average pay for certain jobs are.

, Hopefully you've already come up with a good job title that will catch a candidate's eye while still being easy to find. Once you've done so, then you'll put this at the top of your ad, as well as in the subject line of the posting. , Most job hunters will scan ads quickly before deciding if they want to read more carefully, and big blocks of wording might cause some to pass over a posting. Make your ad easier on the eye by breaking it down into different sections with subheadings. This will help job hunters navigate the ad quickly and know if they are a good fit for the position. Some good headings to use are:Job Description.
Duties.
Qualifications.
Experience.
Application Process.

, Using the job analysis you performed, describe exactly what the job entails. This isn't just a simple summary of the job. A good job description will weed out unqualified candidates and attract qualified ones.Give the location of the workplace.
List the tasks that the employee will be expected to perform.
While qualifications can go later in the ad, you can still get across the level of skill you want in the job description. For example, buzz words like ""experienced"" and ""highly skilled"" will demonstrate that you're looking for a candidate with a certain degree of expertise.
Finally, remember that this job posting is an advertisement. That means you should make the right applican'ts want to apply. Give a sentence or two about how the atmosphere at this job is great, the workplace is friendly, and any other positive aspects of the job.

, In preparing to write your ad, you should have come up with what your ideal candidate would be. This is where you'll lay out those qualities and write the level of skill and experience ideal applican'ts will have. Be specific here: this section will weed out unqualified candidates, and hopefully cut down on the amount of time you spend rejected unfit applican'ts.Include the level of education the job requires, and the specific degree, if any.
Say if you require prior experience or training. For example, saying that you won't consider applican'ts without at least 3 years of experience will ensure you don't have to review inexperienced candidates.
You could list personal qualities here like speaking and personal skills. Keep in mind, however, that applican'ts could easily say that they have these traits in a cover letter and then try to fake them in an interview. Beware of this if you put personality traits in this section., After the job description and qualifications, other information may or may not be necessary, depending on the job. Some popular information to include in job postings is:Pay or salary range. Some may opt to say ""Compensation based on experience"" if they haven't finalized a pay range.
Whether this is a part time or full time position.
Whether or not this position includes the potential for promotion.

, Different jobs may have different application processes, and you should include instructions for applying. You may want a resume emailed to you with a specific subject line in the email. Whatever the process, include it so applican'ts can easily reach you.

, Like with any piece of writing, your ad should be carefully reviewed and proofread before you post it. Any spelling or grammar errors will make your company look unprofessional, and could discourage more qualified candidates from applying. You should also have at least one other person read it to make sure it's an effective ad., After putting the ad together, it's time to post it. Where you specifically post the ad might depend on who your ideal candidate is, so keep the following in mind when posting the ad.More general sites like Craigslist usually have less skilled and specialized jobs posted.
Sites like Monster or Indeed also have general postings, but also more specialized ones.
For highly skilled jobs, you might want to look into professional periodicals or websites. For example, postings for history professors are usually placed on the American Historical Association's website.
You could also use LinkedIn to advertise your job. This way, you can see people's qualifications right off the bat.

Start with the title.,
Introduce your company.,
Describe the role.,
Outline the intern’s responsibilities.,
State any necessary qualifications.,
Describe the required skills.,
Highlight any required experience.,
Provide essential information.,
Sell your company.,
Explain the benefits for the intern.,
Outline the application and selection procedure.",How to Write a Job Description for an Intern," The first thing on the job description for an internship should be the title of the position. Try to be specific to ensure that you attract people with the appropriate skills and interests. For example, you may be looking for a Marketing Intern, a Research Intern, or an Administrative Intern.In most instances you will not need to be more specific than this, as an intern is likely to work across a department.
Try to give some detail in the title, rather than just advertising for an Intern.
When people scans websites or sign up for email alerts they will often focus their search to their field of interest, so having this focus can improve the response.;
, Under the title you should include a few sentences that give a picture of your company. Briefly outline your company’s purpose and aims in a way which will draw in potential applicants.Summarise what your company does on a day-to-day basis. For example, you might write:


“Our company has a proud tradition of developing new technologies in renewable energy. We are an innovative firm looking to create new solutions to our energy needs. We have customers across the world and are keen to help develop young talent.”

, Next you need to give a brief description of the role you are advertising. This should just be a short paragraph that summarizes the sort of tasks the intern will be working on. This need only be a few sentences, but should cover the primary functions and give an idea of the general purpose of the internship.


For example, a description for a marketing intern might say you are seeking “a dynamic individual able to work on their own initiative across a small marketing department. The intern will assist in the production and distribution of promotional material and increase our presence on social media.”A photography intern description might say “photography intern sought to assist staff covering numerous events. The intern will work alongside senior staff in the office and on location.”, The section on the specific tasks and responsibilities of the intern is the most important part of the job description. Here you will precisely detail what the intern will be doing. Write a list of tasks in bullet points. It is common to put the most important, or the thing the intern will spend most of her time doing, at the top. Use active language and be as clear and concise as possible. The responsibilities for a marketing intern might include:


Monitor an update social media accounts, including posting on Facebook and Twitter.
Assist in writing e-mail newsletters for partners and clients.
Minute departmental meetings.
Assist Marketing Officer in departmental administration.
Update client database and contact information.
Help in other departments as appropriate., You should start the second section by stating if there are any specific qualifications required for the internship. This will vary by the field you are in and the type of internship you are looking to fill. Bear in mind that internships are often a way to gain work experience while studying for a particular career, so you may wish to specify that the applicants should be working towards a particular qualification.


For example, an internship at a law firm might be aimed at somebody who is studying law and intends to become a lawyer.
An internship at a newspaper or media organisation might be aimed at someone studying journalism, or a humanities or social science degree, who hopes to become a journalist.

, After detailing any specific qualifications, you should have a section in which you can describe the kind of candidate you are looking for. Concentrate on the specific skills, but also mention personal characteristics that you think are important to work in your company. For example, it may be important to be a good communicator, but it is also important to be flexible and adaptable. The skills required for a marketing intern could be:


Excellent written and oral communication skills.
Detailed knowledge and experience of social media.
Competence in Microsoft Office products, especially Word, Powerpoint and Excel.Be able to work independently with minimal supervision.
Be able to work evenings or weekends if required., In some instances you may be looking for an intern who already has some experience working in your field. This might be the case if you are working in a technical business or a potentially dangerous environment, where knowledge of machinery or safe working practices are essential.


You can state that experience is a bonus, but is not an essential requirement for the position., You should provide all the essential information the applicant should know in a clear list at somewhere on the job description. It’s important to be transparent from the start so the applicant fully understands what they are applying for. Be sure to outline the following:


Whether or not the position is paid.
How many hours the intern will work each week.
Who the intern’s line manager or supervisor will be.
What the duration of the internship will be., Interns often do a lot of work for little or no money, so it’s important that you demonstrate that you are interested in the intern’s professional development and your company has a history of successful internships. Include a section at the end in which you can highlight the benefits to the intern. Start it with a brief summary of the history of your intern programme.


If you have an established internship programme, state how many years it has been going, and highlight the success that previous interns have gone on to achieve.
Use any statistics you have that show the career paths of previous interns.
If you have gone on to employ interns on permanent contracts, you should point this out.

, After expressing how seriously your company takes internships, you should specify the benefits to the potential interns. Write out a list which presents what the intern will learn through the experience. This should be related to the list of tasks and responsibilities. The specific benefits will depend on your company, but some examples could include:


Gaining experience communicating directly with clients.
Participating in departmental meetings.
Learning to create compelling content on a website.
Learning to track web analytics.
Gaining experience working in a team and on your own initiative., At the end of your document you should include all necessary information on the application procedure and schedule. State how you wish candidates to apply, if you have an application form or would like resumes and cover letters. Make it clear if you want any further documents, such as a writing sample, letter of recommendation, or portfolio.Highlight the deadline for applications, and the place where applications should be sent.
Specify whether applications by email are acceptable.
If possible, give an idea about when the applicants can expect to receive a response.
State that you are an Equal Opportunities Employer.

,How to Write an Effective Job Description1,
"
Define the position.,
List the required skills and qualifications.,
Include contact information.",How to Write an Effective Job Description2," Start your job description by stating the title and key responsibilities of the position you wish to fill. That way potential employees will know right away whether they're qualified for the job, and people who aren't qualified will be weeded out before they have to read the entire description.It helps if the job title is recognizable. An incredibly vague title, like ""Associate Customer Officer"" or the like may not get job seekers excited about the role. If you have control over the title, make it straightforward and interesting enough that people will actually want a job with that title.
List between 5 and 10 key responsibilities, erring on the side of being concise. The responsibilities should be clear and have an obvious purpose. For example, write ""Research competitor trends and present reports on your findings,"" rather than ""Stay on top of our competitors.""Include information on how often certain responsibilities will be performed and what percentage of the entire job they encompass.

, Being up front about exactly what skills, educational background, training, equipment proficiency and other qualifications job candidates should have is extremely important in a job description. The candidate should be able to skim through the list and immediately know whether he or she should apply.


Think through the position, then write down all the skills and qualifications you think the candidate should have. Did you include everything that is required? Make sure your list is inclusive, or you may be in for some awkward conversations during the interview phase.
On the other hand, don't go overboard with skills and qualifications. You can list a few that are ""preferred, but not required,"" but this could deter potentially great candidates from applying. Remember that a person's work ethic and personality can be as integral to their success as his or her skills and qualifications.

, Make sure your description has an email address or phone number for the applicant to contact if he or she decides to apply. Consider using the contact information of the person who will be the new employee's supervisor, and stating his or her title and position within the company.

Encapsulate the company's mission.,
Convey a sense of the company's personality.Every company has a different feel, and potential employees will pay close attention to your job description's tone and style to determine what they can expect from your company.,
Include important company details.",How to Write an Effective Job Description3," Employees want to work for a company that is interesting and exciting in some way. Even if the job description seems like a perfect fit, potential applicants might pass the job over if the company doesn't seem to have a strong mission or goal. To describe your company effectively, ponder the following questions:


What does your company do? What makes it special and sets it apart from competitors?
What is the goal of the company? Is it working toward social justice, striving to be at the top of its field, or aiming to provide an excellent service of some kind?
Why do you enjoy working at your company? Try to think through your reasons for being a part of it as you write up your description.

, Your company's personality should be apparent in the language you use to write the description, whether it's formal or casual.


If the company and the job opening are both on the serious, prestigious side, convey that by writing in well-wrought, complete sentences and using formal language.
If you want to show that your company has a fun culture and personality, feel free to use slang, exclamation points, and company jokes to appeal to job applicants' lighter side.

, Your job description should list the location of the company and whether telecommuting is an option for the job applicant. You may also want to include the size of the office, and how many people are part of the company.

"
"
List the salary and benefits.,
Include instructions for resume and cover letter formatting.,
Give an application deadline.",How to Write an Effective Job Description4," In many cases you might want to save this information for the interview stage, but if the salary and benefits are set in stone, you can go ahead and list them. Beware that if the salary and benefits seem insufficient to potential job seekers they may pass over the job without giving the position a closer look.

, If you anticipate getting hundreds of cover letters and resumes, you may want to specify how you want the documents formatted so you'll have an easier time keeping track of everything. Some employers ask applicants to include all information in the body of an email, while others prefer an old-fashioned letter in the mail.

, Listing a deadline may encourage applications to apply quickly, which could potentially help you find the right position for the job a lot faster. However, if people see the description a few days after the deadline has passed, they may not bother applying, and you could miss out on some excellent candidates this way.

What makes them stick with the organization after a bad day or a bad week? Don't assume it's money - most people are more complex than that.


Remember, our values are what make us ""tick."" If you manage by respecting your team's values, they will give you their best effort.
Ask the employees how they're liking their job on a regular basis. Encourage them to be honest with you. Then take action based upon what they tell you.
Offer perks that your employees will value. If health is important to them, give them time to go to the gym and work out. If their family is important, respect the time they may need to send their kids off to school in the morning or pick them up in the afternoon.;
, The successful manager is great at identifying employees' strengths and applauding them every once in a while. That's because good managers know that happy people make productive people. Try to applaud your employees' strengths both publicly and privately.


In a meeting with your boss, for example, mention something one of your workers did well. If your boss happens to mention to that worker that you said something good about them, they're likely to feel that you appreciate them and made the effort to put in a good word. That sort of compliment doesn't go unnoticed.
Privately laud what your employees do well. Tell them when you have a moment. Go into detail. A private chat, however short, can have a positive impact on morale, resulting in more self-motivation.

, Just go out and say it. Ask them out for a cup of coffee and tell them what you appreciate about them: They're a hard worker; they effectively motivate other people; they're easy to coach; they're disciplined or go the extra mile; they always cheer you up, etc. Don't mince words — just tell them straight out. An employee who knows just how much they are appreciated will work harder, enjoy what they do more, and pass that psychic happiness along to other employees.

, This idea can apply to several different areas of life, but it's a great managerial mantra. Do you want to be the kind of person who has wildly optimistic goals that they never meet, or do you want to be the kind of person who sets measured goals and ends up exceeding them by leaps and bounds? Although this is about image, image is extremely important.


Don't be the kind of person who never shoots for the moon. Staying measured in your goals doesn't mean that you should always play it conservative, never setting high goals. A manager who never punches above her weight can come across as lacking ambition. Even the conservative poker player knows they need to go 'all-in' from time to time.

, Having concrete goals empowers your employees and keeps them focused on work. Explicitly outline what you expect, when the deadline is, and what you'll do with the results.

, Providing your employees with quick feedback that's focused on their work can help foster improvement. Meet in small teams or one-on-one, and go over your comments in detail.


Set up a schedule for feedback. Offer it regularly so that your employees know when to expect it and can make space for it in their workflows.

, We all know the kind of manager who constantly shouts or bitterly complains when mistakes are made but gives themselves a 'pass' when they fail. Don't be this kind of manager. Ideally, be harder to on yourself than you are on your employees. This can have a trickle-down effect: Employees see the types of goals and standards you set for yourself and want to emulate you because they look up to you.

, You're a manager because you're good at what you do, but that doesn't mean you're supposed to do everything yourself. Your job as a manager is to teach other people how to do a good job.


Start small. Give people tasks that, if performed incorrectly, can be fixed. Take the opportunity to teach and empower your employees. Then gradually give them tasks with greater responsibility as you come to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
Learn how to anticipate any problems they might have so you can coach them properly before they begin.

, As your workers begin to take on more responsibility and demonstrate that they're capable, give them tasks that will expand their skills and help them take more ownership of their work. Not only are you finding out how much your employees can handle, you're making them more valuable to the company.

, When one of your underlings makes a mistake, don't lord it over them; assume the mistake as your own, even if it isn't technically yours. What you're doing is creating a culture where your employees feel comfortable making mistakes.This is a very important concept:


Doing this allows your employees to innovate and, ultimately, to learn or grow. Workers who learn from their mistakes will grow to become better workers; those who fail to make mistakes in the first place usually play it too safe, never venturing out into deep water.

, Let them take credit for their own achievements. This motivates them to continue to chase after success. The successful manager is like a conductor that orchestrates the music so that each element sounds as good as possible and resonates with the group as a whole. A great conductor will lead by example, blending into the background.


What happens if you're the type of manager who ""steals"" someone's idea and plays it off as your own? You send the message that you only care about your image and are ruthless enough to sacrifice someone else in order to get ahead. That's not a great image to have, and it certainly doesn't motivate the people below you to work harder.
You may be thinking — take responsibility for other people's mistakes and don't take credit for what your employees do; where does that leave me? If you do good work and you're an effective manager, you shouldn't worry about dressing up your laurels. People will recognize the work that you do. Even more important, they'll be impressed that you motivate your employees, know how to be humble, and stay out of the way. If you work hard, you'll get your dues.

, When things don't turn out the way you expected, recognize what you could have done differently and verbalize this realization to your employees. This shows them that you make mistakes too, and it also shows them how they should handle their own mistakes.


Whenever you're doing something correctly after having done it incorrectly in the past, let whoever is watching know. For example: ""The reason I know to press this button is because this happened to me when I first started out, and I made the mistake of pressing the blue button, thinking 'This will shut down the system, which should resolve the issue' and I found out — the hard way — that it makes the issue even worse!""

, Always remind people that if they have any questions or concerns, you're ready and willing to listen. Maintaining an open channel of communication will make you aware of problems quickly, so that you can fix them as soon as possible.


Don't be one of those managers who inadvertently makes an employee feel like they're bothering you when they bring up a question or concern. Instead of seeing it as another crisis to manage, look at it as an opportunity to show your employee how much you want this organization to be a fulfilling place to work.
Never minimize or dismiss the concerns of your employees, and always make sure that you've answered their questions completely.

, Don't make every interaction with your workers strictly business. Ask after their well-being, chat with them about yourself, and establish a personal connection.


Being in-tune with your employees' lives outside the office can potentially alert you to times when that person needs extra consideration from you, for instance if he or she requires sudden time off for a family funeral. If you can be accommodating about upheavals in the personal lives of your workers, they'll feel good about rewarding you with loyalty.
Know your boundaries. Don't overstep and ask your employees about anything too personal, such as religion, politics, or personal relationships. You can keep up a friendly rapport without being invasive.

, Say you're giving your employee feedback in a performance review. You start off by mentioning how great the employee is to work with, and note one or two additional things they've excelled at. Then you launch into an extended itemization of their deficits — ""sales were down this quarter,"" ""revenue slipped,"" etc. What do you think the employee hears most resoundingly, the positive or the negative?


When you mix positive and negative feedback, both areas suffer. The positive becomes overshadowed by the negative, and the negative doesn't carry the full force of its potential impact. Of course, there may be situations where you'd want to communicate this, but on the whole it makes communication less effective.
When you silo positive and negative feedback, the positive stands out even more and the negative becomes more urgent.

, Listen to what your employees and coworkers have to say. You don't always need to be the driver of meetings, keeping others out by dominating the podium. Always make a sincere effort to listen, but be on the lookout most during the following situations:


When employees are actively sharing ideas. Don't butt in and talk just to make sure your voice is part of the mix. This can put the idea-sharing into a stranglehold.
When emotions are turbulent. Let people voice their emotions in a safe, controlled environment. Stifled emotions can turn into resentment, eroding your working relationship. Similarly, emotions that are not adequately dealt with can interfere with rational discussion, which should be the mainstay of your work environment.
When teams are building relationships or having discussions. Offer your employees a receptive ear when they're building relationships and getting creative.

, A good manager not only strives to make herself clearer, but also strives to understand what those around her are saying. You can do this by repeating what the other person has said as a part of your conversation. Use this technique when you're not exactly sure what the other person is saying.


Instead of asking your co-worker ""I'm sorry, can you repeat what you just said? I'm not sure I understood."" say something like ""So you're saying that we could drive up productivity by offering more meaningful incentives. What might that look like in the flesh?""

, Intelligent questions show that you can follow the flow of the conversation and clarify when necessary. Don't be afraid to ask questions because you're worried about appearing ""stupid."" Effective managers care about understanding what's important; they don't care about how they get there. Know, too, that others will probably have questions and may not ask. If you ask their question for them, you can act as a facilitator and build your team's engagement level. That's the true mark of a manager.

, Most of us aren't as egalitarian as we'd like to be. Many times, favoritism happens on a subconscious level. The tendency is to give more positive recognition to the people who remind us of ourselves somehow and who actually like us, rather than to the people who make the biggest contributions to the organization. In the long run, it's people in the latter group who will make the most progress in achieving the organization's goals, so monitor your own behavior carefully and make sure you're not accidentally short-changing them, even if they give you the impression that your positive regard doesn't affect them. Some people shy away from positive feedback but appreciate it nonetheless.

, If you're good to your workers and they're happy with their jobs, they'll pass that kindness on to customers and invaluably bolster the image of your company. Or, they'll do the same for their employees and maintain a positive corporate culture.

Proofread and edit your document carefully.",How to Write Selection Criteria," The selection criteria outline the qualifications, skills, abilities, and experience needed to successfully do the position. Once you understand the job description, you can begin to develop the criteria.The criteria will also help you evaluate potential job candidates. As you think about the position, ask yourself some questions:


What types of experiences would prepare someone to do this job?
What type of education would prepare someone for this job?
What skills are necessary to complete the job?
Are there any policies or regulations someone needs to know to do this job?
For example, if you are filling a managerial position, your selection criteria may include phrases like ""demonstrated ability to manage financial resources and develop budgets,"" or ""proven ability to manage a team."";
, Essential criteria are absolutely necessary to fulfill the position. The desired criteria are qualities and skills that would make a person more successful. The essential criteria should help applicants decide if they are well suited for the position. The desired criteria can help you identify the top candidates for the job.List the essential and most important criteria first.

, Key expressions are usually used to write selection criteria. These expressions will let candidates know what you are looking for and what level of experience is needed to fulfill the criteria. ""Background in"" refers to education. ""Experience in"" and ""proven record in"" means you want a candidate with actual experience that can be proven and with verified outcomes. If you are referencing a transferable skill or potential to do something, you would use phrases like ""aptitude for"" or ""capacity to.""""Knowledge of,"" ""awareness of,"" and ""understanding of,"" indicate that you expect familiarity and/or comprehension.

, A large number of selection criteria may deter people from applying to the position. Try to limit yourself 10 criteria or less.Also avoid using jargon and acronyms as some applicants may not be familiar with them. Write using plain, simple, and concise language.


Include only one skill or qualification in each criterion.
Using jargon can also create a bias towards internal candidates that are familiar with your company and industry.
Don't use gender specific language in your criteria.

, Because you are using the criteria to choose the best applicant, it is important that the criteria can be measured. This will help you compare applicants to others. Avoid including personal qualities in the criteria. Criteria such as ""hard-working"" and ""reliable"" are difficult to quantify. Stick with specific behaviors and more outcome based criteria.Using key expressions will help you avoid including personal qualities.

, Before you begin addressing the selection criteria, you should have a thorough understanding of the position you are applying for. As you go through the description, make sure that your background and interests are aligned with the description. If you have any questions about the job, contact the name listed on the job application or the human resources department to get more information.As you read, think about how your skills and experience make you a good fit for the position. If you are unable to think of specific examples, you may want to consider applying for a different position.You should also research the employer that you are submitting your application to. Your responses will be better if you have a thorough understanding of the culture, needs, and expectations of the company.

, Common phrases are used in selection criteria. These phrases will give you an idea of what the employer is looking for. It is helpful to highlight the key words in the selection criteria before you develop your answers. Some of the phrases to look for include: ""background in,"" ""experience in; proven record in,"" ""knowledge of; understanding of; awareness of,"" ""ability to; capacity to,"" ""must have.""""Background in"" usually refers to your education and training.
""Experience in"" refers to having practical experience in the area.
""Proven record"" means you should be able to confirm and/or demonstrate the skill or experience.
""Knowledge, understanding, and awareness"" are usually in reference to regulations, policies, and procedures.""Ability and capacity"" refers to how suitable you are to perform a task or being able and qualified to perform a task.

, The selection criteria will be listed as either ""essential"" or ""desired."" You must meet all of the essential criteria to make the interview list. You do not have to have the desired criteria to make the interview list. However, having these criteria will make you a stronger candidate.If you do not meet all of the essential criteria, you should not apply for the position.

, The job description usually provides directions for responding to the selection criteria. If you are unsure, ask the employer for more information about how to respond to selection criteria. Inquire about the preferred format and required length before composing your response and writing your selection criteria.Some employers have a specific format that you must follow.Always check before getting started.
A separate document is usually used to submit your responses to the selection criteria. If a separate document is not required, you can format your cover letter and resume to address the selection criteria., Your responses should do more than restate what is in your resume. Instead, they should build on the information presented in your resume. You want to give the employers a clearer picture of your skills and experience.Think of your responses as an opportunity to include all of the information that you were not able to put into your resume and cover letter.


Never refer the reader to information in your resume as part of your response (e.g. see resume).

, Each criterion should be addressed individually. You can use the exact wording of the selection criteria as the heading.Under each heading, write one to two paragraphs explaining how you demonstrate the skill. Your writing should be clear, concise, and specific to the criterion.Try to keep your responses between 60 and 120 words.It may be helpful to brainstorm your response and write down 2 to 3 sentences about how you meet the criterion.
Bullet points can also be used to differentiate between examples. If you gained the skill in two separate jobs, you may devote one bullet point to each job.
For example, if the criterion is ""excellent interpersonal and communication skills,"" begin your response by saying, ""I have developed excellent interpersonal and communication skills, including..."" Then provide specific examples of each of the skills that you just listed., The STAR model is the suggested format for responding to selection criteria. This model will help you develop complete answers. You will outline the Situation, Task, Action, and Result.Specify the ""Situation"" in which you developed or utilized the skills represented by a particular criterion. Explain the circumstances surrounding the experience to give the employer a greater ability to envision your situation.
Demonstrate the ""Task."" Write about the role you played in the situation and how you performed the duties related to the task, using as much detail as possible. Include individual actions, tasks performed with a group and the outcomes experienced.
Elaborate about the ""Actions."" Explain the actions you took and how you completed them to fulfill the specific criterion.
Show the ""Results."" Write about any achievements and the positive outcome from your efforts relating to the criterion. Use quantifiable results, if possible.

, While the STAR model is the most common, there are other methods that you can use. These methods may be more helpful depending on how the criteria are written. For example, some criteria are written as application questions with specific scenarios. Other formats include the CAR (Circumstance, Action, Result), SAR (Situation, Action, Result) , and SAO (Situation, Action, Outcome) model.An example of an application question is, ""Describe a situation where you had to deal with an angry customer. Describe how you met the customer's needs and how you developed skills in this area.""
Criteria that focus on knowledge, understanding, or qualifications can be answered using these other response methods.
Criteria that start with ""ability to"" are best answered using the STAR method.
Choose the response format that helps you write the best answer.

, Your responses will be more impressive if you avoid some common errors. Never claim an experience or skill that you cannot support with examples. Your answers should also be specific instead of just making general statements. Lastly, do not just reword information from the selection criteria or the company's website.These responses should reflect how your specific background and experiences have prepared you to do the job.

, It is important that you respond to each of the criteria listed whether essential or desirable. Even if you do not satisfy a criterion, still write a response. Your response should show any theoretical or best practice knowledge about the area, your ability to acquire that knowledge or skill, and how you plan to do so., Look for incomplete sentences, misspellings, inappropriate word use, formatting errors and awkward wording. Rephrase sentences to make them active tense using strong, descriptive verbs.Also make sure your responses are within the word limit.


Ask a friend or colleague to edit your statement. Encourage him or her to make comments, look for errors and analyze it for run-on sentences or fragments.

Analyze whether the salary is internally fair.",How to Write a Job Description for a Project Manager," Sometimes, you might hire a project manager to implement a pre-existing plan. However, you probably need the project manager to plan the project. Identify the specific duties involved in planning the project, such as the following:Work with senior management to set the parameters of the project.
Devise a work plan for the project, including the sequence of tasks.
Identify the resources needed to complete the project, such as the money, equipment, staff and time.
Review the project schedule with senior management and other relevant staff.
Revise the project schedule, if necessary, after consultation with management.
Come up with benchmarks for evaluating the project at completion.;
, No one is better situated to staff the project than the project manager. Think about giving them the following duties:Select staff or volunteers in consultation with appropriate management.
Oversee staff and volunteers.
Enforce organization policies when working with staff, including coaching, counseling, and disciplining.Maintain personnel files and ensure their confidentiality.
Identify and hire consultants as appropriate to assist in the project.

, Proper implementation includes completing the project on time and ensuring the work is high-quality. Break down this responsibility into a set of specific tasks, such as the following:Follow the plan to implement the project.
Document the project with appropriate records.
Keep all project information and files safe.
Monitor the project and adjust project tasks as necessary to complete the project on time and under budget.
Develop a schedule to communicate with stakeholders on the project.
Review the project team’s work and confirm it meets quality standards.

, Financial budgeting and planning are crucial tasks most project managers will perform. You should consider whether your manager will do any of the following:Approve budgeted expenditures and monitor the spending.
Create cash flow projections and monitor the cash flow on a monthly or other basis.
Update the project’s financial records.
Prepare financial reports and gather necessary documentation in support for the review by funders.
Write status reports for management and key funders.
Communicate will all project funders.

, Your candidates need to know if they will be working out of an office, working in the field, or travelling a lot. They also need to know their hours. Accordingly, consider adding a couple bullet points that explain the work conditions.For example, you might write: “The Project Manager will typically work out of our office but may be required to communicate with stakeholders once a month.”
Also mention hours: “The Project Manger will generally work a standard workweek, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. However, occasionally the Project Manager may need to work in the evenings or during the weekend.”

, You’ll need to decide two things: the minimum education acceptable and whether the person should have a degree in a specific field.For example, you might require a bachelor’s degree as a minimum educational credential.
You can also require a degree in a related field. If your project manager is overseeing a government program for children, for example, you could require a degree in social work or early childhood education.

, You might want a project manager to be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), lawyer (JD), or another professional. Make sure to identify any requirement in your job description.In the U.K., project managers can belong to the Association of Project Managers.State whether you want membership in this or a similar organization.

, Generally, you’ll want your project manager to have certain computer skills. These skills are necessary for tracking the project and budgets, as well as for preparing reports for funders and management. You might also want other technical skills. Consider the following:word processing
email
internet research
spreadsheets
database management and data entry
basic accounting

, These are your “soft skills.” Soft skills separate a great project manager from a good one. Consider what personal traits or attributes you want the project manager to have. If you’ve hired a project manager in the past, think about what you liked and didn’t like about them. Consider the following:Leadership. A good leader can encourage others to meet and exceed their expectations. A leader also boosts morale when it is low.
Team player. Your project manager should be able to work effectively with their staff as well as with management.
Organization. A project manager should be able to prioritize conflicting demands and monitor progress toward the completion of the project.
Strategic insight. Your project manager should be a problem solver, as well as someone who can plan effectively. Your project will run into many snags, and only a good strategist can keep it on track.
Communication skills. Effective communication requires clear thinking and writing, as well as listening skills. Your project manager should be able to communicate orally as well as in writing.
Ethical behavior. You want the project manager to be aligned with your organization’s values, including transparency and honesty.
Creativity. A project manager should be able to think on their feet and come up with creative solutions to unusual problems.

, It’s up to you how much experience you want your project manager to have. You can welcome applications from people with no experience or with several years of experience.


You might also list a preference: “At least two to three years of project management experience preferred.” This way, you don’t exclude people who are new to project management.

, To get talented staff, you need to pay a reasonable rate. Accordingly, you should determine the market rate for the position. Ask another organization that employs project managers what they pay. Make sure the manager does equivalent work as your manager and has similar skills or experience.


You can also check online. Visit websites like Indeed.com, Glassdoor, Salary.com or PayScale.Search for salaries in your location and industry. You can also use the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys.

, Using a range gives you some flexibility about what you offer people. Your minimum should be around the market rate for your area. However, excellent employees often command 20-30% more, because they easily add that much more value.If your minimum is $50,000, you might want to budget for an upper-range of $60,000. If a great candidate comes along, you can offer them close to the maximum.

, Take out your compensation plan and review job designations. See which ones are close to the project manager’s in terms of education, responsibility, and required skills. You will want to make sure the project manager’s salary is in line with the salaries of other comparable professionals.


If the salary is out of line, then your other staff could resent the new hire.Also the new project manager might be angry if they are paid less than current staff.

Realize that management succeeds via the efforts of the workers.,
Delegate responsibility and then trust your people.,
Know your employees to know your strength.,
Most bad bosses are under the (mistaken) impression there is something threatening about this, because the bad boss thinks that she or he is the only one who can perform a given function.,
Empower your staff to make decisions, and don't second-guess them.,
Help them learn to work out issues without your intervention.,
Deal with any problems quickly and directly.,
Tell your staff how much you appreciate them - in front of customers if possible.,
Show your appreciation by doing things for them.,
Learn to be an effective listener.,
Always say thanks to them for what they do at work.

,
Always say neat.",How to Be a Good Boss," Because you're in charge doesn't mean you deserve all the credit for the work being done. Your staff is responsible for the bulk of the work. You are leading them as they get it done to be sure all regulations are complied with, etc.,.;
, Micro-managers are never appreciated and shows disrespect toward the team member. Once you've trained someone to handle a task, allow him or her to handle it without interference. Different people have different approaches, and someone else's way of doing something may be just as efficient as the way you would do it. Before you step in and force your way on anyone, give an honest evaluation to the method, and if you find it works just as well, even if it's different from yours, let it be. Constantly correcting your people undercuts their confidence and does not allow them to exercise their own style.

, Watch your staff; get to know them as individuals. Understand their motives: Whatever that is, do your best to understand. That allows you to enhance, adjust, and align their motives with your goals. The cream always rises to the top, and it's your job to figure out which employees do what is required in their jobs, and employees do all they can in their jobs. There is a huge distinction.

, The truth is, the best boss trusts that his or her staff can be utterly relied upon.

, If you've done a good job of training your people to be your proxies, then you must believe they are doing their best to act in your (and your company's) best interest. Even if they make a wrong decision, or handle a situation in a way you would not have, don't second guess or berate them. Instead, use it as yet another training opportunity. Hear out their reasons for their action - most of the time, when taken in context, there was a logical basis for what they decided to do.

, Sometimes one or more of your staff may experience friction with others. If they come tattling on one another to you, Listen to them carefully. If someone is not fulfilling his or her own responsibilities or is mistreating another employee, you'll need to step in and resolve a conflict at work. But if you're satisfied it's only an issue of competition or a simple personality clash, urge them to settle it between themselves.


Talk to the other person, and upon verifying that it's a personality issue, simply let them both know that they aren't required to be friends, only to get along and get their work finished.
Tell them both you believe in their abilities to work and get along. Then leave them alone, but watch carefully. Don't interfere unless they bicker in front of customers. Put a stop to anything like that instantly.

, Any boss who is busy totally understands this concept: ""I don't need all the details. Bottom line it for me."" You don't have to be so blunt that you crush people, and Be Honest Without Being Harsh is a big time saver, and frankly, appreciated in the end. When you see a problem, deal with it quickly and don't nag your people about it later - let done be done. Try to elicit the agreement that whatever just happened was not acceptable. Remember that your goal is to promote productive behavior and retain the respect of your employee, NOT to antagonize your people, particularly in front of others. Here's an example:


Boss: ""Evan. I need you in the office for a moment."" (Say this in a neutral or pleasant tone. Don't come out in front of customers or peers with your guns blazing, bellowing, ""Evan, get in the office NOW."" This is between you and Evan.) Privately, once all prying eyes are away:

Boss: ""Evan, the cell phone call. Is everything okay with your family?""
Evan: ""Yes, it was just my dad wanting some help later...""
Boss: ""Okay, I see. We're all human, but when you're out in the front office, you cannot take personal calls.""
Evan: ""I know. I'm sorry. It's just my dad doesn't have many opportunities to talk to me..."" (the actual problem or subject of the call is irrelevant)
Boss: ""I understand; nevertheless - when you find you can't end a personal call immediately, I'd like you to leave the front reception. When customers see you taking an obviously personal call instead of helping them, it looks bad for you and the business Our customer is always to have priority unless you have an emergency.
Evan: ""Yeah... that was my mistake.""
Boss: ""Alright. Glad you understand that. Ideally, I'd like you to let your phone go to voice mail when you're at work, but at least leave the front office if you can't end the call immediately,
And that's it. Don't belabour it, don't nag him about it, just let him get on with his job. It isn't necessary to cushion these discussions with compliments or flattery. Your employee should (A) know better than to take lengthy personal calls on the job and (B) be a grownup about discipline. You, as a Good Boss, should (A) stay cool - it's a training opportunity, and (B) be kind and calm, but firm and clear in expressing your correction of the behavior and your expectation for the future. Excessive compliments and a constant attempt to ""relate"" to your staff's personal issues are a waste of time, as are berating and belaboring lectures. Get to the point quickly - but without becoming strident or making a mountain out of a molehill.

, Never hesitate to pat your employees on the back, Compliment staff, and thank them for their excellent service - if customers are there, letting them know how you value your people can go a long way toward the customers actually having more faith in the services your business provides. When your staff feel valued and appreciated, their job means more to them than simply a paycheck. When your customers know that you, as the manager think highly of your staff, they feel confident that they're in good hands, and it gives you more freedom to leave your customers in the very capable hands of your staff. See how this becomes a ""win-win-win""? By lifting up your employee while your customer was watching, All you got something good from it - with zero downside.

, They go the extra mile for you. You do something nice for them.

, Your employees deserve to be heard when they have concerns. Allow them to finish talking before you speak; do not assume that you know what they are going to tell you before they finish talking; do not form objections in your mind while they are talking. Instead, try to be fully engaged while they are talking without making it about your rebuttal. Acknowledge their points, which do not mean that you agree, but does mean that you understand their concerns. Repeat their points in your own words to confirm, if necessary. You may not need to take any action, but hearing them out is important to their sense of empowerment and significance. Often, simply saying, ""I appreciate your telling me this"" is all that's needed to make them feel they were heard.

,, People don't hear it enough in everyday life.

Don't assume you know what's ""going down"" even if you used to work in the same place.,
Tread carefully at the start.,
Take time to get to know people and their roles.,
Observe.,
Ask staff for their ideas.,
Implement gradual change.,
Don't accept the commonplace reasoning from worried or stagnating staff that ""This is the way we've always done it.""",How to Avoid New Broom Syndrome as a New Leader," Being a general employee differs from being a leader. Once you become a manager or a boss, it will take time for you to spot the general trends in the overall landscape. What you learned in your previous role may have only pertained to that role, area, or service. Assume that you still have a lot to learn, and many pieces of the jigsaw to put back yet. You may benefit from reading How to Be Humble.;
, Don't assume that you will be liked. Your predecessor may have been so well-loved that nobody wanted to see him/her leave. Or (s)he may have been so unpopular that they're afraid that you might be just as challenging! Let people get to know you before you implement changes; earn their trust by being responsive, available, and honest. In other words, learn How to Be a Good Boss (or How to Be a Good Manager) before you tackle change.

, Ask them questions about how they perceive their role and how they perceive the general direction of the organization they work for. Don't make it feel like you're grilling them, though, or make them worry about losing their jobs.

, Take a good look at how the unit functions, watch for bottlenecks, and get familiar with the culture of the department and staff. Do they talk, joke, laugh? Are they tense, terse, or reserved? Are they busy, or are they just looking busy? Are they efficiently going about their tasks, or are they spinning wheels on things that should not be first in line to get done? Watching first will help you identify problem employees and trouble spots before you just go in and start slashing.

, Although you're probably brimful of new ideas, simply presenting these as the new way of doing things is unlikely to get buy-in from existing employees - and can create resentment. Remember, these are the people who have been doing the work for a long time. Their ""insider"" view may be very helpful. Instead, take a dual approach of consulting employees to get their ideas and then thinking through the ways in which you can marry the most promising of these ideas with yours to achieve positive outcomes. Be sure to make it clear that you have benefited from staff ideas and pinpoint those that are being implemented. Doing this will smooth your way!


When you delegate, you're more likely to get more useful, relevant feedback. See How to Delegate.

, A bunch of sudden and abrupt changes will leave everyone lurching, and threatens to destabilize your organization. The best approach to implementing change as a new leader will usually be to gradually shift out existing practices and reshape them with new ones. The only exceptions to this will be a situation where the company is failing and everyone knows you have been brought in to try to turn it around in a short span of time, or when you are being confronted with an unexpected crisis. The latter would be a good opportunity to implement a new way of working if you clearly think it would propel the organization forward and resolve the crisis. Use any resistance you encounter at this point as a barometer of how ready the organization is to accept you and to clear out any dead wood at an appropriate (later) stage.

, While it is vital to avoid the sledgehammer approach, you will need to do the role you were employed to take on. You were selected to lead and your superiors will expect to see you making improvements. Don't make changes for the sake of change alone, but do implement improvements. Employees become entrenched in routines that are either too redundant or too risky - where you notice such non-constructive workplace activity, make changes. Request and expect enhancing changes to be implemented at once. Most of all, don't be swayed by any resistance not supported by serious evidence that your proposed changes are not sustainable or beneficial.

Give praise its dues.",How to Avoid Disempowering Your Workplace Team," Empowerment is never a reason to abandon employees to their own devices, to strike out on paths unknown and risky. You need to remain involved, engaged, and actively listening. Let team members know that while you trust their skills, your door is always open and no question is ever stupid. Think of empowerment as a way to stimulate the best in your team members, to help mutual dialog flourish and to open up the availability of innovation tied to experience. You remain the experience at the top of the task and it's up to you to keep up on the progress. And consider the next step.;
, There is no hard and fast rule here and sometimes you'll make mistakes by not intervening when you should have and by intervening when it wasn't needed. That's OK; it's all a learning process and you can take responsibility for your blunders and bolster team morale, provided that team communications are permitted to be open and honest. It might help to develop a system trigger that helps you know when it is vital to intervene, such as when a crucial looming deadline seems to be falling off the rails, or team members are duplicating work without cross-communicating this.

, The opposite of letting it all hang loose is keeping tight reins on your team. This will never lead to empowerment because team members will learn very quickly to question their own judgment and look to yours only. You will grow a group of copycats and the disgruntled will probably move on. Instead, embrace the possibilities and don't be afraid of the sense of loss of control. Empowerment is about letting go of your own concerns and trusting others to meet your expectations. Know your team well and then give them the discretion to make decisions to the extent of their skills, while at the same time helping them to learn new ways to meet challenges. Regular team and individual debriefing is a really important part of not being afraid of empowerment; provided you stay informed, you'll feel a lot more comfortable about letting go of the reins some more.

How to Train Someone to Do Your Job

, Empowering employees doesn't change the business nor its direction. What it does do is provide your employees with a new managerial ethos to live up to their skills, to innovate within parameters and to create a business-wide culture that respects the autonomy of each individual employee.

, Grooming team members to take your place is a good thing because eventually, believe it or not, you will want to move on, be it up or out, and transitions are always much easier on all involved if there are ready, good up-and-coming people beneath you. Besides which, think of it as leaving some of your stamp on the organization through coaching others.

, Although you have your vision of the business direction and you have your opinions about managerial skills, your team will always have ideas that come as a result of being at the front lines of the actual work you're managing. Always stay receptive, make it obvious that you're listening openly, and take on board the sensible and enhancing ideas. Make it clear to your team members that you're doing this and do it regularly.

, Although you're the manager, natural leadership within a team can be very fruitful provided the leader respects your authority. Be aware of natural leadership tendencies and harness them for the good of the project and the growth of the individual. When such an aspiring individual realizes that you are both respecting and making use of their leading skills, they will be more prone to work effectively as a ""sub-manager"" on whom you can rely.

, There are gruff managers who believe that praise should come at Christmas time in the form of a thank you card. A healthy and productive team environment regularly cross-praises and praises from the top-down. It gets even better when praise comes from bottom-up but don't expect miracles! Cultivate a culture of praise and this will feed directly into boosting the culture of empowerment. Avoid praise and you avoid full empowerment.

Schedule meetings with your sales staff regularly.,
Train your salespeople.,
Invest in new sales tools.",How to Motivate Your Sales Team1," Instead of focusing on what they are doing wrong, make sure that some 1-on-1 meetings address their worries, pain points and work environment issues. You are likely to catch motivation problems before they affect their season and quota, if you try to fix negative work pressures.


Ask your sales staff what motivates them during these meetings. You may find some salespeople respond to monetary rewards, while others respond to promotions or a supportive team environment. Take notes on what motivates each person.;
, There are several ways to plan trainings to increase motivation.


Appoint salespeople to train their peers. This is an excellent way to recognize special skills in your salespeople and encourage interaction. Ask the salesperson to take a few hours from selling and plan a 1-hour training session about a topic they excel in.
Take a field trip. Use your contacts to find a manager who would be willing to have you watch their successful sales team. Consider making the place a sales floor for a different product or industry. For example, if your sales team needs to be more aggressive, take them to a conference where they can witness someone selling a product with a 30-second elevator speech. Return and ask them to write a new introduction speech.
Choose an outside consultant to train your salespeople. Pick your person very carefully. Make sure they are an expert, they have excellent time management skills and they are able to inject some humor into the training. Keep training sessions short and include a practice period with the guest speaker.
Appoint a mentor to train younger sales associates. This may help the younger staff work through the growing pains of a new job. Give the mentors incentives if the younger associates meet their sales goals. This is a great option for a workplace that requires team building.

, Make sure your CRM is enhancing the sales environment, rather than detracting from it. A good reporting, mass email or mobile app tool can increase a salesperson's efficiency, helping their sales goals and their motivation.


Most new websites and CRM require a training period. They can be easier for some salespeople to learn than others. Time the adoption of the tool to a low-stress point in the season.

Tailor your motivational plan to each employee.,
Create a reasonable and effective commission structure.,
Implement daily, weekly and monthly incentives.,
Create a personal goal.,
Encourage a team environment.,
Recognize sales achievements.",How to Motivate Your Sales Team2," If you have the ability to adjust incentive schemes, use it. Each person is motivated differently, so choose 1 to 3 things that will help the salesperson work harder and put them in writing.

, If few of your salespeople are meeting their quotas, you should review how well they are working to motivate employees. Reconsider caps on commissions or quotas, placing them at lower levels if the market has seen a drop or raising the commission levels in a market boom.

, Offering a trip, day off, large gift card, coffee, free lunches or gym/club membership for the most sales in a week will encourage staff to go the extra mile. These interim bonuses can also help salespeople to meet their larger quotas by helping them hit milestones during the season.


Incentives also increase friendly competition. Competing on a daily basis for new leads or lead qualification can cause people to push each other to do better. Keep incentives at a value where they increase friendly competition but do not encourage sabotage.

, Keeping in mind what motivates each employee, tack on an incentive to their commission that applies to their desires. For example, if you know an employee has an anniversary, offer them 2 extra paid days of leave if they meet their goal.

, Salespeople can often feel like they are alone, working toward a target. Create a team incentive where they are encouraged to help each other and share knowledge for a common goal.

, The time you take to congratulate someone on their hard work may decide how hard they work to reach their next quota. Consider these recognition strategies.


Congratulate them publicly. Bring up their achievement at sales meetings. Be as specific as possible with the details of their success. For example, say ""Joe's ability to obtain referrals is exceptional. He has the highest referral rate in the company, which leads to him hitting his quotas. Joe can you tell us how you ask someone to refer you to their friends and associates?""
Write the person a note. Do not wait until their yearly review to give them recognition. Instead, send a letter to their house to tell them how valued they are, with a gift card for their family.
Introduce the person and their achievements to your bosses. Recognition in upper management is hard to get, especially if your sales staff sees high turnover. When someone surpasses goals, schedule meetings where they can meet with higher staff or invite them to sit in on a strategy meeting.

Take an employee satisfaction survey.,
Hold regular reviews.,
Communicate openly.,
Include employees any time policy reviews are made.,
Establish predictable and consistent schedules and routines.,

Train managers and supervisors to exhibit desired company culture.,
Trust your employees.,
Promote work and life balance.,
Provide gifts and giveaways when you can.,
Bring food.,
Encourage your employees to socialize.,
Promote professional development.",How to Keep Employees Happy," This can be done anonymously and voluntarily. Invite your employees to share what they like and dislike about their jobs and their work environment.Ask questions like, “Do you feel you have the tools and resources necessary to do your job?” or “Does your work give you a personal feeling of accomplishment?” or “Are you satisfied with your involvement in decisions that affect you personally at work?” or “What might we change to increase employee satisfaction?”
Pay attention to the survey results. There might be some things you cannot do anything about right now, such as providing raises or better benefits. However, pay attention to the things that will cost nothing, such as a dress code that includes casual Fridays.
Continue to invite suggestions from employees. A suggestion box can go a long way in keeping your staff feeling like they can provide ideas for a more positive working environment.;
, Even if a salary increase only comes annually, supervisors and managers should provide performance reviews at least every few months. This gives your employees a chance to engage with you about their performance on the job and how they feel about working there.Praise the staff who are doing well. Hearing they are doing good work will motivate your best employees and keep them happy.
If an employee is doing well, try saying something like, “We are very pleased with your overall performance, especially in such and such area.”
If you feel an employee needs to improve in a certain area, handle the situation delicately by telling them, “We appreciate all of the hard work you’re doing here at the company, especially regarding your increasing sales. But we believe that the company would benefit if you paid more attention to tracking invoice.”

, Your employees will be happy when they are getting accurate information directly from the company. They do not want to hear about news or developments from the media, your competition, or other people.Hold regular meetings or send out newsletters informing employees about important company changes – whether related to business or internal policies.
If your company is planning a merger with another company, hold a meeting in which you inform your employees. You don’t want them to hear about it from sources outside of management. Telling them personally what is going on will also help allay any fears they may have regarding their job stability with the upcoming changes.
Say something like, “We wanted to let you know that there are some company-wide changes happening in the near future that we are very excited about.” Provide some specific details and allow time for questions.

, Staff will be happier if they feel like they have input when it comes to making changes or improvements in the way the business is run.Invite a few employees to work with your benefits department during open enrollment. This will help you provide benefits that everyone appreciates and that truly reflects the interests of the employees.
Recruit employees from all levels to serve on committees. Engage your staff when it comes to strategic planning, holiday planning, hiring, and annual reviews.

, This is especially important when you have employees who do shift work, such as at factories or hospitals.Keep employees on a single shift, either day or evening, and rotate the number of weekends and holidays that people are required to work. No employee is going to be happy if she has to work on Christmas every year or every Saturday night shift.

, People will appreciate displaying family pictures or their kids' artwork in cubicles. Simply request that they keep it professional.Being able to customize their space will help your employees feel like they really belong there and that the management wants them to feel comfortable while they are at work.
You might also consider enacting other office-wide perks that can increase employees’ satisfaction like allowing a more casual dress code on one day per week.

, To maintain a positive environment, it is important to make sure that your managers and supervisors all understand the company culture and know how to help individual employees reach established work standards and competence. Make sure that your managers and supervisors are people-oriented, not process-oriented., Most human resource professionals agree that employees do not like to be micromanaged. Allow them to do their jobs and trust that they will do good work.You can supervise your employees’ work without making them feel like you are constantly looking over their shoulder and waiting for them to make a mistake.
Give your employees the responsibility they need to complete their tasks. If you assign an employee a job, don’t keep checking in on them about their progress or double checking their work after every step they complete.

, Employees are happy when their employers understand their responsibilities and lives outside of work.Introduce flexible working schedules. Some of your staff might work better in the mornings but mentally check out by 3:00 p.m. Others work better later in the day.
Make it easy for employees to work from home when they need to. Caring for a sick child or staying home during a snowstorm instead of fighting their way into the office will keep employees a lot happier, especially if they can stay on top of their work while at home.

, Some companies offer concert or sports tickets to their employees. Others hold drawings for restaurant gift cards. These kinds of perks can go a long way in making your employees feel satisfied at work.This can also be a fun way for employees and management to interact and create stronger bonds.

, People respond well to food encouragement. Show your employees you appreciate them by providing them with a little refreshment on the company’s dime every now and then.Consider bringing in bagels for breakfast once a week, or hosting a pizza lunch for high performing departments once a month.

, A great way to make sure your employees are happy is to make sure they are creating bonds with their colleagues at work. Facilitate this kind of social engagement between coworkers by hosting company events.Host a happy hour, hold a company picnic in the summer, and celebrate the holidays as a team at the end of the year.

, Whether you provide tuition reimbursement or a chance to train for a new role, employees who see opportunities for growth within a company are more likely to be happy and stay where they are.Happy employees stay at jobs longer than unhappy ones, which will save your company money in the long run.
Consider offering professional training courses, management grooming opportunities, or options to transfer departments/locations more easily.

Make an assessment: If you suspect there is an employee morale problem at work, which will happen, the best way to address it is to take some time and effort to assess it.",How to Improve Employee Morale: Assessment & Intervention1," This may be hard to do because it means admitting that things are not as good as you might have hoped. Low production, bad attitudes, absenteeism, lateness, and passive/active anger can come out as result of poor morale. Get a general sense of it.


Pen & Paper: There are many P & P assessment tools you can find on the Internet. Among them, the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) is a favorite used by internal and external consultants which can be tailored to a particular organization or group.
Interviews: One-on-one, anonymous interviews with a random sample of people that should be no more than an hour can be very helpful in getting non-group think answers and finding out what’s really going on.
How has morale been in the past?
Have there been any major changes in routine, personnel, policy, supervisors, business, profit, etc.;
"
"
Realize that the first step begins with the employer.,
Let people know they are appreciated.,
Provide employee perks such as casual Friday, free lunches, and cash bonuses or gift certificates.,
Offer bonuses, whether financial incentives, company cars, or other prizes.,
Understand that the work environment can greatly affect employee morale.,
Use 360 degree feedback surveys as a way to illustrate to employees that you support and encourage an atmosphere of continuous improvement and dedication to improving work conditions.

,
Encourage communication between employees and management.,
Revise the company mission statement to include all employees and departments to ensure each employee feels as though they are an integral part of the company’s future.

,
Make sure the values and ethics of the company are of those employees can take pride in.,
Find ways to make life more pleasant in general for employees.,
Be loyal to your employees.,
Give employees a chance to help others.,
Change the atmosphere.,
Have fun!",How to Improve Employee Morale," To recognize the value of your employees is key. Many business have the attitude that employees are a 'dime a dozen'. If one leaves, another can be found to take their place without much trouble on their part. While this maybe true to some extent, the cost of advertising, interviewing and training the new employee can be prohibitive.;
, Simply stating a few words of thanks or sincere admiration for a job well done will help increase morale among employees.

, Sponsor social events such as a softball team, barbecues for employees and their families, or office picnics.

, This gives employees a goal to work towards and can create enthusiasm which is often contagious among employees. Open the lines of communication with employees to find out what kind of things or programs would get them motivated. This will also help them feel like they are an important, contributing factor of the company.

, A dreary office lacking light and color can cause depression and a lack of motivation. Brighten up the space with a soothing paint job, green plants, and tasteful artwork.


If it is not possible to fix up the environment (i.e. a warehouse or factory), make sure you offer adequate breaks and a break room where employees can relax, eat, and rest.

,, Doing so will allow employees to feel comfortable to voice their opinions and make suggestions to improve conditions and work. Listen to the employees you do have. What are their concerns? Well, money probably ranks right up there at the top, but what other concerns do they have? Is it lack of recognition? Lack of perks? Lack of appreciation for the job they do?

,, Most employees in the work force want to work for a company they can trust and believe in.

, Offer flexible schedules, work-from home schedules, gym memberships, etc.

, If business starts to decline, find ways to keep employees without cut backs or lay offs. Be sure to offer promotions and pay raises to those who deserve it.

, 'Wear a Hat to Work Day' can be turned into a chance to help a local charity. Employees pay a dollar or two for the privilege of looking silly and the money goes to charity.

, Do you rule by intimidation? Surely not, but every atmosphere can be lightened up to a degree. Stop and think, ""Will what I'm doing today have an impact a hundred years from now?""; or, ""Will what I'm doing today hurt or harm someone if I don't act like a dictator?"". If not, come out of the throne room and lighten up!

, You don't have to dress in a clown's costume, but you can promote a feeling of happiness and satisfaction in the workplace. Go out and talk to your employees. Smile. Recognize what they do, for without them, you wouldn't have a business to start with.

,
Help people make a personal vision, mission and goals.",How to Improve Employee Morale: Assessment & Intervention2," Having an outsider do the interviews can get an over all sense of what is happening may help a lot. This is sometimes called an Organizational Audit.

,, Getting them to think of what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how it can be accomplished can be very helpful. These questions can be helping in assessing VMG.


Do people know why they are there and where they are going?
What is the individual and group vision for being at work?
What gives them the “juice” or gets them motivated?
Ask them to write what they want to be most proud of when they retire.
What is the sense of mission that underlies that?
What is their year-to-year, month-to-month, week-to-week plan?

"
"
How is the communication in the work place?,
Is there: shaming, blaming, manipulation, passive-aggressive behavior, sabotage, envy, jealousy, bullying, hazing, cliquishness or open hostility going on?,
Check out a conflict style indicator and or a personality style indicator.",How to Improve Employee Morale: Assessment & Intervention3," Both in general and specifically.


Between various sub-groups?
Between workers and management?
Between management and upper leadership?

, These types of issues are both signs and continual causes of poor morale.

, The conflict style indicator will tell you a lot about how work communication is going and the personality indicator will tell you if people are having misunderstandings about how they and their co-workers function.

Make sure, though, that you get input from staff about what they think will work and how it will work.

,
Make sure you've done a good job of listening, especially, to feelings from your staff.,
List vision, mission and goals by yourself or with some outside help, get staff to start with goals and break those down to small attainable goals.,
Make sure everybody has a copy of the VMG in their employee's handbook.,
If communication is poor, assess as to why that is true and look for emotional baggage between staff, between management and staff or as a whole group.

,
Bring in a consultant to teach communication and or send staff out to a communication class and make sure you follow up on what has been learned.

Consider workload.,
Recognize employees for good work.,
Keep the lines of communication open.,
Offer training.,
Bring in food.,
Pitch in when you can.,
Make the workplace fun.,
Remove negative influences.",How to Improve Employee Morale in Nursing Homes," In order to appropriately boost morale, you must understand what the greatest complaints are among your staff.


Keep the survey anonymous and voluntary. You will not get an accurate response if employees are forced to complete it, or if they will fear retribution because of their answers.
Ask about what they like and dislike about working at your nursing home. Include questions about salary satisfaction, work environment, resources available to help them do their jobs, scheduling and staffing, communication with management and relationships with co-workers and the people they serve.;
, A recent study of nursing home employees revealed the frequency of changes in shift rotations contributed to low morale.

, While your hiring budget may be tight, try to keep the number of residents each staff member is responsible for reasonable. This will increase morale in your staff and nursing home residents.

, Whether it is perfect attendance, a compliment from a family member or a career milestone reached, applaud your employees when they do good work.


Send a personal email or note of congratulations and thanks. Copy anyone who supervises or manages the employee, including the nursing home administrator or CEO.
Create a bulletin board where ""star"" employees are recognized and celebrated. Allow peers, residents and others to leave notes of encouragement or share positive acts that have been witnessed or received.

, Nursing home employees should feel comfortable and encouraged to communicate with their administrators and managers. Be transparent and keep your employees informed.


Create a suggestion box, or something similar, where employees can leave suggestions. This might help empower those employees who are too shy to have a personal conversation with someone in charge.

, Employee morale is dependent on your staff feeling capable and confident in their abilities to do their jobs.

, Bagels for breakfast once a week or a pizza for lunch or dinner will give employees something to look forward to other than their microwaved leftovers or what is being served in the nursing home cafeteria.


Find out if vendors can host these food festivities if you do not have the budget and your ethics policies do not prevent the companies you work with from providing occasional treats.
Organize a potluck once a month. This will help your employees contribute to their team members and give them a chance to eat together while working.

, If you are short staffed or something needs to be done, help out. Nursing home managers, supervisors and administrators who will cover for employees when necessary will earn a more highly motivated workforce.

, Hold contests, do raffles and offer unique learning experiences. For example, help employees learn Spanish by posting one new word or phrase daily, subscribe to magazines that might be entertaining during breaks or designate a wall where employees can post personal pictures.

, Give constant complainers and perpetually negative employees a chance to reform and if they do not, consider terminating them. One bad employee can disrupt the culture of a nursing home and its staff morale.

Decide to have a Christmas morning tea instead of a Christmas party.,
Switch that Christmas office party money over to things your employee will be more than grateful for at Christmas:


Give each employee a cash bonus or a Christmas gift bonus.,
Walk the talk.,
Thank your employees.",How to Give Your Employees What They Really Want for Christmas," Have every employee bake something and bring it in. Offer tea, coffee, soft drinks and juices and some merriment. Switch it to afternoon tea and and early going home before Christmas if you'd prefer. Just don't involve expensive food, alcohol or entertainment.;
, Even $20 per person is better than not having $20 extra at Christmas time.
Give grocery vouchers. Why not help out with each employee's Christmas meal costs?
Give a health care subsidy or gym membership.
Give shares or stock options in your company.
If the employee is deserving, give them a pay raise, in time for returning after Christmas.

, Don't be seen heading out to expensive meals with clients or others associated with your firm. Show your employees your solidarity with the recession-driven environment by eating lean yourself. No doubt your clients will be impressed by your attention to financial savings too.

, Heartfelt, individualized thanks that points to each individual employee's achievements can do more for morale and worker happiness than glitzy parties ever will. Be sure to point out two good things about each employee at your office morning tea, so that the glow of being acknowledged is also recognized by every other employee in the room, in turn. Remember that in a time when people are just glad they have a job, recognition of doing it well is a huge source of reassurance.

Keep your employees informed.,
Respond to employees quickly and fully.,
Get out of their way.,
Expand your employees’ autonomy as they gain experience.,
Have regular one-on-one meetings.",How to Make Your Employees More Productive1," The greatest way to boost your employee’s productivity is to provide them with all of the information they need to meet their responsibilities. Further, the more information they have, the more they will be able to make their own decisions. In turn, this can make your whole team more productive.As their boss or manager, you probably have experience, training, and insight into how and why your business runs the way it does. By sharing this information with your employees, they will not only work better on their own, they’ll also rely on you less.
In short, clearly articulate the objectives of their position, as well as what their contribution is meant to accomplish.;
, Providing an employee with additional information is especially important whenever your employees have questions or concerns. Whether questions or concerns are asked directly, or you can tell that some employees are unsure with certain elements of their position, address any need for additional information as soon as you can., By giving your employees more information about what you need them to do and allowing them some freedom to take their own approach, they may even figure out new ways to perform certain tasks more productively. In short, don’t make them go through your, or follow your specific instructions, if they’re ultimately getting the job done with the parameters you’ve defined.Remember that they don’t work for you, they work for the business.

, To be sure, you’ll want to check in frequently with new staff members. For instance, ask them how they feel about their position, and if they have any questions about what’s expected of them. However, once they’ve demonstrated that they’re capable of meeting your expectations, give them the space to do so without interruption., Depending on your business, consider having your employees update you on what they’re working on in weekly or monthly one-on-one meetings. This will give you the chance to provide guidance, but still allow them to focus on accomplishing their tasks.When you do give advice, be as specific and as action-oriented as possible. For instance, say things like, “It seemed to really work well when you ran the analysis that way. Try starting with that approach first for a while, and see if we don’t see results right off the bat.”

"
"
Avoid unnecessary electronic correspondence.,
Abandon the unnecessary.,
Offer to help.,
Pay attention to your employee’s emotions.",How to Make Your Employees More Productive2," Otherwise stated, don’t e-hover. It’s no surprise that people are constantly distracted by their phone, and this is partly because of how much people use their phones for work. A good way to reduce those distractions is by not contributing to them yourself.If an email or text isn’t immediately necessary, don’t send it. Instead, compile a list of things you want to point out or remind your employees of, and send these out all together in a weekly email.
Meanwhile, enforce the rules about technological distractions. Make sure everyone knows the consequences of texting when they’re not supposed to, and be consistent about punishing those who break the rules.

, Along with emails that can wait, there are many other common business practices that may actually be unnecessary. In fact, your employees are likely to point them out. When they do, don’t default to the mindset that “this is simply how things are done,” actually think about your employee’s comments when they point out something that isn’t productive.For instance, is there anything you ask your employees to do that you wouldn’t do yourself? Is there anything you didn’t find useful when you had their position? Chances are, you can eliminate something your employees are currently wasting time on, and everyone will be happy about it.

, Helping your employees with simple, everyday tasks can improve productivity in a multitude of ways. Most obviously, if someone is hit with a bunch of menial tasks suddenly, they can use a quick bit of assistance. Plus, sitting down with someone to bang out a job together gives you the opportunity to work face-to-face with your employee and increase camaraderie.Say something like, “Dwight, I saw you received way more orders than usual today. Can I help by printing the packing slips and labeling some boxes for you?”

, The emotional well-being of your employees is extremely important to their ability to focus and work productively. In fact, scientists are finding more and more evidence of the links between productivity and well-being. If you notice one of your employees seems to be down, reach out to them.While recurring emotional issues are a whole different issue, occasional emotional doldrums are totally normal.
If someone is dealing with something, reach out to them. See if there’s anything you can do to help. Not only will this mean a lot to them, it will also help them get through whatever they’re struggling with and return to their usual levels of productivity.

"
"
Ask what would make your employees happier.,
Adjust the tangible environment.,
Stroke their egos.,
Allow a flexible schedule.",How to Make Your Employees More Productive3," The causal link between people's’ happiness and their workplace performance is well established. They’ll not only appreciate the gesture, they’ll likely answer with realistic, productivity-enhancing ideas.In particular, make of point of occasionally asking the people that work for you something like, “Is there anything you think we could change around here that would make your job more enjoyable?”

, If an employee ever has a valid complaint or request about the tangible environment in which they ask, do your best to address it immediately. For instance, if someone feels that it’s too chilly or not well enough lit in your office, make the necessary changes.Adjustments like these can go a long way to not only make your employee happier and more productive, but also feel like they are being listened to.

, Stated more professionally, reward employees with things that cater to their self-esteem. In the most basic terms, people enjoy feeling respected and appreciated, and people work harder when they feel like they’re efforts are recognized. You probably also respect and appreciate your hardest working employees the most. Make sure they know it.The specific type of recognition that particular employees will most appreciate will vary widely.
For instance, some will like to be publicly praised, while it might mean more to another if you privately pulled them aside and said something like, “Alysha, I know you’ve been kicking butt lately. I want to let you know I really appreciate it, and your impact around here is extremely valuable.”

, Another adjustment you may be able to make to improve productivity generally is loosening schedule requirements. People who have the freedom to determine when they work may wind up working just as much, as well as more productively.The important thing is ensuring that your employees meet their responsibilities. If they’re able to do so more effectively on a slightly altered schedule, everyone wins.
For example, don’t insist everyone is in the office everyday from 8-5. Someone may have a doctor’s office mid afternoon, and then work from home later in the evening.
Trusting your employees with the freedom to manage themselves can often make them more productive, and it can also improve your relationship with them.

Vary your tasks throughout the day.,
Ask for more opportunities.,
Focus on the positive.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Seek feedback.,
Take breaks.,
Be aware of your strengths.",How to Become Highly Motivated for Your Job1," People tend to lose motivation on the job out of sheer boredom. The brain functions best when it is subjected to stimulation and differentiated activity. Try to organize your day so that you’re working on different tasks or projects for a few hours at a time. This will help keep you engaged and break the monotony of your routine., If your job consists of only one or two tasks, it’s easy to become bored and unmotivated. Ask your boss for more responsibility. Take on a new project or see if you can collaborate with coworkers to get a different perspective on your work. This will not only broaden your skill set and keep you stimulated, but will also show your boss that you have initiative and drive., If you adopt a positive attitude towards yourself and your work, it will be easier for you to commit to a standard of excellence. Find a way to see the value in everything you do and give it 100%. If you remind yourself of what you do well and put effort into even menial tasks, you will have a higher sense of self-worth. Plus, doing tasks well might lead to a promotion, or a shining letter of recommendation if you’re trying to switch career paths.If you’re having trouble fixating on the positive, try writing a love letter to yourself. Though it may seem a bit overly sentimental, putting down what you love about yourself on paper gives those positive qualities a new weight. Try writing down five or six things that you value in yourself as both a person and a worker, and keep these in mind when you’re feeling low at work.

, It’s easy to waste time at work by checking your cell phone, social media, or your favorite blogs. Completing your work with speed and drive will boost your motivation. Commit to turning off your phone for a few hours at a time to get your work done quickly. That way, you can associate work with productivity instead of constant distractions., Work environments can be isolating, and it can often be hard to find a sense of community. Seeking out honest feedback from your superiors will not only help with your job performance, but will also allow you to create a personal connection with your colleagues. Plus, your boss will be impressed by your initiative.


See the value in both positive feedback and constructive criticism. Positive feedback can help give you an ego boost and refresh your motivation to continue to perform well. Criticism, when viewed as constructive instead of negative, will help you to develop new skills and put renewed effort into your work., Nobody can be productive for eight hours straight. Taking a few breaks throughout the day will give you a much needed stress release and refocus you for impending tasks. Go for a short walk around the block to get some fresh air, stand up and stretch, grab some coffee with a coworker. Don’t make the breaks too long, but recognizing that everybody needs to clear their head from time to time will make it easier to return to your desk., While it’s great to work on your weaknesses, focusing primarily on your strengths will make you feel more successful on the job. Recognize what you are good at and put energy into completing those tasks on a daily basis. Talk to your boss or supervisor about what you think you’re good at so that they know what kinds of projects and assignments you’ll do best with."

Keep the office clean and well maintained.",How to Engage Employees," To engage your employees, you need to first empower them by allowing them to make decisions, much like a partner in your business. This could be giving certain approvals, leading small meetings or setting up sessions without asking for sign off from management.As a manager, you will need to present certain guidelines around this, of course. But this will enable employees to be a part of the management process, so you can make joint decisions together.
Treating each employee as a valuable member of the team will motivate them to put forth their best effort on a consistent basis.;
, For example, to discuss how to increase sales for exceeding quarterly targets, you can organize a session where employees team-up to present possible solutions and ideas to improve sales. The manager of the sales department can act as a facilitator to keep the discussion on track. This way, your employees get a chance to bring their unique voice to solving business problems., This will make them feel that you value their involvement and contribution to a high level discussion and allow them to illustrate their expertise and talent., This will show them in a tangible way that their contributions and support matters to the company’s growth and that as a manager you take their ideas seriously.

, Just as you notice what your employees do and say, your employees will notice whether or not you keep your promises and care about their ideas.Employees will be more committed to you and the company when they see you live up to your promises. So keep your promises to your employees, even if they seem small or minor.
For example, if an employee approaches you for guidance or support while you’re busy, and you promise to get back to them when you have a free moment, follow through and help the employee at a later date. If you forget and the employee reminds you of your promise, but you make an excuse that you are too busy or you just don’t have the time, this could affect the employee’s morale and level of trust and respect for you.

, The company’s plan of action should indicate where the business is headed and what role each employee is going to play to get there. It is unreasonable to expect your employees to work effectively when they do not know what they are working towards.


Being transparent and open about the company's overall plan will communicate to your employees that you trust them. Your employees should have no suspicion or confusion about management in any way. If there is a lack of trust or suspicion of bias, they will likely lose interest in their work and feel uncomfortable communicating their ideas.

, In a dynamic organization, employees must stay on top of their daily responsibilities. But your employees can only perform well when they know and understand their role in the company’s overall vision.


One on one meetings will also let your employees know if they performing above or below your expectations. Otherwise, your employees will not be aware they may need to adjust their behavior. Keep these meetings open and inviting, and be clear about your expectations.
The one on one meeting is a way to also bring to the surface any challenges the employee might be facing that hinders their ability to perform daily tasks. These meeting should be frequent and focus on biweekly or monthly goals.

, Assign specific tasks to each employee but make sure the task falls within the employee's skill set and job description.


As a manager, simply assigning tasks to your employees is not enough; your employees should understand exactly what they need to do and have the necessary tools and training so they are engaged in a task, rather than just doing it for the sake of checking one more task off their list.
For example, filing for taxes sounds like a simple task. In fact, this seemingly simple task involves collecting data from every department in the company, consolidating the accounts, and then having someone prepare them according to a format; it becomes clear that multiple people and skill sets are involved in completing this task.

, A goal that is not realistic or too broad or vague will have a demotivating effect on your employees. You want your employees to reach the end of their work day feeling like they accomplished small goals, instead of feeling like they will never achieve a larger, more intimidating goal.


For example, being one of the top ten distributors in a market with hundreds of competitors is an unrealistic goal for a small, growing business. It might be more effective to focus on improving the company’s quarterly sales or improving the company’s distributor's list for the year.

, These “small goals” can be monthly or quarterly targets. Clearly link these targets to a long term mission. Employees will be highly engaged knowing that their efforts are directly contributing to the company’s mission., This will allow your employees to get direct feedback from management as to how close or far they are to achieving their goals. Set aside the time to tell employees what they doing right and where they need to improve on.Nothing engages an employee like the prospect of a raise or appreciation in an upcoming review, so use these sessions to motivate the employee to work harder. The review can act as a scheduled “reward system”. You may even notice employees becoming more serious and dedicated to their work closer to review time.
When managers offer consistent feedback, employees feel their managers support them. By building a relationship of trust and openness, the employees will feel free to discuss even their small, rare mistakes and work on them so they do not turn into bigger problems later on.
Encourage growth and development by providing suggestions or have your employees come up with solutions to solve their current issues during or after their performance assessment.

, Doing this will help your employee feel like they are appreciated and their success is being recognized personally by a manager.A quick email, text message or visit to an employee’s office or cubicle for a thank you can do wonders to energize them.

, Even if the sales targets are not met due to unrealistic goals or aspects that were out of your employees’ control, show appreciation for small wins. This will remind employees that their efforts are not going unnoticed and prevent them from feeling demoralized or under appreciated.

, When an employee does average work, follow the average routine. But when an employee goes the extra mile, make sure you acknowledge and reward them.


Reward employees who have achieved their goals for one, two, or even five years running. Appreciate their long term focus on the business strategy as well as their ongoing contribution to meeting daily targets. Doing this will reward employees for keeping their eyes on the company’s overall vision while still managing their daily tasks.

, Whether it is the right IT setup for their work station or hands on guidance about how to complete a task, you want your employees to feel like they are being set up for success, not failure.

, Your employees may lack the skills or knowledge to perform their assigned tasks, especially if they are new to the job or unfamiliar with the work. The fear of being unable to properly understand an issue can lead to disengagement and a lack of motivation, so address this fear with training.


These sessions should link different operations of the business to specific skills that need to be learned. Sometimes it is not the skills as much as the direction and instruction that counts.
For example, simply training an accountant to handle tax filing isn’t enough. They need to be instructed on how to specifically apply their skills in a certain situation or procedure.

, For example, you can create a program where the most efficient employee will be sent abroad for training with paid leave. This will encourage every employee to work hard and improve their existing skills., As an employer, you need to encourage employee advocacy, as this gives you a chance to see how effectively your employees deal with customers. Take action to boost advocacy, as it will turn your employees into ambassadors for your business.Employees who attend networking events or external, industry gatherings on a frequent basis are the best advocates and brand ambassadors for your company. They will spread goodwill and loyalty toward your company and help you to expand your brand.

, Currently, the young employees in your workforce are interested in how the organization is helping to uplift society. They are less concerned with the company’s financial performance compared to the company’s shareholders. Instead, they want to know how the company is impacting the world around them.Getting the company involved in the community in a positive way will help your employees to stay engaged with their day to day work and with the mandate of the company overall.

, Holding events in the office will allow employees to discuss their work with each other, get to know other employees in different departments, and exchange their views and perspectives on their roles.


A study has shown that workplace relations play a crucial role in employee happiness; even more than employee/boss relations. As well, individual self-esteem will be boosted when employees hear about themselves in a friendly, positive light from their peers and co-workers.
Keep in mind that many employees are more receptive to social events initiated by their co-workers, rather than by management.

, This will encourage cross-workplace ties among your employees and allow them to get to know each other outside of the office setting., A few minutes of the meeting, perhaps at the start, can be devoted to light-hearted conversations or listening to someone’s personal experience. This will help your employees look forward to meetings and stay engaged., Sometimes, small issues such as routine maintenance of common areas, or even the coffee machine breaking down can lead to distraction from the main focus and work of your employees. Address these smaller issues and promote smooth running of the office to limit your employee’s distractions and ensure they are working in a well kept, well run, and engaging space.

Wake up early.,
Manage your time.,
Leave work at work.,
Develop conviction.,
Show respect.,
Develop empathy.,
Keep learning.",How to Become Highly Motivated for Your Job2," Most people tend to be more productive in the morning, when the brain is rested and there are fewer distractions. Try setting your alarm a bit earlier and create a morning ritual that will set a positive tone for your day.Try to make the morning your time. Eat a good breakfast, practice yoga or meditation, go for a walk or read. Creating space for yourself will make it easier for you to go into the workday feeling calm and focused.

, Making realistic lists for the day is a great way to promote efficiency. Don’t put too many things on your list. Instead, write down your top priorities for the day. This will increase your motivation to accomplish goals, and you’ll gain a lot of momentum and confidence from crossing things off your list once they’re complete.

, Let the evenings be your time to pursue hobbies and passions outside of your career. If you come home and fixate on mistakes you made that day or worry about projects that need to be completed the next day, you run the risk of letting your job consume you and burning out. One of the best ways to destress? Laugh! Call up a friend with a great sense of humor or watch a funny show to lighten your mood post work. Pick out a new hobby. Changing up your routine with a new, fun hobby will help you release tension after work. If you’re having a tough day on the job, having something to look forward to in the evening will keep your spirits up., Conviction is a firm belief in what you want to do. Make sure your career goals match with your company’s goals. If you believe in your company’s goals, you are more likely to stay motivated during the workweek. , A solid sense of self-respect will help you believe in your capabilities at work. High self respect and esteem are also easily recognizable qualities that will make your coworkers want to connect with you. It’s equally as important to show respect to others. When engaging with coworkers, even ones you might not get along with, showing them that you respect their opinion and contribution to the company will allow your relationships to develop smoothly.

, At work and in life, we are bound to meet colleagues or clients who we find unreasonable, uncooperative, or just plain frustrating. Take time to communicate with someone individually if you feel the two of you are clashing. Understanding a person better will help you see where their more aggravating qualities stem from, and will allow you to form a more positive relationship. Getting along with your coworkers instantly boosts motivation, since it makes you more likely to enjoy being at work.

, Dedicate yourself to a lifetime of exploration and learning. In your spare time, read books about things that interest you, take a class, learn a new language – do anything that gets you jazzed about your life. Exploring all the possibilities that the world has to offer lets you go through life with a sense of curiosity and excitement. This kind of attitude will keep you motivated in your career and help you figure out exactly what it is you want to pursue."

Discover what you love.,
Give yourself the freedom to experiment.,
Seek advice from experts in fields that interest you.,
Don’t prioritize money.",How to Become Highly Motivated for Your Job3," Imagine getting up in the morning and being excited to go to work. For people who have found a career that they love, going to work feels more like a hobby than an obligation. Take some time to figure out what you’re passionate about, and then find ways to turn your passions into a career.


Make lists of things that you love to do. Write down 5-10 things that get you going, and try to match these passions with plausible careers. If you love hiking, look into careers that allow you to be in nature, such as a horticulturalist or environmentalist. If you’re interested in social justice, try researching ways to get involved in a local school or non-profit. Writing down what you love to do and matching those interests with potential careers will open your eyes to the kind of life that will make you want to go to work everyday.

, It’s easy to get comfortable in a job, even if it’s one you can’t stand. If you find yourself dreading going to work in the morning, give yourself the license to look into a different career path. It takes time to figure out what job sustains your curiosity and intellect.

, If you think you’d like to pursue a different career path, talk to friends, family or acquaintances with jobs that excite you. Ask as many questions as you can on how to get your foot in the door. Not only will this help you to make connections, but it will also show you that it is possible to follow your dreams if you take the right steps towards career satisfaction.

, We all need a certain amount of financial stability to survive. However, picking a career based on salary alone isn’t always the best path to staying motivated. Let yourself pick a job that interests you, even if it’s not the highest paying offer. As long as you can support yourself for the time being, it’s important to try to love what you do. Believe in yourself and work hard so that you can get the necessary experience to move up in your career and eventually snag your ideal salary."

If many workers cite a similar workplace element as positive, work to expand or emphasize it.For instance, if many workers like the automatic staplers because they are superior to manual staplers, get a few more and stash them around the office in accessible locations.
Conversely, if many workers find something at work irritating or unpleasant, work to remedy or remove it.
For instance, if your workers do not like the piped-in music played over the loudspeakers, turn it off and replace it with different music.
Never leave concerns unanswered, or offer vague or dismissive answers along the lines of, “That isn’t important.”;
, Whenever possible, ask for feedback before implementing new policies – especially those that affect workers.If your workplace policies meet widespread resistance, amend or toss them. Bad policies and feelings of powerlessness destroy workplace morale., When your workers do a great job, let them know. Say “Thanks for doing that” or “Great job” regularly.Provide more formal recognition when the scale of the accomplishment is greater.For instance, if one worker, or a team of workers, has been pulling double duty to meet a deadline, call a meeting and ask them to stand. Lead the group in a round of applause for their efforts.
If your staff attains some significant milestone – for instance, perhaps they’ve manufactured a combined one million widgets for automobiles – draw attention to this accomplishment in your regularly scheduled meetings or in the employee newsletter.If you are not in a management position, you can create positive morale in the workplace by congratulating your coworkers when they receive positive recognition, and by thanking them for helping you out.

, Generally, provide more positive than negative feedback. If there is something wrong with a worker’s performance, let them know in a private place. Do not embarrass or berate them in front of their peers.Emphasize your worker’s strengths and avoid accusatory language. If your workers need to change something, describe the behavior you want to change rather than the worker.If you are not in a management position, you can create positive morale in the workplace by being sensitive to your coworkers’ feelings. Do not accuse them of being lazy or sloppy in their work. Instead, use positive language and gentle suggestions to alert them to your displeasure.
For instance, if your coworker wants feedback on a low-quality project, you might say, “This could use a little more work.”

, Do not dance around an issue or use vague language when describing a problem. This is especially true if there is a development that affects everyone in your place of work. For instance, if your company experiences a merger or bankruptcy, let your workers know as soon as possible either in an email or a meeting. This will help maintain trust and boost morale, even in difficult times., If your workers believe you care about them and their well-being, workplace morale might improve. You can encourage this belief by sending a signed card, flowers, or gift card to workers on their birthdays. Inquire about your employees’ families and hobbies.For instance, greet your employees in a friendly manner each day. Ask, “How are you?”
If they have children, ask “How are the kids?”
If they are in a relationship, ask “How is ?”

, Often, a workplace has low morale because people cannot see the higher purpose toward which they are working. Remind your employees regularly that their work is important and valuable, and without it, their community and the world would be far poorer.For instance, if you’re running a publishing house, remind your employees that your educational materials are helping kids learn.
If you are not in a management position, you can help your coworkers see the big picture by expressing gratitude for your job. You might say to your coworkers, “We are really providing a valuable service.”

, Discourage shouting, name-calling, and other negative behavior in the workplace. Identify and root out workplace bullies – those workers or other managers who embarrass, harass, or otherwise unfairly target certain workers for whatever reason. Discipline their behavior appropriately and dismiss them if necessary., When you and your workers can give back together at local community organizations, their morale might improve. Through such an experience, you and your workers will come away with a sense of having united for a greater good, and will use the experience to reflect on how lucky they are.Contact local food banks, low-income housing nonprofits, and soup kitchens to share a valuable bonding experience with your workers.
Instead of scheduling volunteer opportunities together, as a unit, you could simply offer each worker four or five hours of paid volunteer time per month. This could avoid the difficulty that accompanies trying to schedule a day on which all workers are free to volunteer their time, and the potential loss of work-hours if you choose to replace a regularly work day with a volunteer opportunity.

, Show your workers or coworkers that you are excited and energized by your job each and every day. Smile regularly and work hard. Conduct yourself professionally. In conversation, share with workers that you are looking forward to a great day and a bright future.Meet the high standards you’ve set for customer service and quality.
Be honest with your workers and coworkers.

, Make sure that both rewards and discipline are awarded when necessary. If your workers feel they were punished arbitrarily, others might worry that they could be punished in an equally unfair way. Likewise, if you regularly ignore people who do a great job and work hard, this could lead to poor workplace morale., If people are working every day – or even just five days per week – for months on end, it can be exhausting. After a while, the drudgery of such a schedule can cause workplace morale to decline.In order to create positive morale, grant all your employees at least one month of paid vacation per year, including public holidays.

, Permit your employees some ownership of their working hours to improve morale. For instance, allow them to bring their own ideas to management, and to develop them on company time if they seem relevant to company interests.For instance, if you run a sandwich shop, your employee might have a great idea for a new type of sandwich with a unique mix of ingredients. Allow them to develop it and, if you have enough faith in it, sell it for a limited time. Incorporate the sandwich into your regular menu if it process successful.
This not only improves morale, but can improve your workplace by introducing new and innovative techniques and products.

, If workers know they will get a bonus, they will be more productive and feel more excited about going to work. At the end of each fiscal year, provide your workers with an appropriate bonus – typically about 10% of their annual pay., Workers will feel their morale much improved if they have time to build positive relationships with one another. Often, the best place to do this is outside of regularly scheduled working hours. For instance, you could schedule a bowling excursion after work one night, or treat your workers to a day at a theme park.Don’t just assume your workers will be interested in a particular company outing. Ask them for suggestions directly, then act on those suggestions.If you are not in a management position, you can create positive morale in the workplace by making friends with your coworkers and associating with them in a friendly way outside of your workplace.

, Schedule special family lunches or “bring your child to work” days. Organize quarterly events or functions in which employees can bring spouses or families, such as appreciation dinners and family picnics. These opportunities allow you and your workers to get to know each other more personally., If your workers do not start out as happy and chipper people, they might have difficulty developing a sense of positive morale later on. Use job interviews as opportunities to screen out people who seem morose, blue, or otherwise lacking in positivity. Look instead for people who have not only a strong work ethic and an employment history that reflects commitment to their work, but also an upbeat, can-do attitude., If workers do not have the support they need and feel overburdened, your workplace morale will plummet. Be sure to ask workers regularly how they’re doing, and inquire if they need more help. Hire additional staff if necessary., If your company or workplace does things in the same way for too long, you can all become bored and lose morale at work. To boost morale, find new and better ways to empower workers to accomplish what they need to.For instance, instead of one person always running meetings, you could designate a different meeting leader or a meeting co-chair to organize the meeting agenda.

, Discourage workers from sitting at their desk through the lunch hour with their sandwiches or carryout containers. Staying inside at the same location all day can reduce creativity and morale. Suggest – or insist – that employees eat in the break room or take a walk before returning to work.If you are a worker whose boss allows you to take a real lunch break, you should do so to improve workplace morale.

, If your business goes through a bad time and you need to fire some workers, do it all at once. If you proceed with staff cuts over the course of several months, your workers will become stressed and depressed wondering whether they will get the axe next. Workers can better weather a single big shock than a series of financial and staff cutbacks over a longer period."

If you create a friendly and comfortable atmosphere for your employees, then they will be more eager to go to work every day. Here's how to do it:Create a space that isn't too cramped. Do your employees feel like they have room to walk around and breathe, or like they're crammed in like sardines? The more free they feel to move around, the happier they'll feel.
Make sure the temperature in the office isn't set to be too hot or too cold. Your employees won't be motivated if they're freezing or so hot that they can't focus.
Create a pleasant ambience through lighting. Though you may not be able to help it if your office has harsh fluorescent lights, you could make a big difference by putting up a few lower-wattage bulbs that are easier on the eye.
Make sure your employees have lots of natural light and position them next to windows whenever you can. They will be less likely to feel stifled if they are near light and fresh air.
If your environment is more casual, you can set up more relaxing furniture around the office and tell your employees that they could work there from time to time as well, if they don't have to be rooted to their desks.;
, Your employees will spend a lot of time staring at your walls, so this is a great place to catch their attention and motivate them into doing better work. Here are a few things you can put on your walls:


Put up a bulletin board where people can post pictures, birthday cards, and any relevant personal information that they want to share with their coworkers. This will make people feel more relaxed and comfortable, and they may even smile when they peek at the board.
Recognize outstanding employees. Though you don't have to post the ""employee of the month"" on your wall, you can post a small notice or write a person's achievements on a whiteboard for the whole office to see.
If your company is going strong, put up some posters that show the company's progress to motivate the employees to do good work.
You can put up a few motivational slogans, but don't overdo it. You don't want your employees rolling their eyes at your overly-enthusiastic signs.
Hang a few pictures that are easy on the eyes. Don't put up loud and garish posters; instead, take the time to put up a few pictures or paintings that leave a pleasant impression.

, Don't underestimate the power of having some food around the office. People will be much more excited to come to work if they know that there will be some food waiting for them. Here are a few food tricks that will motivate your employees:


Keep a kitchen stocked with tea and coffee so your employees spend more time hanging around the office instead of stepping out for coffee.
Bring in bagels and donuts for breakfast one day a week or month. This will get your employees to come to the office earlier and to spend more time there.
Order pizza for lunch once in a while. You can even institute a ""pizza day"" once a month.
Have snacks around the office. Make popcorn, bring in chips and guacamole, or bake brownies.
Declare a potluck day. This is a cheap way to give everyone something good to eat, and to have people talking.
Bring in a cake or cupcakes on an employee's birthday.
Create a festive environment through food. Bring in Easter eggs around Easter, matzoh during Passover, and candy canes during Christmas to make everyone feel at home.
Just remember to have healthy options available as well. Some people gain weight when they start working in an office with a lot of food options.

, Casual dress days will make people more excited to go to work, and will make them feel more comfortable in the work environment. You can institute a casual Friday, or randomly choose to add extra casual days to the calendar.


You can even make your casual dress days themed. If the Super Bowl or March Madness is coming up, everyone can wear the colors of their favorite teams.
Your casual attire can also be used to highlight upcoming holidays when the time is right. During Christmas, people can wear silly reindeer antlers, or people can wear orange and black around Halloween.

, If they've done something truly outstanding, then you should take the time to let them know. Instead of telling people that everyone is doing great, take the time to pull a specific person into your office, or to write an email or a note along with that person's check, to let him know that his work is truly outstanding.


You can also recognize the employee by posting something about the employee's work on your front bulletin board, or sending along an email highlighting the person's achievements.
If the person did something truly exceptional, like sign a new and prestigious client, you can stand up and make an announcement to praise that person. Don't be afraid to follow your words up with a round of applause, as long as it feels natural.
Recognizing your employees' individual efforts is important, but you should make sure that nobody feels left out if you're always recognizing the same few employees.

, You should take the time to let your team know that they are doing solid work as a unit, and show that you appreciate their efforts at all times. Taking just a few minutes out of your day to praise your employees for good team work can motivate them to work much harder. Here's how to do it:


Hold a meeting to discuss the company as a whole, and to show how your employees' efforts are contributing to the mission of the company. Your employees don't want to feel like cogs in a wheel, but like they're contributing to something valuable, so take the time to make them feel special. If you have facts and figures to show much your team is contributing to the company, even better.
Send weekly emails, updates, or newsletters that tell your employees that their hard work is paying off. Recognize the efforts of your team and use positive adjectives to highlight their good work.
If you feel that there is room for improvement, that's okay, too. Just be honest with your employees about the work that still needs to be done. Make a mental note of praising your employees more than you give them negative feedback. This will make them feel much more positive about the hard work that they do.

, Setting up a system of rewards is an excellent way to motivate your employees. Whether you set up a contest to see who can accomplish something the fastest on a certain day, or if you have a competition to see who can generate the most revenue by the end of the month, any contest that has a reward, even if it's silly, will keep your employees motivated to produce solid work. Here are some great rewards to offer your employees for a job well-done:


Reward them with small gifts. Give them two tickets to a movie, a gift certificate to a store, or even highly-coveted tickets to a sports game. Make sure to check in with your employees about what they think makes a good reward in advance. Your employees won't be as motivated if they aren't excited about the prize.
Reward your employees with time off. You'll be surprised to see how quickly your employees start working when you offer to let them leave 15 or 30 minutes early, or if you give them the option of coming to work an hour late the next day.
Reward your employees with a telecommute. The employee who does the most work can be allowed to work from home for a day. Just make sure this doesn't make it look like everyone would prefer to always be at home -- remember, your employees are supposed to be excited about coming to work.
Reward your employees by doing their work for them. People love seeing their boss do their jobs, whether it's to keep the company bathroom clean or make a few calls to clients.
Reward them with casual dress. Employees love dressing casually, and that employee can earn the privilege to dress casual for any given day.
Reward your employees with lunch. The employee who wins the work contest can earn a free lunch from you -- an an opportunity to get to know you better.

, You may feel like you're too busy to take the time to get to know your employees -- well, think again. If you develop a stronger relationship with your employees, you'll not only have a better sense of what makes them tick, but they'll also like you more and will be more motivated to work for you as a result. Here's how to do it:Initiate a ""coffee Friday"" where you spend twenty or thirty minutes chatting with an employee over coffee in your office. You don't have to talk about work at all. You can just get to know each other better by talking about your interests, hobbies, and families. Don't be afraid to ask for feedback during these meetings. Your employees can help you know what really motivates them.
Learn something about your employees' families. Remember that your employees are real people with real families and real struggles. If you know the names of their husbands, children, or even pets, you'll have more to talk about, and you'll look more caring when you ask about their families.
Learn something about your employees' interests. If you find out that one of your employees watches one of your favorite TV shows, you can use it as a conversational point.
Remember that there's a difference between building a strong relationship with your employees and building an intimate friendship with your employees. Your conversations and contact should be friendly and open, but not too personal.

, Having a few social events on the calendar will help people in your office get to know each other. People will be much more excited to come to work and to do their work if they are friendly, or even friends, with their coworkers. Here's what to do:


Have people go out to lunch together once a month. This will help people feel less isolated during lunch time and can help them get to know each other.
Create a team bowling or softball league. This will not only be a great way for your employees to bond, but people will feel more of a sense of team spirit after working together as a part of a different kind of team. Bonus points if you can play against other companies or branches of your department.
Have a happy hour for your employees to relax and laugh after work. This may be organized by one of your employees, but don't be afraid to join in if the mood is right.
Create a team volunteering league. You and your employees will not only be doing a good deed, but they'll get to know each other better.
Create team memories (by taking pictures, saving special emails, saving diplomas) and bring them back at a corporate event, so that people remember what great time they had at work.

, Theme days are a great way for people to get to know each other and be more excited about coming to work. During theme days, people are more relaxed, and have an easier time getting to know each other while working. Here are a few things you can do to develop stronger relationships in the workplace through fun themes:


Have a food theme day. Everyone will be responsible for cooking or bringing in a food from a certain type of cuisine, such as Mexican. If you have a diverse office, you can have everyone bring in a meal from his or her culture or background.
Dress up for holidays. Though you don't want your employees smearing Halloween makeup all over their keyboards, you can let people dress up for Halloween and even have a costume contest.
Have a sports theme day. Everyone can dress up as their favorite sports hero.
Have a Hawaiian theme day. Pick a summer day for everyone to dress like they're on vacation, and people will feel more relaxed.

Decline to give an award, if necessary.,
Reassess the program.,
Create a new selection committee every year.",How to Begin an Employee Recognition Award Program," Your objectives should be meaningful to your organization. For example, you might want to encourage teamwork or innovation. Alternately, you might want the program to reduce absenteeism and increase employee retention.;
, Your recognition program will fail if it isn’t supported by senior management. Accordingly, you should schedule a meeting to discuss why you want to implement the program.


Print off articles that demonstrate the benefits of employee recognition award programs and leave them with your boss.
Management is usually worried about money. Explain that an employee recognition award program can be created fairly cheaply.

, Don’t just outsource your reward program to Human Resources.Instead, your committee should represent employees at all levels of the organization, including management and senior leadership.You can appoint a chair and then ask for volunteers to join the committee. If there’s a lot of interest, you might need to hold an election.If you have a small business, you might not need a committee. Instead, you can work with all employees to come up with a recognition award program or just develop it yourself.

, Identify why you are recognizing people, and make sure the criteria tie in with your business’ core values, such as integrity, commitment, and excellent. Award programs generally reward the following:Length of service with the business. Typically, recognition is given for five-year increments (5, 10, 15, etc.) and the recipients receive certificates or plaques.
Outstanding one-time performance. For example, a staff member might have handled an irate customer or pulled through on a big project.
Excellent effort over time. These are your superstars who bring their A game every day.
Other criteria. Many businesses are becoming more creative with their awards programs. For example, they are recognizing employees for building morale, volunteer work, and client retention.

, Make sure to ask your employees what behaviors or accomplishments they think should be rewarded.This way, they will support the award program because they see that it promotes values they share. Create a survey on SurveyMonkey and distribute it to your staff.


Also ask them how they want to be recognized. For example, do they want to attend a banquet where employees receive rewards? Or do they want a plaque on the wall with a gift certificate?

, After taking into consideration your employees' preferences, you should come up with awards. Pay close attention to your budgeting constraints. Senior management will be less enthusiastic if you break the bank on awards. Consider any of the following:Cash bonuses. You can give $25, $50, or more. These are appropriate for rewarding one-time performance.
Small gifts. You can give movie tickets, gift cards, flowers, or T-shirts.
Public recognition. You can name someone an employee of the month and put their picture on a bulletin board. You might also hold a recognition lunch or simply praise someone in a team meeting.
Time off. You can give extended vacations or more personal days. However, you should avoid giving people alternate or flexible work schedules. They might quickly become accustomed to the schedule and build their life around it. If their performance deteriorates, you will find it difficult to return them to their regular schedule.

, Your budget will drive how extensive your recognition program can be. A recognition program doesn’t need to be expensive, but you should anticipate the costs ahead of time. Consider the following:promotional materials, such as flyers
awards
food and facilities if holding banquets
time spent administering the program
time spent training managers and supervisors about the program

, This group can be the same group that helped plan the program, or you might want to select a new group of people. They will be responsible for gathering all nominations, reading them, and then voting on who should receive awards. Make sure your selection committee is diverse.


If your business is small, the boss might be the only one who will select the winner.

, Ideally, you shouldn’t announce the employee recognition program in an email or on your website. Instead, you should explain it at a team meeting.If you have a very large company with multiple offices, consider traveling around to the different offices to talk about the program.


You can also send an email after the meetings, in case anyone missed the meeting. Also, staff might want something to refer back to.

, You can have fun with the award program by sponsoring a design contest to come up with logos or themes.You want your recognition award program to stand out from other company programs. Build recognition using consistent branding: print your logo on all communications, such as emails, memos, and letters.

, Your nomination process should be accessible and easy.Consider letting staff submit nominations using paper as well as online. The nomination form should ask for the name of the person being nominated and also provide space for the nominator to explain why.


You might need to offer information sessions on how to nominate someone. Ask someone who has written a successful nomination to talk about how they did it. Preferably, they can talk up the program.
Remember to thank people for nominating a colleague for an award. If you don’t, then you won’t get the buy-in that you need.
You also need to decide whether to share the nomination with the nominee or whether to keep it secret., For your program to succeed, you must constantly promote it. Put up flyers in common areas and send email reminders when the nomination deadline is approaching. Also include information in your employee manuals.

, The selection committee should gather all of the nominations and review them. You can have the selection committee pick recipients, or you might want them to forward their choice to a senior manager for approval., Not every award requires a public banquet. Instead, you might give someone a reward on-the-spot when you see them give great effort. Ideally, the method of recognition should match the significance of the accomplishment the employee is being recognized for.If you’re giving a small cash bonus, you can recognize the employee one-on-one.
You can also publicize small awards in team meetings or through email.
More significant accomplishments should be recognized across the company, either at a banquet or in company-wide communications.
Always remember your employee’s preference as well. Someone who dreads getting up in front of people won’t appreciate a roomful of people clapping for them.

, You shouldn’t just hand someone a bonus for $100 and then get back to work. Instead, your recognition program needs to explain why the person is being recognized. Your employees will get as much satisfaction from hearing “good job” as they will from the reward itself.

, Ask direct supervisors or department heads to present awards to their subordinates, even if they didn’t nominate the employee for the award.The supervisor should also have something nice to say in their own words. Employees don’t want someone from Human Resources reading a generic statement about their performance.

, When no employee meets your criteria, then you should choose not to give an award. You don’t want staff to think they just need to “wait their turn” before they are recognized with an award.


If you choose not to give an award, then tell your staff the reasons why. At a staff meeting, you can say, “We aren’t giving an award this year because no one met the criteria.”

, You need to confirm that your staff found the award program valuable, so consider sending out another survey. Tweak the program based on their suggestions.Have your selection committee review the suggestions before approaching senior management.


Consider also whether the program has helped you achieve your objective. Has employee morale and retention improved? Are you seeing more of the behavior that you want to create incentives for?
Sometimes, employee recognition programs backfire and foster competitiveness in your team. Feel free to scrap the program if you think it is counterproductive.

, Don’t have the same people choose the winners year after year. If you do, then your staff might suspect that the awards are rigged. Also think about including former award winners on the selection committee."

Look for a therapist whose relationship to you extends beyond the office.,
Check for a dependent relationship.,
Identify a lack of clarity in the therapist’s role.,
Listen for oversharing.,
Look for breaches of confidentiality.",How to Spot an Unethical Therapist1," In order to provide the best care possible, therapists are expected to maintain appropriate boundaries by limiting contact with their clients outside of regular appointments.This includes, phone calls, emails, texts, and social media. If a therapist does not respond to your messages outside of work hours, then they are maintaining healthy boundaries. If you and your therapist spend time together outside of your scheduled appointments, such as going bowling together, then they are violating their code of conduct.If you are, for instance, in a relationship with your therapist, they are definitely in violation of ethical codes.;
, If you feel that you could not function without your therapy sessions, or if you feel that your therapist is causing you to have a dependent relationship with them, they are behaving unethically. For instance, if your therapist suggests that you stop spending time with all your friends and family and suggests that they are the only one who can help you, they might be engaging in manipulative and unethical behavior.There are certain cases in which a therapist will recommend that you stop spending time with someone. Listen to your therapist’s reasoning in each case to determine if the person they encourage you to stop spending time with is truly harmful to your physical or emotional well-being.

, It should never be unclear for whom the therapist is working. For instance, if your therapist is hired by your employer to evaluate your fitness for a job, they should let you know that (and should also let you know if they will be providing information about you to your employer). Alternately, if a therapist is a witness in a court case, they should make it clear whether or not they are advocating for (or were hired by) one side or the other., During the course of therapy, you will get to know your therapist – their likes and dislikes, their personality, and other personal details that tend to crop up naturally in conversation over time. But overall, when you seek therapy, the therapist should focus on you. If your therapist seems to emphasize themselves, their life, and their problems, seek treatment elsewhere., When you see a therapist, you should expect that the information you share with them will remain confidential. If the therapist shares information about you with third parties – insurance companies, teachers, or spouses, for instance – they are in violation of their professional role as confidantes.In some cases, the therapist must turn information over to third parties such as law enforcement. For instance, if you’ve committed a crime or if you are the victim of a crime and there is an eminent threat to yourself or others, your therapist might be required to turn that information over to the authorities.
When you begin working with a therapist, they should lay out the limits of their confidentiality and disclosure practices, including how their records are stored.
If your therapist does not share this information with you, you should not seek counseling with them.
It is important to make sure that you understand the confidentiality agreement between you and your therapist, and recognize that this has certain limits. For example, if you express a desire to harm yourself or others, then your therapist is mandated to report this. Otherwise, everything you discuss should remain confidential.

Read the information on the CT scan.,
Read up on your anatomy.,
Find a good light source.,
Do not get disoriented.,
Hold the film in the proper orientation.,
Put the films in the correct order.,
Take note of the shades of white, gray, and black.,
Compare the two sides to help you see abnormalities.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Read a CT Scan," Check to see what is printed on the films to determine they are yours and what part of the body is represented in the films.


You should see your name and other identifying information like your birthdate. The name of hospital or medical facility where the films were taken and the date the study was performed should be printed on each film. You do not want to look at someone else’s films and become upset if you see an abnormality.
Your expectations about what you will see are determined by what part of your body was studied. The CT of your brain will be compact with your brain encased inside the thin bone of your skull. The CT of your leg or arm will be compact but it will have length; the scan will have images of your bones and the surrounding soft tissue (muscle and fat). But, the CT of your abdomen will be larger and very complex because you will be seeing things like your small intestines curled up like a snake right next to your kidneys, liver, spleen, etc.;
, The CT scan images are sharp with good definition, but they are still X-rays. The structures inside of you are shown in shades of white, gray, and black. You must have an idea of what you are looking at and what is normal.


You can go to a website like https://www.imaios.com/en/e-Anatomy which offers short explanations of CT images of the different parts of the body. This will help you focus on what is important in each area of the body like the brain, chest, or pelvis. Use more than one website and search for the websites that offer free images.

, If you have a printed CT scans, the films will be a little smaller than an opened New York Times newspaper. The best light source will be flat and around that size or a little larger. If your CT scan is on a computer disk, the computer screen is the “light source”.


If you have a large flat screen TV and DVR capability, find a scene where there is a very bright flash filling the screen and hit pause. It may not be easy to get the TV to shine bright enough. Try holding the films near any light source. You can try a lamp with the shade off, a fluorescent light fixture, or your computer screen. You may have to keep moving the films back and forth if the light source is small.

, You need to know if the CT scan images are presented in the transverse, coronal, or sagittal plane. You must have this information when you use the anatomy atlas as a reference.Imagine yourself standing up and the CT scanner machine is cutting you into slices like bread. The transverse plane would be bread slices that start at your head and end at your feet. The coronal plane would be bread slices that begin in the front and end at your back; your face, stomach, and toes would be in the first cuts and the back of your head, your buttocks, and your heels would be in the last cuts. The sagittal cuts would start at one ear and end at the other.The CT scanner is the machine which takes the special X-ray films. The CT scanner uses focused X-ray beams that are shot through your body. A certain pattern is created when these X-rays strike a special detector. A computer connected to this detector creates images based upon this pattern. You lie on a table that moves in very small increments through a large tube. A picture is taken each time you are moved. Because the tube of the scanner surrounds you in a complete circle, pictures can be taken in the three planes with ease., The words on the film will let you know which side of the film should be facing towards you and where the top is. This should not be an issue if the CT films are on a disk, but you still should check.


When you look at a CT scan, it is like looking in a mirror. The right side of your body will be on the left side of the film and the left side of your body will be on right. The uppercase R and L on the films tell you what side of the body is represented on the film, not the actual right and left side of the physical film.The anterior or front part of your body will be on the top of the film and the posterior or back part of your body will be on the bottom. , Numbers will be printed on the CT films. The CT scan cuts your body into cross-sections which are like very thin slices of bread.As you look at the images in order, you will notice a normal and natural flow. Any sudden breaks can suggest disease or an abnormality.


When you look at the special X-rays in order, it is like watching a slow-motion film of the structures and organs inside of you and how they relate to each other. If you were looking at a CT of your chest, you would see how your large blood vessels and the bronchi (the tubes through which air flows in and out of your lungs) weave through your uniform lung tissue. A lung cancer would create a noticeable disruption in this pattern.
When you view the films on your computer, you will have no issue with scrolling through the images and seeing it as a slow-moving film.

, The soft tissues, fat, air, and bone inside of you are represented in these different shades. An unexpected color in a part of your body could be a sign of an abnormality.


Dense tissues like bone show up as white areas. Both air and fat show up as dark gray or black. Your soft tissues and any fluid, including blood, will show up in various shades of gray. Different types of contrast, which shine bright white on the films, are used to better define the structures inside you. You swallow one type to show the fluid inside your stomach and intestines. But, another type is injected into your into vein to show the blood in your vessels or the fluid around an organ. The latter could be a sign of inflammation, infection, or bleeding..A specific example is looking at the shading on the CT of your brain and knowing you have had a stroke. The bone of your skull is normal and shines bright white like an egg shell around the grays and black of your brain tissue. But, there is a small, faint white area surrounded by the grays and black where the stroke has occurred. Your brain tissue was deprived of blood flow in this area. The fluid which leaked out of your injured brain cells has contrast in it. This fluid is white, but it is not as bright as your skull.

, Bilateral organs should be hard to tell apart like identical twins. The CT anatomy atlas is a good reference, but the best point of reference is the normal organ on the other side.


This will not work for organs like your liver, stomach, or spleen; you only have one of each. However, your brain has two lobes. You do have two arms and legs plus organs like your kidneys, lungs, ovaries, and testicles which are bilateral.

, A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting all types of X-rays, including CT scans, has read your films. She sent a report to your doctor with a detailed description of what she saw on your films.


Your doctor ordered the CT scan either to find a diagnosis to explain your symptoms or as follow-up for a medical problem like cancer, stroke, or a broken bone. You are a bit nervous or curious. It seems like the day of your doctor's appointment will never come. You have a copy of the CT and you decide to take a look. Reading a CT correctly takes a lot of practice and the proper lighting. Let your doctor and the radiologist have the final word on what is normal and abnormal on your CT scan.

Utilize an employee incentive compensation program.,
Help them see why their work is important.,
Make it clear how important each step is to the bigger picture.,
Keep the work environment happy, clean, and fun.,
Start the day with a team huddle.,
Give employees “project promotions.” Say Dave comes to you with a really great idea for a side project.,
Involve them in decision making.,
Equip every individual for their job.,
Use gags and gimmicks as status symbols.,
Latch onto their personal motivators.,
Listen to what they're saying.,
Respect them as real, individual people.,
Give them praise.,
Listen to what they think needs improvement.,
Keep the feedback coming.,
Invest in your employees’ lives.,
Make everything personal.,
Be a little weird.",How to Motivate Staff," Instead of increasing wages (which no boss wants to hear), start an employee incentive compensation program, like an Employee Stock Ownership Program (ESOP). This way, when the company does well, the employees all benefit, from the CEO to the warehouse workers. Since they want to reap the benefits, they’ll be motivated to do their part to make that happen. In their minds, right now their paycheck comes whether the company soars or not – this way, its success affects them, too.


This can (and should) be a program that gives them incentive they can share with their families, which has been seen to be an incredible motivator across companies.For those that are adults with families to support, it can be a huge reason to stick around for the company if their families benefit, too.;
, Presumably, the company was started for a larger reason than just getting a paycheck. Maybe the higher-ups see that, but for employees, every day is just the humdrum of the everyday. It’s work, work, and more work. Make sure they see how their work gets the company to its end goals and how valuable that is. You may be surprised that it’s not even something they think about.


Let's say you need to motivate your staff at McDonald's. They're flipping burgers and getting pretty tired of it. Remind them that in addition to getting a paycheck, they're working for a larger cause: getting people tasty food quickly – and cheaply, too. They're helping out all the people whose lives are stressed for time or money. This gives them a reason to work – because they may not have one.

, It’s easy for employees to look at data input, for example, and slack off because it ""doesn’t really matter.” However, if step 1 isn’t completed, step 2, 3, 4, and 5 can’t be completed either. Make it clear that every little thing they do helps the company be more successful.


Be sure to share with your employees the vision for the company, letting them know what exactly they're working on and why. When they don't know what their work means to the company, they've no reason to be motivated to do it.

, Imagine a group of people who work in an office full of gray cubicles with no art on the walls, where the copiers are out of ink and the coffee maker hasn't worked in weeks. How happy are they going to be? Not very. Make sure coming to work is fun to keep them motivated – here are a few ideas:


Get color on the walls in the form of art and motivational posters
Have dress-up days with themes (pajamas to work, anyone?)
Bring a special breakfast into the office one day a week routinely
Make sure all the equipment is working to keep work easy to complete
Have in-house activities, like games and get-to-know-yous for morale

, Every sports team starts in the locker room for a pep talk for a reason – it gets them in the zone and centered on what they need to do. Just 10 or 15 minutes each morning dedicated to how awesome the team is doing and what they’re doing today to be even ‘’more’’ awesome will not only get them jazzed for work, but help them feel appreciated, too.


Don't hesitate to take a couple of minutes of talking about ""how"" everyone is, too. When you get a chance to personally see that Sally is trying to type between coughs and sneezes, you can let her know that she should take it easy. This lets her know you care and gives her a reason to work hard – she wouldn't want to disappoint someone who cares about her and her performance.

, Instead of saying, “Yeah, Dave! Go for it!” (which is fine), say, “Dave, you’re fired from your normal job. You are now CEO of Side Project #1. Show me what you can do!” And Dave will eat it up.


We all need a sense of importance. When you have a large team that is all essentially doing the same thing, people start thinking they don't matter because it's the logical conclusion. Giving them little promotions and encouraging side projects is an easy way to get around that.

, Companies make dozens of decisions every day. Often, this is without even talking to the employees, and sometimes without even letting them know of the changes. This makes them feel incredibly isolated and undervalued, so do away with this by involving them in the process. They can bounce around ideas and shoot out potential solutions (and some might be ‘’very’’ good) – and you can take them or leave them.


It doesn't matter if the ideas are implemented, just that they were involved. The employees should feel as if they're on the same page as everyone, not that they're left behind. If they feel left behind, they'll eventually stop bothering to follow at all.

, When a team member feels incompetent or insecure about his or her job performance, their job performance suffers. They don’t try as hard as they’re just not happy. Avoid this by ensuring they’re equipped for their job. Give them workshops, seminars, and coaching to keep them on the right track.


Ideally, your work organization already has this – it's just a matter of knowing who to utilize it for. When you start getting feedback from your employees, you'll know exactly who needs what.

, You know how in grade school your teacher would give you gold stars for doing a good job? Now that you're dealing with adults, nothing's changed. Humans are pretty simple when it comes to some things, and little status symbols can be quite meaningful. Here are some ideas:A plastic whale for a ""whale"" of a job
A Pillsbury doughboy for the person ""raising the most bread""
Cardboard stars colored or spray-painted for star-studded performances

, If you listen to a person for just a few minutes, it won’t be too hard to figure out what gets them energized. Sit down with each employee and just get them talking about their work and the company. What bothers them? What do they see in the future? What are they excited about?


For example, knowing that Jose is excited about the company expanding to different countries, you could get him started on an international project – and that means Jose will be happy and stick around. Things like this can largely reduce employee turnover, too.
Keep an eye out for personal triggers, too. Does Jose hate mornings and in general feel a lag in his productivity? Tell him that it’s fine if he comes into work an hour or so late – as long as he keeps up the good work, of course!

, Employees aren't monkeys that should be left in a room for 8 hours a day to press buttons. They’re not robots who tick away happily until their batteries need replacing. They’re people who need to feel like they matter. The easiest way to do that that’s 100% free? Just listen to them. Start a casual chat once in a while, making it clear that you care about their happiness. In this instance, a little goes a long, long way.


You have power in this situation. What can you do to make them happier? If there's something you can do, do it! Because a happy employee is motivated, does work they're proud of, and, through it all, sticks around.

, There are too many people out there that take their power and abuse it. Just because your staff is “below” you doesn’t mean they do not deserve to be respected. If you were in their shoes, how would you want to be treated? Not respecting your employees as individuals that are trying to do good work is one of the most demotivating things you can do to them.


If you were in their position once, think back to what it was like. What kind of boss did you wish you had? What kind of boss would make you want to work?

, Everybody wants to know how they’re doing, and everybody ‘’really’’ wants praise. Take a minute out of our day (as consistently as possible) just to say, “Keep it up!” This lets the employees know you’re aware of the work that you’re doing (holding them accountable) and makes them feel proud of themselves (keeping them going).


Do this in front of everyone. This has a number of effects: it makes the other person feel like the big kahuna, it makes everyone else crave that same praise, and for those that have heard it before, it makes them harken back to their praise, raising their moods, too.

, Employees see a different side of the company than you do. Because of this, they’ll have a better idea of what needs improvement on their end. Often, these ideas will make their jobs easier, leading to more productivity.


Whether it's a more reliable copier or a different manner of invoicing, remember that small holes sink ships, and small fixes keep them afloat. Try to implement as many of their ideas as possible – not only to increase workflow but also to make them feel valued and listened to.

, Whether it’s positive or negative, employees need to know how they’re doing and that they’re on the right track. Structure allows them to breathe easier. With feedback, they know exactly what is expected of them and in what areas they can improve upon. This makes you happier too, getting your point across!


Be sure to keep the feedback personal. Don't parade about talking about how great one employee is while not giving praise to the others. And the opposite is even more true: don't berate a person openly. They'll feel dejected, unmotivated, and downright terrible.

, Mentor, coach, and align them for the future. To make them into a valuable employee, they need skills they can use for a long time coming. Give them opportunities to better their entire lives, not just to keep them punched in doing overtime. When they have a gig that gives them life skills, they'll see the value in their work.


Make it clear you’re interested in their work-life balance. Investing in their lives also means investing in their happiness. This can range from asking questions about their families to going out to happy hour to initiating a work trip. You want balanced, unstressed individuals as employees, not unmotivated drones who count the seconds ticking by.

, Getting an automatic email from your company saying, “Wow! You’ve worked a million hours for us! Thanks!” is nice, sure (if you know the HR department perhaps), but getting a hand-written note from your boss (even if you don’t know him or her) would mean the world.


Take these little opportunities, from birthdays to congratulations to condolences. When your employees can feel your presence, they'll feel like they're a valued part of the company – after all, why else would you spend this time on them?

, Imagine a boss who comes to work every day in a suit and tie, goes straight to his office, and only calls you in when he’s giving you a performance review. Fun, huh? Now imagine a boss who, once in a while, comes to work in a monkey outfit, gives everyone bananas, and throws impromptu meetings every so often (sometimes in the monkey outfit) to talk to his team, get a feel for how things are going, and update everyone on where the company is at. Which boss would make you want to come to work?


Okay, so you don’t have to wear a monkey outfit. But coming to work with a box of banana cream donuts wouldn't hurt!
Take part of your lunch break to crack jokes with your team. Laughter is contagious and can keep everyone's spirits up under the pressure of work and deadlines.
Let them see you as a person, quirks and all. Making yourself real will turn you into a person with feelings whom they respect and don't want to disappoint.

Choose a dermatologist.,
Make a list of qualified doctors in your area.,
Research their professional records.,
Look up testimonials and reviews online.,
Make an appointment and interview them.,
Compare prices and dose strengths.,
Make an appointment for the procedure.,
Share your medical history.,
Ask about reducing the discomfort.,
Get the Botox injection.,
Don't lie down for a few hours.,
Be patient for results.",How to Pick a Good Botox Injection Doctor," The best way to minimize your risks, enhance your experience and get the best results from Botox injections is by choosing a qualified and experienced doctor.However, although all licensed medical doctors can legally inject you with Botox, it's probably best to go with a dermatologist (skin specialist) if you are getting the muscles of your face done to reduce wrinkles and promote a more youthful appearance.


Dermatologists are experts at treating a wide-variety of skin problems and cosmetic concerns for the face, so your search should start within this group of specialists.
If you're getting Botox injections for neck spasms or a lazy eye, then you can expand your search to include other types of doctors, such as orthopedists and ophthalmologists, although your family physician might be very experienced also.;
, Using the internet or yellow pages, make a list of about a dozen or so qualified doctors in your area who work in established clinics and advertise that they offer Botox injections. Call their offices and ask if they have a background in cosmetic medicine, as well as training and experience administering botulinum toxin injections injections.Cross any doctor off the list who doesn't meet these criteria.


If you are getting injections into your facial muscles, you need a doctor who has specialized training in facial anatomy and a well-developed aesthetic eye. Most family practitioners don't have these skills, so ask around.
Give some preference to Botox doctors who come recommended from family members or close friends. If their experience was positive, they is a good chance yours will be also.

, Once you have your list narrowed down to under 10 potential doctors, spend a few hours researching their names on the internet, particularly their state medical boards and associations.You want to verify they haven't had their license revoked and haven't had any malpractice claims or other lawsuits against them. Keep doctors on the list who are in good standing and have clean records.


In some cases, otherwise good doctors have to deal with and settle frivolous law suits that don't reflect their competence. As such, talk to the doctor on the phone and ask them about the case.
A doctor with a clean record doesn't mean they are competent or experienced with Botox, just that they likely haven't been grossly negligent and endangered someone's life.

, Another way to find out information about doctors is to read reviews, testimonials and comments made online by previous patients. Stick to the information about Botox injections and not other procedures performed by the doctor. Decide if the balance of comments are positive or negative, and eliminate any candidates that have more than a few bad or scathing reviews.


Botox therapy can be dangerous if it's administered incorrectly, so there can be legitimate complaints by patients and not just petty cosmetic concerns.Keep in mind that most people tend to take the time to write something online only if they are really angry or disappointed, which can bias the reviews. Satisfied and happy people don't frequently write reviews online.

, Once your list is at a more manageable number of qualified and experienced doctors (6 or less), it's time to make an appointment and see them for a consultation. Ask for a tour of the office and get a feel for the doctor's demeanor and professionalism. Eliminate doctors from your list who seem too busy, distracted, rude or are too pushy and money focused.


Ask the doctor to see samples of their work, such as authorized before & after photos of their Botox patients.Ask who actually does the injection. If a registered nurse or physician’s assistant does the injection, that may be fine, but they should be working closely under the doctor's supervision.

, Botox injections are the most commonly performed cosmetic procedure in the world, so competition can be fierce and prices are more affordable than ever.Cost matters to most people, so ask each remaining doctor on your list about their total price that includes all services. Keep in mind that doctors add varying amounts of liquid to the Botox crystalline to make it injectable, so find out how concentrated their doses are.


Although there is no specified amount of liquid to add to Botox crystals, most doctors add between 2–3 milliliters (0.068–0.10  fl oz) of liquid to each vial.Make sure you're paying for more concentrated doses.
Ask if you get a discount for referring other people or coming in with a friend or spouse.
Don't always choose the cheapest fee. Balance it against your gut feeling of the doctor, their staff and the facility.

, Once you've narrowed it down to your top choice, find out if they can accommodate your schedule and time frame. Most highly recommended and reasonably priced doctors have long waiting lists for Botox injections, which may not suit you. Whoever you pick has to be able to fit you in, so keep a alternate doctor in mind in case there's scheduling conflicts.


Hours of operation is also an issue. Established clinics with successful doctors often have shorter hours and aren't open on weekends. Make sure your doctor's availability suits you.
Newer clinics and less experienced doctors are often open more days and have more flexible hours, but they might not have had time to build a good reputation in the community.

, Once you've selected the right doctor for your Botox procedure, you'll have a pre-treatment consultation and and go over your medical history.Make sure to tell the doctor about all your previous procedures, prescription medications and allergies, so the risk of complications is reduced.


Tell your doctor if you've had any Botox injections within the past 4 months because more frequent treatments than that are not recommended.If you take blood thinners, such as warfarin, you may need to stop for several days before your Botox injection to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding or bruising.
Other drugs to stop or avoid before your Botox injection include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, muscle relaxants, sleeping aids and allergy medications.

, Although most people tolerate the injection very well, some are more sensitive to needles than others. If your pain threshold is low, ask your doctor about topical anesthetic creams or gels to numb the area prior to injection. This is particularly relevant if you are being treated for excessive sweating in the palms of your hands or soles of your feet because it involves numerous injections.


The needles used to inject Botox are very thin and the injections aren't very deep, so discomfort during the procedure is usually minimal.Other methods used to numb your skin prior to an injection include ice therapy and vibration anesthesia, which uses a special vibrational massage to desensitize the nerves., You will be placed in a raised position on an exam table and your carefully chosen injection sites will be cleaned with a non-alcohol based cleanser. After any numbing procedures are completed, the Botox solution is diluted and then injected into the desired sites directly into the muscles fibers. Typical injection patterns for the face include 4-5 areas on each side of the forehead and 2-3 areas around both eyes.More sites can be injected by experienced doctors depending on the number and type of wrinkles, as well as the ""look"" you're after.


Most patients describe a pinching feeling during Botox injections to the face, but not much pain.
Immediately after the injections, you'll remain upright on the exam table for about 5 minutes to make sure you don't have a negative reaction. Then you can go home.

, In general, you can go back to normal activities right after a Botox injection, although you should avoid lying down for 2-4 hours and take it easy in terms of vigorous exercise.Lying down promotes swelling and inflammation, so staying upright for a while is important.


Consider getting your treatment done in the morning so you have lots of time to recover before bedtime.
If you're getting Botox injections in the face, you may want to take the day off work if you're in the public eye because of the expected mild-to-moderate facial swelling.

, Regardless of the skill and experience of your doctor, you will not see significant results in your forehead / face immediately.As such, don't worry and be patient. Depending on your skin's health, the concentration of the Botox solution, number of injections and the area treated, final results take between 3-7 days to manifest.


For your first Botox treatment, your doctor will likely inject a lesser amount and then touch-up the results during a follow up.
Over-treating the face can make a person expressionless and look like a mask, so patience and conservatism is needed.

Be wary of a therapist who has no qualifications.,
Look for a therapist who oversteps their areas of expertise.,
Note any inappropriate secretive behavior.,
Look for sketchy billing practices.,
Watch out for a therapist that milks you for every penny.",How to Spot an Unethical Therapist2," Depending on what state you are in, your therapist should hold specific degree and license requirements. You may see a M.A, PsyD, or PhD that is licensed according to the specifications required in their locality. Each nation has its own board or organization that grants licenses and certifications. Certain states or provinces have their own licensing requirements, too.You’ll probably see a psychologist, but if you’re working with a psychiatrist rather than a psychologist, they should have a medical degree (M.D.).There is no such thing as an unlicensed therapist. However, sometimes, you will be referred to a therapist in training, who is still being supervised and working under a licensed professional. If this occurs, the trainee should let you know as soon as you begin seeing them., Every therapist focuses on a particular subset of therapeutic practice. For instance, some therapists practice marriage counseling, others are specialists in the area of child psychiatry, and so on. Ask your therapist what their areas of specialty are before signing up for treatment with them. If they insist they are qualified to treat you instead of referring you to an appropriate specialist, you should consider this an indication that they are unethical.For example, if you have a heart problem, you don't go to your foot doctor to treat it, you go to a cardiologist. The same type of specialty classifications apply to psychologists. If a psychologist says that they ""do everything,"" then this is a sign of an unethical practice.

, While it is not appropriate for your psychologist to share personal information with you, you should be able to get some information about their business practices. For instance, if your therapist will not answer basic questions pertaining to their business practices, then they might be trying to hide something.Withholding psychological testing results from you is another example of unacceptable secretive behavior.

, If your therapist does not inform you of the fees and billing practices associated with treatment, their behavior might constitute an ethical violation. Your therapist or a representative of their office should answer all billing questions in a direct and easy-to-understand way.Your therapist should address billing schedules and practices at the beginning of your treatment.
If you are confused about a bill or have questions about how your bill is calculated, do not hesitate to ask your therapist.

, If you have a hard time paying your therapy bill, let your therapist know. They should refer you to a community therapist or work with you to develop a sliding payment scale."
"
Watch out for therapists that do not offer realistic treatment plans.,
Note a lack of improvement.,
Be cautious with a therapist who focuses on the negative.",How to Spot an Unethical Therapist3," When you begin therapy, you and your therapist should have a conversation and develop a treatment plan that addresses the problem or problems you’re interested in working on. These will be different for each individual. Using your input, your therapist will identify a set of criteria to determine when your treatment can be considered complete, a point beyond which you no longer benefit from therapy.Both you and your therapist should be on the same page about your needs and develop a plan – open to later amendment – that can help.
An unclear or inadequate treatment plan would be one in which your therapist continues to suggest or provide therapy even after you stop benefiting from it.
Alternately, an inappropriate treatment plan might inappropriately end your treatment before providing adequate help.
It is impossible to say how long a treatment plan should last. Everyone has different emotional needs. The length of your treatment plan should be based on the depth of your particular emotional needs or issues.
A questionable treatment plan is one that offers guarantees.For instance, if your therapist says, “You’ll be guilt-free in 90 days, guaranteed,” you should assume they are unethical.

, If your therapist insists that you are getting better but you express that you do not feel better, or have not found an improvement in your situation, your therapist is – at the very least – a poor listener, which makes them essentially unqualified to continue treating you. At the worst, their continued insistence that you are getting better could be an unethical ploy intended to get you to keep opening your wallet.Improvement depends on the reason or reasons that prompted you to seek treatment.
If you sought therapy because you were struggling with depression, for instance, a more positive mood or outlook on life might qualify as improvement.

, Part of successful therapeutic treatment is learning how to identify and reframe negative thoughts and feelings. You’ll never totally dismiss or forget about negative feelings, but they will take an appropriate place alongside positive thoughts. However, if your therapist constantly brings up your failures or negative aspects of your personality without helping you reframe your thoughts in a supportive, healthy way, they are engaging in unethical behavior.For instance, a good therapist might hear you say, “I don’t think I have anything to offer” and suggest that your friends and family surely disagree.
An unethical therapist, on the other hand, might hear you say “I don’t think I have anything to offer” and agree, “You’re right, you don’t seem to be very intelligent or kind.”
If you leave your therapy session feeling worse than when you started, that should be a red flag that your therapist is not right for you."

If you are an international patient trying to request an appointment online, you will first need to select your language from the list under the ""Request an Appointment"" button, and follow the instructions on the subsequent page(s).
Don't make an official appointment request until you have spoken with your insurance provider and primary care physician.;
, The three main patient treatment centers are located in: Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Scottsdale, Arizona. Be aware that the best location for you might not necessarily be the one that is geographically closest to you, as some locations may lack certain specialties.The Rochester, Minnesota campus is the flagship Mayo Clinic institution, offering the widest variety of services from the largest number of physicians.
Due to the typically cold, harsh winter weather conditions, the Rochester, Minnesota campus is less likely to be busy than the other two during the winter season; this may mean a shorter waiting period.

, After selecting your Mayo Clinic location online, you will be asked to provide information about the prospective patient (whether this be you or a friend or family member).Be sure to provide as much information as possible when filling out this form; this will expedite the appointment scheduling process.


You will need to have relevant information readily available when completing the patient information form. This includes birth date, address, insurance information, and details regarding the patient's medical condition.
Supporting information about tests, x-rays or other diagnostics is also requested.
Once you have finished the form, click ""Send Request"" at the bottom of the page.
A Mayo Clinic representative will contact you (usually within a few business days) to review additional financial and medical information before you're offered an appointment.

, This is an alternative to scheduling an appointment online. If you choose to do this, you will need to call the specific facility you wish to visit, as there is no central scheduling location.The appropriate phone numbers for the location of your choice can be found online.When you call, be sure to have all relevant patient information ready, which includes the information listed for the online scheduling procedure.
You are no more or less likely to get an appointment by calling versus scheduling online, and the waiting period is the same.

, Mayo Clinic waiting times can be as long as a few months, but will depend upon the severity of your condition and how busy your location of choice happens to be.In the meantime, continue to see your primary care physician and contact Mayo Clinic to inform them of any significant changes in your condition.


You may be able to see a doctor more quickly if you are a ""walk-in"" patient; these waiting times can still take a week or more (depending on how many people cancel and the severity of your illness).
Don't wait to receive medical attention if you are seriously ill. If your condition worsens while you are waiting, see your doctor and request a referral to Mayo if you haven't already been given one. This could ""fast-track"" your appointment.

, Once your appointment date arrives, make sure you have your documented medical history and other pertinent information with you when you see the doctor. Mayo Clinic doctors will review your medical history as part the diagnosis and treatment planning processPrevious X-rays, test results, and all other relevant information should also be included with your records.

, Before you attempt to schedule an appointment with Mayo Clinic, you should speak to your doctor and ask whether specialized care is needed for your condition. Mayo Clinic physicians are highly regarded as some of the best in the world, but are typically specialists in various fields of medicine. Your condition may be better handled by a general practitioner.


Ask first whether you think you may need to see a specialist for your condition. If your doctor says 'yes,' then you can ask her whether Mayo Clinic might be a good choice for you. Alternatively, you can do your own research to figure this out.

, This is the best way to get all the information you need before making your appointment. You can also do the actual appointment scheduling online, though this is not your only option. The Mayo Clinic website can be found at http://www.mayoclinic.org.


If specialty services are more important to your needs than facility location, you find out which specialties are handled at which facilities by visiting the Mayo Clinic website., Mayo Clinic appointment scheduling is determined in part on the basis of need, with more severe medical conditions taking priority. If your condition is not serious, is general in nature, or can easily be handled by physicians at another facility, you may have to wait quite a while to be seen.Your primary care doctor is probably in a better position than you to make this assessment; it is always best to consult a doctor before making serious decisions about your healthcare.
Consider whether your condition warrants traveling to a Mayo Clinic facility for treatment. This can be time consuming and potentially expensive, so you should take this matter seriously.

, Due to Mayo Clinic's extreme popularity and the high quality of medical care they offer, their facilities and doctors are in high demand. In some cases, another physician's referral is required in order to get an appointment. The Mayo Clinic asks that you contact them to ask whether you will need a referral.Though most patients are able to schedule their appointments themselves, some insurance companies require that you receive a physician's referral before they will agree to cover your treatment at Mayo Clinic. Contact your insurance company to find out their policy.
Even if your insurance company does not require that you receive a referral, some specialty areas within May Clinic might. This is why it is important to contact Mayo Clinic before scheduling an appointment.

Look for quality of breathing.,
Check for temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).,
Check the color of the sputum.,
Notice difficulty breathing.,
Look for physical signs of a serious cough.,
Notice if your cough is persistent.,
Look for an upper respiratory infection (URI).",How to Know when to See a Doctor About Your Cough1," Is the person having difficulty breathing? Is the person unable to talk, grabbing and flailing their arms in the air? Is the person turning pale or bluish around the lips? For any of these symptoms, call emergency services, such as by dialing 911 in the United States, because this is an emergency.
, Running a fever with a cough is also an indication that something may be wrong and the person may require medical attention. If the person has a fever above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), then call a doctor.


A fever indicates that you have a serious underlying infection or virus that needs to be treated.If you have a low grade fever, one below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), then call your doctor if it lasts for more than 72 hours.
If you have a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) or above, then this is a medical emergency and you should call emergency services immediately.

, If the sputum (phlegm) is green, yellow, red, brown indicates an infection or inflammation and you will need to contact a physician. When you suffer from a wet, productive cough, you produce phlegm. Phlegm is produced when your lungs are inflamed or if you have an infection. When you have a productive cough, you need to keep a close eye on what your phlegm looks like. This can give you a clue that your cough is more serious. Look for any red streaks in your phlegm. This indicates that there is blood in your phlegm. If you notice blood, go see your doctor right away or get to an emergency room.


When you are sick, cough out your phlegm into a tissue or napkin so you can examine it.If your phlegm is clear, it is considered normal.
This change of color means you may have an underlying infection that may cause problems., Breathing problems go hand in hand with serious coughs, since both deal with the lungs. If you have any difficulty breathing because you can't stop coughing or can't take a deep breath after you cough, you should call for emergency services. Also look for bluish or grey colored lips and fingertips, which show a lack of oxygen.


Wheezing may also occur when you find it hard to breathe.
If you are suddenly unable to breath in, call emergency services immediately.Listen for a high pitched noise or bark when the person is coughing. Listen for wheezing, crackles, and stridor (a harsh vibrating noise when breathing) as well.
You can also check for retractions (then he air makes the skin suck in between the ribs) by pulling up the person’s shirt and observing their breathing.

, There are some physical symptoms that may indicate that your cough is serious. If you notice these symptoms along with a persistent cough, you need to see your doctor to look for a more serious condition. These symptoms include:


Noticeable weight loss
Waking up with night sweats
Dizziness
Intense chest, abdomen, or rib painPersistent coughing
Shortness of breath
Difficulty breathing
Facial and throat swelling
Possible airway obstruction, such as from food or a toy in child’s throat, or food in an elderly or debilitated person’s throat
Sputum or fluid (especially blood) being coughed up
Wheezing, stridor, or barking
Retractions
Very pale and sweating
Bluish pallor especially around the mouth.

, Sometimes a cough can start be so persistent that is can start affecting your everyday life. This is when your cough causes you to lose sleep or causes interruption in your work, school, or home life. A cough is also considered persistent if it lasts up to a week with no change, despite home treatments.If this happens, contact your doctor so you can diagnose your symptoms. Your doctor may be able to give you a stronger cough suppressant or help treat any underlying cause of your cough. Remember cough suppressants are not always a good thing. If there is an infection in your lungs, then that needs to be coughed up and out of your body, not suppressed. Suppressing the cough would make the infection worse, so always consult your physician if your cough is serious.

, Upper respiratory infections are caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. These cause irritations to your throat and lungs, which cause you to cough. These will also produce colored phlegm, which illustrates the underlying cause.


If you notice increased irritation in your throat and lungs in addition to your cough, see your doctor."

It also allows you to remain at your job, and it costs less than inpatient programs. Intensive outpatient treatment is a highly focused approach that usually requires attending sessions at least three days each week.
Partial hospitalization approaches are helpful if you are undergoing a medically assisted withdrawal. They usually involve no overnight hospital stays, but do meet for at least 20 hours per week. Therapy and counseling are forms of outpatient treatment that often are a follow up to more intensive residential programs. Through meeting with counselors, you will learn about the causes of your substance abuse and work to mend broken relationships and learn skills to live substance free. "

Ask questions like, “What levels of care are covered?” and “What are my co-pays or deductibles?”
Ask how they determine whether treatment is medically necessary.

, Depending on your age and income level, as well as other factors, you may be eligible for these federal programs.


Medicaid, which provides coverage for some low-income people and those with disabilities, is one of the largest payers for substance abuse services in the country.

Decide if medical intervention is necessary.,
Ask your doctor for an injection.,
Have the cyst drained.,
Ask about surgery.",How to Get Rid of a Cyst1," Facial cysts, medically referred to as sebaceous cysts, can be annoying and unsightly but they don't necessarily require medical intervention.

Facial cysts are usually small, round lumps just underneath the skin. They may be black, reddish or yellowish, and occasionally release foul-smelling discharge. Cysts are generally more painful than other skin conditions, such as pimples.If the cyst ruptures, this can lead to a potentially dangerous boil-like infection. Prompt treatment and removal is required.If the cyst suddenly becomes painful and swollen, it may be infected.

During your regular annual doctor's exam, ask your doctor to look at the cyst and determine if it poses a risk for cancer.;

The cyst can be cut open and drained by your doctor.


The doctor will make a small cut in the cyst and gently drains out the built up fluid. The procedure is fairly quick and usually not painful.The major downside to this method is that cysts often reoccur after being lanced and drained., The only way to fully remove a cyst is through surgery. Talk to your doctor about undergoing surgery if you want a cyst removed.


Cyst removal surgery is minor. It does not take very long and recovery time is relatively brief. However, you may have to return to your doctor's office after the surgery to remove any stitches.Surgery is very safe and usually prevents cysts from occurring. However, cysts do not usually pose a medical threat. Therefore it may be difficult to get surgery covered by insurance."

, The goal is to try to get the front and sides of the mouth, areas that gargling won't get, during this first sweep.


Move your cheeks in and out, and your tongue back and forth, to swish the gargling liquid back and forth in your mouth.
Some people enjoy warming the gargling liquid up a bit before gargling. While it probably won't be pleasant if you're using mouthwash, warm water and a little bit of salt feels nice in the back of the mouth.

It is also known to increase your blood circulation.Lavender: This herb has soothing and calming properties. It also has antibacterial properties and can help with anxiety and depression.Calendula: This herb can help to accelerate healing and also has antimicrobial properties.Always pre-test the oil on a small area of your skin before you use it. This will confirm you are not allergic to the herbal oil. To test the oil, place one drop on your wrist and wait 10–15 minutes. Only use the oil for steam cleaning if there is no reaction on the surface of your skin.

, Use a hair tie to put your hair back so your face is exposed. Then, wash your face with a plant-oil based product. This will ensure it is clean and ready for steaming. Use oils like glycerin, grapeseed, and sunflower to create a plant-oil based product.

Allow the water to boil for another minute and then take it off the heat. Be careful, as the pot will be hot. Shut off the stove and put the pot on an even surface in an open area.

, Cover your head with the towel first so you can position your face 12–15 inches from the water. Doing this will cause your blood vessels to dilate and your pores to open up without damaging your skin with the steam.


Close your eyes and breathe in and out deeply. Relax and be calm as the steam wafts over your face.

, One minute in, remove your face from the steam and let your skin rest for 10 minutes. Only reheat the water and steam again if you do not have an allergic reaction to the oils in the steam after 10 minutes, with no sneezing or itching.


Hold your face over the steam for up to 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove your face from the steam and rinse your skin with lukewarm water. Pat dry it with a towel.

, End the steam session by hydrating your face with natural oils or a non-comedogenic moisturizer. This will keep your skin soft and prevent damage to your skin.


Go for store-brand moisturizers that are labeled non-comedogenic or non-clogging, like Olay, Neutrogena, and Clinique moisturizers.
For a natural option, go for natural oils that are high in non-comedogenic properties, such as hemp seed oil, shea butter, sunflower oil, castor oil, calendula oil, or argan oil.Begin by moisturizing your face twice a day with natural oils, in the morning and at night. Do the steam treatment once a day, in the morning or the evening.

If you have shown no improvement by then, you should speak with your doctor.Do not begin use of any other hydrocortisone product until you have spoken with your doctor.

, These are stronger steroids that can be applied directly to the rash during flare ups. They can effectively reduce itching and irritation. Topical corticosteroids are not meant for long-term use, as they can cause serious side effects.


These creams can cause the skin to thin and produce stretch marks.These medications must be prescribed by a doctor. Always apply strictly as recommended by your doctor. Do not use more often than recommended.
Your doctor may suggest mixing your steroid cream with a good, thick moisturizing cream or ointment to reduce dose and manage flares — you want to use as little of this product as possible to reduce side effects.

It has been effective in 60–70% of patients who did not respond to topical solutions.


Although these treatments remove much of the UV light that causes the negative effects you would experience in a tanning bed, you still may experience some of the consequences associated with prolonged exposure to light. These risks include aging, burning, and even skin cancer.

Thus, it can mean a substantial time commitment.To receive phototherapy, you will likely need to talk to a dermatologist who can refer you to a hospital that has the appropriate facilities.Do not attempt at-home treatments. Proper facilities will remove much of the dangerous UV light. If you try to replicate this treatment with prolonged exposure to sun light or sun tanning beds, you will put yourself at considerable risk for skin cancer and other skin problems.

Food allergies may trigger eczema. Try keeping a food and symptom diary, keeping track of what you eat and when you experience a flare up. This may help you identify foods that you should eliminate from your diet.
Pet dander can be a contributing factor. Most dander can be removed from dogs by bathing them once every three days. Otherwise, try to keep pets outside or off couches.

, For some people, medication can be sufficient to help them with their anxiety or depression symptoms. While a combination of therapy and medication is often best, consider talking with your health care provider about if your symptoms are manageable by medication.If you have severe depression or another form of severe mental illness, medication may be a key part of your recovery and well-being.
Make sure that you discuss the costs of your medication with your health care provider. There may be generic brand medications for very low cost, or prescription drug help through a pharmaceutical company. If you are without insurance and low income, find out if you may be eligible for medication assistance via Needy Meds: http://www.needymeds.org/

If you are having trouble with side effects, or want to discontinue your medications due to cost, talk first with your provider about other options that may not have been discussed. Avoid quitting a medication suddenly, as this may have detrimental effects.

If you changed out of dirty clothes, be sure to take them with you.
Avoid doing anything too gross, like flossing your teeth or clipping your nails, in front of other people.
Understand that people typically act differently in locker rooms than they do in bathrooms. It may be fine to get completely undressed in a locker room, but this is usually frowned upon in bathrooms.

, If the device is activated by a motion sensor, this will start the air flow. You may need to wait for a second or two. There can sometimes be a delay while the dryer attempts to “find” your hands.

, Allow your hands to rest in the warmth of the air. Turn them slowly back and forth, and side to side, in the stream of warm air. You can do this as slowly or as quickly as you want.

, This will take a moment. You may want to count the seconds in your head to accurately judge the time.This method of hand drying takes around 45-50 seconds, so don’t rush the process.Someone with a disability, who has difficulty accessing the dryer may not be able to wait for their hands to be completely dry.

, If the dryer stops before your hands are completely dry, begin the process again. With button start air dryers, one air cycle may not be enough to get your hands dry. Start another cycle by pressing the button again if you need more drying time.

, Now, your hands are dry, so you may move them out of the air stream. Air dryers that have motion detection will stop automatically once your hands are no longer triggering the start sensor.

Enjoy your citrus.,
Eat beta carotene.,
Go for the garlic.,
Add some zinc to your diet.,
Get your selenium.,
Ensure you get your omega-3 fatty acids.,
Avoid processed food.,
Breastfeed your baby.",How to Develop Immunity1," Vitamin C is an antioxidant all-star. It is thought to boost your white blood cells, antibodies, and interferon, all to prevent viruses from taking hold.However, more research is required to verify these claims.You don’t have to buy an expensive juicer. Just eat your citrus fruits and sometimes try to zest the peel for extra vitamin C.
Try to get 200 milligrams of vitamin C a day, easily acquired by meeting your daily requirement of at least 6 fruits and vegetables. You can also find vitamin C in broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, strawberries and raspberries, and more.Spread your vitamin C intake over the day or excess consumed in one go might be excreted into your urine.;
, Beta carotene is an antioxidant precursor to vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables that boosts your natural killer and fighter cells, strengthening immunity and possibly preventing and killing off cancer cells (via increase in the body’s natural tumour necrosis factor).Beta carotene and other carotenoids are found in richly colored orange and yellow fruits and vegetables such as cantaloupe, sweet potato, pumpkin, and carrots. Surprisingly though, it’s also in spinach. Eat at least five servings a day of fruits and vegetables to get a suggested minimum of 6 milligrams of beta carotene.Be moderate about your vitamin intake. Pure vitamin A can be toxic in high doses, but when derived from foods containing beta carotene, the body will only convert as much to vitamin A as it needs., The chemical allicin and sulphur-containing compounds in garlic seem to be the key components to support your health. Garlic boosts white cells, antibodies, and killer cells. The more raw or cooked garlic you eat, the better – research shows that there was a 30% reduction in risk of colon cancer for people who ate raw or cooked vs. garlic supplements.There is no recommended amount of garlic to eat and you cannot get garlic toxicity. Your breath may suffer, however!
Garlic is also an antioxidant and gets rid of those free radicals that promote aging.

, Zinc is a mineral that has immunity boosting properties because it increases the production and strength of your white blood cells and killer cells.Zinc can be found in foods such as zinc-fortified cereals, beans, beef, dairy, dark meat-turkey, oysters, and crab meat.
Too much zinc, over 75 milligrams a day, can actually weaken your immune system. Getting 15-25 milligrams a day is enough.

, Selenium is a mineral found in many foods that increases your killer cells and boosts your immune system. Selenium is an even more potent antioxidant when combined with vitamin E.Fish and seafood, plants, whole grains, brown rice, garlic, and many more foods contain selenium. About 55 micrograms a day is all the selenium you need. Taking too much selenium can actually increase your risk of diabetes and selenium supplements are therefore not advised., Fatty fish such as salmon and tuna, algae and krill, some plants, and some nut oils are great sources of the omega-3 fatty acids that promote white blood cell activity, heart health, brain functioning, gastrointestinal health, and more.Omega-3 fatty acids are comprised of EPA, DHA, and ALA – three types of acids. EPA and DHA come from fish, krill, and algae, whereas ALA comes from some plants, such as flaxseed, soybeans and pumpkin seeds, and some nuts, such as walnuts. EPA and DHA sources are more readily used in the body, whereas ALA needs to be converted in the body to EPA and DHA and this conversion does not happen easily.Adults are generally recommended to have two servings of fish a week to get their necessary omega-3s. Your doctor may advise you to take more if you have high blood pressure or cholesterol but a general rule is no more than three grams per day. If you get your omega-3 via oils or in supplements, take additional vitamin E to supplement it., Eating natural food has so many advantages, and boosting your immunity is one of them. Avoid nutrient-poor foods such as processed, refined, and fried food full of excess sugar, fat, and salt.Eating natural, non-processed (or minimally processed) foods also increases your bioflavonoids which help the immune system by blocking environmental toxins from parking on your cells. Getting your nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day ensures you get a healthy dose of bioflavonoids., Give your baby the best start with immunity passed on directly from you. Called ""passive maternal natural immunity,"" your baby receives a dose of your antibodies, immune factors, and white blood cells every time you breastfeed.Breastfeeding also supports the growth of healthy gut bacteria, also essential in a strong immune system.
The immunity you pass on to your baby supports the building blocks of lifelong immunity."

Don't directly touch surfaces.",How to Disinfect Public Surfaces1,"


Cars, buses, subways, and the like are particularly dirty places, often housing upholstered seats, scarcely-mopped flooring, and railings which thousands of human hands cling to and ooze upon.
Consider standing whenever possible, or sitting on a newspaper or other disposable object.
Instead of grabbing onto handrails with one's hands, wrapping a clothing-clad arm around the pole can provide security and keep hands clean.
When traveling, wear shoes at all times, even in hotels. Also for hotels, bring a blanket from home to sleep upon to limit exposure to hotel sheets.

Do your business.,
Look for the chain on the wall.,
Pull the chain gently down.,
Release the chain as soon as you hear or see water.",How to Flush a British Toilet2," Sit on the toilet, use it, and then dispose of your paper. Again, if there is a trash can close at hand, this may be the best place to dispose of your paper (at least until you and this particular toilet are old friends and you have a sense of how much it can accommodate).

, Older British toilets often do not come with a lever. Instead, they have a chain, which is typically attached to the wall. , Don't pull too hard or you may snap the chain or lever at the top. If the water does not flow, or flows very slowly, you may need to try a quicker movement. Don’t pull hard; just increase your speed a bit. , The toilet will continue flushing. There is no need to hold the chain down, and this may cause the toilet to malfunction. Should the toilet keep on running for more than a few minutes, flush again, and this time release the tension of the chain gently. (On a properly functioning toilet, you should be able to just let go, but older toilets may be in disrepair.)"

Some dual flush toilets have decals that tell you how much water each button offers. Others will have larger buttons for the larger flush and smaller buttons for the smaller flush. In some cases, dual flush toilets will have up-and-down levers instead of buttons. If this is the case, look for signs that tell you whether to pull the lever up or push it down (based on whether you have deposited liquids or solids). , You’ll need the smaller flush for liquids and the larger flush for solids. Be sure to push the button firmly, as far as it will go, but don’t hold it down for more than a second. Dual flush toilets usually offer a .8 gallon flush and a 1.6 gallon flush. "

Stand in front of the jet air dryer.,
Continue the downward movement.,
Lower your hands.,
Pull your hands back up.,
Dip your hands back into the airflow.,
Continue to lower and raise your hands.",How to Dry Your Hands in a Public Bathroom2," Be close, but try to give yourself enough room to maneuver your hands. Let your hands fall forward. With your fingers pointing at a downward angle, slowly move your hands next to the dryer opening.

, Jet air dryers are motion activated, so air flow will start once your hand movement is detected. Try to make this movement swift. Sometimes, slower movements will not be detected.

, Be sure to lower both hands entirely. You want to make sure that the air surrounds your wrists and hands.

, Gently raise both hands upward until they are almost out of the air stream. Move them in a way that allows them to brush against the airflow.

, When the airflow hits your fingertips, place your hands back into the airflow. You want your hands to be thoroughly covered.

, Repeat these motions until your hands are completely dry. You may even want to turn your hands so that your palms are facing upwards. This will ensure that both sides of your hands are dry.


There is some concern that jet air or warm air dryers spread bacteria and germs."

Pull off a section of paper towel.,
Press both hands onto the cloth.,
Take only as many towels as you need.,
Rub your hands with the towel.,
Be sure your hands are completely dry.",How to Dry Your Hands in a Public Bathroom3," Paper towel dispensers can be stacked, on rolls, or in sheets. Use both hands to pull paper towels off. Rip the towels off gently or you will end up with half of a paper towel.


Some dispensers work by simply pulling out the towels. Grasping the towel by the edge, gently pull the towel free from the dispenser.
Roller dispensers will have towels that are perforated for separation. Hold both sides of the towel and pull straight down on the towel edge. A single sheet of towel will release automatically.
Some roller dispensers have levers for dispensing the towels. Pressing on the lever will cause a sheet of paper towel to drop. Use both hands to separate it from the roll.
Use your elbow to press the dispensing lever. This way, your freshly sanitized hands won’t pick up any germs that could be on the lever., Placing your hands on opposite sides, rub the cloth briskly across your hands. There are different ways to do this. You can move them in the same direction, or you can move one hand up and the other hand down.

, Don’t overdo it. People generally take more towels than they need. If you shake excess water from your hands before using the paper towel, you can limit the number needed to get your hands dry.If you are concerned about environmental waste, you may want to avoid using paper towels when possible.

, Don’t be too quick. To get the excess water off your hands, you should allow the paper to rest on your hands for a few seconds. Be sure to dry your fingers and around finger nails.

, Look at your hands, are they still wet? If they are, you should keep drying them. After you're done, dispose the used towel in trash receptacles.

Try to get as many nutrients as possible through your diet.,
Have a multivitamin.,
Get your vitamin E. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that stimulates and enhances your immune cells.,
Take spirulina.,
Try echinacea.,
Take probiotics.,
Be careful with DHEA.,
Stay away from silver.",How to Develop Immunity2," The best way to get nutrients is through a well-balanced diet. If, however, you are on a restricted diet that prevents you from getting the necessary nutrients, you should talk to your doctor about which supplements may be right for you.

, Sometimes, you get almost enough of your micronutrients through your diet but need only a little top up. The body is incredibly savvy and will pull what it needs from a multivitamin and excrete the rest as waste.Vitamins A, B2, and B6 might also have roles in supporting the immune system.
More isn’t necessarily better and your body excretes extras, so instead of high doses of many individual vitamins, a multivitamin is often a smart choice.

, It also may reverse some of the aging damage done by weakened immune systems.It can be hard to get enough vitamin E through diet (mainly in avocados, seeds, vegetable oils, and grains) and your multivitamin might not have as much as is recommended so take up to 400 milligrams a day in a supplement.

, Spirulina is a blue-green algae and one of the world’s best superfoods. It comes packed with protein, vitamins, minerals, and nutrients such as B vitamins, beta carotene, vitamin E, iron, zinc, and selenium. As a result, spirulina may promote cell regeneration, fortify your immune system, protect against allergies, and help iron-deficient anemia.Spirulina usually comes in a dried flaked or powdered form that is easy to add to smoothies. Although there is no specific science to recommend a standard dosage, two grams a day is generally suggested.Buy spirulina from a trusted brand, as the algae, if not sourced wisely, could be contaminated with heavy metals and toxins., The science verdict is still out on the effectiveness of echinacea. This plant in the aster family is available in supplement format and is often taken to boost the immune system and fight off colds.Exercise caution when taking echinacea. Children under 12 may develop rashes. People who have allergies or take blood thinners or ibuprofen/naproxen may have serious side effects.
Do not take echinacea on an ongoing daily basis. Take 300 milligrams of powdered extract (or an equivalent tincture or tea) three times a day, only for the first few days of a cold., There are hundreds of healthy bacteria naturally living in your gut. Probiotics, such as lactobacillus acidophilus, have been shown to increase immune cells and correct deficiencies.The research on exactly how probiotics help you is still evolving but one theory suggests that, as probiotics help break down food in the intestine, they make the environment unsuitable for “bad” bacteria.Scientists agree that you're doing good for your gut by choosing yogurt and other food products fortified with probiotics.Depending on the source of the probiotics, whether you take a supplement or get them through fortified dairy products, one to 15 billion culture forming units (or CFUs) are suggested to maintain digestive health., Some people advocate taking DHEA, which comes from a hormone naturally made in the brain’s adrenal gland. Lower levels of DHEA have been found in people with altered immune function but little research has been conducted on the effects of taking DHEA regularly to promote immunity in healthy people.No more than 50 milligrams of DHEA a day is advised.

, Some people advocate the use of colloidal silver, tiny particles of silver – the same kind in your jewellery – floating in a liquid that you drink, inject, or apply to your skin. There is no scientific evidence to support using silver to boost your immune system.Silver is not an essential mineral. There is no need for silver in your body.
Silver builds up in your body, since your body has no use for it, and can lead to kidney damage and seizures.

Get vaccinated.,
Allow some exposure to germs.,
Reduce your stress.,
Laugh.,
Get in the sun.,
Get enough sleep.,
Avoid colon cleansing.,
Receive medical treatment.",How to Develop Immunity3," Vaccines help you develop immunity by creating a mock infection in your body, thereby activating antibodies to develop in response. These antibodies then know to recognize similar attacks from real invaders and work to protect you from infections and illnesses in the future.A schedule of vaccination, starting at birth, is comprised of protection against chickenpox, diphtheria, influenza, hepatitis A and B, haemophilus influenzae (or Hib, which causes meningitis), measles, meningococcal diseases, mumps, polio, rotavirus, rubella, tetanus, and whooping cough. Some vaccination schedules now also include human papillomavirus (or HPV).Vaccines that are made from weakened or killed germs do not give you the illness; they only cause a symptom reaction such as redness where you received the shot or a slight fever.
Vaccines are very safe, do not cause autism, and only rarely cause severe allergic reactions, if you are allergic to eggs for example. The diseases you can get are worse than being vaccinated., Natural exposure to illnesses creates antibody development and these antibodies then act to fight off infection from future exposure to the same illness.Don’t over do the hand sanitizer. Antibacterial products actually foster the development of resistant bacteria which can then be able to live despite antibiotic treatment, so antibiotics to can't do their job when you really need them. Wash your hands with regular (non-antibacterial) soap and water.
Allow your kids to get dirty, pet a friendly dog, or play with a toy that has fallen on the floor. Just wash their hands with regular soap.
Surprisingly, research has shown that children who had higher levels of exposure to infections had less heart disease later in life.Do not take your children to “chickenpox parties” or similar means of introducing natural immunity. Chickenpox can be very serious and is best prevented via vaccination.Be smart with your immunities. Some people aim to boost their immunity to certain foods, plants, and even snake venom through repeated and increased exposure. This method to acquiring immunity is not safe and can even result in lethal consequences., Chronic stress leads to increased blood cortisol levels which depresses your immune system.Learn how to deal with stress by altering your physical and mental habits, such as meditating, doing sports, eating a balanced diet, or journaling.
Cognitive behavioural therapy is one of the most effective ways of dealing with stress. Therapists assist by helping you learn to reframe and solve problems, tolerate uncertainty, and increase exposure to anxiety triggers.Studies have shown that putting your feelings into words by journaling helps you deal with your emotions by halting negative feelings and providing an emotional release., Laughing alleviates a stressful situation, releases endorphins to invigorate your mind and body, and improves your immune system.Laughter is the best medicine for stress.Try some laughter therapy yourself. Watch a funny movie that you love or try laughter yoga.

, There is mounting evidence that Vitamin D not only builds strong bones by helping your body absorb calcium but also builds your immune system.Get 10-15 minutes of smart exposure to sunshine three times a week. Take the necessary precautions to avoid burning in the sun, such as sunblock, hydration, and wearing a hat. The benefits of the vitamin D will still shine through.If you choose to take supplements, 15 micrograms a day is sufficient for adults., Your body rests and regenerates at night while you sleep. During sleep, your immune system releases proteins called cytokines. You need these protective proteins when you’re stressed or ill so if you’re not getting enough sleep, you’re not producing enough cytokines, which in turn weakens your strength to fight infections.Most adults need seven to eight hours of sleep a night.

, Some people propose that colon cleansing, with water, coffee, or other substances, can lead to a heightened immune system by flushing out toxins. There is no scientific evidence to support this and colon cleansing can in fact be dangerous and unhealthy., If you have a diagnosed immunodeficiency illness, your doctor will recommend IV or injection therapy.Immunoglobulin therapy involves the direct injection or intravenous delivery of antibody proteins to help fight infection. This is usually done in the hospital as an outpatient.
Stem cell transplantation is a potential permanent cure for life-threatening immunodeficiency diseases. The stem cell donor and recipient must be a close match; even so, the treatment is not a guaranteed success.
Healthy people simply looking to boost their immune systems do not need medical immunotherapy.

Any object, such as a keyboard, that has experienced constant fondling by unwashed hands, can be a potential dirt-magnet.

Using the keyboard example to represent such objects, one may begin the use process with a disinfectant wipe. The wipe alone, however, cannot remove years of accumulated oils and dander on the keys, so wearing a pair of gloves is an excellent means by which to avoid personal contamination.

Keep a journal.",How to Fend off Fatigue," Not getting enough sleep and regular sleep can make a huge difference. If you have trouble sleeping, try taking melatonin, a substance naturally created by your pineal gland (in the brain.)It regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature. In patient studies it has helped people restore circadian rhythm, and get back into normal sleep patterns.;
, Things like caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol. These knock your system out of whack and make it more difficult to get on a regular sleep cycle. Certain depressants like alcohol, and stimulants like caffeine contain materials that alter chemical receptors in your brain, which changes your body's ""internal clock."" Studies have shown that habitually using these substances alter your eating and sleeping patterns, which in turn make you feel more tired at odd hours of the day.

, Be more aware of what you are eating and do what you can to eat healthy foods. The more, the better. Also consider vitamins. Replenishing vitamins you don't get in your diet normally will give you quite a burst of energy. Taking antioxidants is a good way of removing free-radicals in your body, which are high-energy particles that ricochet wildly and damage cells. Taking fish oil tablets is another good supplement to fend off fatigue, because it is high in Omega-3-fatty-acids, which stimulates blood circulation and reduces blood pressure, which will allow your body to rest easier when sleeping.


Also consider using a colon cleanser. Studies have shown doing this once a year for a middle aged person, or twice a year for an elderly person greatly improves how your body absorbs nutrients from food, and will also help combat feelings of fatigue.

, In many ways, water is more important than food. You can survive longer without food than water. Since we are made mostly of water, increasing how much water you drink cleanses your blood and GI tract, removing impurities lingering in your system.

, Stress affects your metabolism and your ability to sleep. Yoga, stretching, and heavy breathing are all good ways to control your heart rate, lower blood pressure, and relax the rest of your body. Doing this before bed usually produces more fulfilling and restful sleep, which will help you to wake more refreshed and less drowsy.

, Your health will always improve with proper exercise. You will have more energy and feel better, all the way around.

, If you are depressed, see someone. If that isn't feasible, talk to a friend. There are also free, anonymous phone lines you can call for advice, or to talk to people if the depression is severe.

, Maybe the level of medication you are receiving is no longer what you need.

, This will help you track when you are tired. That could be indicative of something.

Apply conditioning treatments regularly.",How to Control Frizz1," The naturals oils produced by your scalp help to combat frizzy, dry hair. Shampoo strips these oils from your hair. Fight frizz by decreasing the number of times you shampoo your tresses each week. After rinsing your hair with warm water, apply a sulfate-free, moisturizing shampoo to your roots. As you lather up the shampoo, avoid applying the product to the shaft and ends of your hair. Rinse out the product with warm water.Always use a moisturizing shampoo.
If you have fine hair, try lathering up every other day.
If you have have thick hair, try going two to three days between washes.If you have excessively dry, fragile, and or porous hair, shampoo your locks every one to two weeks.Instead of using a traditional shampoo, consider experimenting with the no-poo or co-wash products. These shampoo free products will cleanse your scalp and moisturize your hair without drying out your tresses.;
, When dry, porous hair takes in moisture from the air, the hair shaft swells and becomes frizzy. You can prevent this from happening by deep conditioning your hair. After shampooing your hair, coat the hair shafts, never the roots, with a protein-rich deep conditioner and let it sit for five minutes. Once the deep conditioner has penetrated your hair, rinse it out with cool water to seal the cuticle., Hair masks and hot oil treatments are an excellent way to infuse your dry locks with extra moisture and strengthen the cuticle. Once every one to two weeks, coat your hair with the restorative mask or hot oil treatment of your choice.


When applying a hair mask, coat your hair with the product and then cover your head with a shower cap. Let the product to sit for the time allotted in the product’s instructions. Rinse out your hair thoroughly. Search for treatments that contain keratin, protein and natural oils. Avoid products that include parabens and sulfate.
When applying a hot oil treatment, coat your freshly washed and towel dried hair with the product. Place a shower cap over your head and then apply heat via the sun, a blow dryer, or a hot towel. Allow your hair to cool to room temperature and then rinse with cold water."

Avoid overstocking items that have limited lifespans, as these will need to be disposed of.Perform quarterly inventory checks to look for items that are close to the end of their lifespans.
A computerized inventory system will make this task much easier.
Consider limiting access to materials to prevent waste.
Be careful to always store materials according to the manufacturer's recommendations to avoid damaging the product.;
, Recycling as many materials as possible will go a long way in helping you reduce waste. Make sure your staff knows what products are recyclable and how to recycle them.Whenever possible, store materials in reusable containers that can be refilled by your distributor.
Some distributors will allow you to return containers used to store radioactive isotopes.
You can sell items like metal drums, wood pallets, and used and spoiled film to recyclers.
Certain chemicals, such as formaldehyde, can be reused.
Consider purchasing refillable ink cartridges for your printers.
If you do not have sufficient volume of recyclable materials, consider working with other local hospitals to create a shared recycling area.
Consider composting waste from your cafeteria, and even using compostable plates., Some materials create more waste than others, so be sure to consider the environmental impact of all of the materials used by the hospital. It may not always be possible to use a greener alternative, but do so whenever you can. Some materials to avoid whenever feasible are:


Aerosol cans
Non-rechargeable batteries
Any construction materials (flooring, countertops, etc.) that are not resistant to solvents
Cleaning products that contain zinc, tributyl tin, phenolics, or chromium
Oil-based paints
Chlorinated solvents
Equipment that contains mercury

, Do a thorough review of all routine procedures performed in your hospital and look for areas where material usage can be decreased. For example, employees may be filling containers with more of certain solutions than necessary.In some cases, you may be able to solve this problem with training, but in other cases you may need to reevaluate the size of the containers provided.

, Be sure your equipment is not using more materials than necessary by inspecting it routinely. Look for leaks and anything else that may cause inefficiency., It may seem like a small change, but having janitors clean with microfiber mops instead of traditional loop mops will reduce your usage of water and cleaning chemicals, while also decreasing the risk of cross-contamination."

Cleanse your liver by reducing your intake of alcohol and caffeinated beverages. Recent research however indicates that decaffeinated coffee may help lower elevated liver enzyme levels. Replace these beverages with non-alcoholic beverages to allow your liver to regenerate, flush itself clean and function properly. Read on to find out what liquids are good for the liver.;
, Detoxify your liver and flush toxins out by drinking at least 2 quarts of water every day. Drinking lots of water will keep you hydrated, which naturally encourages cell regeneration. It will also allow the liver to filter out more toxins and residue, letting it work faster and increasing your energy level.

, Drink lemon juice in water or tea once a day. Lemon juice stimulates the liver's bile production to help push toxins out. It also prevents the buildup of gallstones and promotes digestion and liver function in the movement of gastric juices.

, Green tea is rich in catechins, a type of plant antioxidant that boosts liver function and helps reduce fat storage in the liver., Fruits like strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries all enhance the health of the liver. These fruits have organic acids that lower sugar blood levels, and will help you to burn fat, decreasing your chances of fatty liver diseases., Fasting is a sure-fire ways to cleanse the liver. Most fasts involve eating only fruits and vegetables, or drinking only fruit and veggie juices, for a certain period of time. There are many different cleanses out there--you have to pick one that is right for your body.


You should consider consulting a nutritionist or doctor before you embark upon a fast.

, Foods that are processed and contain lots of preservatives, fats and cholesterol can cause the liver to become congested and clogged with fat residue. Clean out your liver by avoiding processed or fatty foods to allow the liver to unblock itself and regenerate cells.Avoid fast food. In particular, try to avoid deep fried food or preserved meat (such as sausage, bacon, corned beef, etc.)
Avoid bad fats. Fatty red meat, deep fried food, and processed fats should all be avoided, as they can clog up your liver. Processed fats include margarine, shortening, and hydrogenated oils.
Avoid artificial sweeteners, colorings, and preservatives. It is best to go the natural route when cleansing your liver.

, Certain vegetables contain nutrients like beta carotene that stimulate liver cells and protect the liver from toxins. Dark, leafy greens like spinach encourage cell growth and stimulate the liver, while beets protect bile ducts in the liver from toxin damage. Aim for 5 servings of vegetables daily and include those that contain liver-aiding nutrients.


Greens that promote liver health include dandelion greens, bitter gourd, arugula, mustard greens, chicory and spinach.

, Garlic has sulfur-containing compounds that activate liver enzymes that work to flush out any toxins that might be in your system. Garlic also contains allicin and selenium, two nutrients that protect the liver from damages caused by toxins. These two nutrients also aid in the detoxification process.


If you can’t stand the taste of garlic because you simply don’t like it (or you’re a vampire) you can purchase garlic supplements at your local health store.

, Grapefruit is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, both of which promote a healthy liver cleanse. Grapefruit boosts detoxification enzymes in the liver and has a flavonoid compound known as naringenin which causes the liver to burn fat rather than store it. Be careful however, because large amounts of grapefruit can inhibit a liver enzyme called cytochrome P450, which can affect the way certain foods and drugs are broken down in the body.

, Avocados are delicious and have glutathione-producing compounds. These compounds help to prevent the liver from toxic overload.

, Walnuts have high levels of l-arginine (an amino acid) glutathione, and omega-3 fatty acids which help to cleanse the liver of disease-causing ammonia. Extracts of their shells are used in many liver-cleansing formulas.

, Natural herbs like burdock and dandelion root are all said to help rid the body of toxins while protecting liver cells and promoting healthy liver function. All can be found in capsule or tablet form and dandelion root also comes in some herbal teas. Adding these supplements to your daily diet may help cleanse your liver and regulate its function.

, Soya Lecithin granules contain phospholipids which help protect the liver. Soya Lecithin granules are available in most health food stores.

, Magnesium promotes bile production, which in turn promotes the cleansing of the liver. You can take magnesium supplements to increase your liver health.Another way to get your magnesium is by dissolving a tablespoon of Epsom salt in warm water and drinking this mixture once or twice a month. Epsom salt contains a high amount of magnesium.

, Turmeric boosts the liver’s ability to produce bile, a key part of the liver-cleansing process. It has also been known to help regenerate damaged liver cells., Milk thistle promotes the growth and health of liver cells. Milk thistle contains silymarins, which are antioxidants that fight oxidation, a process that damages liver cells. It also enhances protein synthesis in the liver.

, Stressful situations release hormones and endorphins in the bloodstream, which, in turn, deposit toxins in the liver and slow it down. Eliminate stress in any areas of your life that you can.


Consider anti-stress activities like yoga and meditation.

, When you expose yourself to chemicals, your liver has to work overtime to keep you healthy. Reduce the number of chemicals you are exposed to by using cleaning products made from natural ingredients. Also helps to use organic and natural products for you own personal hygiene.

, The more toxins in the air, the more toxins your liver has to remove from your body. Air purifiers are particularly good investments if you live in the city or near a highway, as cars deposit many toxins into the air.

, Exercise helps you maintain a healthy body weight, which in turn lowers your risk of fatty liver disease. Exercise also improves the function of liver enzymes. However, excessive weight training is connected with elevated liver enzymes, which is why you should stop exercising 48 hours prior to a liver function test.

Acquire a denture brush.,
Accident-proof your workspace.,
Apply warm water and cleaning product.,
Brush.,
Rinse.,
Use your dentures.",How to Clean Dentures1," A denture brush is recommended in order to clean all areas of the denture. If you prefer to use an ordinary toothbrush, use extra attention to reach all curved areas of your dentures. If you wear a single denture, you will need a separate brush for your denture in order to preserve the condition of the toothbrush you use on your natural teeth., Start by accident-proofing the surface you will work over. Place a face cloth in the bottom of the sink and partially fill the sink with water to provide a cushion should the denture be dropped. Dentures can break if dropped on a hard surface.


Grasp the dentures in your non-dominant hand, but don't squeeze too hard. Dentures can break.

, You can use a gel or paste specifically designed for dentures or a little soap or other mild, non-toxic cleansing agent. Don't use regular toothpaste or any powdered or abrasive cleaners. They may scratch the denture and provide places for bacteria to thrive and may irritate your oral mucosa., With the denture brush in your dominant hand, brush all areas of the denture. Ensure that the bristles reach all the grooved and curved areas. Don't scrub too hard, though, as you don't want to damage your dentures.Rigorous brushing will help prevent the formation of tartar.

, Under running water, use the brush to rinse away remaining cleanser and debris. Inspect your denture for cleanliness. Areas that feel ""slippery"" may indicate that there is still plaque on the surface., Now you can place the dentures back in your mouth if you are ready to wear them, or, if not, you can place them in water to soak them overnight."

Remove excess water from your hair.,
Apply a serum to your damp hair.,
Blow dry your hair.,
Curl or straighten your hair with care.,
Keep flyaways at bay.",How to Control Frizz2," After showering, people commonly use a bath towel to squeeze the excess water from their hair. Rubbing a towel vigorously against frizz-prone hair, however, further damages the cuticle and increases your susceptibility to frizz. Instead of using a common bath towel, gently pat and squeeze water from your hair with a microfiber towel or cotton shirt., Silicone-based hair serums are ideal for people with dry, frizzy hair. These products will protect your tresses from the sun and humidity. Prior to blow drying, apply the serum to your damp hair.


If you have thin hair, avoid serums that are ""extra-moisturizing."" The additional oil may weigh down your hair. Search for a product that contains Indian Alma oil.
If you have thick, wavy hair, purchase a serum that claims to be ""extra-moisturizing."" Look for products that contain Alma or Argan oils.
If your hair is coarse and curly, you need a product that will moisturize and curl your hair. Purchase products that contain coconut oil., While heat from a blow dryer can further damage dry hair, the moisture your hair absorbs while air drying causes unwanted frizz. Following a shower, never let your hair air dry for too long. Apply an anti-frizz shine serum to your wet locks and blow dry your hair as soon as possible to lay down the cuticle.Invest in a high-quality, ionic ceramic blow dryer. Ionic blow dryers help to press down the cuticle and keep frizz-inducing moisture out.Set your blow dryer to a medium or low heat setting. High heat can cause the cuticle to swell.
When drying your hair, use a round natural bristle brush, such as a boar bristles, to help smooth and distribute the natural oils of your hair.If you have curly hair, use the diffuser tool and your fingers. It will help your curls dry evenly., Excessive exposure to heat can further damage your dry, frizzy hair. When you use a curling iron or straightener, take a few additional measures to protect your tresses.


Limit your use of heated tools.
Always apply a heat-protecting serum to your hair prior to curling or straightening it.
Set your heated tool to a temperature between 350℉ to 450℉. Applying such a high heat to your hair seems counter-intuitive, but it actually significantly reduces your hair’s exposure to heated tools. The higher the temp, the fewer times you have to go over a section of hair to achieve the desired results.
Invest in high-quality tools., People with frizzy hair tend to have flyaways, little pieces of hair that stick straight-up. After styling your hair, lightly spray your locks with an alcohol-free hairspray. The hairspray with set your style in place and prevent flyaways.


If you have kinky, wavy, or curly hair, spray the hair spray directly into your palm. Rub your hands together and then pat the areas of your hair that are prone to flyaways."

Get regular trims.,
Protect your hair at night.,
Avoid brushing dry hair.,
Avoid over processing your hair.",How to Control Frizz3," Split ends increase the presence of frizz. To help keep frizz and split ends at bay, schedule a trim every eight weeks. Frequent trims will increase the health of your hair by preventing new splits and breaks from occurring., Throughout the night, your hair can come into contact with fabrics that roughen up the cuticle and cause frizz. This form of damage is completely preventable and avoidable. Swap your cotton or synthetic-blend pillow case with a silk or satin pillowcase. You may also choose to sleep with a silk scarf wrapped around your head., Once your hair dries, you should not run a brush through your tresses. When you brush dry hair, you disrupt the cuticle and stretch out the strand. Both can lead to breakage and frizz. If you must brush your frizz-prone hair, wet your fingers and comb through your locks gently., Frizz-prone hair is fragile and must be treated with care. Harsh chemical treatments, such as relaxers, perms, and hair dyes, can remove the moisture from your already dry hair. When your hair lacks moisture, it becomes brittle and prone to breakage and frizz."

Handle hazardous waste correctly.,
Control spills.,
Be mindful of plumbing.,
Develop a pesticide control program.,
Talk to the lab manager about chemical usage.,
Consider treatment or recovery systems.",How to Control Environmental Pollution Risks in a Hospital2," It is critical that your entire staff know how to handle and dispose of hazardous materials. If the staff is thoroughly trained, it reduces the risk of contamination of other patients.Consider hanging informational posters around your hospital that explain how to dispose of different types of waste.Using red ""hazardous material"" bags or canisters for appropriate waste will cut down on the accidental handling of hazardous and potentially dangerous material.
Having separate disposal containers for hazardous wastes also reduces the unnecessary use of these containers for nonhazardous materials.
Store hazardous materials away from nonhazardous materials to avoid contamination.
Always keep radioactive materials segregated, centrally processed, and properly labelled

, In case of a spill, handle it properly to avoid contaminating the surrounding area. You should also be proactive in preventing spills and leaks whenever possible.You should create a spill containment system around your storage area to prevent leaking materials from spreading to other areas.
When a spill is detected, be sure to scoop up and reincorporate as much of the material as possible. The remaining material should be cleaned using commercial absorbents and disposed of according to all federal and local laws.
Prevent spills in the first place by lifting drums with the proper equipment instead of tipping them. Always use pumps to transfer hazardous materials into smaller containers.
Inspect containers regularly for signs of corrosion. This will help prevent the deterioration from becoming so bad that it causes a leak.
Keep containers covered. This will not only prevent spills, but will also minimize airborne emissions of toxic chemicals.

, Chemicals can damage plumbing drains, which may cause the leaching of toxic substances like mercury. If you are ever unsure if a chemical is safe to dispose of in a drain, don't do it., If chemical pesticides are used, be sure to maintain a log indicating when and where they were applied. Take care not to use pesticides in areas where patients or employees might be exposed to them.Use non-chemical pest-control methods whenever possible.

, In some cases, there may be less hazardous compounds that can be used in place of more traditional ones. Tell all lab managers to think of ways to reduce their usage of hazardous chemicals like mercury whenever possible.For example, zinc fixatives can be used in place of mercury fixatives in certain applications.

, There are treatment systems available that can recover certain substances from wastewater, and others that can detoxify certain substances, meaning that you do not have to treat them as hazardous materials when disposing of them. Such a system might be cost-effective if you deal with large volumes of these materials.Treatment systems are useful for chemicals like formaldehyde.
Recovery systems are useful for contaminants like silver, which is commonly introduced into wastewater by radiology equipment.

Choose low-VOC materials.,
Have the correct particle filter.,
Circulate your air properly.,
Avoid incineration.,
Contain germs.",How to Control Environmental Pollution Risks in a Hospital3," When constructing or renovating a hospital, choose materials that are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These may cost a bit more, but they will reduce the levels of toxic chemicals in the air inside your hospital. Keep this in mind when selecting materials like:Carpet
Paint and other finishes
Caulk
Adhesives
Cleaning products, particularly floor waxes and strippers, Hospitals should invest in a proper particle filter to maintain an acceptable level of air quality in their buildings. The correct type of filter for your hospital will depend on a variety of factors, including the existing ventilation system and the location.If you are not sure what kind of filter your hospital should have, hire a consultant.
Be sure to maintain your filtration system and change the filter regularly in order to prevent air from bypassing the system.

, In order to improve indoor air quality, it is important to have a system that allows clean air to circulate into the building. A system that provides 100 percent outside air with no air recirculation offers the best improvement., Incinerating waste can cause the air inside your hospital to become contaminated with toxic chemicals like dioxin. For this reason, seek out alternate methods of waste disposal if your hospital still relies on an incinerator.Recycling and reducing waste will help you greatly reduce the costs associated with properly disposing of waste.

, Be sure to take all reasonable precautions to reduce the transmission of germs that are spread by contact and by air from patients to visitors, staff, and other patients at your hospital.Have negative air pressure in hospital rooms.
Use single rooms whenever possible.
Keep the doors to patients' rooms closed except for entry and exit.

Clean the container.",How to Clean Dentures2," Having the dentures out of your mouth for a period of time each day gives your tissues a rest from the constant contact. While out of your mouth, the denture should be kept moist. Soaking them overnight is a good way to do this., Soaking your dentures in a chemical solution helps to loosen stains and deposits that can then be rinsed or brushed away. Specifically designed denture soak products are often also anti-microbial and offer other benefits., Select a container with a fitted cover that is the appropriate size for your denture. Make sure you account for displacement of the liquid when selecting a container.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparation and length of soaking time. Use only warm water in order to promote the action of the cleanser. Hot water can distort the shape of your denture., Ensure that the denture is completely submersed in the solution and cover the container. Do not leave any part of your denture out of the water or exposed to air., In the morning when you remove your dentures from the solution, rinse to remove chemicals and debris, and then brush your denture before putting it in your mouth., Empty and clean the soaking container. Pour out the used denture solution and clean the container thoroughly to make it ready for the next use. You will want to do this daily to ensure your dentures are as clean and fresh as possible.

End the conversation with a mutually acceptable plan.",How to Confront Others About Their Poor Hygiene," Making sure that you have a particular result in mind will help you plan for the difficult conversation. Know the specific changes that you want to see in your friend or colleague’s behavior and be clear about why those changes are important.Avoid examining his or her personality; keep your goals focused on behaviors.
Write your goal down so that you can keep it as a reference as you plan the conversation.;
, If you’re in a workplace, then take a look at your company’s dress code, in case your colleague simply doesn't know the standards. If you’re dealing with a friend or family member, think of ways that you can present the situation that will reflect his or her personal values or beliefs.Know your company's dress code, if you’re speaking with a colleague or employee.
It’s possible that the person simply doesn’t know that they have a problem, as they may have a decreased ability to smell or are unaware of how to care for his or her hygiene.Some people may view hygiene as a community obligation, rather than a simply personal one, so be aware of potential cultural values that you can point to as support for improving the situation., Some health conditions or mental illnesses can contribute to difficulties in managing personal hygiene, so it’s important to be aware that discussing this topic may bring up other issues.


Depression can cause anxiety, a sense of helplessness, and deep sadness that may interfere with a sufferer’s ability or desire to maintain good hygiene.Certain illnesses of and damage to the brain or nervous system may affect a sufferer’s physical ability to care for him or herself, and so add to a lack of good hygiene.Drug or alcohol abuse can cause confusion, fatigue, memory loss, and lack of attention, which may all contribute to less attention to personal hygiene., You may be concerned about the other person’s feelings, or you may have difficulty bringing up challenging issues with others. If you mentally prepare yourself by focusing on the goal and eliminating any extra emotions, you’ll feel more confident in the conversation.Make a list of all outside issues and emotions that are causing you anxiety and plan to leave them out of the conversation.
Remember that this discussion will be painful, but it will definitely help your friend or colleague in the long run. Focus on the long-term benefits for his or her relationships, professional success, and self-confidence.

, Although you don’t want to “gossip” about the situation, it’s important to be sure that you’re focused on the goals of the conversation and that you can feel more confident about your approach.Ask your supervisor, friend, or mentor (preferably someone who does not know the person or is not affected by the situation) to give you feedback on your tone of voice, the evidence you’re including, and potential challenges you might face during the conversation.

, The person may not realize that there’s a problem, and he or she may be humiliated and defensive. The conversation, even if you’re gentle and have the best intentions, may alienate your friend or colleague. He or she may even begin shouting or involve you in a physical altercation.Include a mentor or another friend as a support system to help you prepare and to be present during the difficult conversation.
Be aware that this kind of conversation, if it’s with a colleague, may be construed as bias or harassment, and may put you at risk of legal action., Have the mindset that you will both be able to speak and listen well, and that you’ll come to an understanding that is satisfactory for both of you.Consider meditation for calming your fears and helping increase your mindfulness, and thus your confidence.Imagine a positive and encouraging conversation, and see yourself as calm, compassionate, and honest in your mind's eye. Imagining your ""best possible self"" may both help your confidence, and also may improve your optimism for a successful meeting.Make a list of the results of a successful conversation, both in your relationship and in that person's life. Write down the positive meanings for negative consequences, too, so that you can maintain an optimistic outlook throughout the process., Rather than making a public demand or writing a letter, call or speak with your friend or colleague in person.A conversation is not an argument, so use direct, but warm, tones and general language when you ask for a meeting, such as, ""If you have a minute, I'd like to set up a time to speak with you this week.""
Sending an email message is acceptable, although it may cause some anxiety because it’s less personal and may seem cold or unfeeling.

, Although the person may push you for details right away, it’s best to make sure that you both have sufficient time for a full conversation. Rushing through between appointments or when you have other plans may lead to confusion and hurt feelings.Meeting at the end of the workday is the best option for a co-worker or employee, so that he or she doesn’t feel self-conscious all day long.Plan to set your cell phone to the “Do Not Disturb” setting during the time you choose so that you can avoid distractions and interruptions.

, Body language and facial expressions make up a significant part of our communication, so meeting in person is important if you want to protect your relationship, whether professional or personal.Video conferencing, such as Skype or Google Hangouts, is an option, though it can feel impersonal and distant, and you risk technological problems and misunderstandings.
A phone meeting might be acceptable, but it may lead to more awkwardness, since you can’t see each other’s expressions or body language.
Email isn’t really useful, as the conversation is delayed and broken up, and you can’t see one another’s body language or hear tones of voice. Additionally email poses privacy concerns., Choose a safe, neutral space, like a conference room, outdoor park, or a study area, so neither party has too much dominance in the conversation. If one person feels less powerful in the room, he or she may feel even more nervous or defensive about the situation.Avoid crowded public places, like coffee shops or restaurants, that might lead to greater embarrassment and a more emotional response.
Your office may feel like the principal’s office to your colleague, and there may be more interruptions. These interruptions will hurt your chances of having a calm and thoughtful conversation., Although it’s kinder, and more effective, to meet one-on-one, try to request that another friend, mentor, or supervisor be available at the time you’re meeting. He or she can help you to deal with difficult emotional responses or challenging questions. If you feel uncomfortable being alone with your co-worker or friend in this situation, then have your support person present during the conversation itself.
If your coworker is of the opposite gender, be aware of cultural values that may interfere with or complicate the conversation., The most important outcome is a relationship that survives the conversation. Keep this mindset throughout the conversation to help with awkwardness and to keep you on track.A friend needs to know that your relationship is important to you and that you’re having this conversation because you care about his or her well being. ""Your friendship means a lot to me, and I wanted to meet with you because I'm concerned about you.""
A co-worker or employee needs to hear that his or her work is valued and that his or her job isn’t at risk. ""I'm glad to have you on our team, and I want our working relationship to continue to be successful."", Be specific about the problem, as being vague in order to spare the person's feelings might lead to misunderstandings. Use as much respect, kindness, and compassion as you can, but present the issue clearly.Keep your body language open to encourage your friend or colleague to trust that you want to help them.
Avoid statements with generalizations like “You never” or “You always.” These phrases will put the person on the defensive, which will distract from the issue at hand and cause even more discomfort for both of you. Use only “I” statements to explain your feelings rather than blaming your friend or co-worker. Focus on the reasons that good personal hygiene is important for your relationship, whether personal or professional.Don’t use anyone else’s comments about the person’s hygiene as evidence of the problem, as this will just make the person feel more humiliated and isolated.

, It’s easier to discuss clothing, as most workplaces have a dress code, even if it’s business casual. These standards will help you explain your position. Friends may also be more receptive if you begin with more surface concerns.You may need to explain the term “business casual,” or, in a more informal workplace, explain the difference between “casual” and “inappropriate” or “messy.”
If finances are an issue and the person brings it up here, you can later offer some suggestions for shopping on a limited budget. ""I understand financial struggles; I've been there, and I have learned a lot about how to find good deals on quality clothing.""

, This portion of the conversation will be the most uncomfortable for both of you, but you should bring it up as directly, yet warmly, as you can. Don’t make any assumptions about the cause of the odor, instead, suggest that the person may need to wash clothes more often or shower more regularly, or that it may be a health issue.""I also want to talk with you about something that's difficult to bring up, and we'll probably both feel pretty awkward. I am concerned about your hygiene habits. I've noticed some odors that seem to follow you from place to place.""
Leave the cause open-ended so that the person can explain if they feel comfortable doing so. Hygiene is a personal issue, so he or she may not want to offer details about their habits or problems. ""You don't need to explain your situation to me, although I'll be willing to listen if you want to.""
Try to explain that body odor issues may be a “violation of employee dress code. At our business, we need to maintain a particular level of professionalism, and that includes everything from appropriate attire to overall hygiene."", It’s important to let the person have a chance to respond to the situation, especially since learning that other people are bothered by one’s poor personal hygiene can be distressing.Let the person express the emotions they need to, even if that means they are visibly upset and this is uncomfortable for you.
Don’t interrupt unless he or she asks you a question. While interrupting is sometimes a useful strategy, in this case, you don’t need to assert control over this part of the conversation.Pay attention to both what the person says and how he or says it. Note verbal and non-verbal cues, and be ready to summarize and reflect on his or her response before you continue., In an awkward conversation, it’s easy to be distracted by side issues, emotions, or a desire to be overly kind. Stay focused on explaining the issue and the changes in behavior you’d like to see.Let him or know you understand his or her feelings, but you need to keep on track: ""Thank you for being honest with me about your feelings. Let's talk about how we can solve this problem together.""
If the person becomes defensive, remember to reaffirm the relationship and his or her value as a friend or employee, but be clear that personal hygiene is an important aspect of his or her success, both personally and professionally.
Be ready to redirect the conversation back to personal hygiene and the ways you can help, especially if the person now seems to think that he or she is worthless as a friend or employee.
If an employee shares that his or her poor hygiene is related to depression, then show genuine compassion and urge him or her to seek counseling. You should still express that employees should practice good hygiene when coming to work., Explain your expectations for the person’s hygiene, and then offer your help with any aspects of good habits that seem difficult for him or her. Revisit the strengths of your relationship and the positive outcomes of the conversation: ""I'm so glad you took the time to talk with me. Our relationship/your work is important, so let's talk about how we can move forward.""Young college students, for instance, may not know how to do their own laundry, so offer him or her suggestions for detergents and methods for washing clothes.
If the person insists that he or she bathes frequently, suggest new soaps or deodorants to help to combat odors, and be willing to explain how to apply deodorant.
Discuss alternative options for solving the problem, paying attention to the person’s needs as well as your own; ask ""What can I do to help you?""

Follow a diabetes diet.,
Avoid problem foods.,
Get some exercise.,
Quit smoking.,
Keep your mind sharp.",How to Maintain Senior Health Through Diabetes1," A diabetes diet focuses on eating healthy foods in moderation, and controlling blood sugar and weight. It is important to eat meals at regular times, which will help keep your blood sugar levels steady. Ask your doctor for a recommendation for a registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator to help you develop a meal plan.Choose healthy carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates should be a staple in your diet. Your carbohydrates should come from fruits, vegetables; whole grains; legumes (beans, peas, and lentils); and low-fat dairy products.
Eat fiber-rich foods. Fiber is essential to moderating digestion and can help control your blood sugar levels. Vegetables; fruits; nuts; legumes (beans, peas, and lentils); whole wheat flour and wheat bran are all examples of high-fiber foods.
Eat heart-healthy fish at least twice a week. Salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines and bluefish all have high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower triglycerides. Cod, tuna and halibut all have less total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol than poultry or meat.
Look for good fats. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (in moderation) are healthy choices that can lower your cholesterol. Choose avocados, almonds, pecans, walnuts, olives, and canola, olive and peanut oils.;
, While you may know that you should avoid highly processed foods and foods with added sugar (such as candy, sodas and other sweetened drinks, frozen or microwave foods, fast foods, and simple ""white carbs,"" like pasta, white bread, white rice, and crackers), you will also need to be aware of foods that affect your heart health. Diabetes can increase your risk of stroke and heart disease. In addition to processed and sugary foods, watch out for foods containing the following:Saturated fats (full-fat dairy products and animal products such as beef, hot dogs, sausage and bacon)
Trans fats (processed snacks, baked goods, shortening and stick margarines)
Sodium (frozen meals, canned entrees, canned vegetables with added salt, lunch meats, salted nuts)
Cholesterol (full-fat dairy products, high-fat animal proteins, egg yolks, liver, and other organ meats)

, Regular exercise is essential for cardiovascular health and managing diabetes. It helps keep your weight under control, can help lower your blood sugar, and reduces stress and your risk of heart disease. Start slow and work up to 30 to 45 minutes of moderate exercise (like walking or swimming) five day a week.Make it safe. Always check with your doctor before starting a workout plan. Also, listen to your body. If an activity feels too strenuous, stop and rest. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after exercising. Wear an ID bracelet or necklace that says you have diabetes, and inform trainers or exercise partners that you have diabetes.
Make it easy. A little bit of moderate exercise every day is better than vigorous exercise once a month (or less). Start by walking for five to 10 minutes a day.
Check your blood sugar before you exercise and immediately after. Never inject insulin into a part of your body you are going to exercise. Keep a snack nearby that can quickly raise your blood sugar, such as five or six hard candies or a half cup of fruit juice.
Check your feet often, before and after you exercise. Diabetes can decrease sensation in your feet, so you may not notice a sore or blister on your foot. Do not ignore small issues, as they can become serious if left untreated.

, Individuals with diabetes who smoke have been shown to have more trouble with insulin dosing, and more trouble controlling their disease. Smoking is a major obstacle to achieving good health. If you are a smoker, particularly if you have been diagnosed with diabetes, now may be the time to quit.


Choose a starting date and make a plan for how you will quit.
Figure out what triggers you to smoke, and try to be ready when those things happen.
Get support from others before you begin.
Consider using prescription medication from your doctor or nicotine replacements (like gum or patches).
Focus on your goal and stay committed.

, Beyond just taking care of your body, exercising your mind is crucial to senior health. Make time every day to help keep your mind sharp and slow down the mental signs of aging.Keep learning. Try a new hobby or learn a language.
Challenge your brain. Work on crossword puzzles, play card games, or try Sudoku.
Get plenty of sleep. If you have trouble sleeping long hours at night, try adding a short nap during the day.

Check your blood sugar.,
Know the symptoms of hyperglycemia.,
Know the symptoms of hypoglycemia.,
Keep an eye on your weight.,
Watch for symptoms of diabetic eye disease.",How to Maintain Senior Health Through Diabetes2," Between doctor’s visits, it is important to monitor your health at home. You can purchase a glucose monitor at your local pharmacy to regularly check your blood sugar levels. Simply follow the provided instructions to prick you finger and test your blood. Perform this test as often as is advised by your doctor, or anytime you feel ill.Your doctor will give you individualized target blood sugar levels, and specific instructions on what to do if your results are not within those targets.

, This means your blood sugar levels are too high and you don't have enough insulin or your body isn't using insulin properly. It may be caused by not using enough insulin or the insulin being ineffective, eating too much or exercising too little, stress, or dawn phenomenon (a hormone surge that occurs around 4 or 5am). If you notice symptoms of hyperglycemia, check your urine for ketones. If they are not present, you may be able to lower your blood sugar levels through exercise. If ketones are present, however, do not exercise, as this will cause your blood sugar to rise higher and could lead to a diabetic coma. Symptoms of hyperglycemia include:High levels of sugar in the urine
Frequent urination
Increased thirst

, This is when your blood sugar levels drop too low and is also known as an insulin reaction, or insulin shock.

You can also drink juices and other beverages fortified with calcium.If you're going vegan rather than just vegetarian, go for calcium-rich or fortified foods, such as tofu, plant-based drinks fortified with calcium, and leafy greens.
You may want to talk to your doctor about potentially taking a calcium supplement.

, Vitamin D may be a struggle to get if you're going for a vegetarian diet.

Trim the hair with nail scissors.,
Use an electric trimmer.,
Spot color individual hairs.",How to Get Rid of Gray or White Body Hair1," If you have noticed a few stray gray/white hairs on your body, your first impulse might be to pluck them out. Instead of plucking--which can cause swelling, redness, and patchy regrowth--use a pair of nail scissors to trim any gray/white hairs down close to the skin., Another quick option is to use an electric trimming device. This is a great option if you need to do more than snip individual hairs and you think a good trim will effectively disguise your gray. Any electric clipper with a plastic guard can be used, although devices made specifically for beards or body hair may give you better control.This is also good to do prior to shaving, if you have a lot of hair to trim down before removing it completely.
Don't use an electric trimmer prior to waxing.

, If you only have a few gray/white hairs to cover, you may be able to spot color them. Try using an eyelash or eyebrow tint product. You could also try using a hair root touch up product. Simply apply either product to the specific gray/white hairs, wait the specified amount of time (see instructions), and rinse.Most of these types of products come premixed. However, for some kits, you may need to mix the color and developer. Simply follow the instructions provided.
Any of these products might tingle. If you feel severe burning, rinse the product off right away.

Quit smoking.,
Take Melancor.",How to Get Rid of White Hairs1," Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet plays a huge role in the health of your hair, so making sure your body is getting all the hair-friendly vitamins and nutrients it needs can help to prevent white hairs.


Make sure you are eating plenty of lean protein (hair is made from protein), fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Drink plenty of water for hydration.
More specifically, make sure you are getting enough of the vitamin B12 and the mineral zinc. If you don't feel you are getting enough in your diet naturally.
Also make sure you are getting adequate amounts of vitamins A, C and E and of minerals like copper, iron and folic acid.
Biotin (sometimes called vitamin H) is another important vitamin for healthy, naturally-colored hair. It is found in foods like cucumbers, oats and almonds.;
, Poor quality hair products are full of chemicals such as sulfates, phosphates, chlorine and ammonia which dry out the hair and weaken the roots, making you more prone to white hairs. Therefore, you should stick to hair products with as many natural ingredients as possible.

, Head massages help to stimulate blood flow to the scalp, which keeps hair growing healthily. If possible, massage a natural oil like almond or coconut oil into the scalp, as this helps to deeply moisturize the hair roots.

, According to one study, smokers are four times as likely to have white or grey hairs as their non-smoking counterparts. Smoking also causes hair to look dull and brittle and make it more prone to falling out.

, Melancor is a tablet-based product which rejuvenates natural hair color by stimulating the production of melanin in the hair follicles. It can help restore color to grey hair, and also prevent new grey hairs from forming. It needs to be taken once a day and has no common side effects. It can be purchased online.

Moisturize.",How to Get Rid of Gray or White Body Hair2," If you are are planning to fully remove your body hair--either by shaving or waxing--it is important to exfoliate the area both before and after the process. In the shower, using a loofa or washcloth and a cream cleanser, massage the area with circular motions.

This makes both hair removal methods more effective, reduces skin irritation, and significantly reduces instances of ingrown hairs.
Between shaving/waxing, continue to exfoliate every few days.

, If you plan to remove your gray/white body hair at home, shaving is the classic option. In order to do this, take a hot shower to open your pores and dampen the area you plan to shave. Then apply a thin layer of shaving cream to the area.

Shaving can be done on your chest, pubic area, or practically anywhere else on your body.

, Carefully move your razor across the surface of your skin to remove the hair. Begin by moving the razor in the direction the hair is growing (to prevent razor bumps and ingrown hairs). If this does not accomplish a close enough shave, you may try moving against the grain.Shaving needs to be repeated around once a week.

, The longest lasting way to remove gray/white hair from your body is to visit a salon and have it professionally waxed. Some people swear by waxing, while others do not enjoy it. Weigh the benefits against the concerns, and decide if professional waxing is right for you.Some concerns with waxing include: the pain involved (which varies for individuals), the cost (if done professionally), and various skin reactions (especially for those with sensitive skin).
Some benefits to waxing include: a longer-lasting result (usually around 6 weeks between touch-ups), softer regrowth, and greater ability to shape your body hair in a way that obscures your gray/white hair as opposed to removing it all.

, If you’d like to wax your body hair at home, you can purchase a home waxing kit. Choose between a traditional wax kit (which uses cloth strips) and a hard wax kit (in which the wax hardens and is removed without cloth). Prepare the wax according the the instructions.

Traditional waxing is best for legs, arms, chest, and underarms.
Hard wax works best for coarse pubic hair.
Most wax can be prepared with on your stove or in your microwave.

, Apply hot wax to your skin using the wooden stick provided. Then, if you are using a traditional waxing kit, press a cloth strip onto the wax, wait 10 seconds. If you are using hard wax, simply apply the wax and wait 15 seconds for it to harden. Then pull off either the cloth strip or the hardened wax, in the direction opposite the hair growth.Repeat this until all unwanted hair is removed.

, Perform an internet search (or make a few phone calls) to locate a salon in your area, and make an appointment. The esthetician (professional waxer) will apply hot wax to the area, then--if they are using traditional wax--they will press a rectangular piece of cloth onto the wax. After 10-15 seconds, the esthetician will swiftly remove either the rectangle of cloth or the hardened wax, taking the hair off with it.They will repeat this method until all of the desired hair is removed.

, After removing the hair (using the method of your choice), you will want to apply a gentle moisturizer. Use a product intended for use on your face. This helps to keep the skin smooth.

Between shaving/waxing continue to apply moisturizer every few days.
Avoid over-moisturizing, as this can clog your pores.

Apply this mixture to the hair you'd like to color.,
Wait 15-20 minutes.,
Rinse off dye and wash the area with soap.",How to Get Rid of Gray or White Body Hair3," Hair dye intended for use on your head is too harsh to be used on your chest or pubic area. Instead, purchase a product created specifically for body hair.These products can be found at beauty supply stores or online.
Most of these products are marketed toward women, and advertised for used on pubic hair. These products are also safe for men to use, and can be used on any body hair (including chests and beards).
Many body hair dye products are available in both ""natural colors"" (like blond, black, and auburn), and ""fun colors"" (like pink, red, and blue). Choose the color that best matches your natural color, or opt for something a little funky.

, Body hair dye (just like dye for your head) will come in two parts: color and developer. Following the instructions included with your dye, mix these two products together.Mix these products in a non-metallic/non-ceramic bowl, or in the container provided.

You can intensify the power of the hair dye by applying heat from a blow-dryer.
The dye may tingle a bit. However, if you feel a painful burning sensation, remove the dye immediately.

Substitute heavy pack items.,
Exercise beforehand.,
Lose weight if necessary.,
Prepare for terrain and weather conditions.,
Plan your accommodation.,
Break the hike into stages.,
Walk in the light.,
Take your time.,
Take recovery days.",How to Hike As an Older Person," A heavy pack can damage your spine, make walking more difficult, and drain your energy. Aim to fit everything into a 45 liter (12 gallon) pack weighing no more than 8 kg (18 lbs), not counting water.


Instead of walk guides and maps, use a smartphone with books and a working GPS system installed. Walk guides are thick books and maps will tire your arms after extending them for a long period of time.
Replace a heavy camera with a smartphone or a small digital camera.
Coordinate with other hikers in the group so you don't bring extra materials. If possible, ask a younger person to carry some of your water for you.;
, 'Training' for the walk is a good way to prepare yourself for what is to come. If you rarely exercise, it's a good idea to spend three months training. If you are already in shape, you may only need a shorter training period to strengthen your legs. Try one of the following exercises, ideally five or six days a week:


Put on a heavy pack, about 15 kg (33 lb). Walk for at least one hour, preferably on a path involving plenty of stairs.
If you don't have time for the walk, instead jog for at least thirty minutes at a slow and steady pace, raising a good sweat. Do not wear a pack while jogging, as it may cause injury.

, Your muscles are not as strong or fast as they were when you were younger, so they are subject to injury when overloaded. Extra weight will tax your muscles and increase your risk of heat stroke and other injuries. This is the hardest step in preparation for your walk, but it is very rewarding. Not only will it give you more strength for your hike, it can also assist with other weight-related problems.



Exercising and eating healthily are the two most important ways to lose weight.

, Read a hiking guide for the area you'll be traveling to. You may need special equipment if you expect snow, water crossings, or other difficult terrain.


Don't forget to pack appropriate hiking clothes. If the weather is variable, dress in layers. The lowest layer should be fabric that wicks moisture away from your skin.
If you haven't trekked in a long time, talk to more experienced hikers. They can help you choose gear, pack in a way that keeps your clothes dry, and offer other invaluable advice.

, For multi-day hikes, arrange places to stay in advance when possible. Tents and bedding are very heavy to carry around all day, so only camp if you are fit and confident in your abilities. If you can find places that provide cooking equipment, you can save even more weight.


Many regions have made it illegal to camp, as fires, toilets, or litter can destroy the surrounding area.

, Check your map and mark the rest spots on today's hike. Be honest about how far you can walk without a break, and how far you can go in one day.


When hiking in mountainous terrain, take a break at least every 14–19 km (9–12 miles) on the ascent. On the way down, descend no more than 900 meters (3000 ft) of altitude before resting.

, Expect to spend about eight hours on the move each day, including stops for morning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea. Plan to arrive at the night's stop with enough time to wash yourself, eat, drink and change into evening clothes to stop for the night.

, Even if your pack is light and you feel you can travel faster, travel at an average of 1.5 miles per hour to avoid straining yourself. This may sound slow, but most hiking requires a lot of ascent and descent, which is a lot harder than walking flatland.


Avoid the 'red-zone'. These are very steep climbing stairs that can radically raise your heart rate to dangerous measures. Go to all extents to stay in the safe, guided paths.

, If you're hiking for more than five days in a row, take a recovery day once a week. Take it easy, wash and dry your clothes, and introduce yourself to the locals. Your body needs time to rest.


If you're bored and feeling ready for more, you can spend the day on a gentle local hike. A day without a heavy pack will still make a big difference.

Go for an all-over color.,
Get highlights.,
Try henna.,
Experiment with more temporary solutions.,
Use natural hair rinses.,
Embrace the grey.",How to Get Rid of White Hairs2," An all-over hair color will completely fill in any white hairs, making it a good option if your hair is more than 40% grey.


You can opt for semi-permanent colors which last for a couple of weeks, or go for permanent colors which will stay until the hair grows out.
If you're trying to match the hair dye to your natural color, it's probably a good idea to get your hair done professionally, as it's difficult to predict how home coloring kits will react with your hair. However, many people use the necessity of dyeing their hair as an opportunity to experiment with a new color.
If you decide to dye your hair at home, avoid home coloring kits that contain ammonia, which can damage and dry out the hair.
Be aware that going don this route will require a lot of maintenance, as you will need to reapply the color (or at least touch-up the roots) every time the hair grows out.

, Highlights are another option for covering up white hairs. Rather than coloring the whole head of hair, select strands are bleached or dyed in order to add texture and life to the hair.


Highlights can be very fine, adding subtle color and shine to to the hair, or they can be big and bold, adding variety and contrast.
Highlights will need to done by a professional hair stylist and can be quite pricey. However, they tend to last a little longer than all-over hair dyes.

, Henna is a form of natural hair dye. It contains no chemicals and will actually condition the hair, leaving it shiny and moisturized.


Henna will produce a rich red color in your hair. The lighter your hair (or the more white hairs you have) the brighter the red color will be.
Henna can be very messy - it comes in the form of a brick which needs to be melted down, or in a powder which needs to be mixed with lemon juice or tea or coffee. It has a mud-like texture and needs to sit in the hair for several hours while the color develops.
One thing to be aware of is that chemical hair dyes cannot be applied to henna-treated hair, so make the decision to use henna on your hair with care, as you will be stuck with it for a while!

, If you're not ready to commit to dyeing your hair just yet, there are other, more temporary solutions to covering up your white hairs.


Use hair mascara. This is exactly what it sounds like - mascara for your hair! It's great for covering up individual grey strands around the temples and hairline. It will last until the next time you shampoo your hair.
Use a root concealer. A root concealer works like a dry shampoo - it comes in aerosol form and can be spritzed on any grey hairs near the roots, where it will adjust to your natural hair color. It will rinse out with your next shampoo.
Use color depositing shampoos and conditioners. Color-depositing shampoos and conditioners help to blend away white hairs by imparting them with a color similar to your natural shade. After one wash with the color-depositing shampoo and conditioner, the color should last through the next three washes., There are many home remedies out there which involve rinsing the hair with a blend of different liquids, which can potentially add color. Whether any of these methods actually work or not is up for debate, but they're worth a try!



Rosemary and Sage: Boil half a cup of rosemary and half a cup of sage in a large pot of water for about 30 minutes. Strain the herbs out, then leave the water to cool. Once cool, pour the water over your hair and scalp and leave your hair to dry naturally, then wash out using natural shampoo. Repeat once a week.Gooseberries: Boil a number of Indian gooseberries (known as amla) in some coconut oil until they turn black. Allow the mixture to cool slightly then apply to the hair and scalp, massaging in with the fingers. Leave for 30 minutes, then rinse out.

Black walnut: Crack open some black walnuts and add the fruit to a pot of water. Boil for 15 minutes, then allow to cool. Remove the walnuts from the water, then rinse your hair with it and allow hair to dry naturally before shampooing. Repeat twice a week.

, Instead of trying to cover up or get rid of your white hairs, consider embracing them! As long as you take good care of it, white hair can look rather chic. It will also save you a lot of time and money.



Maintain a modern cut. Many women (and men) associate white hair with looking old, but this is often because their haircuts are old-fashioned. Try getting a fresh, modern cut from a professional stylist -- something like a sharp bob or blunt bangs. This will help to keep your hair looking young.Keep hair looking sleek. White and grey hair tends to get dried out and frizzy-looking, which can age you. Keep your hair looking sleek and hydrated by using moisturizing shampoos and conditioners, using oil-based hair treatments (such as argan or coconut oil) and by using a flat iron to smooth down any flyaway hairs.

Know that white hairs are mainly due to genetics.,
Understand that white hair is not caused by stress.,
Check for any potential underlying conditions.",How to Get Rid of White Hairs3," Although most people typically associate white hair with getting older, there is no specific age at which people are ""supposed"" to go grey.


Some people spot their first white hairs in their teens, while others don't go grey until middle age. As the presence of white hair is mainly down to genetics, if your parents went grey at an early age, you probably will too.
Race also plays a role. Most white people will start to see white hairs by the age of 35, Asians by the age of 40 and black people by their mid-forties.

, It's a common misconception that white hairs are caused by stress, but there is no scientific basis for this theory.


Rather, hair turns white when the color-producing cells in the hair root stop producing pigment, such as Melanin (which is what gives hair its color).
It has also been suggested that a build up of hydrogen peroxide around the hair follicles can bleach color from the hair as a result of oxidative stress.
However, stress has many other negative effects on your health (including possible hair loss) so reducing stress is still a good idea.

, Sometimes when a person's hair turns white prematurely, it's the result of an underlying autoimmune or genetic condition.


Some specific conditions that are sometimes linked with hair turning white include vitiligo (a thyroid disorder) and anemia. Problems with the pituitary gland can also be a factor.
Therefore, if you're hair is turning white prematurely and you experience other symptoms attached to any of these conditions, you should see your doctor.

Understand the differences in types of facilities


There is a big difference between a nursing home, which provides around-the-clock skilled nursing care, and an assisted living facility, which offers assistance with daily tasks while still allowing seniors to retain some independence.,
Calculate what you can afford


While health insurance and government agencies may provide some financial help with paying for a senior assisted living facility, most of the expenses will be left to the seniors and their families.,
Determine what services are needed


It's important to know what help or services your senior loved one will need when choosing a senior citizen living facility.,
Meet the staff


Meet with nurses and staff members that interact with facility residents to get a feeling for the atmosphere of the facility.,
Take your senior loved one with you


It's important that your senior loved one feel safe and content at the assisted living facility you choose for them, so take them with you when you visit potential facilities.,
Check out standards and reviews


Nursing homes and assisted living facilities are held to state and federal regulations of sanitation and resident care.,
Talk to current residents


Meet with some of the facility's residents and ask them what they think of the facility.,
Ask about medical procedures


Find out what guidelines are in place for staff to follow in case of emergency medical situations, or for routine medical issues such as incontinence or high blood pressure readings.",How to Find an Assisted Living Facility for a Senior," The services provided and costs incurred vary depending on the type of facility you choose.;
, Determine what you can afford so you can decide if prospective facilities fit into your budget.

, Make a list of the most important services, including medication assistance, incontinence care, dressing, meal help and physical therapy and exercise, so you can keep them in mind when reviewing facilities.

, Find out what credentials the facility requires for staff to be employed and how many staff members care for residents.

, Give them a tour of the bedrooms, activities areas and grounds so they can offer their opinions.

, A quality facility will have these records readily available to prospective residents. Review them carefully and note how frequently the facility is inspected and whether there have been any emergency inspections or complaints against the facility.

, Ask if they are happy, if there are fun activities, if they feel well cared for and if they are satisfied with the quality of care they receive. Some facilities provide welcoming committees for new residents that should be able to answer your questions.

, Staff should be able to tell you how medical issues are handled for residents.

Don't ignore blurry central vision.,
Be alert for strange visual distortions.,
Watch for difficulty adapting to low-light conditions.,
Be aware of the risk factors.,
See your doctor or eye specialist.,
Ask about the Amsler grid.,
Consider other diagnostic tests.,
Take anti-angiogenic drugs.,
Look into taking nutritional supplements.",How to Detect Macular Degeneration," AMD symptoms usually develop gradually and without any eye pain, so they may difficult to detect. The hallmark symptom of AMD is a progressively developing blurred area near the very center of your vision, either in one eye or both.With time, the blurry central area can grow larger or you may develop dark spots that completely block out any images. On the other hand, peripheral vision is not affected by AMD.


Objects in your central vision may not appear to be as bright as they used to be — colors can get dull.
AMD affects only the central part of your vision because that's where the macula is located. The macula is in the center of the retina and needed for sharp vision of objects that are straight ahead.;
, Another common symptom of AMD is strange visual distortions — objects may appear distorted in shape, or straight lines may look wavy, crooked or bent.When these symptoms develop, people may think they're hallucinating. Although other eye diseases cause blurriness, only macular disease (including AMD, cystoid macular edema, diabetic macular edema, and others) creates these types of visual distortions.


Visual distortions associated with advanced stages of AMD make it difficult to drive, read and recognize faces.
AMD often affects both eyes at the same time, but if only one is affected, it's difficult to notice visual changes because your good eye compensates for the affected eye., Another common symptom of progressive AMD is an increased difficulty adapting to low-light situations, such as dimly lit rooms, offices or restaurants.You might also feel the need for brighter light when reading books or doing work close to your face. If you find yourself or your partner turning on lights much more frequently than before, then it could be a sign of AMD.


Correlated to seeing things more dimly is perceiving a decreased intensity or brightness of colors. The world tends to take on a darker and drabber look with AMD.
AMD doesn't affect peripheral (side) vision, so it doesn't cause complete blindness — although people with advanced symptoms are often labelled as legally blind and not allowed to drive a car or operate heavy machinery.

, The cause of AMD is not clearly understood, but a number of risk factors have been noticed, such as: hereditary (genetic) link, advanced age, female gender, cigarette smoking, obesity, cardiovascular disease and Caucasian race (skin color).Most people with AMD have at least a couple if not most of these risk factors.


In terms of age, AMD is most common in people older than 65 years.
Smoking tobacco and being overweight, particularly if you're obese, puts you at much higher risk of AMD. These factors also increase your risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, which negatively affect the blood vessels of the eye.

, If you notice any of the above eye symptoms and they don't go away after a week or so, then make an appointment with your family doctor or eye specialist, such as an optometrist or ophthalmologist. After an eye exam and various tests, they can rule out other common eye diseases, such as retinopathy or cataracts, and give you an idea of what stage the AMD is in.The early stage of AMD doesn't typically cause any vision loss or eye symptoms, which is why regular eye exams are important — especially if you have risk factors for it.
Early-stage AMD is diagnosed by the presence of yellow deposits (called drusen) underneath the retina.
The intermediate stages of AMD usually cause some vision loss, but not many other symptoms. This stage is diagnosed by the presence of larger drusen and pigment changes in the retina.For late stage AMD, vision loss is substantial, other eye symptoms are obvious and changes in the macula/retina are significant.

, In addition to getting a visual acuity test with an eye chart and a dilated eye exam (done with eye drops), your eye doctor may also use an Amsler grid to test for AMD. The Amsler grid is essentially a piece of graph paper with dark lines on it forming a square grid and a dot in the middle — although some versions have white lines drawn on a darker background.The Amsler grid can help spot the distorted lines and/or blurry vision that are common with AMD.


Looking at an Amsler grid helps with early detection, which is important because treatment for wet AMD is more successful when done before damage occurs.
You can download a free Amsler grid from online or pick one up from your ophthalmologist's office to test your vision at home.
If on your computer, sit about 14 inches away from the screen. Cover each eye and look at the dot in the middle. The surrounding lines should not look blurry or distorted.

, Other diagnostic test used to help diagnose AMD include fluorescein angiograms (done with a fluorescent dye injected into the arm that then passes to the blood vessels in your eye), and optical coherence tomography or OCT.OCT is similar to detailed ultrasound imaging, except that it uses light instead of sound. OCT can get high-resolution cross-sectional images of the eye and all the small blood vessels.


Fluorescein angiography uses a special dye and camera to look at blood vessels in the retina and choroid, which are the two layers in the back of your eye.OCT can provide doctors with images of the eye tissues in real time, which may enable them to diagnose AMD in its earliest stages., Anti-angiogenic medications are the primary form of treatment for AMD. They are injected into the eye in order to block the development and growth of new blood vessels.These drugs also help prevent leakage from the abnormal blood vessels already in the eye that cause so-called wet AMD. This treatment has been effective in many patients and some have actually regained their lost vision.


Anti-angiogenic drugs are injected into the eye at four to 12 week intervals to cause the blood vessels to shrink.After the injections, your doctor may order an angiogram (a special photograph that uses dyes) in order to make sure there's no more leakage from blood vessels.

, Researchers have found that taking high doses of certain vitamins and minerals on a daily basis can slow progression intermediate and late-stage AMD.More specifically, taking a combination of vitamins C and E, zinc and copper can reduce the risk of developing late-stage AMD by about 25%. Adding the antioxidant plant compounds lutein and zeaxanthin may have an even more preventative effect.

For vitamins, the effective daily doses are 500 mg of vitamin C are 400 IU of vitamin E.
For minerals, the effective daily doses are 80 mg of zinc oxide and 2 mg of cupric oxide (copper).
About 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg zeaxanthin each day were found to be helpful also.

Progress slowly.",How to Do Tai Chi for Seniors," Breathing is one of the most important parts of practicing tai chi, so a basic breathing exercise can serve as an introduction to the discipline. Maintaining deep, repetitive breathing is calming in and of itself, even if not combined with specific tai chi movements.Think of your breath as a circle – in through your nose and out through your mouth without holding your breath or stopping at any time. There should be no pause between the end of your inhale and the end of your exhale – it should be one continuous circle.
Rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, in the position it would be if you were making a hard l sound, such as in the words ""laugh"" or ""light.""
Expand your chest and belly as you breathe in, making room for as much air as possible. Squeeze your belly gently when you exhale, as though you are pressing the breath out.
While breathing, focus on relaxing every part of your body where tension may reside. Continue your deep breathing, relaxing your body completely.;
, Standing is one of the most important warm-ups of any tai chi routine. Standing in proper alignment releases the tension from your body and puts you in balance. While there are several different tai chi standing positions, the neutral position is the easiest place to start.Do some deep breathing before you move into this position, and make sure that your entire body is relaxed. Then stand with your feet parallel and roughly hip- or shoulder-width apart. Choose the width that is comfortable and relaxed for you. You'll know when you're in correct alignment because your hands will line up over your feet.
Make sure your weight is distributed evenly, and that you aren't leaning more to one side. Then bend your knees slightly. You should be able to see your toes – if you can't, you're leaning too far forward. Your back should remain straight.
Tuck your pelvis in slightly so that your tailbone is pointing toward the ground and your back is less curved. Keep your head up and your neck straight. Your shoulders should be flat and neutral, and your chest relaxed.
When you achieve the correct posture, continue to relax and breathe deeply. Focus on how the position feels and increase your awareness of each part of your body and how it feels in this position.

, If you're just starting tai chi, you may not be able to physically feel the ball of energy you create, but with practice and focus you can raise your awareness of the energy within and around you.To start this exercise, stand in a neutral position. Bring your hands together in front of you and rub them together with slowness and intention. Think about pulling your energy into your hands as you rub them together. Feel the warmth generated by your motion.
Continue breathing deeply, focusing on the energy flowing into your hands as well as the energy that connects your two hands together. When that connection feels strong, begin slowly and gently pulling your hands apart.
As you pull your hands apart, remain aware and focused on the energy between your hands. Keep your hands and fingers relaxed and soft. Your fingers should be slightly curved, as though you are holding a ball.
Bring your hands closer together when you feel the energy weaken, but don't allow your hands to touch. Pull them apart and then bring them together again, keeping your motions slow and deliberate and your muscles relaxed.
When you're done with the exercise, pull your hands slowly apart until they are about shoulder-width apart, then drop them to your sides.

, The circling hands exercise introduces you to circles and cycles, which are fundamental principles of tai chi form and philosophy. It's a good exercise for beginners, and also can be used as a warm-up to regular practice.Start the circling hands exercise by standing with your hands in front of your body, palms facing each other. Think of how your body would be positioned if you were giving someone a standing ovation.
Keep your body neutral and your muscles relaxed, and make sure you are breathing deeply. Create space between your hands by separating them – you can have them as far apart as you want, as long as they are each equidistant from the center line of your body. For the duration of this exercise, you'll keep your hands the same distance apart.
Begin moving your hands in circles, keeping them the same distance apart. Move them up and out from your body, then down and toward your body. From the side, it should look like you're tracing a circle.
Expand your hands and wrists as they move away from your body and contract them as they move toward your body. Keep your movements slow and gentle, and focus on your breath and how the movement feels to all parts of your body.
You also can do variations of this exercise in which you change the direction in which you trace your circle, vary the space between your hands, or change the height of the circles.

, If you want to learn additional tai chi moves and forms on your own, pick up a book or video at your local library or bookstore. Books also introduce you to the vocabulary and philosophy behind tai chi.Learn as much or as little as you want about the philosophy underlying tai chi. Don't be intimidated by the vocabulary or terminology used by tai chi practitioners. It will become second-nature to you over time if you start regularly practicing tai chi.
Keep in mind it isn't necessary for you to adopt the philosophical underpinnings of tai chi to reap its benefits. It's enough that you believe in the power of meditation, relaxation, and deep breathing.
Even if you don't try to follow along with a video, simply watching others do tai chi is a way to become more familiar with the movements and forms of the practice.

, The best way to do tai chi is by taking a class. You can enjoy the companionship of fellow practitioners as well as guidance and assistance from a live instructor. If you think you want to attend a class, go watch one in progress first.You can find classes near you simply by searching ""tai chi"" on the internet along with the name of your city or town. You also might ask at your local library or community center.
Senior groups or clubs often have tai chi classes as well.
Watch the class quietly. When the class is over, you typically will have the opportunity to speak with the instructor as well as some members of the class and ask any questions you have.
Observe a beginners class that you think you would be interested in joining. You also might want to observe an intermediate or advanced class so you can meet and talk to more long-term tai chi practitioners.

, Tai chi is a low-impact and gentle type of exercise. However, if you have significant balance or coordination issues, or if you have musculoskeletal problems or medical conditions such as arthritis, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before you start practicing tai chi regularly.You also may have difficulty practicing if you're currently on medications that can make you dizzy or lightheaded.
Your doctor will advise you whether tai chi is a good idea for you, and may even give you suggestions on classes to take or instructors to use.

, If you have arthritis, you may benefit from the 12-movement program designed by and for the Arthritis Foundation. This beginner-level program is offered throughout the United States.If you live in the U.S. and want to take a class that uses the Arthritis Foundation's program, call the Foundation at 1-800-283-7800 or visit their website at arthritis.org to find out where their program is available.
Even if the Foundation's specifically developed program isn't available in your area, they may be able to connect you to other tai chi classes that would benefit you.

, Before you sign up for a specific class, you should take the time to meet with the class instructor and find out more about their credentials and experience. Since there is no universal accreditation for tai chi instructors, make sure you take a class with someone who is experienced and respected in the practice.If you have personal health concerns or difficulties with coordination or flexibility, explain those issues to the instructor. They should be willing to accommodate you.
You can also research the instructor's background and reputation online. Ask the instructor where they've taught classes before, or if you can talk to any practitioners who have taken their class for an extended period of time.

, To practice tai chi, you need to wear clothing that provides you with a full range of motion without constricting or binding. More lightweight clothing will move with your body so you don't have to constantly adjust it.You may want to dress in layers, especially if you tend to get cold.
If you're unsure about what to wear to class, observe a class and pay attention to what the practitioners are wearing. You also can watch classes online to get an idea of what clothing is appropriate.
You'll typically see practitioners wearing everything from yoga attire to regular street clothes or business casual. You shouldn't have to buy any new clothes just to practice tai chi.

, Although many people practice tai chi daily, when you're just starting out you can try a weekly or bi-weekly class to develop the habit and get used to tai chi. After that, you can work towards implementing tai chi practice into your everyday life.Be prepared to try out tai chi for at least three months. After that time you should already notice positive changes in your body in mind.
If you don't enjoy tai chi, you can stop at any time. But if you want to quit because you're not noticing any benefits or positive results of doing it, keep in mind that it can take two to three months to realize many of the benefits of tai chi.

, Tai chi operates according to the 70 percent rule. With any movement, you should only do 70 percent of what you can do. If you have arthritis or other injuries that limit your mobility, this means you should only go 70 percent as far as you possibly could without experiencing pain.For example, if you can extend your arms out straight in front of you, that is 100 percent extension in your elbow. In tai chi, you should go with 70 percent extension of your elbow.
However, if you have arthritis in your elbows and can only extend the joint 70 percent without pain, then you should only extend your elbows about 50 percent.

, Your instructor typically will start with breathing exercises, and you should continue to breathe deeply throughout your movements and forms. In many ways, the deep breath is more important than anything else in tai chi.Your breath centers your body and mind, restoring your energy and bringing your body into better balance.
If you're in a class and the instructor is calling for a movement or form that you cannot do, return to a neutral standing position and focus on your breath.
Take plenty of breaks throughout your practice and check your breathing. You should breathe through all of the moves and forms, never holding your breath.
Don't worry about timing up particular movements with the inhale and exhale when you're just beginning tai chi practice. Breathing deeply is more important than breathing at a particular time. This ability to breathe and move together in harmony will come as you advance.

, Some like to think of tai chi as a moving meditation. Throughout your practice, you will be encouraged to clear your mind of outside thoughts and focus on the energy flowing through your body.Many tai chi movements focus on circles or cycles. As you practice tai chi, it can help to think of your body as a circle or moving in circles. Concentrate on the energy cycling through your body, the air moving in and out in a circle.
Many tai chi exercises call on you to focus the energy in your body, such as the circling hands or energy ball exercises you may have done when you were first starting tai chi. With practice, you'll be able to feel the energy moving between your hands as you perform these exercises.

, Many seniors feel lost after retirement because they no longer have a regular job to structure their daily routine. If you decide you want to do tai chi every day, you can make it part of your regular morning routine.Whether you take a class or practice at home, create a regular time during which you practice tai chi each day, so your practice becomes habitual.
You may have a class that meets twice a week, and you practice other days at home. Your home tai chi practice should be the same time each day as your class.

, Tai chi isn't a competition. You don't have to learn and practice a large number of movements or forms to get positive mental and physical benefits from tai chi. Aim to learn one or two new movements or forms each month to expand your practice.Keep your expectations realistic. You can realize great benefits from tai chi practice, even if you aren't able to do everything right away. Your coordination, balance, and flexibility will get better with regular tai chi practice.
Above all else, focus on your breath. Take plenty of breaks, especially in the beginning, if something gets difficult. Keep in mind that tai chi is supposed to be a gentle, relaxing practice. If you find yourself getting frustrated, take a break to breathe and regroup.

Or, ""I feel so comfortable with you, let's discuss spicing things up with some toys. I'd love to hear your ideas.""

, A therapist may be able to help you and your partner with specific concerns, or with creative ways to improve your sex life. Ask your doctor for a referral.It's okay to tell your therapist something like, ""I just don't feel like I get aroused like I used to, and I worry that my partner thinks it's their fault. Can we talk about it?"" You wouldn't be the first to ask this, and they'd likely have a lot of helpful advice.

Recognize the person's basic needs of daily living.,
Ensure that the person with a disability has adequate support.If they are unable to complete any or all of the tasks of daily living above, think about who you can put in place to be of assistance.,
Make sure the home is adapted to fit the person's disability.,
Try internet grocery shopping and other home delivery services.,
Consider transferring the disabled person to a care facility.",How to Enhance Daily Life for a Person with a Disability1," These include getting dressed, bathing, eating, toileting, paying the bills, cleaning, shopping, making telephone calls, etc. Is the person able to do these tasks on their own, or is the disability preventing them from doing so? Sit down with the person and discuss these things to show that you care.A good way to frame these questions is to say that you read that they are important and normal questions to check in on for all people in ""situations such as yours"" (referring to the person who is disabled).
Another option, if you are uncomfortable asking such personal questions, is to set up an appointment with the family doctor, who has been trained to go over these questions in a professional and respectful way.;
, Are you or other family members or friends able to help? Is a full-time caregiver needed?


Note that ensuring the basic needs of daily living are accounted for and looked after is key to enhancing life for a person with a disability.
It not only lifts one's spirits by alleviating stress that these things will be taken care of, but also helps someone living with a disability to feel supported and cared for by those around them as it shows that others have taken an interest in their well-being.

, One option is to contact an occupational therapist (someone whose job consists of helping to adapt home situations for people with disabilities).You can start by making some basic adjustments yourself to help the person with a disability, as you and the affected person see fit. Some things to consider include:


Is the person now wheelchair-bound? If so, are there ramps to get in and out of the house? Whether or not they are in a wheelchair, are they able to get from one floor or the house to another if it is a multi-floor house? Is there any way to make this easier, such as with the installation of handrails?
Bathroom tasks may also be made easier with handrails, for instance to help with showering and/or toileting.
If the person is at risk of falls where they may not be able to get up to reach a telephone and call for help, do they have a medical alert button they can press and/or a medical alert bracelet detailing their medical conditions for if and when something happens and emergency medical personnel arrive?
These are just some of the things to consider. The person themselves (with the disability) can likely give you the best indication as to things they are struggling with mobility-wise at home, and either you or the occupational therapist can then think of creative ways to help.
The occupational therapist can also conduct a complete evaluation of the home environment that is much more thorough, and provide innovative solutions that we often cannot think of ourselves given that they work in this field and have lots of experience., Look into assistance programs such as ""Meals on Wheels"" to see if your loved one qualifies for this assistance. These are great services that can ensure ready-to-eat meals delivered to their door.

, In cases of extreme injury and/or illness, it may be impossible for the person to manage on their own at home. It may also be too expensive to hire full-time caregivers, and even full-time caregivers may not be able to provide adequate medical care and support in severe cases.


For cases where the medical needs of looking after the disability are higher, consider transferring the person to a facility where this type of care can be available on an ""as-need"" basis, or even on a 24/7 basis.
Another reason to transfer someone with a disability to a group care facility is to enhance their social connections. It is a fine line to walk, because some people get depressed at the idea of moving out of their home; however, others thrive as it gives them many more options of things to do during the day, people to connect with, and others who are in similar situations.

"
"
Plan regular trips or visits.,
Check with a social worker for locally run day trips and other programs.,
Find a pet for them, if they are interested.",How to Enhance Daily Life for a Person with a Disability2," If a loved one, family member, or dear friend is suffering from a disability, one of the most powerful ways to show your love and support — and to demonstrate to them how much you care — is to stop by for regular visits.Life can be hectic with any number of personal commitments, but if you can take the time out of your busy schedule to stop by once a week, or even once a month (whatever you have time for), it can make a big difference to their mental and emotional wellbeing. Connection with other people is one of the most vital things in helping us to thrive as human beings!


When you do visit, bring an excited energy to make the person feel wanted and appreciated.
Also, make an effort to relate to them in the same way you did prior to the disability. This will show them that you see them as the same person, and that nothing has changed for you at the heart level as a result of the challenges they are facing with their body.
This will boost their self-esteem and feelings of self-worth, because many people do not want to be viewed in a different light by their loved ones simply because of a physical disability or challenge.

, In addition to home visits (or outings you may do with your loved one), encouraging them to get involved in community events can be a great way to meet new friends and also to feel engaged in life.Trying different activities may also help the person with a disability to find something they are passionate about, which can rekindle their sense of enthusiasm for life. Having a passion with other people outside of the home can do wonders for one's mental and emotional wellbeing (and note that mental health problems such as depression can be one of the greatest problems accompanying disability).

, Pets can be great companions. It is important to choose a type of animal that the person likes, and that they are able to look after given their disability. Having a pet (or anything to look after — even a garden!) can contribute to one's sense of responsibility, and overall happiness and wellbeing.


Pets have been shown to improve the mental health of people living alone. In studies of how people relate to dogs, for instance, it has been shown that having a dog increases your levels of oxytocin, which is commonly known as the ""love hormone"" (it gives you that great feeling when you hug, cuddle, or kiss someone, or otherwise connect with a living being such as a pet).
Some disabilities would also qualify people for a ""service animal.""Service animals are specifically trained to help with the given disability, such as guide dogs for people who are blind. Service animals are also available for people who are diabetic, autistic, epileptic, or suffer from severe anxiety, among other things. If your loved one's disability qualifies them for a service animal, look into this option as well — it provides not only companionship, but also assistance moving through the world in a functional way.

"
"
Inquire if they are interested in taking courses.,
Offer to introduce the disabled person to health focus type fitness programs or sports groups.,
Find ways that they can contribute to others.,
Help the person to see how they can live with meaning and purpose regardless of disability.",How to Enhance Daily Life for a Person with a Disability3," Many people whose bodies are disabled are not held back at the level of the mind, so engaging in courses or programs that stimulate their brain — as well as the creative flow of ideas and new learning — can be very beneficial. Ask if the person is interested in enrolling in an internet course or a degree (perhaps even one that can be obtained ""long-distance"" via internet courses, if they are unable to transport themselves to a college or university).

, These usually range from a more gentle activity such as Tai Chi, water exercises and other kinds of exercises aimed at improving mobility and circulation, to more complex sports and games depending upon the person's abilities and the extent of the disability.

, It gives a sense of confidence, self-esteem, and happiness to give to others who are in need or less fortunate, and it can also help a disabled person to feel better about their own situation as they realize they still have gifts they can give to others who may be in even more challenging situations than they are.


Examples might be volunteer services such as knitting blankets or scarves for the homeless, volunteering as a mentor to other people with disabilities, or finding other services that they can do.
There are also companies that specialize in employing the disabled for paid work and will even organize transport. This may be a good option to look into if the person is still interested in working.
It is important to recognize not all disabled people are unable to make a career for themselves. A qualified individual such as an accountant, an architect, a phone-based salesperson, etc., can still work from home with the use of a computer, so it is wise to inquire if their employer can find ways to keep their employee active.

, If the person with the disability is to thrive mentally and emotionally in the long-term, it is important that they find ways to enjoy their life and to feel like they can make a meaningful contribution to the world around them despite their handicap. Brainstorm ideas with your loved one as to how they may regain passion for life and an overall sense of purpose.

Consider the pros and cons of each.",How to Decide As a Retiring Senior Citizen Whether to Buy or Rent," One of the first things you should take into consideration when you’re deciding whether to rent or buy a home after retiring is how long you plan to stay. The shorter the stay, the fewer benefits you’ll receive from buying a new home. As a general rule, if you plan to stay in your new home less than three or four years, renting is going to be a better option., No matter which option you decide on, you will want to make sure you have all the things you want and need in your new home. Make a list of your must-haves and ensure wherever you decide to move includes all of these things.For example, if you’ve owned a home for the majority of your adult life, you are probably used to every day luxuries that don’t necessarily come with renting. Your must-have list might include a big backyard, the freedom to decorate however you want, or a garden out back. You might not be able to keep all of these things by renting.
On the other hand, you may be looking to downsize, cut back on your responsibilities, or allow yourself the flexibility to travel. If this is the case, renting might be a good option.
Just like you have a list of must-haves for your new home, you might also have a list of things you don’t want to deal with anymore. Perhaps you’re looking forward to having a landlord to take care of home repairs and landscaping, for example. Or, maybe you are looking forward to having fixed monthly housing expenses. Renting could be a good option for you. While renting may come with fewer amenities, it also comes with fewer responsibilities., Another consideration in whether you should buy or rent once you retire is your health. Your health can affect such things as your ability to maintain a home, your predicted medical expenses in future years, and the possibility that you may have to move to an assisted living facility eventually.


For instance, if you are in good health, taking care of repairs and maintenance might not be an issue if you own your own home. However, if you are not in the best of health, having to take care of these repairs might be too much to handle.
You must also consider what kind of cash flow you’ll need for health issues, keeping in mind that this amount will probably increase over the years, your last five to seven years of retirement being the most expensive., For many retirees, whether or not they want to leave an inheritance behind for their children or grandchildren plays a big part in the decision to rent or buy. If you plan to leave an inheritance, buying a house can help you build equity and increase the amount you can leave to your loved ones. If you don’t plan to leave an inheritance, however, renting may be a better choice., Your retirement income will come from a number of different places. To figure out your budget for retirement, you’ll need to determine all the sources from which you will receive income while you’re retired. Check all of the following possible income sources:


Social Security—provided by the federal government, this income accumulates over your working years
Defined benefit pension—provided by your employer, this income is based on the amount of time you worked for your employer, what you earned over those years, and the age at which you retired. Check with your employer’s human resources department to find out how much pension income you’ll receive.
Defined contribution plan—most commonly a 401k, this income source is a plan offered by your employer into which you can invest your own money. Many employers will match a portion of your investment, but unlike a defined benefit pension, there is no guarantee from your employer as to how much you’ll receive in retirement. What you receive will depend on how much you invest, where it was invested and how long you’ve had the plan.
Home equity—if you own your home it will build equity over time. You can use this equity in retirement by selling your home or obtaining a reverse mortgage.Savings and investments—these are your personally-owned savings accounts and investments, like stocks, bonds, and IRAs., It is imperative that you figure out a realistic retirement budget to help you in making the decision to rent or buy. Once you figure out your overall retirement budget, you can decide on a housing budget. Begin by gathering any pertinent materials and information, such as:


Your most recent bank statements (6-12 months worth)
Your most recent credit card statements (6-12 months worth)
Your last two pay stubs (for both you and your spouse)
Colored highlighters (10-12)
Your tax return from the previous year, Using one of the highlighters, go back through your bank statements and credit card statements and mark any fixed expenses. This includes any recurring monthly, quarterly, or yearly payments. For an even more effective budget, break your fixed expenses down into three groups, using a different color highlighter to mark each group:


Essentials—food, housing, transportation, clothing, health care
Non-essential monthly expenses—gym memberships, cable, monthly subscriptions
Required non-monthly expenses—property taxes, insurance premiums, automobile registration
Don’t forget to identify any changes in health care expenses, including dental, vision, and hearing insurance costs. Once you’re retired, your previous employer most likely will no longer cover any of your health care premiums., Think about how your spending will change after retirement. Once you’re retired, you’ll likely have more time to do the things you enjoy, like traveling, golf, or going to the spa. These items will be considered optional expenses in your budget. Be sure you adjust your predicted spending to include any increase in these activities., You’ll need to figure out how much you’ll be spending on fixed expenses to determine how much free money you’ll have for your optional expenses. You can then tweak your budget and find places to save if you’d like more money for flexible expenses. To determine your fixed expenses, do the following:


Add up your total expenses.
Add up your fixed expenses.
Divide your fixed expenses into your total expenses. The answer will tell you how much of your retirement income will go toward fixed expenses, which will include any housing costs., Once you’ve figured out your overall budget and annual budget for your retirement, calculate a housing budget to help you in making the decision to rent or buy. Professional opinions vary some, but in general, the experts suggest spending between 15 and 20 percent of your annual budget on housing, whether you’re renting or buying.Asses this number in relation to your fixed expenses. Is it feasible to pay this amount on housing and still be able to stick to your budget?


If the number you come up with is not feasible, tweak your budget to find places you can save money and cut back on spending.

, If this all seems pretty confusing, that’s because it can be. While you can calculate a ballpark figure yourself, consulting with a financial planner will be a huge help in figuring out the specifics of your situation. A financial planner can not only help you determine your budget, but can also give you guidance on how and when to tap your assets in order to get the most out of your retirement funds.


Write out a list of questions before meeting with your financial planner. This will help ensure you get all the information you need and thoroughly explore your options.
Some questions to include could be, “How can I get the most out of my retirement income?” “How can I plan for unexpected expenses?” and “Are there other ways I can increase my retirement income?”

, You may want to relocate once you retire to be closer to family or to live in a warmer climate. Choosing where to live can be tricky because there are many things to consider in this decision. In addition, the cost to rent or buy, which is a very important variable in retirement, will change depending on what part of the country you are in. Some things to consider when choosing a location include:


Generally, renting is cheaper than buying on either coast, and buying is usually cheaper than renting in the middle of the country.Are there quality health care facilities close by?
Are all the recreational activities you want to participate in during retirement available?
Do you want to move closer to family?
Are you considering part-time work? If so, look for places with a low unemployment rate and a growing economy., You must also take your significant other’s and family’s needs and wants into consideration when choosing a house. Talk to them about what their must-haves are and where they would like to live.


Ask your significant other questions like, “Where do you see us living after retirement?” “What would you like to do more of when you retire?” or “What are your top three must-haves for our new home?”
If you are planning on moving closer to family, be sure to discuss boundaries. For example, while your children and grandchildren will no doubt love having you closer, moving into the same neighborhood as them might be too close.

, Once you’ve narrowed down where you’d like to live, you’ll need a good realtor to help you find places that fit into your budget and needs. Most importantly, you need an experienced real estate agent who is ethical and knows the area well. When looking for a real estate agent, do the following:


Ask for referrals or look for them online. Good realtors will have plenty of satisfied customers that are happy to tout their abilities.
Do an Internet search for the top real estate companies in the area and check their employees’ bios and reviews to get an idea which realtor might be a good fit for you.
Ask for referrals from other real estate professionals. If you have a great realtor in your current location, ask them if they know of any good realtors in your new location. Professionals are usually happy to refer clients to capable associates.
There is a difference between a realtor and a real estate agent. Realtors belong to the National Association of Realtors and pledge to follow a Code of Ethics. Real estate agents, however, make no such pledge., Whether you’re thinking about renting or buying, you’ll want to be thorough when viewing any potential properties. Spend time going through the whole house and make notes about what you like, what you don’t like, and any concerns or issues you noticed. To help you determine whether or not this house is a good fit for you, consider the following:


Is anything in the house damp? Is the building structurally sound? Are the window frames in good shape? How old is the roof and is it intact?
Is there enough storage space? Are the rooms spacious enough for your needs? Are there enough electrical outlets? And are they in good condition? What’s the neighborhood like?, When it comes down to it, actually crunching the numbers might give you the best idea of whether renting or buying is most suitable for you (financially at least). Once you’ve narrowed your search down to a few homes, calculate your monthly homeownership costs. To do so, you must take into consideration the transaction costs of buying a home, property insurance and taxes, maintenance and repair costs, homeowners insurance, and the opportunity cost of tying up your money in the purchase of a new home. This can be extremely tricky and will vary depending on factors like where you buy your home and the current status of the housing market, but you can use the following numbers as a general guide:


As a general rule, experts say you can expect to spend about $834 per month in homeownership costs for every $100,000 in your houses value. For example, a $300,000 house would produce monthly ownership costs of around $2,500 ($834 x 3). The numbers in this example were calculated assuming the homeowners would be in their house for 10 years., Because there are few additional costs to renting, such as maintenance and repairs, taxes, and so on, determining your monthly rental costs is pretty straightforward. These costs will simply be the amount you will to pay in rent every month.Keep in mind your lifestyle needs and wants when looking for a suitable rental.
Also consider that the cost of renting generally goes up year after year, so you will probably not be paying the same rate 10 years down the road., Once you’ve determined the monthly cost of both owning your own home and renting, compare the two to figure out which is the cheaper option. For example, a $300,000 home could generate ownership costs of around $2,500 per month. If you can find a home that costs less than $2,500 per month to rent, renting might be the better option for you.


Figuring out the cost of owning a home versus renting can be confusing. Luckily, online mortgage calculators and rent-vs.-buy tools can make this much easier. The New York Times has an excellent online rent-vs.-buy tool that you can use to help you make these decisions., Renting and buying both have financial pros and cons that you must think about as well. Just because renting is the cheaper option doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best option for you, and vice versa. Consider the pros and cons of each to help determine which solution makes the most sense for you.


Home ownership pros: you can usually get more for your money and you can build equityHome ownership cons: entails financial risk like fluctuations in market value and inflation, you are responsible for repair and maintenance costs, and your monthly costs are likely to fluctuateRenting pros: amount paid in rent won’t fluctuate from month to month, the landlord takes care of repair and general maintenance costs, and renting frees up money for your to invest or use on other expensesRenting cons: rent will likely increase over time and there is no offsetting increase in equity when you rent your home like there is when you buy"

Get away from the source of the burn.,
Determine the severity of the burn.,
Cool your wound.,
Clean the wound.,
Cut aloe from a plant.,
Use store-bought aloe.,
Apply a generous amount to your wound.,
Take an aloe vera bath.,
See a doctor.",How to Use Aloe Vera to Treat Burns," Whenever you find yourself burned, you need to get away from the source of the burn. If you got burned by an electrical appliance, turn off the appliance and move the skin away from it. If you were burned by chemicals, get away from the spill as quickly as possible. If you got a sunburn, get out of the sun immediately.


If your clothes were covered with chemicals or burned in the process, remove them as carefully as possible without hurting the wound. Do not pull clothing away from your skin if it sticks to the burned area; call emergency services or seek immediate medical attention.;
, There are three different degrees of burns. Before you treat your burn, you need to know the difference in the burns. A first-degree burn affects only the top layer of skin, is usually red, can be painful, and is dry to the touch.A second-degree burn extends further into the under layers of skin, may look ""wet"" or discolored, often includes white blisters, and generally causes pain.Third-degree burns extend all the way through the skin and sometimes into surrounding tissue. They look dry or leathery, and may include black, white, brown, or yellowed skin at the burn site. They cause swelling and are extremely severe, even though they often hurt less than more minor burns because the nerve endings have been damaged.If you are unsure whether a burn is first- or second-degree, call a doctor. If you think it is anything other than a first-degree burn, see your doctor. Second- and third-degree burns can be life-threatening if not properly treated.
Only continue if you know your burn is first-degree or minor second-degree. Others should not be treated with this method unless a doctor tells you it is okay.
Never treat a third-degree burn, or any open wound, with aloe. The aloe does not allow the burn to dry, which makes it impossible to heal., Once you have assessed the state of your burn and removed yourself from the injurious situation, you can start to cool your wound. This helps pull the heat from the wound and calm the skin before you apply aloe. Run cold water over the burn for 10-15 minutes as soon as possible after the burn.


If you cannot reach the area with a tap or shower, soak a cloth in cold water and place it over the burn for 20 minutes. Replace the cloth as its temperature rises with another newly soaked cloth.
If you're able to, bathe the burned area in cool water for at least 5 minutes. You can soak the area in a sink or bowl of cool water., Once you have cooled the wound, you need to clean it. Take some soap and rub it in your hands. Gently rub the soap over the burned area, cleaning it. Rinse the area with cool water to remove to soap suds. Pat dry with a towel.


Do not rub the wound because it can cause the skin to get even more irritated or the skin to break if it is sensitive or starting to form blisters., If you have an aloe plant in your home or near where your burn occurred, you can use it to get fresh aloe. Remove a few meaty leaves near the bottom of an aloe vera plant. Cut off any spines on the leaves to avoid getting poked. Cut the leaves in half down the middle and score the insides with your knife. This will release the aloe from the leaves. Collect the aloe on a dish.


Repeat until you have enough aloe to cover all of your burn.Aloe vera plants are very easy to maintain. They grow in almost all indoor climates, and in warm outdoor climates. Water it every other day and make sure you do not overwater it. Offshoots from the plant can be easily potted to grow a new plant.

, If you do not have an aloe plant, you can use over-the-counter aloe gel or cream. It can be acquired at most general stores, pharmacies, and grocery stores. When purchasing a brand, make sure the cream or gel is 100% pure aloe vera gel, or as close as possible. Some products have more than others, but you should get the one with the highest possible amount of aloe. Look at the ingredient list of the gel you buy. Some that claim that they are ""made with pure aloe gel"" only have 10% aloe., Take the aloe you extracted from the plant or pour a generous amount of the gel into your hands. Rub it gently onto the burned area, making sure not to scrub the affected area or rub too hard. Repeat 2-3 times a day until the burn is no longer painful.


You only have to cover your wound after the aloe vera has been applied if it is in a place that might get rubbed against or hurt without a protective covering. In this case, use a clean bandage or gauze that will not leave any residue behind once it is removed., If you want another alternative to simply applying aloe vera gel, you can take an aloe vera bath. If you have an aloe plant, boil a few leaves in water. Take out the leaves and pour the water, which may be brown in color, into your bathwater. If you have gel, pour a generous amount into your water as you fill up the tub. Lay in the lukewarm water infused with aloe for 20 minutes to soothe your burn.You can also buy bubble bath with aloe in it, but it is not recommended to use these products on burned skin. They may have other chemicals that might dry out your skin instead of hydrating it.

, Sometimes, aloe will not be enough to heal a burn. You should monitor your burn while you are using aloe to see how it progresses. You should see a doctor if your burn gets worse or becomes more irritated by the aloe. You should also seek medical attention if your burn persists for more than a week and seems to not get better.


If your burn has increased pain, swells, develops pus, or you run a fever, you may have an infection and you need to see a doctor.You need to see a doctor immediately if you get an infection, have trouble breathing, have a low body temperature, or experience bone or joint problem on the site of the burn. You should also see a doctor immediately if you have burns on your face or hands.

Protect their physical safety.",How to Deal With the Elderly," If your relationship has had the same power structure for a long time, old patterns will begin to emerge. If you are caring for someone who has always been controlling or critical, this dynamic will continue.


If the behavior is very old, changing it is unlikely. Ask yourself what is and is not acceptable. If you feel that the behavior is abusive toward you, then you will need to either have a discussion about boundaries, or enlist someone to help you with caregiving.
Sometimes difficult behavior is new and unrelated to old dynamics. If this is the case, you should try to determine a cause.;
, If difficult behavior is a big break from old patterns of behavior, it is usually caused by the traumas of aging. Have a discussion about what might be bothering them.


It’s not a good idea to bring up what might be bothering them while they are having an outburst. Try to wait until they are calmer.
Do not blame them. Say, “I notice some things have been bothering you more. What can I do to help you out when you’re dealing with them?”

, If an elderly person has become too controlling or aggressive, you may start to dread visiting. When it begins to significantly impact your quality of life, it is time to confront them about it. When confronting them, make sure that you stress that you love them. Say, “I am always going to love you, no matter what, as long as you live.”
Then tell them why you are having trouble. “If you continue this behavior, though, I am not going to want to spend as much time around you or visit you as often.”
Finish by appealing to their dignity. “I am telling you this because I want you to help me by ending this behavior. That way we can make the most of this time we have together.”

, If an elder’s difficult behavior is driving you to depression, you may have to distance yourself.


Don’t blame the elder when you tell them you will not be able to be the sole provider of care. Say, “I don’t think I’ve been able to provide you with the best care possible. I want to make sure that you’re completely taken care of.”
Search for resources in your community for caregivers. Check http://www.aarp.org/home-family/caregiving/?intcmp=LNK-BRD-MC-REALPOSS-GTAC for advice and guidance in finding service providers, making plans, and caring for the elderly person in your life.
If it is truly no longer safe for the person to live in their home without outside assistance, suggest either a live-in nurse or moving into an assisted living situation where staff will be present around the clock.
It is important to have conversations with your parents (and other elderly relatives who depend on you) about their wishes regarding care later in life. Start having these conversations early on and make sure to include your siblings. Ask your loved one what their wishes are regarding care late in life and be sure to obtain all of the necessary legal documents to provide them the care that they have requested, such as a power of attorney.

, Figure out what their preferences are, and what your availability to help is. If you go into a conversation armed with the facts, you can pre-empt any complaints that they might have. You might consider asking your family doctor for resources and information about things like home health care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social workers.


Try discussing all of the care options available with your loved one. This will give them an opportunity to consider their options and choose the one that is the most appealing. For example, your loved one may be more comfortable with having a home health care aide some to visit them a few days per week than moving into a nursing home.
Be sure to check the references for any eldercare services you consider hiring.
You might also explain that accepting some care early on may prolong independence in the long term., Some elderly people will be resistant to receiving care. Aging people are losing independence, mental agility, and physical ability, so they may fight to keep some control.


Choose a time when you are both relaxed. It will be easier to have an honest conversation if there are no other tensions.
Use friends and family members to help if you meet a lot of resistance. Do not say things like “So and so said you’ve been having trouble with x”, as this will cause miscommunications. Rather, bring friends along, or let them know that you’ve started having these conversations.
Use positive words rather than words that will make them feel like invalids-- “client” rather than “patient”, or “friend” rather than “nurse”.

, Elderly people are especially prone to depression as a result of the changes they experience. These changes may include incontinence, pain from arthritis, loss of vision, loss of hearing, and loss of independence.

Try to put yourself into this person’s shoes and imagine how they are feeling. This will make it easier for you to approach them from a place of compassion and love.

, One coping process for aging is determining how an elder will live on after death. Helping them along this journey can be healing for everyone involved.


This may be as simple as bringing up and discussing how they have impacted lives: “Your children really respect you and take your advice to heart.”
Ask them to write or dictate stories from their life. Keep a recording of what they say, or have their writing bound.
If asking them is unfruitful, you may want to get them involved in activities that will bring them into contact with people. You can keep a record of what happens there.

, Allowing them to make their own decisions will keep them from feeling out of control and lashing out.


Even though it may not be the most efficient way to do something, it will mean a lot to an elder to be able to make even small choices. Call and ask how they want something done, whether it be a doctor’s appointment or a trip to the park.
“When do you want to get there?” and “Who should I invite?” are both good questions that may go ignored if you are too concerned with making decision quickly.
If they have trouble making decisions, you can present them with a few choices. This way, they still get to be the deciding factor.

, Elderly people often forget things or ask the same questions over and over. They can be slow-moving or even obstinate. Keep in mind that they usually can’t help it and aren’t deliberately trying to be difficult or cause you stress.


Don’t try to rush them. Use gentle reminders if they are getting distracted, but do not force them to move faster.
Don’t worry about speed unless it is absolutely necessary. In today’s world, we’ve been taught to do everything as quickly as possible, but that may simply not be necessary for older people.

, As their abilities change, elderly people may begin to feel ignored. Often they feel as though they lose the respect that they fought for all their lives.


Ask them their opinions about skills that they are knowledgeable about, like gardening or cooking. For example you can say, “I’ve been trying to make that casserole you always used to make for potlucks, but I can’t seem to get it right. What’s the secret?”
Update them on how their advice worked. This will make them feel both respected and useful. “Your advice worked great! Everyone loved it. I told them it was your help that made it so good.”

, Contact is important in maintaining mental health and happiness. As people age and their friends and spouses pass away, they receive less physical contact, which can deepen depression.Give them hugs, hold their hand, or hold their arm as you walk together. Small touches during everyday interactions can go a long way to counteracting the social isolation that elderly people often endure. Touch can lower blood pressure, and even help reduce physical pain. , If you are taking care of a family member, you have likely been creating a relationship that has taken shape over years. As your roles reverse, this may change.


Aging family members may become angry that they’ve lost the authority that they used to have over you. Allow them to work through this anger. Things are changing, but eventually everything will settle down.
You may expect that your relationship will deepen or improve with increased contact, but also be aware that old emotions and ways of interacting may not work in your new role. Don’t let your expectations get too high.

, You may need to open yourself up to spirituality to get through rough patches. If this works for you, make sure that you keep up some sort of routine when times are easy as well.


Meditation particularly is a long-term practice. If you meditate, try to do at least a few minutes each morning. The most simple form of meditation is just sitting with eyes closed, counting breaths up to ten. As your mind wanders, you just bring your thoughts back to the breath. Spiritual practices are about forgiving yourself. It is an opportunity to examine your feelings without guilt or shame, and just be okay with yourself.

, Take time to visit friends, go to the movies, or have a glass of wine. This may seem difficult, but it’s just as important as any other part of your life.


It might be too hard to be spontaneous. Try to work a fun activity into your schedule, or just schedule some free time for yourself a few times a week.
Having free time built into your schedule will reduce confusion from your elder about why you are unavailable.

, Your support system will become even more important as you take on extra burdens. Make sure to talk out any difficult experiences with the people who matter most to you.


Don’t overload any one person. Your spouse probably understands you the best, but you won’t want all of your conversations to revolve around caregiving. Talk to friends that even seem a little bit outside of your inner circle. Sometimes you will find people who have gone through similar experiences.
Make it clear whether or not you want advice. Sometimes you just need to get something off your chest, but the person you are talking to thinks that you want a concrete solution. Let them know if you just want to rant, or if you’re asking their advice.

, Getting older and becoming less mobile can be very isolating, so making sure that the elderly person in your care has ample opportunity to interact with others in their age will provide entertainment and comradery, which will have both physical and mental health benefits.Many of the activities at senior centers, like bingo, music, exercise, and games are designed to boost brain-power. Encourage them to join in on these activities, and accompany them if they are reluctant. Make sure they have whatever they need, like a hearing aid, in order to remain part of the conversation around them.Look into transportation options for seniors in your area. Some senior centers have their own shuttles to transport people to and from the senior center. There may also be a special senior shuttle in your area that will take people to and from their destination at a low cost.

, There is nothing sadder than having to give up a hobby or pastime that you have enjoyed for years. Helping senior citizens remain active can actually help slow the aging process, too.


If they aren’t able to play sports anymore, take them to watch games in person or watch games together on TV. Make sure they get exercise in other ways as well.
If failing eyesight makes artistic pursuits difficult, ask them for advice on a quilt you are making, ask them for help picking out paint colors to redecorate a room, or take them to an art museum.
Take religious senior citizens to services at their place of worship., Put regular visits to your elderly relatives or friends on your calendar so they are part of your regular routine. Showing up, even for a brief visit, will show them that you are thinking of them and will provide something for them to look forward to.


Elderly people need to see family or friends a minimum of three times per week to ward off depression and loneliness. Unfortunately, emailing doesn’t really help., Elderly people often have health problems that require multiple medications including pills, diabetic testing, and even injections. If keeping track of these medications becomes too much for you or for the elderly person, then talk with their doctor. You may be able to arrange for a registered nurse to visit their home once or twice per week to help with medication management.


Sort pills into a pill box marked with the days of the week. If they need different medications in the morning and evening, sort morning pills into a pill minder designated with a specific color, and the afternoon or evening medications into a different pill minder designated with a different color, or use one box with multiple rows for medications to be taken at different times of the day..
Keep a log book of medications taken, doctor’s appointments, and any medical problems they experienced for each day. If something goes wrong or they end up in the hospital, the records will help doctors figure out what happened and what to do.
The log book will also be helpful for reminding your elderly friend if they have already taken their medications for the day, so they won’t be confused and double-dose themselves.

, Sometimes elderly people end up being over-medicated and take so many pills a day that it is too confusing and may be unnecessary. Regularly going through each of the medications with the doctor and pharmacist can help prevent this problem. If the person has more than one doctor because they are managing multiple health problems, it is crucial to make sure that all physicians are aware of all of the drugs in their regimen. Some drugs can cause harmful reactions when combined.The pharmacist should be able to explain anything you need to know about timing for taking medications and possible side effects or adverse reactions.Contact their doctor and pharmacist right away if they have any adverse reactions after starting a new medication.

, Making sure that their environment is modified prevents falls and other accidents. People usually prefer to remain living independently in their own home as long as possible instead of moving in with relatives or into a nursing home. You can help make this possible by assessing the how the features of the home may present hazards, and fixing them to be safer when possible.


If the elderly person in your life still lives in their own home, consider hiring an aging in place expert to help you make modifications like handrails in the shower.If climbing up and down stairs is difficult or impossible, you may want to have a chair lift installed to prevent falls. Or, ramps can be installed to accommodate wheelchairs.

List any needs or concerns that you might have about the use of sunscreen.,
Read over the label on a sunscreen in your bathroom cabinet.,
Make an informed choice.",How to Understand Your Sunscreen Label," This list might include such things as:
Potential allergens
Potential carcinogens
Effectiveness of sunscreen
Duration of effectiveness
Suitability for different age groups etc.



 

;
, See which ingredients you are already familiar with and those that don't mean much to you at all. The following list provides some of the key sunscreen ingredients, along with an explanation of what they are:

SPF - this is the indicator level of how much ""Sun Protection Factor"" is in the sunscreen. The rating is an attempt to show how long you are protected from the sun's UVB rays, and the higher the SPF, the longer the protection lasts. However, increased SPF comes at a cost - do not let it fool you into thinking you can stay out in the sun longer and not take other sensible sun protection measures. That will only end in sunburn and premature skin aging. Also, the higher the SPF, the more chemical barriers you are being exposed to. And finally, SPF only measures sun-protections against UVB, not against UVA - see the article Understand the Effects of Different UV Rays for an explanation of the different effects of the rays. As such, the indicator is only telling half the story of how long it will take to redden your skin and you may redden much sooner!





Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide - these minute metal particles that reflect and scatter UV light. These do not penetrate your skin, which makes a sunscreen with these elements ideal for sensitive skin, children and those who do not like using chemical versions. Note that titanium dioxide has been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.Concerns have also been raised about the use of nanoparticles of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as possibly increasing the risk of skin cell damage but studies are as yet inconclusive.Chemical blocks - If there is a phrase on your sunscreen that says the sunscreen protects you against UV radiation and both UVA and UVB rays, then it contains chemical blocks. Some chemicals tackle UVB and some UVA, so many products tend to contain a combination of both. Chemical blocks may cause skin reactions (rashes etc.) and for some people, there are questions about the safety of some chemicals in sunscreens who are concerned that the chemicals might penetrate the skin barrier and increase photocarcinogenic properties.If this is a concern for you, practice safe sun precautions (see ""Tips"" below).





Broad spectrum - this means that the sunscreen will protect against both UVB and UVA. However, some broad spectrums are better than others, as some sunscreens do not adequately block UVA. MedicineNet notes that ""a good broad-spectrum sunscreen should contain avobenzone, ecamsule (Mexoryl), titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide for significant UVA protection.""PABA-free - most sunscreens carry this message now. PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) caused a spate of skin rash reactions, so few manufacturers include it now. It is also implicated in increasing the chance of skin cancer.Modern sunscreens rely on derivatives of PABA which are considered to be safer, such as PABA esters (glyceryl, padimate A and padimate O).Although these derivatives are considered to be safer, there are still side effects for some users.





Waterproof or water resistant - this lets you know that the sunscreen will stay on as you swim. Water resistant generally stays on for about 40 minutes, with waterproof generally providing coverage for up to 80 minutes.However, no sunscreen is really waterproof and will eventually wash off. It is generally recommended that you reapply such sunscreen every 2 hours when you are swimming.





Baby or child sunscreen - this indicates a more skin sensitive formula that has been manufactured to suit babies and children.





Expiry date - pay attention to this one; old sunscreen won't be able to protect you as the ingredients break down and their effectiveness wears off. It isn't helped by the fact that we tend to leave sunscreens in the heat, fastening their demise. Replace regularly, at least every year.





Extracts and scents - mere window dressing to make the product more palatable. These can be irritants, so take care.






, Next time you purchase a sunscreen, keep this list in mind and be guided by the needs and concerns that you listed in Step one. Follow up any concerns that you might have with the retailer and the manufacturer. You can also ask your local health professional for more information and advice.

Run the burn under cold water.,
Cool the spot for 5-10 minutes.,
Look at the spot after a few minutes.,
Continue applying a cold compress, if the pain persists.,
Raise the burned area above your heart.,
Seek medical attention for serious burns.",How to Treat a Small Burn1," If you've just burned yourself, rinse the burn under cool water. Cold water will quickly cool the affected area and minimize the size of the burn. Don't use soap yet, just rinse the burn.Don't rinse more serious burns. If you see any scorching or ash and smell burning, stay away from water and call 911.
Don't submerge burns in water. Rinse gently, then dry your skin by patting it with a clean towel afterward.;
, After cooling down your skin with water, you can use a clean cold compress on the burn to reduce swelling. This helps to soothe the pain and minimize the swelling and blistering that can occur with minor burns.


Some people like to use chipped ice cubes, or bags of frozen vegetables or other frozen items instead of a clean cold compress. If you do this, don't ice directly for more than 5 or 10 minutes. Burns can numb your heat-sensitivity, which means you can actually get frostbite. Since you won't be able to feel it getting too cold, use ice sparingly.

, Even if you think the burn is relatively mild, keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't get worse. Sometimes, bad burns can become numb, making the pain come on later.Learn the difference between burns to plan for care:



First degree burns affect the top layer of skin only, and are characterized by redness, minor swelling, and pain. First degree burns don't usually require medical attention.Second degree burns also only affect the outer layer of skin, but are more severe, characterized by red and white splotchy skin, blistering, swelling, and more significant pain.

Third degree burns affect the under layers of skin, and the fat beneath. Some severe third degree burns even affect muscle, or bone. These burns are characterized by blackness or white scorching on the skin, and may be accompanied by difficulty breathing, severe pain, and smoke inhalation.

, Use a cold washcloth or other sanitary compress on the affected area to help with the pain. Coldness helps both to reduce the pain and reduce the swelling of the burned area. Burns that blister will hurt more in the long run, so it's important to keep it from swelling up if you can.

, Sometimes, even minor burns will start to throb and can be quite painful in the first few hours. If your burn hurts, you can ease the pain by raising the area above the level of your heart, if possible.

, All third degree burns require medical attention as quickly as possible. Second degree burns larger than three inches, or on the hands, feet, face, genitals, or major joints and sensitive areas, it's also important to get checked out by a doctor.

Clean the area gently with soap and water.,
Apply over-the-counter topical cream if necessary.,
Leave the burn uncovered.,
Leave small blisters alone.,
Wear loose clothing around the area.,
Take over-the-counter pain reliever, if necessary.",How to Treat a Small Burn2," After you've gotten the swelling and the pain under control, clean the burn with some mild soap and water. Dry the area and keep the burn clean to avoid infection.

, To help keep the swelling down and the burn as clean as possible, it's a good idea to use a basic salve or balm that you can get at the store. Aloe-vera gel or cream is often used, as well as low-dosage hydrocortisone.


If you have blisters, use an antibiotic topical cream and cover the blister with a bandage for about 10 hours before you uncover it.
Gentle, scent-free moisturizer is sometimes used on mild burns. This helps keep the skin on the burned area from cracking. Let the burn heal some before you apply moisturizer.

, Very mild burns don't need to be covered to help them heal. Keep the burn clean and dry, and it should heal in a few days.


Blistered burns should generally be covered loosely with gauze. If you're in pain, you can use some loosely-wrapped gauze or a Band-Aid to cover the burned area and keep it safe.

, Never attempt to pop blisters when they form. The blister is protecting the burned area and helping to heal the skin underneath. Blisters will go down in a few days, provided that you keep the area clean and dry.


Larger blisters should be checked out by a doctor, who will often lance or remove the blisters, if necessary. Never attempt to do this by yourself.

, To keep the burn from becoming irritated, try to keep the area open and dry. Wear loose fitting cotton clothes that breathe well and let the air get to the burn.


If you've burned a finger or hand, remove any rings, bracelets, and watches from the area, and wear short sleeves. You don't want to agitate the area at all, if possible.

, If your burns are hurting, taking a pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. This can help to reduce swelling as well as control the pain. Use OTC pain medications as directed.

Treat burns with aloe-based gels.,
Apply coconut and lavender oil.,
Dab the burn with vinegar.,
Use cut potato.,
Only use home remedies on very minor burns.",How to Treat a Small Burn3," Aloe-vera gels and moisturizers are helpful at soothing and cooling burns. You can use the natural oil from the plant itself, or buy some aloe cream at the store.


Some moisturizers and lotions advertised as ""aloe"" actually contain only a small percentage of aloe-vera. Read the ingredients, and make sure you're not covering your burn with scented, aluminum-based lotions.

, Lavender essential oil is thought to have therapeutic properties for small cuts, abrasions, and minor burns that affect the outer layer of the skin. Essential oils can irritate your skin, however, so it's important to mix it with a soothing oil, like coconut, which has antimicrobial properties.Supposedly, the French scientist who pioneered the use of lavender oil as a home remedy once burned himself in the lab and plunged his hand into a vat of lavender oil, healing it quickly., Some people think that a small amount of diluted vinegar can help to control pain and heal very minor burns quickly. If you burn yourself, rinse the burn quickly with cool water, then use a wet washcloth with a few drops of vinegar on it. Use the cloth as a cold compress on the affected area., Cut potato is sometimes used in rural regions instead of bandages, specifically on burns.Potato peel is antibacterial and won't stick to the wound, which can be somewhat painful.


If you try this, make sure you clean the wound thoroughly before and after, and rinse the potato before you apply it. Don't leave potato residue on your wound., If you can't heal up a burn with cool water, over-the-counter medication, and time, you need to get medical attention. Never try to use unverified home remedies on serious burns.


Petroleum jelly or Vaseline is commonly thought to have burn-soothing benefits, but this is not true. Vaseline is a moisture barrier, which can dry out the wound. Vaseline has no actual healing properties. Putting Vaseline on a burn is not recommended.
Some people think toothpaste, butter, and other kitchen supplies should be used on burns. This is not backed up in any way. Never apply toothpaste to burns."

Spit out whatever burned you.,
Drink cold water immediately.,
Place an ice cube on your tongue.,
Rinse your mouth out with salt water.,
Continue rinsing your mouth with salt water daily.,
Keep blisters intact.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat ice cream, frozen yogurt, ice pops, and other cold, soft foods.,
Keep any cold foods or drinks in your mouth as long as you can.,

Apply an oral anesthetic to blisters and painful spots.,
Take a pain reliever if you are uncomfortable.,
Brush your teeth carefully.,
Visit the doctor if you see no improvement or the pain is too much to handle.,
Avoid hot food and drinks while your mouth is healing.,
Avoid crunchy food.,
Abstain from spices.,
Stop eating acidic food.",How to Treat Tongue Burn Blisters," You'll probably realize right away that the food or beverage you just put in your mouth was way too hot. You should should remove the food or drink that burned you immediately, or it will keep scalding your mouth. It isn't always possible to spit the food out, but you should try to do this instead of swallowing the food so you don't continue burning your throat and esophagus.;
, This helps in two ways. First, it will cool off the burned area. Second, it removes any food or liquid that is still hot. Oily foods especially can leave hot liquid in your mouth that will continue to burn you if you don't flush it away quickly.Cold milk coats the inside of your mouth more thoroughly than water. You may find extra relief from drinking some cold milk., After rinsing with cold water, suck on an ice cube for 5 to 10 minutes. This will keep your mouth cold and prevent any further burning, sparing as much of your mouth as possible. This will also numb the area, which is helpful because tongue burns can be very painful., After you've cooled off your mouth, you'll want to disinfect your burn. Your mouth is full of bacteria, and burns can get infected if not treated properly. A salt water solution will help disinfect the area and keep it free of infection.Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water. Stir so the salt dissolves.
Rinse and gargle with the mixture. Be sure not to swallow any of the salt water.

, You'll still want to keep your burn clean while it heals. You should continue rinsing your mouth once or twice daily until the burn heals., If you've suffered a more severe burn, blisters can form and you can experience a lot of pain. If blisters form on your tongue, don't pop or drain them. They may pop on their own, but your shouldn't do this purposely. Blisters protect new cells as they form and keep bacteria out of wounds. Popping them can slow the healing process and could lead to an infection., This will help keep the area moisturized, which will help with pain. It also aids in the healing process by balancing your mouth's pH and preventing acids from damaging new cells. Additionally, blisters can pop more easily when they are dry., While you may lose some of your sense of taste as your burn heals, these treats will definitely make your healing process more enjoyable. Not only are they easy to eat, but the cold will keep your tongue numb and kill the pain.Sprinkling a little sugar on your tongue may help with pain., When you take a drink of cold water or a bite of ice cream, keep it over your burn blisters for as long as you can. This will numb the area and fight the pain., This mixture is both soothing and helps increase circulation to the mouth. Increased circulation brings nutrients to the wound, which will help it heal faster and more efficiently.Alternatively, you could just apply a dab of honey to the blisters. This will soothe the wound and stimulate circulation. Honey also has natural anti-bacterial properties that can help prevent infection.
Do not give honey to infants under 1. It may cause infant botulism, a serious condition.

, If ice cream and cold drinks don't treat the pain well enough, you can use an oral anesthetic. Brands like Orajel and Anbesol are readily available at pharmacies and supermarkets. These will help keep the area numb while it heals. Be sure to use these products as labels or pharmacists direct you to., If the pain from the burn is causing discomfort, you can treat it with a pain reliever like acetaminophen., The motion of brushing and the chemicals in toothpaste can be both painful and damaging to your burn. You'll have to take care when brushing to avoid popping blisters and hampering the healing process.Don't brush your tongue. You will damage newly-formed cells and slow the healing process. You can also pop blisters, which can lead to infections.
Don't get toothpaste on burned areas. Toothpaste can irritate the burn and cause pain.
Use mouthwash sparingly, if at all. Like toothpaste, mouthwash will irritate the burn. It is better to just rinse your mouth out with salt water while you wait for your burn to heal.

, The cells in your mouth regenerate quickly, so most burns on the tongue clear up in 2 or 3 days. If your burn was more severe, however, it can take longer for your mouth to heal. If it has been more than 3-4 days and you see no improvement, see your doctor to make sure you don't have an infection. You should also see your doctor at any point if the pain is more than you can handle, or if the burn seems large or deep, or if the burn makes it difficult to breathe or swallow., You can still have your coffee and tea, but just make sure you allow it to cool fully before drinking. You might even want to consider switching to iced varieties for a few days. The new cells in your mouth will be very sensitive- if you expose them to hot food before the burn is fully healed, they can easily burn again. Also it will be very painful.Blow on food and drinks to cool them off faster. For drinks, you should consider adding an ice cube to ensure they are a safe temperature.
Test everything before putting it in your mouth. Touch it with just the tip of your tongue to make sure it is a safe temperature.

, Foods like crackers, chips, and crunchy bread should be off the menu until your burn heals. These can scratch against your burn, which will be very painful. They can also pop blisters, which will slow the healing process and put you at increased risk of an infection., Spicy food will cause a lot of pain for your healing mouth. The irritation from spices can also slow the healing process. If you're a fan of spicy food, it would be best to abstain for a few days while your burn heals. Also avoid adding any spices like pepper to your food., These are mostly citrus-fruits like lemons, oranges, and pineapples. Citric acid will hurt and slow the healing process. Wait at least 3 days before bringing these foods back into your diet."

, There are many other venomous spiders found in the U.S., but let’s focus on the two most common species. Keep in mind that while they are both highly venomous, it is rare for either spider to attack people.


Black widow spiders are shiny black all over and about the size of a paper clip. They also have peculiar red circles or markings on their abdomen. A black widow’s bite will usually leave two small holes on the bite site. The black widow is feared because the strength of its venom is 15 times stronger than that of a rattlesnake.The brown recluse spider is sometimes called a violin spider because of its elongated legs and the violin-string mark on its back. To definitively identify this spider, you need to examine its eye. Most spiders have eight pairs of eyes, but the brown recluse spider only has six. , Both species of spiders like warm, dark and dry places or settings that are plagued and untouched. Their bite usually feels like a light pinprick, so your child may not even feel their bite.


In the United States, there are about 3,000 known poisonous spiders. Though poisonous, most of them do not have fangs strong and long enough to break through the skin. In fact, a majority of these spiders also have very weak venom that do not cause life-threatening problems., This will help you identify the species of spider and determine how serious the bite is. But if you suspect your child has been bite by a venomous spider, skip this step and take them to the hospital.


Use a plastic or glass container to capture the spider. Avoid touching or holding the spider.

, Usually, the larger the spider species, the more dangerous they are. So discourage your child from playing with bigger spiders and if a bigger spider bites your child, be more cautious when treating the bite.

, These are all signs of a brown recluse spider and a black widow spider bite.

, This is a characteristic of a brown recluse spider bite. The area surrounding the bite will also appear to have a bluish streak. The blisters will be filled with fluid that will slough off and leave a deep, enlarged ulcer on the skin., These are symptoms of a black widow spider bite. Your child may also experience stiffness and intensifying muscle pains within 8 hours after they were bitten., This is a rare, but possible scenario. If your child has an allergic reaction, histamines (substances that cause swelling and itching) can accumulate in the bite area or in other parts of their body.Your child may experience swelling and inflammation of their mouth or face.
Your child may have difficulty breathing, they may wheeze (whistling sound when they breath), and feel tightness in their chest. The histamine will cause their airways to become inflamed and more narrow, resulting in breathing difficulties.
Your child may have trouble speaking or swallowing. Histamines can cause a constriction of the muscles your child uses to speak and swallow.
Other symptoms of an allergic reaction include intense pain that extends beyond the bite area, severe abdominal cramping and pain, vomiting, excessive sweating, a rash, joint pain, and general weakness.

, Spider bites can be easily mistaken for other bug bites, especially if you did not see the spider bite your child or find the spider. Assess the bite mark carefully and make sure it is not a bite from another insect.


Bed bug bites are usually painless. The bite mark will be a raised, red skin bump which can be very itchy. They appear very similar to a mosquito or flea bite.Tick bites have a bite area with a “bulls-eye” rash, which means the rash resembles the bulls-eye used in shooting games or darts. But the bite is usually not painful or itchy.Flea bites appear as a raised, red skin bump with a single pierce mark at the center. These bites can be itchy and appear in groups of 3 or 4. The rash may turn white when you press it and become bigger or spread over time.Bee stings cause a sharp pain that becomes dull and more of an ache over time. The bitten area will have a red skin bump with white around it.Lice bites will appear as small red bumps that can be very itchy and may become crusty or ooze with fluid.Mite bites will appear as small, raised bumps that look like pimples or acne and can be very itchy., Once you determine your child has not been bitten by a venomous spider like a black widow or brown recluse, assure them that you are going to take care of the bite at home.


If your child is scared and crying, comfort them. Ask them how they got the spider bite.
If your child cannot yet express themselves by speaking, look for non-verbal cues. For example, you can figure out your child’s level of pain from the bite by looking at their body language and their face. If they are grimacing or crying, they are likely scared and in pain.

, This will help them focus on something besides the spider bite. You can also sing, hug, or kiss them to comfort and distract them.

, The spider’s fangs will have likely broken the skin. This breach could allow bacteria and harmful microorganisms to infect the bitten area. So, cleaning the bite area reduces transmission of these harmful microorganisms.


Avoid using alcohol to clean the bite as this can be painful for your child.
You can also use a betadine solution to clean the bite. Apply the medication with a cotton ball, wiping the area in a circular motion, starting from the center and going outward. This method will decrease the chance of introducing more bacteria to the area.

, Cooling methods like a cool compress or an ice pack wrapped in a clean cloth or towel will minimize swelling around the bite. Also, applying something cold has the added benefit of numbing the area so your child feels less pain and itchiness around the bite.Only apply the cold compress for around 20 minutes. Keeping it on for longer may lead to injury on your child’s skin.

, If the bite becomes very swollen, raising it above your child’s head or heart will allow gravity to make it difficult for fluid or blood to reach the inflamed area. This will also help to drain any excess fluid from the bite.

, This will slow down the spread of the spider’s venom by constricting your child’s blood vessels. Once you do this, take your child to the hospital or your doctor immediately if you realize the bite is from a black widow spider or brown recluse spider.

, If a black widow or brown recluse spider bite is causing unbearable pain or life-threatening symptoms for your child, the doctor may recommend an injection of anti-venom into their thigh muscle or through a vein.


Anti-venom is an antibody (proteins that kill foreign bodies) that works by neutralizing the toxins, making them harmless. However, it cannot reverse any damage that is already done to your child because of the bite.An injection of anti-venom can be frightening for your child so always stay with them when they get the injection. Comfort and distract them with their favorite toy or stuffed animal.

, These can include itching, swelling of different body parts, and breathing difficulties.


Your child will be assessed first to see if they have an allergy to horses to avoid side effects, since the anti-venom is derived from horses.
The anti-venom can interact with other drugs such as atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and bisoprolol.Talk to the doctor if your child is on any of these medications before going forward with an anti-venom injection.

, Because black widow spider bites are usually very painful, over-the-counter pain-relievers are not strong enough to reduce your child’s pain.Opioid pain-relievers are stronger than mild pain-relievers. They work by blocking the pain signals going to the brain so pain will not be felt at all.Commonly prescribed opioid pain-relievers include:


Morphine sulphate (Duramorph, Infumorph). The recommended dose is 0.05 to 0.1 mg per kg given through a vein.Oxycodone (OxyContin, Roxicodone). The recommended dose is 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg/dose every 4 to 6 hours given as tablets and syrups.Hydrocodone (Zohydro ER, Hysingla ER). The recommended dose is 3.75 to 15 ml every 4 to 6 hours given as tablets and syrups., These can include nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness and breathing problems in the case of an overdose.To cope up with nausea and vomiting, feed your child small frequent meals, perhaps six a day, rather than the standard three major meals.
Make sure your child drinks a lot of water, at least 8 to 10 glasses of water a day, to avoid dehydration caused by vomiting.
Breathing problems or respiratory depression as a result of opioid pain-relievers can be prevented if the nurse or doctor administers the correct dose.
These pain-relievers can interact with different drugs and substances such as acetaminophen, tramadol, aspirin, narcan, parnate, alcohol and bupropion. They can also interact with medical conditions such as diarrhea, liver disease, kidney problems and seizure disorders.Let your doctor know about any other medical issues your child may have before getting a prescription for opioid pain-relievers.

, Studies show that children who receive aspirin at a young age increase their chances of developing Reye’s syndrome, a rare but fatal disease.Paracetamol is part of the acetaminophen drug family and available as an over-the-counter drug. It works by inhibiting the production of pain chemicals that lead to pain perception.


Special consideration should be given as you are giving a drug to a child, not to an adult. So you need to adjust dose accordingly.
The maximum single dose of paracetamol for children is 15 mg per weight (kg) of the child. So if your child weighs 30 kilograms, then the maximum dose is only 450 mg per day.
Divide this dosage and give it to your child 4-6 times a day. The medication is taken orally., This medication works by blocking the production of histamine, which causes tissues to itch and swell.The most common prescribed antihistamine is diphenhydramine, found in brands such as Benadryl and Sominex. The recommended dose is 5 mg/kg/day administered orally as tablets and syrups. It can also be injected to a muscle or to a vein.Antihistamines can interact with other drugs and substances such as acetaminophen, tamoxifen, potassium chloride, caffeine, propoxyphene and aspirin. It can also interact with medical conditions such as asthma, heart disease, and kidney and liver disease.Talk to your doctor before giving your child antihistamines if they have any of these conditions or are on any other medication.

If you are injected with venom from the bite, you have one, clear course of action to take: slow the spread of venom while you get help.


If you are confident that you were bitten by a non-venomous snake, treat the bite site as a puncture wound and clean and wrap it appropriately. Continue to monitor the wound for bacterial infection.
If you’re unsure about the type of snake that bit you, err on the side of caution by assuming that you’ve been envenomated and proceed accordingly.;
, You may not know that you’ve been bitten until you show effects of the venom in your body. It is especially important that you know the signs of having been bitten before you go out in the wilderness. Remember, there are different types of venom and each impact the body differently. Some signs of poisoning include:


Blurred or disturbed vision
Swelling or discoloration around the bite, especially redness
Fang puncture marks (some snakes will only puncture with one of their fangs)
Tingling or numbness
Intense pain at the bite site
Vomiting, nausea, or stomach cramps
Breathing problems

, It’s better to leave a snakebite untreated than to treat it improperly. Being bitten by a snake when you’re not close to a hospital can be frightening, and you might panic at first. If you’re bitten by a snake in the wilderness, you need to stop and assess your options so that you can treat yourself appropriately.Do your best to consider:


Your surroundings. Where are you? Is there a trail or road nearby? Do you recall seeing any signs or landmarks recently?
Your resources. Do you have a first-aid kit with you? A snakebite kit? If not, what resources do you have? What about a cell phone or two-way radio? If you do have a cell phone with you, make sure to install a first-aid app before you head out.
Distance from help. When you set off into the wilderness, did you pass a ranger station or medical station? Are you still close enough that you can reasonably get back to a main road and a hospital? If you were to call EMS, how quickly could they reach you? Consider hiking with a PLB (personal locator beacon) if you plan on being out of cellphone coverage.
Immediate danger. You’ve been bitten by a snake and are in the wilderness, which is dangerous. But look around to consider any other immediate danger such as other snakes, weather, other animals, or life-threatening allergies.

, The best treatment for a snake bite is that which is given by a medical professionals and first responders. As soon as you realize that you’ve been bitten, seek medical help. Many hospitals in known areas of venomous snakes have ready access to anti-venomous, and the quicker you are injected with an antivenom, the better.Don’t wait until pain or swelling becomes too much before calling for help. You risk your own safety, and if you wait too long, it will be too late for the antivenom to be effective.When you call for help, give the emergency operator your best location, either as a mile marker or landmark.
Emergency operators are trained to provide pre-arrival instructions, which you should follow exactly, until help arrives.

, If you can, take a picture of the snake that bit you, or at least get a look (if it’s safe to do so) at the snake so that you can describe it to emergency personnel. If, for example, you know that you were bitten by a Coral snake or can describe a snake with red on yellow, that description will help doctors decide what course of treatment is best.


It is suggested that you circle the bite location with a pen and note the time that you were bitten so that doctors can track the progress of the venom through your body, once help arrives.

, You need to make sure that you’re out of immediate danger, though you may need to go through your pack to retrieve any necessary supplies (if you are with someone, have them go through your pack instead). Once you are out of harms way and have anything you need from your pack. Venom is circulated through the blood, and the more you move, the higher your heart rate. The more your heart beats, the more your blood is circulated. Move as little as possible until help arrives.Remove (or ask another person to remove) any jewelry or tight clothing quickly. These tight items must be removed because you might swell at the bite location, and your jewelry or tight clothing may not be able to accommodate that swelling.

, Once you realize that you’ve been bitten (and sometimes people don’t realize it until they exhibit symptoms), immobilize the bitten body part. You want to avoid moving around, and you need to keep the bite location immobilized and below your heart. If you’re out in the wilderness alone and you don’t have a way to contact medical help, you may need to hike for help. Do your best to immobilize the bitten appendage and keep your heart rate down.


The best case scenario would be to lie down, keeping your head elevated above your heart, and the bite below your heart, which will slow the spread of venom in your bloodstream.

, If you have immediate access to soap and water, wash the bitten area. Your goal is to remove as much of the snake's saliva and venom as possible from your skin. Most snakebite kits will contain materials to wash your skin, also.


Your goal is to wash the skin. Don’t attempt to flush the bite area with water or any other liquid., You need to protect the wound from bacteria after washing the bite site. You should have a kit with you in the wilderness that contains the supplies necessary to bandage your wound. If you are more than half an hour from medical assistance, you’ll need to apply a pressure immobilization bandage.Pressure immobilization bandages are bandages that are firmly wrapped around the entire extremity that was bitten. Be sure that you don’t wrap your immobilization bandage too tight. The purpose of this wrapping is to keep your appendage from moving while the pressure slows the spread of the venom., At one time, some thought that they could cut around a snakebite and remove any venom from the body. We now know that just isn’t true. This is not only ineffective (the venom travels throughout the body via the blood, not the skin), but also leads to loss of tissue and substantially increases the potential for infection.Along these lines, don’t ever apply ice or an ice pack to a snakebite. This won’t slow the spread of venom, can lead to tissue damage, and ultimately, can make the injury substantially worse.

, It used to be that doctors advised bite victims to try and suck out the venom from the bite wound. Multiple studies show that suction does remove a small amount of venom, but not enough to be helpful or effective. Rather than try suction, just wash, immobilize, and bandage the wound while waiting for help.Many snakebite kits still have suction devices in them, but experts agree that they shouldn’t be used.

, If you’re in the wilderness and bitten by a snake, you might recall advice that directed bite victims to tourniquet the wound so that venom wouldn’t spread throughout the body. Multiple studies have shown that this is not only ineffective at stopping or slowing the spread of venom, but also puts the victim at risk of localized tissue damage, or, worse, loss of limb from lack of circulation., Don’t drink anything caffeinated, as this will elevate your heart rate and speed up the spread of the venom throughout your body. Similarly, don’t drink any alcohol as a pain reliever as this will thin your blood and speed up the spread of the venom throughout your body (so will aspirin).Additionally, you don’t want to ingest anything that will contraindicate with any treatments medical personnel administer to you. Your best, safest choice is to drink water and take no pain relievers., Learn which snakes live in the region in which you’ll be in the wilderness to help with quicker identification. For example, all venomous snakes in North America (except Coral snakes) are pit vipers. That’s helpful because they all have big, fat bodies, their pupils are oblong, their fangs lay flat in their mouth, and they have heat-sensing pits below their eyes., Knowing some general guidelines about how snakes hunt, react, where they prefer to live, and how they defend themselves will help you stay out of trouble when you’re in the wilderness.


Vipers hibernate in the cold and typically mate in the spring and fall, when the weather is warm. Vipers live in all types of climates and can be terrestrial, arboreal, or even aquatic (Water Moccasins).
Elapidae snakes are typically elusive and are proficient burrowers. This family of snake usually spends their time underground, except during breeding season or rain. There are some Elapidae, however, that primarily live up in the trees or lurk in fallen leaves.Sea snakes live in warmer waters, but still come to the surface for air because they lack gills (which makes them easy to distinguish from eels)., Trying to identify a venomous snake by a triangular head shape has proven ineffective as most snakes have an approximately triangular head shape.Also, the triangular head rule really only works with vipers.


Many types of animals use camouflage to protect themselves and snakes are no exception. Some non-venomous snakes can even make their head shape more triangular when threatened, mimicking their venomous pit viper cousins.

, Familiarizing yourself with general traits in coloring, size, and markings can help you quickly identify a snake or its family. Remember, some non-venomous snakes have grown to mimic their venomous cousins as a means of camouflage and protection.


Vipers have a triangular head, which is wider than the neck. These snakes are often described as a bit fat. Vipers also have long fangs for deep penetration.
The Elapids have heads that are covered in relatively large scales and their heads are about the same width as their necks.
Sea snakes have flattened tails (to help them swim) and small heads.

, You may have heard before that venomous snakes have elliptical pupils while non-venomous snakes have round pupils. This rule of thumb is useful for one of the snake families, should you get close enough to see the snake’s eyes.


Snakes in the Viper family have elliptical pupils, which distinguishes them from similarly marked or colored snakes with round pupils.The Elapid and Hydrophidae, or Sea snake, families both have round pupils.

, Not all snakes are the same, and neither are all snake bites. Some bites can be fatal, whereas others may do little more than sting. If you know what family of snake has bitten you, you can appropriately treat yourself if you’re bitten in the wilderness and cannot immediately seek medical attention.


Viper venom can contain a variety of toxins: necrotizing, causing death of tissue near the bite; anti coagulating, which prevents the blood from clotting, and hemotoxic, causing a very painful bite, and blood issues, such as anemia and, rarely, kidney failure.Elapidae venom contains neurotoxins, or nerve toxins, of which there are several varieties, such as presynaptic and dendrotoxins.Hydrophidae venom is neurotoxic and myotoxic, which can cause muscle pain, or the other extreme, renal failure and cardiac arrest., Land snakes like protection and live in the trees, logs, rocky areas, large branches, dead leaves, tall grass, and some burrow underground. If possible, avoid these areas when you’re out in the wilderness.Remember, too, that snakes are wild animals and are unpredictable — you might find one in the middle of a trail or inside your tent, so always pay attention when you’re out in the wilderness.

, Because you’re in the wilderness, it’s especially important that you dress appropriately. Don’t go walking or hiking in shorts or sandals. You need to wear long, loose pants at all times to minimize your exposed skin, as well as keep your ankles and legs protected. You should also wear heavy boots or snake boots, so that your feet are protected from any fangs that might try to sink in them., When you’re out in the wilderness and come across a dead animal, such as a dead snake, you might be tempted to get a closer look. Whether it’s a simple curiosity or because you want to identify the snakes in the area, don’t, under any circumstances, touch the dead snake. Snakes retain reflexes after their death and are able to strike, bite, and inject fatal doses of venom hours after they have died.There should really be no reason for you to approach a dead snake in the wilderness; however, if you do, take necessary precautions and stay a good distance away from the animal.
Touch the snake with a long stick if necessary, so that any post-mortem reflexive biting will be targeted on the stick and not your hand or foot.

, Pay extra attention to what your senses are telling you in the wilderness, specifically what you hear, see, and smell. When threatened or trapped, snakes will often utilize defense mechanisms as a warning. You might hear a snake’s rattle or hiss, or smell their defensive secretions, or see a snake with its head raised above its body, for example.Many varieties of snakes will hiss to alert you that they see you and are uncomfortable with your presence and is meant as a warning sound to other animals, since snakes don’t have ears.
The well-known rattle of a snake’s tail is distinctive to the Pit Viper family (rattlesnakes) and this warning should be taken very seriously. If you’re traveling to the wilderness, make sure to listen to several audio clipsof actual rattlesnake rattles so that you can immediately identify the sound if necessary.Some snakes emit a smell as a warning to other animals, although there is debate as to whether this is exclusive to venomous snakes. What can be agreed upon is that venomous snakes typically emit a defensive smell: some give off sickeningly sweet, sometimes putrid, odor and others emit the smell of cucumbers or melons.Even the more aggressive species of snakes will usually avoid a confrontation if given the chance to flee. A bite is usually a last resort for a snake and will be preceded by warnings, such as sounds and smells.

, The last thing you want is to put your boots on and find a venomous snake still curled up inside, keeping warm. The best way to avoid a snake getting in any of your gear (backpack, tent, food, clothes) is to secure your items. If you have a vehicle with you, lock everything that you can inside. If you only have a tent, secure everything inside your tent so that no snakes make their way inside. Remember if you’re out in the wilderness, you will likely light a fire at some point.


Even a small fire will give off residual heat long after the flames have died out, and that residual heat, especially if you surround your fire with rocks, will attract snakes., Snakes don’t have ears, and instead rely on their eyes, tongues, and their ability to feel vibrations. When walking in the wilderness, poke the ground in front of you with a long stick. Doing this will allow snakes to feel your approach before they see you, and that gives them time to get away rather than feel trapped and defensive. Also, if your stick gets too close to a venomous snake and they do attack, they are more likely to attack the stick than you, as that will be the closest threatening object to them.Poking the ground with a stick is especially important when you’re walking through tall grass.

, Never go out into the wilderness alone. Stick with at least one buddy, just in case one of you is bitten and needs medical assistance. Also, if you set out into the wilderness with dogs or children, make sure to keep them close to you and behind your walking stick if you can. You don’t want to run the risk of them running ahead and encountering a venomous snake., If you do encounter a snake (or smell or hear one), stop moving immediately and consider your options. Ceasing your movements will lessen the immediate threat that the snake might feel. When you can, back away from the snake very slowly. Don’t make sudden movements, and use that long stick as a buffer between you and the snake. Remember, if they’re going to attack, they’re more likely to attack the closest threatening object."

Apply some home remedies.,

Distinguish between a wasp and a bee.,

Avoid provoking bees and wasps.",How to Treat Yourself if You Get Stung by a Bee or Wasp," If you have had multiple stings in the past or this instance has multiple stings, you may experience an allergic reaction to the protein in the venom of the wasp or bee. The level of your reaction will determine whether further treatment or professional medical assistance is required.


A mild reaction will be localized to the area where you were stung. You may develop a red, raised welt that is approximately ½ inch in diameter. However, some people will experience a red raised area up to two inches in diameter. The area may be itchy. The center is often white where the stinger punctured the skin.A moderate reaction includes the localized response you’ll see in a mild reaction, with the addition of swelling of the affected area that extends beyond two inches in the day or two following the sting.Moderate reactions usually peak at 48 hours and last five to ten days.
A severe reaction to a sting those symptoms in the mild and moderate levels of reaction with chronic hives (urticaria), diarrhea, coughing or difficulty breathing, swelling of the tongue and throat, weak and rapid pulse, reduced blood pressure, loss of consciousness and, potentially, death if not treated quickly. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should call your local emergency number. If you are aware of your allergy and have an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q or other), you should use it or have someone nearby use it on you. Press the autoinjector against your thigh and hold it there for a few seconds. Await emergency assistance.;
, The initial first aid for a bee or wasp sting will depend upon which insect stung you. In both cases, however, first aid will consist of reducing the discomfort and swelling to the area.Wasps do not leave a stinger behind, while honey bees (though not bumblebees) will leave a barbed stinger behind., Wash the sting site gently with soap and water. Use cool water to help reduce the discomfort. Hot/warm water will increase the circulation to the area and increase the swelling. Then, apply a cold pack or ice to reduce swelling. If you are using ice, ensure that there is a towel between the ice and your skin to reduce the potential for cold damage to the skin's surface. Apply the cold pack or ice for 20 minutes once an hour until you feel relief.If the area is very itchy, you could take an oral antihistamine like Benadryl to relieve the itching. Alternatively, over-the-counter topical corticosteroid cream can also be used to reduce the histamine response in the area to the sting.
If you feel pain in the area, you can take ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed. Follow all dosing instructions on the bottle.

, First, you need to remove the sting. The stinger should be located in the center of the sting. There will be a venom sac attached which continues to pump out venom into your body after the bee has flown off. Do not pull the stinger out with your fingers or a tweezer. Squeezing the venom pouch will only drive the venom into your body faster. Instead, wash your hands and then scrape your fingernails across the stinger to catch it and pull it out without squeezing the sac. You could also scrape the sting site with a credit card edge to pull out the stinger.As with a wasp sting, wash the affected area with soap and water, apply a cold pack or ice to the area to reduce swelling and discomfort. If using an ice pack, place a towel between the ice and your skin to prevent cold damage to the tissue.
Consider an over-the-counter antihistamine or topical corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation, itching and discomfort from the sting.

, For ordinary stings that don’t cause an allergic reaction (see below), home treatment after applying initial first aid is adequate. In most cases, the signs and symptoms associated with the sting should disappear within several hours or a day or two.There are, however, some home remedies that can provide relief from the sting of the sting, so to speak. These include:


Make a paste of baking soda and water to place over the area. The baking soda helps to soothe the area, reduce the swelling and calm any itching.
Apply honey to the area to reduce the swelling and discomfort. Honey has natural antibacterial properties.
Crush a couple of cloves of garlic and apply the juice to the area. Garlic also has natural antibacterial properties.
Lavender essential oil can help reduce the pain of bee and wasp stings when a couple of drops are applied topically to the affected area.

, In most people the swelling and itching will recede in a matter of a few hours with a minor reaction and home treatment.The more severe the reaction, the longer the symptoms will last. Observe for the following symptoms, which can appear a few minutes or after an hour of the sting and indicate a severe reaction to the sting. Seek assistance if you experience any of them.


Abdominal pain
Anxiety
Trouble breathing and wheezing
Chest discomfort or tightness
Coughing
Diarrhea
Dizziness
Hives and itchy skin
Palpitations
Slurred speech
Swelling of the face, tongue or eyes
Unconsciousness
Note that there have also been reports of unusual reactions to bee and wasp stings which include persistent symptoms lasting months, serum sickness, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and secondary Parkinsonism (symptoms similar to Parkinson’s Disease) after an anaphylactic shock. However, these are rare very responses to the sting of a bee or wasp., Although wasps and bees can be mistaken for each other because both give painful stings, it is important to know and be able to identify the difference between them so you can administer the proper treatment. Bees and wasps are both members of the Hymenoptera (or winged membrane) order of insects, but look different and have different lifestyle habits:Their bodies are different proportions. Bees measure about 2.5 cm long and can have entirely black bodies. Others are black or brown with yellow stripes. Bees are also hairy. Wasps, meanwhile, have more narrow waists and smooth, shiny skin. Bees also have two wings, whereas wasps have four wings.
Bee colonies are much larger with populations over 75,000 while wasps live in colonies of fewer than 10,000. Wasps hibernate through the winter months but bees do not hibernate, although they stay in the hive in the cold winter months. Wasps cannot produce honey but all species of bees can. Bees feed on pollen and plant products while wasps will eat pollen but also other insects.
Honey bees can sting only once. Their stinger is barbed and stays in your body, causing it to be torn from the bee’s body and left in your skin. Honey bees die after attacking. A single wasp or bumble bee can, however, sting multiple times.

, Bee stings and wasp stings look very similar for the most part. Unless you see the insect sting you, it may not be apparent which one it was, so knowing what to look for in the sting can be helpful.You will experience instant and sharp burning pain at the site of the sting.
A red welt will appear within minutes.
A small white spot will be in the center of the welt where you were stung.
The area may swell slightly around the sting.
Look for a stinger in the center of the red area to determine if was a honeybee which stung you.
Cater your treatment based on the sting and your body's reaction to it.

, Bees are usually docile and will attack only when provoked, while wasps are more naturally aggressive predators. In general, you should stay calm around bees and wasps. Walk away slowly from the area. Swatting at bees and wasps can cause them to sting. Preventing wasps and bumblebees from invading your outdoor space is the best way to prevent being stung.Wasps and bumblebees are attracted to sweet drinks, food, and garbage. Take your picnic food out only when you are ready to eat and put it away quickly when finished to avoid attracting these insects. Examine the inside of all drinks and food before eating or drinking to prevent being stung in the mouth.
Use a tight lid on the garbage to prevent the insects from gathering inside the garbage and swarming you when you open the lid.
Never work in the yard wearing yellow or white colors or floral prints as these attract the insects. Try wearing the color red because bees and wasps cannot see the color red. Do not wear loose clothing in which bees and wasps can get trapped.
Minimize any attractive scents, such as perfume, colognes, scented soaps, hair spray and other fragrances.
Do not walk barefoot. Wasps and bees are commonly found on the ground.
Do not leave outside lights on longer than necessary at night. The light attracts insects and the predators that eat them — like wasps.
Do not squash a wasp. The body of the wasp will release a chemical alarm that signals other wasps in the area to attack. Similarly, when a bee stings it releases a chemical that attracts other bees to the area.

Check the bites for breeding fleas.,
Visit your doctor.,
Treat bites with an antihistamine cream.",How to Treat Sand Flea Bites2," In most instances sand flea bites will consist of a small red spot, similar to a mosquito bite. In some cases, however, a female flea will burrow into the skin to hatch eggs. These can cause severe irritation and infection. The bite will look like a swollen area with a small black spot in the center.If you think you have a burrowing sand flea, you should visit the doctor to have the flea removed.

, After applying hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion the symptoms should decrease. If this does not happen or if the symptoms worsen, then you should visit your doctor immediately.

Avoid the beach at dawn and dusk.,
Try insect repellent.,
Cover your legs, feet, and ankles.",How to Treat Sand Flea Bites3," Sand fleas are most prominent in the early mornings and evenings when the temperature is slightly cooler. To prevent sand flea bites, head to the beach in the middle of the day. You may still get a few bites, but there will not be as many fleas out during this time.You should also avoid the beach when it is raining. Sand fleas are most active in cool and moist temperatures.

Don’t pop it unless it really bothers you.,
Disinfect the blister if you have to pop it.,
Drain the blister.,
Clean and bandage the blister.,
Put on a new BandAid each day.,
Put a cold pack on a blood blister.,
Go to the doctor if your blister may be more serious.,
Wear gloves when working with your hands.,
Apply a donut dressing to an area that is starting to form a blister.,
Build up slowly.",How to Treat Raw Blisters on the Palm of Your Hand," Popping the blister makes a hole in your skin. This makes it more vulnerable to infections because it is easier for bacteria and dirt to get inside. It also exposes the more tender, underlying skin to use before it is ready, which can be very painful. Instead, you can:Wash the area gently with soap and warm water. It is important to clean the blister in case it breaks open. This will reduce the amount of dirt and bacteria on your skin nearby which could infect it.
Cover the blister with a BandAid. This will reduce the pain by protecting it from contact as you use your hand.;
, It is important that the skin around the blister be clean and disinfected before you puncture the blister. This will reduce the likelihood of it getting infected. You can:Wash the blister with warm water and soap. Don’t scrub because you don’t want to irritate it. But run it under water and wash it gently to make sure that any dirt, bacteria, or sweat is removed.
Dab iodine, hydrogen peroxide, or rubbing alcohol on the area to kill any remaining bacteria. Use a clean cotton ball and gently wipe the blister and a small area around the blister itself.

, The goal of draining the blister is to get the fluid out without introducing bacteria or leaving an open wound. You can do this with a sterilized sewing needle.Wash a needle with soap and water. Then wipe the needle with rubbing alcohol to kill any bacteria that may be on it. You can do this by putting alcohol on a cotton swab and rubbing it on the needle. The alcohol will quickly evaporate in the air.
Slowly and carefully use the needle to make a tiny hole in the edge of the blister. Make the hole in the layer of skin that is on top of the fluid. The fluid will flow out of the hole.
Do not remove the layer of skin that was on top of the bubble. Leave it so that it covers and protects the irritated skin beneath it.

, After it has been drained the blister is an open wound through which bacteria and dirt can get into your body. You can minimize the chances of this happening by:Washing the fluid from the blister off your hand. Run your hand under warm water and wash gently with soap.
Gently smearing Vaseline or an antibiotic ointment on the drained blister. They are available at your local pharmacy. You can purchase it without a prescription.
Applying a clean BandAid over the blister. Be careful that the adhesive areas of the BandAid do not stick to the flap of skin that was on top of the blister. You don’t want to rip the skin off when you remove the BandAid.
Look for for the kind of BandAids that have a square of gauze with adhesive on all four sides, rather than the kind that are strips with adhesive on only two sides. This will better protect your wound, as all four sides of the bandage will be sealed.

, Gently remove the old BandAid, reapply the ointment, and cover the blister with a new bandage. After a few days the skin underneath will be healed and you can gently remove the flap of dead skin covering the wound. You can carefully cut it away with a scissors sterilized in rubbing alcohol. Each time you change the Band Aid, you should also check for signs of infection. Go to the doctor if you have the following signs of infection:Increasing redness, swelling, warmth or pain over time
Pus seeping from the wound. This does not include fluid that came out of the blister when you popped it.

, If your blister is filled with blood and painful, don’t pop it. It should be allowed to heal naturally to prevent an infection. You can reduce the discomfort by applying ice:Wrap an ice pack in a thin towel and apply it to the blister for about 20 minutes.
If you do not have an ice pack handy, you can wrap a bag of frozen peas or corn in a towel and use that.

, Blisters are occasionally caused by allergic reactions or infections. If you think your blister may be a result of any of the following, go to the doctor to get it checked:A burn, including a sunburn
An allergic reaction to medication
Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema
An infection such as chickenpox, shingles, herpes, impetigo

, Gloves will reduce the amount of friction on your hands when you do house and yard work such as:Raking leaves
Shoveling snow
Gardening
Moving furniture or other heavy lifting

, This is a great way to take the pressure off an area that is getting irritated from friction. For extra protection, you can also wear gloves.Use moleskin or another form of soft padding. You can purchase it at your local drugstore.
Fold the moleskin or padding in half.
Cut a half circle out along the fold. The cut should be the diameter of the area you want to protect.
Unfold the moleskin. You will have a small round hole in the center that is the size of the area that is forming a blister.
Fix the moleskin to your hand with the sensitive area exposed through the hole. The padding around it will take the pressure off and prevent a blister from forming.

, If you are engaged in a sport that causes your hands to be exposed to severe friction, consider increasing the amount you do slowly. This will give your hands time to form calluses. These are tough areas of skin which protect the softer skin underneath. If you feel a blister forming, stop and give your hands time to rest. When your skin is no longer sore, you can start up again. Sports where you may be particularly prone to blisters include:


Rowing
Gymnastics
Weight lifting
Horseback riding
Climbing

Eliminate the cause of the burn.End contact with whatever heat source caused the burn as quickly and carefully as possible.,
Remove clothes and jewelry.If you burn is covered by or located near rings, bracelets, and other jewelry, remove them to prevent constriction when the area swells.,
Rinse your burn.,
Clean your burn if the skin has been broken.Before cleaning your burn, wash your hands with soap and water.,
Bandage your burn.,
Identify the burn as second-degree.,
Determine if the burn is major or minor.,
Determine the depth of the burn.,
Decide what treatment is appropriate.,
Protect your burned skin.,
Minimize your pain.Ibuprofen or acetaminophen are over-the-counter medications that can help relieve pain and swelling.Do not give aspirin to children younger than 12 years old.,
Get a tetanus shot if necessary.Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a bacterial infection commonly associated with burns and can lead to painful muscular contractions in the jaw and neck.,
Monitor your recovery.",How to Treat Second Degree Burns Caused by Heat," Remain calm after suffering a burn. If treating someone else, say soothing, comforting things like, “It’s not that bad,” or “You’ll be all right.”


If you were burned by flame, move away from the source of the flame and practice the stop, drop, and roll method to put the fire out.This method requires laying on the ground, folding your arms to your chest in an ‘X’ and rolling rapidly from side to side.
Wrapping yourself in a thick coat or blanket will also help you extinguish the flames.
You could also pour a large bucket of water over yourself to put out the fire.
If you were burned by contact with hot metal, plastic, or coal, remove the heated object as soon as possible without touching it.;
, Clothing, including belts, should likewise be removed (especially in cases of major burns) so that the burned area can be seen and evaluated, as well as to minimize constrictive swelling.


Be gentle when removing jewelry and clothes.
Do not remove burned clothing if it is stuck to the skin., For minor burns, fill a sink or tub with cool (but not cold) water and keep the burned area of your skin in the water for at least five minutes, or until the burn is no longer very painful. If a sink is not available, run cool water over the burn for at least five minutes, or until the burn is no longer very painful.


Depending on the burn, it might take as long as 15 to 20 minutes for the pain to subside.Do not use ice on a burn.
Do not immerse large, major burns in cold water. This could cause hypothermia or shock.

, Run a mild soap and cool water over the burned area. Be very gentle and pat the burn dry with gauze or a clean cloth. Apply a thin layer of triple antibiotic ointment over the burn.


Do not pop or scrape away blisters.

, During the first 24 – 48 hours, wrap the burn loosely in an absorptive dressing like gauze. After this early period, the burn will exude less pus and you should switch the dressing to a nonadhesive type that is water and air-tight. Polyurethane film or hydrocolloid dressings are good choices at this stage.Change your dressings once every 48 hours.
If the site of the burn weeps some fluid, don’t worry. This is normal; however, if your burn exudes green, white, or yellowish liquid, or becomes increasingly swollen or red, it has become infected and you should consult a doctor., Second-degree burns are more serious than first-degree burns but less serious than third-degree burns. Second-degree burns are characterized by swelling, pain, and blisters. They may produce white or splotchy skin.Comparing second-degree burns to third and first degree burns can help treat them appropriately.
First-degree burns cause redness, pain, and swelling.Second-degree burns extend more deeply into the skin than first-degree burns. They result in blisters that reveal pink, moist, and painful flesh when removed.If your second-degree burn is deep, it will probably be dry, not moist, and not terribly painful. If it is deep and dry, you might not be able to determine whether it’s a third-degree or second-degree burn.
Third-degree burns will often cause no pain at all the nerves have been damaged. They involve all layers of the skin, including body fat. The burned skin might appear black or white, and will be dry, possibly with a leathery appearance.Bone and muscle might be burned as well. Victims of third-degree burns might have difficulty breathing or go into shock.

, Second-degree burns are minor if they are less than three inches wide. They are major if they are larger than three inches, or are located on the hands, feet, face, groin, major joints, or butt.If you have burns on your face, feet, genitals, or hands, consult a medical professional immediately.
If you’re unsure of the severity of your burn, err on the side of caution and treat it as a major burn.

, Second-degree burns are classified as either partial or full thickness and must be treated differently. Partial thickness (or superficial) burns are often wet in appearance, can be extremely painful, and involve damage to the upper layers of the dermis. Full thickness burns appear dry and are usually less painful, as they involve most of the dermis and may cause nerve damage. Partial thickness second-degree burns can usually be treated successfully at home. A full thickness burn, however, will most likely need excision and skin grafting to heal and should be seen by a doctor immediately., Most second-degree burns can be taken care of at home; however, minor burns can only be treated if the skin is unbroken. All major burns must be referred to a physician. Furthermore, even if a burn appears minor, it might require serious care if it is particularly deep or in a sensitive location like the hands, face, feet, or genitals.If you have any doubts about the extent and severity of your burn, consult your doctor for advice and treatment.

, Avoid placing pressure on the burn, and do not scrape the affected skin.If the burn is on your arm, for instance, try to use your opposite arm and wear short-sleeved shirts. If the burn is major, raise the burned area above the level of your heart. This may require laying down and, for instance, propping a burned leg up with pillows.

,
Apply lotion to the burn. Aloe vera lotion or gel can provide pain relief and reduce swelling., Even minor burn injuries require a tetanus shot if you have not had one in the past ten years.

, If you still have pain with a minor burn after 48 hours, contact your doctor.If the burn has not healed within three weeks, you should also consult a medical professional.

Wash the area of the flea bite with warm soapy water.,
Try calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream.,
Ask your doctor or pharmacist about antihistamines for severe itching.,
Avoid scratching in and around the affected area.",How to Treat Flea Bites1," Apply an antiseptic and an ice pack  to reduce the swelling.


If you don't have an icepack, just wrap some ice in an elastic bandage or place it in a plastic bag. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables.
Put the ice on for 10 minutes, then remove it for 10 minutes. Repeat this cycle twice over the course of an hour.. Make sure that the water is not too hot as this can actually aggravate the inflamed areas on your skin. ;
, Either of these ointments, which you can get at your local drugstore, may ease the itching of your flea bite.


Hydrocortisone is a mild steroid cream, while calamine lotion uses ferric oxide to treat mild itchiness. Both are available over-the-counter (OTC) and are safe to use in quantities directed by the manufacturer.

, Sometimes, flea bites itch so severely that you need to take an oral antihistamine. Your doctor or pharmacist can provide suggestions for OTC or prescription solutions. Some antihistamines that you might consider include:


Diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine is OTC and provides quick relief for most itching, but often makes users drowsy. Look for the non-drowsy version.
Tripelennamin hydrochloride is another OTC drug, and similar to Diphenhydramine. Tripelennamin hydrochloride is taken orally.
Hydroxyzine is prescription only. If your itching becomes severe and you need relief that OTC antihistamines can't give you, ask your doctor about Hydroxyzine, which works by reducing the natural histamines in the body.

, It can damage the skin and allow infection to occur. Use an over the counter itch relief product like Calamine lotion or one containing hydrocortisone to relieve the itching instead."

Eat a lot of garlic.,
Make a citrus spray.,
Use essential oils to dissuade fleas from biting you.,
Check out some other ways to fight fleas.",How to Treat Flea Bites3," For some reason, fleas don't relish the taste of garlic. So prepare a your favorite Italian dish, or make Moules Marinieres, and sop up all that garlicky goodness with some garlic bread. Don't give any garlic to your dogs, however, as garlic is toxic to them.

, Fleas dislike citrus smells. Slice a lemon into thin pieces, add it to some water and heat to a boiling point. Let it sit overnight and, in the morning, spray it onto areas where you suspect fleas hang out (the ankles and the arms especially). This should help prevent future flea bites and make you smell nice in the bargain!

, Several essential oils help ward off fleas because of their strong smell. Use this to your advantage. Create tinctures or mix the essential oil directly onto your skin for relief from fleas.


Use eucalyptus oil on problem areas. Eucalyptus oil is another offensive smell for fleas. Take a little bit of eucalyptus oil, mix it into a spray bottle with some water, and spray onto ankles and arms.
Use lavender oil on problem areas. Lavender oil, like eucalyptus oil, is offensive to fleas. Apply as you might eucalyptus oil.
Use cedarwood oil on problem areas. Alternately, sprinkle a few cedar chips in your pillow, at the base of your bed, etc. to discourage the fleas from living in the area.

Know when to call emergency services and seek immediate help.,
Get out of the water as calmly as possible.,
Douse the tentacles liberally with vinegar for at least 30 seconds.,
Stay extremely still while you remove the tentacles.,
Throw away any materials that came in contact with the jellyfish nematocysts.,
Once the tentacles have been removed, relieve pain with painkillers or by immersing the stung area in hot water (not scalding!).,
Don't try to treat jellyfish stings with urine.,
Avoid applying fresh water to the sting.,
Don't use meat tenderizer to deactivate stingers.,

Wait a full day for the pain to subside and several days for the irritation to go away.",How to Treat Jellyfish Stings," Most jellyfish stings do not require medical intervention. However, if you or someone else finds themselves in the following situations, seek immediate medical help:


The sting itself covers more than half your arm, half your leg, a large part of your torso, or your face or genitals.The sting causes a severe allergic reaction, including but not limited to difficulty breathing, dizziness or light-headedness, nausea, or palpitations.The sting came from a box jellyfish. Box jellies have extremely potent venom. They are found off the coast of Australia, and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, as well as Hawaii.They are pale blue in color and have a cube-shaped head, or ""medusa."" They can grow approximately 6 feet (2 meters) tall.;
, To head off the possibility of being repeatedly stung and to begin treatment, seek land as soon as you are stung.


As you get out of the water, try not to scratch the sting-site or touch it with your hands. There are likely still tentacles attached to your skin, and itching or touching them will only get you stung more.

, Vinegar has been shown to inactivate the stinging cells from a diversity of species, and will make it so that no further harm comes from the tentacles , and it is recommended by health authorities. , If you are experiencing shock, make sure that someone has called emergency services and try to calm yourself as much as possible. The more you move around while you attempt to remove jellyfish tentacles, the more venom will be released.


Tweezers, a knife, or a pair of clean sticks may be helpful in removing the venom-filled tentacles. Do not attempt to rub or scrape the tentacles, as this will cause more stinging cells to fire.

, Drive down to 0% the likelihood that you'll accidentally sting yourself again.

, Studies have shown that heat inactivates the venom toxins, relieving pain better than ice If you are experiencing extreme pain, take a recommended dose of a painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.

, The idea that urine was a good treatment for jellyfish stings probably originated as an old wives' tale, and then entrenched itself even further after a Friends episode used it for comedic effect.There's no need to pee on your jellyfish sting!

, Most jellyfish stings occur in saltwater. That means that the nematocysts have large concentrations of saltwater in their venom cells. Any change to the solution of saltwater in the nematocysts will cause the venom cells to fire. Fresh water does just this. Stick with saltwater instead., There isn't any research indicating that it actually works, and it may cause more harm than good., Like adding a freshwater solution to the skin, alcohol may actually cause the nematocysts to discharge even more venom, leading to a more painful experience., After you've removed the tentacles and relieved most of the lingering pain, clean the affected area with warm water. (It doesn't need to be saltwater, as the nematocysts — which react with the fresh water — should have already been removed.) If the skin is still visibly irritated or raw, lightly cover the area with a bandage and wrap with gauze.


Three times a day, clean the area with warm water and apply an antibiotic ointment like Neosporin. Then wrap the area with a bandage and gauze., Soothe any remaining skin irritations with over-the-counter antihistamine pills, or with topical creams containing diphenhydramine or calamine.

, 5 - 10 minutes after treatment, the pain should begin to lessen. After a full day, the pain should be almost completely gone. If you continue to experience pain past a full day and haven't done so already, see a doctor or specialist for professional treatment.


In rare cases, stings from jellyfish can cause either infection or scarring, but most people avoid these scenarios entirely, even after especially painful stings.
In extremely rare cases, people experience hypersensitivity to the venom a week or several weeks after being stung.Blisters or other skin irritations may surface seemingly out of the blue. While this hypersensitivity is generally not dangerous, it may be helpful to see a doctor or dermatologist for assistance.

Put them in hallways, bedrooms, the kitchen, living room, and near the furnace. Test the fire alarms monthly and change batteries at least once per year., To prevent the occurrence of a fire, you should never smoke indoors. Either smoke outside or, better yet, not at all., Hot water scalding is one of the most common causes of burns among children. Set the water heater below 120°F (49°C) to keep the water temperature safe., If you have children around, watch the stove carefully when in use. Otherwise, keep children away from the kitchen and watch them carefully to make sure they do not make their way to the stove.Always keep pot handles facing toward the back of the stove so that it will be harder for children to reach them., Matches and lighters should be someplace where they will not be found. Otherwise, they should be inaccessible. Consider putting them somewhere too high for children to reach or in a locked compartment. Lock up flammable liquids, preferably outside of the home, and far from any heat sources.Keep any chemicals locked up or out of the reach of children.

, Put child-safety covers on electric outlets and throw out appliances with frayed cords. Avoid plugging too many appliances into an extension cord."

Use power strips with circuit breakers instead of extension cords if the appliance is permanently plugged into a socket.",How to Maintain Workplace Safety1," Post the plan and map for employees to read. Do occasional fire drills with all employees.;
, Flammable trash includes cooking grease or other oils, paper, wood and any other items that burn easily.

, Flammable materials add to a building's fire load -- the combustible parts of a building.

, Clearing the area below ceilings also allows an automatic sprinkling system to douse flames.

, Check the light bulbs in the Exit signs to make sure they work. Test the emergency lighting system regularly.


Instruct employees and customers not to block emergency access to the building by parking in the fire lane.

, Repair or replace damaged cords. Compromised electrical cords are a common cause of fires in the workplace.


Label all circuits in the circuit box or electrical panel. Employees will be able to shut off power in targeted parts of the building if a fire starts.

, Follow county or city codes on fire extinguisher maintenance and have extinguishers tested and certified according to the laws in your area. Keep fire extinguishers clear of obstructions.


Notify employees of the location of all fire extinguishers. Train employees how to use extinguishers.

, In a temporary situation, an extension cord may be used.

You can download the the game and play it offline.A number of other interactive tools are available at https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/oshasoft/index.html. These tools include videos and graphic menus, and are organized based on the type of hazard they cover.
You also can use OSHA's Compliance Assistance Quick Start, a training module that covers key regulations in the construction industry, the health care industry, and general industry.OSHA also has industry-specific resources available at https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/compliance_assistance/industry.html.
Search for the most common violations in your industry and how to meet frequently cited OSHA standards at https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/citedstandard.html.
For example, lack of fall protection and faulty scaffolding, such as holes in scaffolding platforms, are two common OSHA violations in the construction industry. These requirements apply to both commercial and residential construction.;
, After you understand a little more about the regulations that apply to your business, you should get out on the floor and observe when and where safety hazards occur and how they can be eliminated.


You can use OSHA's web pages on safety and health topics to figure out how to control or eliminate any hazards you've identified.If you have a construction business, keep in mind that your work site will be constantly changing, so you and your employees will have to be vigilant about the introduction of new hazards.
Inspect your scaffolding regularly for platform holes, and make sure your workers have an adequate point of access onto the scaffold. Cross-braces or stacked blocks are not considered adequate access under OSHA guidelines., You can have an OSHA inspector come to your workplace and work with your employees to identify potential hazards and evaluate your compliance with OSHA safety policies.OSHA's consultation program is a service to small businesses, and offered free of charge. The program is completely separate from enforcement inspections, so you don't have to worry about an inspector who shows up for a consultation citing you for a violation.
The consultation is confidential, and even if hazards or potential violations are found, it won't trigger an enforcement inspection.
Using the consultation program may qualify you for a one-year exemption from OSHA enforcement inspections.
You can find the consultation project nearest you and schedule a consultation by searching OSHA's consultation directory at https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/smallbusiness/consult_directory.html.

, Having annual self-inspections or audits can help you minimize risks and pinpoint areas where there is room for improvement.


Depending on the nature and location of your business, you may want to have an additional inspection in winter to prepare for winter weather.You can find checklists online for your industry and use them to determine whether your workplace is compliant with OSHA standards.During your inspection, enforce disciplinary policies as necessary for employees or managers who are violating federal safety policies.For example, OSHA requires all construction workers working at heights over six feet to wear fall protection. This can be easy to forget, especially if workers are going up and down all day. It also is one of the easiest things for OSHA inspectors to notice if it's missing.
You also can use outside resources, such as your workers' compensation or general liability insurance carrier, to conduct periodic workplace safety inspections.

, You are required by law to display the OSHA workplace safety poster in an area where it is visible to all employees.You can order a copy of the poster free of charge from OSHA, or you can download it at https://www.osha.gov/Publications/poster.html and print it yourself.
The poster is available in English and nine other languages, including Spanish and Arabic.
OSHA puts out new posters periodically; however, you don't have to replace an old one if you don't want to. New posters are redesigns but include the same information.

, If employees are trained how to follow federal safety policies in the workplace from the beginning, they won't fall into bad habits.Require safety training and provide written tests for each employee to demonstrate your commitment to following federal safety policies and teaching employees about OSHA requirements.
Keep in mind that OSHA doesn't allow a ""grace period"" for new employees, so your orientation must be sufficient that all employees understand how to correctly follow federal safety policies from the first moment they set foot on the work site.

, Continued training will alert employees to standards they may have been overlooking and remind them of regulations they may have forgotten.Depending on your industry, you may want to have training sessions more frequently. For example, if you are in the construction industry, weekly training sessions may be necessary as your worksite changes frequently, exposing employees to new or different hazards as your projects progress.
Keep in mind that hazard communication is one of the most frequently cited OSHA standard violations.Make sure your employees understand all potential hazards in your workplace, how to deal with them, and what safety precautions are required to minimize risk.
Maintain documentation of the dates and topics of these training sessions, and have employees who participate sign attendance sheets.
OSHA offers training courses and seminars through its Training Institute Education Centers. Some courses are as short as a few hours, while others run several days. These courses are open to the public and vary in price.You can also find webcasts and training videos for free on OSHA's website.
If you have non-English-speaking employees, make sure you have training materials and provide sessions in their language, or use a translator.

, Everyone who works for you should have immediate access to safety rules and regulations that apply to your workplace.Your safety manuals should include specific information about typical hazards your employees will encounter on a daily basis in the workplace, and more general information about hazards or issues that may come up less frequently.
Your safety rules should be the same as the OSHA regulations, or stricter.
Require your employees to sign and date an acknowledgement that they have received and read the safety manual and understand the safety regulations they must follow. Keep these acknowledgement forms in a separate OSHA file.
If your work involves use of hazardous chemicals, make sure you have written and up-to-date safety data sheets for every chemical used in your operation. OSHA has standardized formats for these sheets., Regardless of the size of your business, you must send a report to OSHA if an employee is seriously injured or dies at your workplace.OSHA requires a report of any work-related fatality within 8 hours of the incident.
If an employee has a work-related injury that results in an inpatient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye, this injury must be reported within 24 hours of the incident.
You can report incidents by calling or visiting your nearest OSHA Area Office, by calling 1-800-321-OSHA, or by using the reporting application on OSHA's website at www.osha.gov., If you have 11 or more employees, you must create a written report of any workplace injury, illness, or exposure to toxic materials.Some low-hazard industries are exempt from this record-keeping requirement. Check the appendix to the recording and reporting regulation at https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=12791 to see if your business is exempt.
You can download the required forms at https://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/RKforms.html. OSHA has forms available in fillable format so you can enter the information on the computer, or print and fill them out by hand.
The forms require Microsoft Excel or an equivalent program that can read Excel documents. If you don't have a spreadsheet application, you can download the free Excel viewer, which will enable you to view the form and print it out.You must fill out the form within seven days of learning that the injury or illness occurred. The forms must be kept in your records for five years., A paper trail of continuing inspections demonstrates your efforts at compliance.In the event an enforcement inspection uncovers a violation, proof of regular self-inspections can help you demonstrate a commitment to following safety policies.

, Enforcing disciplinary sanctions for violation of safety policies can provide you with a defense to an OSHA violation.Documentation of employee discipline for safety violations should be kept separately from personnel files. Designate a file specifically for OSHA violations.
These records prove that you have communicated your safety rules to employees, and enforced those rules effectively and consistently when you discovered a violation.

"
Understand the priority.,
Identify potential hazards in the workplace.,
Decide when and where employees and visitors will be in danger in the even of a fire.,
Identify the hazards.,
Risk evaluate the hazards.,
Record your risk evaluation.,
Put your fire safety plan in place.,
Review your plans regularly.",How to Practice Fire Safety at Your Workplace," If there is a fire the main concern is that everyone can reach a safe place quickly. Putting the fire out is the second priority because of the spread of fire, heat and smoke caused by it which can trap. By law your workplace must have suitable means of detecting, giving warning and escape. During a fire you want to get out as quickly as possible because the fire can trap or overcome you by the heat and the smoke before you get a chance to evacuate.;
, Potential hazards include sources of ignition, sources of fuel and work practises. Give attention to any areas, particularly unattended ones where there could be a delay in detecting the outbreak of fire and any areas where the warnings may go unnoticed by people who may not be able to react quickly.

, Key points to consider:


Is the length of time it will take to evacuate all people to a place of safety adequate?
Are there enough exits and are they all in the right place?
Are the exits suitable for all people, wheelchair users for example?
Are all escape routes easily identifiable, accessible and adequately illuminated
If the fire detection and warning system is electrically powered, does it need a back up supply?
Have you trained your staff in using the means of escape?
Do you have a meeting point once you have evacuated to account for all members of staff?

, Decide whether the existing precautions are enough or whether more should be done. Arising dangers and ideas to evaluate include:


Ignition control of sources and fuel.
Fire detection and warnings.
Escape plans and routes.
Fire equipment for fighting fire
Maintenance and testing of fire precautions.
Fire safety knowledge of employees.
Carry out improvements that needed.

, Try to eliminate the danger, but if that is not practical do your best to reduce the risk.


Reducing sources of ignition:

Remove unnecessary sources of heat in the workplace or replacing it with safer alternatives.
Replace naked flame and radiant heaters with fixed convector heaters or a central heating system.
Ensure that sources of heat do not arise from faulty or overloaded electrical or mechanical equipment.
Ensure that all electrical fuses and circuit breakers are the correct rating and suitable for the purpose.
Keep the ducts and flues clean in the building.
Prohibit smoking throughout the complex.
Ensure that all equipment that could provide a source of ignition is left in a safe condition, even when not in use.
Take precautions to reduce the risk of arson.


Minimise the potential fuel for a fire.

Remove flammable materials and substances or reduce them to the minimum required for the operation of the business.


Replace materials and substances with less flammable materials.

Ensure flammable materials are handled, transported, stored and used properly.
Ensure adequate separation distances between flammable materials.
Store highly flammable materials in fire resistant stores and containers.


Reduce the sources of oxygen.

Close doors, windows and other openings not required for ventilation, especially out of working hours.
Block ventilation systems which are not essential to the running of the workplace
Avoid storing oxidising materials near or with any heat source or flammable materials.



, Discuss your findings with employees:


Actions you think are adequate.
Prepare an emergency plan.
Inform, instruct and train employees about fire precautions.

, Talk to your boss, supervisor, or employer. Key points to ensure:


There needs to be an effective means of detecting any outbreak of fire and for warning people quickly enough so that they can escape to a safe place before the fire can make any escape routes unusable.
Ensure that there is suitable fire fighting equipment, e.g. extinguishers, in place for your employees to use in fighting a fire in its earliest stages. The equipment must be suitable to the risks (the correct fire extinguisher for its purpose, for example) and employees should be trained in how to use it. There should also be no doubt as to when it is time to evacuate the building should the fire get out of control.
Ensure there is a fire safety policy for the workplace which promotes good housekeeping and reduces the possibility of a fire occurring. All employees from day one should have an understanding of what is expected of them should a fire break out. Carelessness and neglect are two of the most common reasons cited for outbreaks of fire in the workplaceand no employer or employee should ever be complacent enough to think ""it won't happen to us"".

, Your plan should be revised each year and when the workplace changes. It is imperative to keep the fire safety measures and equipment in the workplace in effective working order and to carry out regular checks and to practice your evacuation procedures routinely.

Be aware of the costs.,
Make it easy to introduce.,
Measure its success.,
Have an escape plan.,
Convey your vision.,
Sell the change.,
Remove any uncertainty.,
Time it right.,
Don't lose your company's identity.,
Seek input.,
Reward employee performance.",How to Introduce Changes in Workplace Procedures," If you're implementing a procedural change to save money over the next few years, it may seem like a clear choice. But if that change will require a costly installation of new equipment, significant re-training of personnel, or hiring new employees to take on new roles, you may need to compare the costs to see if they outweigh the long-term savings and benefits.Talk to an accountant about the relative costs versus longterm savings to determine if your company can afford to implement those changes, or try performing a simple cost-benefit analysis.


A cost-benefit analysis compares the anticipated costs against the anticipated benefits to determine the best, most cost-efficient plan.To conduct a simple cost-benefit analysis, divide a sheet of paper into two columns. List the benefits in one column and the costs in the other column. Compare the two lists to see which course of action is the most beneficial and cost-efficient.;
, Even if the procedural changes you're introducing will radically change the way your business operates, it's important to make those changes easy to introduce and implement. If at all possible, try to implement the new changes in stages or phases. That way your employees will find it easier to adjust and adapt to the new procedures.If possible, implement changes in a way that allows employees to adjust on a step-by-step basis. Try staggering the new procedural changes over several weeks or even months to allow for optimal adaptation., Significant procedural changes should be made for a reason. Once you've determined why you're making those changes, it's important to find a way to measure the relative success of the changes. If the changes are supposed to save costs, then have a cost comparison in place to evaluate how effective the changes have been after several months. If the changes are supposed to improve customer satisfaction, then take surveys and keep an eye on the number of returning customers who are pleased with the changes you've made.Consider using a free or low-cost financial tool to track your company's success before and after implementing the changes. You can find free tools online like inDinero or Corelytics, or subscribe to a more in-depth monthly service from those same providers., Obviously your hope with the new procedural changes is that it will make things better in the workplace. But what do you do if the opposite ends up happening? Any good plan for procedural changes should have a backup plan or, if all else fails, an escape plan to abandon the changes altogether.Decide whether you will default back to the old procedures in the event that the new changes fail, or whether you will implement a backup plan. If choosing a backup plan, have concrete plans in place just in case.
You may want to avoid telling your employees that you have a backup plan or that you may revert back to the old procedures. Telling them these things may make you appear weak or ineffective as a leader, and it may increase employee resistance to the changes if they know that enough vocal opposition will return things back to the way they were.

, If you believe that the procedural changes you're making will improve the company and/or the workplace, communicate this. Let your employees know how you envision the company a year from now, and lay out the strategies (including these procedural changes) that will help get the company where you believe it needs to be.Share your vision with your employees. Be clear and concise in describing what you want for your company.Understand your employees.
Empower your employees by letting them voice their thoughts, concerns, and overall feedback on the changes you're proposing. However, do not lose the organizational structure of your company.
Decide whether it would be best to communicate your vision and announce changes in person or through email. Issues of urgency are best delivered in person, and written/emailed messages can be easily ignored.

, No matter what workplace procedural changes you're trying to implement, it may not be enough to simply tell your employees ""That's just the way it will be from now on."" As a leader, it's your role to lead, and that means getting your employees behind you 100%. Once you've announced the changes, sell them to your employees. Help them see why those changes are good for the company and, ultimately, good for the employees.Let your workers know your (or the company's) motivation for implementing these changes. If the changes will save money, then say so. If they will create a better work environment, then let everyone know. No matter what the motivation is, make it clear that the advantages of these changes will outweigh the costs and implementation problems.Point out why the old way of doing things was improper or ineffective. Having a clear contrast might make it easier for employees to understand why that change was necessary.

, One of the biggest reasons employees resist change is the fear they feel for the unknown. If there is any uncertainty about how the day-to-day business will operate, or about the very specific roles you and your employees will play in these changes, you will need to remove those uncertainties. You can do this by anticipating questions, doubts, and fears that your employees may have and alleviating them before they come up.Be meticulous in your planning of how the business will operate and what (if any) changes will arise in your employees' roles. Let them know that their roles will not change, or if their roles will be affected in any way, then be clear about this from the start.
Try to frame procedural changes in a way that employees will see those changes as an improvement to how they work. If you remove the doubt that surrounds vague procedural announcements and re-frame those changes as a way to create a better work environment or a smoother order of operations, your employees will most likely be more on-board., Some business experts advise that the timing of a procedural announcement may be the biggest factor in getting employees on board.There's no clear-cut rule on when the timing is right, as every situation and workplace is different, but being aware of how the changes affect your employees may help you time the announcement and implementation a bit better.


If the new procedures will require additional training, try to time the implementation of those procedures in a way that gives your employees adequate time to prepare. For example, don't announce new procedures on a Friday if they go into effect on the following Monday. That may require employees to come in over the weekend for training or scramble to figure things out on the day the changes go live.
If at all possible, announce procedural changes a few weeks before they will take place. This will give everyone a chance to read the new procedures, understand how they differ from the old ones, and learn how to make the necessary changes.

, Procedural changes are usually good, but they shouldn't be so radical that your employees no longer recognize the company - at least not overnight. Remember that in addition to comfort in the familiar, many of your employees may be loyal and dedicated to the company for its image/identity or its original mission. It's okay to shift those aspects through a long-term plan, but making radical changes over a short span of time may alienate or alarm your most loyal employees., Your employees' degree of satisfaction will be one of the best gauges of how effective the changes have been. Some employees will, of course, resist change no matter what happens, but other employees may like the overall direction while having reservations about how those changes are actually implemented.An easy way to ensure employee satisfaction and gauge any future changes that may be necessary is to ask employees for feedback on the changes. Let them know that while you may not be open to reversing the changes, you do value employee input and collaboration when it comes to how those changes are implemented.Consider forming a task force or committee to seek feedback on how the changes are being implemented and input on how the changes might be more successfully implemented., One way to help get employees on-board with new procedural changes is to generate short-term goals for your employees and reward those who meet those goals. It may seem like an insignificant move, but it can help build support for the changes and instill a strong desire to implement those changes."

Keep the operator's area clean.,
Look around the area where you are operating the machine, and ask these questions:


Will the ground support the equipment?",How to Check a Forklift for Safe Use," Standard for most, if not all types of forklifts are the following:


Seat belts, operator restraints. Skid steer lifts have a sissy bar that drops around the operator's torso, most others have a common belt type restraint.
Backup alarm or bell. This will alert persons working around your equipment that you are reversing the machine.
Fire extinguisher. Should be ABC rated, 10 pound minimum, with a full charge, and located in an easy location to reach.
Mirrors mounted in a position so that the areas behind the machine can be watched from the operator's seat.
Load lift and angle (all-terrain type only) charts.
Rating stamp on each fork, to assure the forks are original equipment or heavier duty.
Parking brake, highway warning flashers and signs, boom angle indicator, and level tilt indicator if applicable for the use.;
, Failure of any of these can render the forklift inoperable in a precarious position.To do this, you will need to lift the engine cover and move the steering wheel forward.

, This should include lift cylinders, wheel hubs, hydraulic fittings and valve spools.

, Check the lines for any wear and tear. Any exposed reinforcing wire or crushed steel fittings indicate a possibly catastrophic failure of the machine's hydraulic system.

, Damaged links in lift chains can break, allowing loads to fall, worn or out-of-round rollers can bind, throwing rails off their tracks on telescoping lifts.

, Make sure they are properly inflated, and have no rubber damage to their sidewalls or treads. A sudden blow-out can cause a forklift to overturn, injuring or killing by-standers and the operator.

, If you are carrying heavy material and cannot stop, someone will get hurt.

, Debris can make using controls difficult by jamming them or blocking access to them.

Show an existing policy adequate to prevent the violation.,
Prove the rule was communicated to all employees.,
Demonstrate your company has methods in place for discovering violations.,
Provide a record of consistent enforcement of the rule.",How to Defend Against Safety Violation Citations1," Your company must have a safety policy in place that specifically applies to the OSHA standard you were cited for violating.For example, if the safety standard is addressed in your employee handbook, a copy of that handbook would serve as evidence that the policy was in place.
You also should have some evidence that the policy was put in place before the incident occurred that gave rise to the citation – in other words, before the OSHA agent observed the conduct.
Consider creating a safety committee among employees, or hiring a professional safety director to be in charge of ensuring compliance with OSHA safety standards.;
, Typically your workplace safety rules and policies should be included a written manual distributed to all employees.Records of any safety training courses you offered to employees also serve as evidence that all employees were aware of the safety standards, if the standard you were charged with violating was included in the training.Make sure you take attendance or have employees sign in when they complete a training course so you have evidence of who participated.You also can communicate information about rules and safety standards by posting signs in the workplace. For example, if an employee was seen not wearing safety goggles, evidence that the employee had to walk through a door with a sign that said ""goggles must be worn beyond this point"" would support your claim that the violation was an isolated incident of employee misconduct.

, Supervisor rotation schedules and internal inspection checklists can show OSHA the violation would have been discovered in due course.A defense of employee misconduct also may relate to the direct supervisor in charge of observing and reporting violations of safety standards.Because the employee misconduct defense is closely tied to the employer's knowledge of the conduct, you typically also must show that you were unaware the violation was taking place.
Regular equipment checks and employee testing also are methods for discovering safety violations.Consider hiring a third-party safety consultant to train and monitor employees., If there is evidence that exceptions were made or that employees weren't disciplined for violating the rule, you will be unlikely to prevail using an employee misconduct defense.If your employee misconduct defense focuses on the misconduct of a supervisor, any inconsistency in enforcing your rules should be connected to that supervisor in particular. For example, you might have one supervisor who routinely allows employees to work without the safety goggles required by OSHA.
Consistent enforcement plays into your lack of knowledge of the violation, implying that if you'd known about the violation you would have disciplined the employees responsible.
The disciplinary sanctions for violating safety rules and standards should be included in your written policy and followed without exception. Along with discipline for violations, you also might consider an incentive program for employees who consistently follow safety standards.Consistent enforcement also demonstrates that the employee's misconduct occurred without the knowledge or consent of any managers or supervisors.Keep in mind that policies and rules that aren't enforced consistently are no better than having no safety rules at all. Your employees won't take the rules seriously if there are no consequences for violating them."

Pay attention to your mood.,
Remain objective about work.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Set realistic boundaries to maintain your work-life balance.,
Consider professional support.",How to Avoid Emotional Burnout at Work1," Keeping track of your mood from day to day can help you to identify if there is a problem. Try keeping a log of your mood to identify changes. You might notices changes in your mood that are dramatic or subtle. For example, you might notice you are feeling unmotivated one day, or that you feel hopeless. Watch for these types of mood shifts and talk with someone you trust about them.

If your mood shifts begin to interfere with your ability to do your job, or if you feel overwhelmed by your emotions, then see a therapist for help as soon as possible.;
, You might find yourself becoming emotionally involved in situations at work, even if you don’t mean to. You may have a job that requires you to get closely involved in the lives of others. Or, you may work in an emotionally charged environment with volatile co-workers. You can avoid emotional burnout if you take a step back and stay objective rather than allowing your emotions to takeover.


Remind yourself that you have to maintain some emotional and mental space between your professional and personal life. For instance, if you work in social services, you may need to tell yourself, “By doing my job, I’m doing something to help this person. But I can’t take this home with me.”
Try to avoid getting caught up and emotionally involved in workplace drama. For example, if the office ‘hot couple’ just broke up, steer clear of getting worked up as if your own relationship just ended.

, Releasing your emotions by confiding in someone close to you can do a great deal to help you manage feelings that arise because of work. Just having someone listen while you talk through your feelings can help you avoid emotional burnout at work.They can also offer a fresh perspective on frustrating situations and strategies for handling work-related stress.


You might tell your brother, for instance, “Work has been really crazy lately! Can I talk to you about it?”
If you have a career or professional mentor, it would be perfectly appropriate for you to talk to them about your work-related emotions, as well as strategies for avoiding emotional burnout.
Or, for example, if you have a good relationship with your supervisor, you might ask them, “Could we talk about some ways to manage emotions and avoid burnout in this line of work?”

, It is important to maintain healthy boundaries to keep your work life and personal life separate. Try setting some boundaries that are based on what you value and want to preserve in your life. To do this, you will need to examine your values and determine what is most important to you. Then, you will need to make these limits clear to your coworkers and boss.For example, if you value spending your weekends with your friends and/or family, then you might make a rule that you will not work weekends, and let your boss and coworkers know that you are not available on the weekend.

, Sometimes, either because of the nature of your job or because of circumstances, situations come up at work that can be emotionally taxing. For example, you may be an ER nurse who sees serious trauma on a regular basis or you may work at an organization that’s undergoing major restructuring. In these, and cases a counselor, therapist, or similar professional may be able to help you cope and avoid emotional burnout.


Contact your human resources department for information about receiving support and services through your employer. Some professions have dedicated hotlines and other resources set up to help employees.
You can also talk to your regular healthcare provider about receiving professional support. You might say, “I’d like to talk with someone about some of my feelings about my job. Is there anyone you recommend?”
Make sure that you report any inappropriate behavior towards you or other people in your workplace. Being sexually harassed, bullied, cyber-bullied, or pressured by your colleagues can contribute to workplace stress and burnout. Talk to someone about the issue right away.

Acknowledge an understanding of the regulation and its purpose.,
Demonstrate an attempt to comply with the rule.,
Provide documentation of the hardships that would result from compliance.,
Show that you took alternate steps to protect employees.",How to Defend Against Safety Violation Citations2," You cannot claim it was infeasible or impossible for you to comply with the regulation unless you know the regulation and the harm it is supposed to prevent.


You must demonstrate that you have recognized and evaluated the particular hazard associated with the standard you've been cited with violating., Any evidence of efforts your business made to comply with the standard or regulation supports your argument that compliance wasn't feasible.


It isn't enough to try only once – typically you must show that you made multiple attempts to comply with the standard and all were unsuccessful.Attempts to comply also must be ongoing. Generally you must demonstrate to OSHA that your employees' safety is paramount and that you have diligently attempted to comply with the rule and found it impossible to do so and still complete the particular work or project., A hardship typically means that the job cannot be completed otherwise. OSHA does not consider any amount financial hardship to your company to justify non-compliance with safety standards.However, keep in mind that it's not enough simply to say that compliance with the OSHA standard would be expensive, or would require you to change your methods of production., Even if the particular standard proved impossible to implement, it helps your case to show other efforts you made to fulfill the same purpose.Because you essentially must argue that whatever work must be completed cannot be done at all if you complied with OSHA's safety standard, this defense is exceedingly difficult to prove.OSHA agents test standards in many contexts before regulations are issued, and to prove compliance is impossible for your company may require you to distinguish your work from that being done in similar businesses that have managed to comply with the standard.
Additionally, rapid advances in technology require that your search for reasonable alternatives be continual.Spending a few months searching for an alternative and not finding one won't get you off the hook a year later.

"
"
Prove your attempt at compliance.,
Demonstrate the hazard caused by compliance.,
Indicate any alternative measures you took to protect employees.,
Address whether you applied for a variance.",How to Defend Against Safety Violation Citations3," You cannot know that compliance with the standard would create a greater hazard to your employees than violation of the standard unless you've tried to implement it.


Witness testimony, such as statements from supervisors or employees, may be necessary to show an attempt at compliance.
Showing your attempts to comply with the safety standards indicates that you care about your employees' safety. Even if you don't succeed in your defense and are still cited for the violation, this can keep OSHA from regarding your failure to comply as willful – meaning that you acted intentionally with indifference to the requirements or to the safety of your employees., To effectively claim this defense you must be able to show OSHA that if you complied with the standard your employees would be in greater danger as a result.Typically you also must be able to prove that the hazard was caused by adherence to the standard, rather than by an employee's particular habit or work practice that could be corrected.Even if compliance does create a greater hazard than non-compliance, your defense isn't likely to succeed if that hazard can somehow be controlled., If you haven't attempted any alternative measures, you must prove that there are no possible alternative means to protect employees against the same hazard.Much like showing that you attempted to comply with the safety standard, trying other ways to achieve the same result demonstrates that you care about your employees' safety and aren't intentionally ignoring the issue.At the same time, you should exercise caution when using your own methods or judgment in place of the practices required by OSHA. You still may be cited with a violation even if no accidents have occurred in your workplace and the hazard has been avoided., OSHA grants variances in certain situations where employers are unable to comply with specific standards.If you haven't applied for a variance, you must demonstrate that a variance wouldn't be appropriate if you want to succeed with this defense.Applying for a variance allows OSHA to evaluate your alternative method and determine whether it satisfies the same purpose as the agency's safety standard.

Take a break.,
Meditate on a regular basis.,
Use deep breathing.,
Keep a journal.,
Do something active.",How to Avoid Emotional Burnout at Work2," Sometimes the best way to manage stress is to take some time away from what’s stressing you. Taking a time-out gives you the chance to calm yourself, build up your energy, and approach your work with a renewed perspective.This may mean taking a five-minute walk during the day to clear your mind and boost your mood.
It may mean taking advantage of your vacation days or taking a mental health day.

, When you have an emotionally stressful job, this is one way that you can avoid emotional burnout. It’s a great way to clear your mind, release tension, and reduce stress.It’s also something you can do for a few minutes on your break at work or for a longer time at home.


Make yourself as comfortable as possible. If you can, lie or sit somewhere quiet where you won’t be disturbed or interrupted.
Take a few deep breaths and try to clear your mind. Focus on your breathing and relaxing your body.
Pay attention to emotions that you’re feeling. For example, you might think to yourself, “I feel anxious right now and my body is tense.”
If you start thinking about work, gently turn your mind back to your breathing, body, and emotions.

, This is one stress-reduction technique that you can use in the moment and as a long-term stress-management strategy. It’s an effective way to avoid emotional burnout because it can lower your heart rate, release tension in your body, and help you think more clearly.


Inhale through your nose slowly and deeply. Hold the breath in your stomach for a few moments and then let it out slowly through your mouth.
Try different types of deep-breathing techniques. For example, you may want to visualize calming colors or a peaceful scene while you’re breathing.

, If you don’t already journal or don’t include work-related issues when you do, you may want to consider doing so. Journaling is a good way to manage your stress and your emotions related to your job. It gives you a safe space to release and explore your feelings. It’s also a good way to document any situations at work that are causing you concern.


Write about the things that happen at work, how they affect you, and how you feel about it.
Make a list of strategies that have been useful in helping you manage your work-related stress. Add to it and refer to it often.

, Physical activity can help you avoid emotional burnout for a number of reasons. It supports your immune system and overall physical health which will make it easier for you cope with work-related stress. It’s also a good way to release excess energy and tension.You don’t have to try to fit a two-hour workout in every day, but it may benefit you to be active for at least a few minutes each day.


You can try activities like yoga, tai chi, swimming, or hiking if you’d like some time to think through your emotions.
Activities like team sports, martial arts, or weight-lifting are a great way to release tension and energize yourself.
Even standing beside your desk and doing a few stretches can help you manage stress.

Practice mindfulness.,
Look out for anger and irritability.,
Be aware of feeling fatigued.,
Watch out for feeling detached and isolated.,
Pay attention to decreased productivity.",How to Avoid Emotional Burnout at Work3," This is the practice of being fully present in each moment and being aware of your senses, thoughts, and feelings. When you’re mindful, it will be easier for you to recognize the signs of emotional burnout early and take steps to avoid it.


Be fully present by only doing one thing at a time. Avoid multitasking. For example, don’t work while you’re having your lunch. Focus on eating.
Check in with yourself throughout the day to evaluate how you’re feeling and what you’re thinking. You might ask yourself, “How do I feel about this situation? What do I think about it?”

, There are signs that your body may give you that let you know you may be experiencing a lot of stress and may be on the verge of burning out.One of these signs is an increase in irritability. If you notice that you’re getting frustrated or angry easier or more often than normal, you should recognize that it might be emotional burnout.


For example, pay attention to whether you’re snapping at co-workers, family, or friends for no reason.
Or, for instance, notice if you’re cranky during the week, but more relaxed on your off days.

, It’s normal to feel a bit tired after a productive work day. But, one sign of emotional burnout and high stress is feeling extra tired, or tired when you know you’ve had enough rest.Be aware of your energy level and take note if it seems to be dipping for no reason.


For instance, do you feel drowsy in the middle of the day even though you got eight hours of sleep the night before?
Or, for example, do you find yourself feeling like you just don’t have the energy to go to work or completely drained at the end of the day?

, Although some people simply aren’t as social as others, one indicator of emotional burnout is feeling unconnected to the people around you.Pay attention to signs that you’re withdrawing from normal activities or that you’re feeling detached from people you’re usually close to.


For example, take note of thoughts like, “No one understands what it’s like” or “I’m all alone in this.”
Or, for instance, if you feel like you can’t connect with any of your co-workers so you avoid company get-togethers it may be a sign of feeling isolated.

, You have probably experienced a time or two when you aren’t getting as much done as you would like to. Maybe you have other responsibilities or special circumstances that are interrupting your workflow. But, if you notice that you aren’t getting as much done as you used to or need to, it may be a sign that you’re approaching an emotional burnout.For example, if you generally turn in your weekly reports on time, but now find that no matter how long you spend on them, you can’t get them in on time, you may be burning out.

Conduct a survey to find out what types of services and programs your employees would be interested in.,
Determine what type of lifestyle your employees are leading.,
Have a kick-off ""healthy living fair"".,
Have a health or wellness event every week.,
Encourage physical activity outside of the office as well.,
Set up a program to assist employees suffering from problems of abuse or addiction depending on the policies in your workplace.,
Offer healthy incentives.,
Follow up.",How to Start an Employee Wellness Program," It is often helpful to form a committee of employees to conduct a survey. Form a committee of representatives from all organizational levels, areas, and other groups, so you can have a range of opinions represented. In this committee, think about including people from your organization or corporation that have responsibility for some aspect of employee health or well-being, such as human resources, employee benefits, occupational health and safety, the employee cafeteria, and employee unions.


This committee should meet regularly to ensure the program's success. They should write a mission statement based on the results of the survey.





;
, How many employees take smoke breaks throughout the day? If you have a vending machine, how often does it need to be refilled? Do your employees exercise regularly? Do they eat 3 balanced meals a day? Do they go to the doctor regularly for checkups? Looking at questions like that will provide you with a better sense of the types of programs from which your employees would benefit.

, Offer employees free flu shot, blood pressure checks, cholesterol screenings, BMI assessments, smoking cessation programs. Work with your local hospital to coordinate these events.

, One idea is to use Monday as the day for all things health and prevention. This will start the week out on a good note and employees will appreciate the opportunity to improve their health on their company’s dime! Employers could organize Monday walks, free fruit on Mondays, or Monday health screenings., If employees want to enter a local run or walk for a charity race, run a marathon, or take a fitness class, sponsor them!

, While some companies may choose a zero-tolerance policy for drugs, other companies may choose to offer on-site counselors to encourage employees to quit smoking, drinking, or using drugs. Using work site health promotion to help as many employees overcome their addictions will benefit the entire company.

, If any employee achieves a health goal, reward them with an item that is useful and further promotes their health such as:


pedometer
microwave vegetable steamer
good athletic socks
orange peeler
dyna bands
stress balls

, Find out what's working, what isn't. Are employees losing interest? Continue taking surveys and adjusting your program so that it remains effective.

Try to create a comfortable environment.,
Keep feedback anonymous.,
Pick a medium that works well for your particular company.,
Consider using employee surveys.,
Check in with employees over lunch or coffee.,
Have routine conversations with trusted and candid people.,
Consider employing several different mediums to get feedback.,
Request examples when receiving feedback.",How to Get Honest Feedback from Your Employees1," As an employer, one of your primary jobs is to create a comfortable environment for your employees. When you do that, you set the stage to break through their fear of giving honest feedback. An authoritative or autocratic manager will most likely get more falsified feedback. When making your workplace friendly, consider:


Are there any pressure topics that may be making your employees nervous? Maybe you fired an employee for disagreeing with you on one too many topics. To rectify this, make sure you make clear why that employee was fired; perhaps you and he did not agree on certain office policies.
Is there any favouritism in your office? You may not even realize its happening, but other employees might. Try to keep everyone in the loop, and seek advice from everyone, rather than a select few.;
, Start taking feedback by keeping it anonymous. Employees may be hesitant to open up because they are aware they might have to face negative consequences if their name is attached to a negative comment. As an employer, you can assign a coach or specific employee to gather feedback anonymously.


If you keep criticism anonymous, you give employees opportunity to openly speak up without the fear of getting fired. This will help you to easily find problematic areas of business, which must be dealt with at the earliest possible time.

, When you offer your employees an appropriate platform or system to initiate unprompted criticism, you are more likely to get frequent and direct feedback.

, You can employ independent, yet confidential surveys that offer employees a space for written comments. Some comments may be off base, but when you read between the lines, you might find that you are able to understand many factors pertaining to behavior, communication or work arrangements that require attention.


A group of trusted people, such as people specifically hired for this purpose, can also conduct the surveys, which may include interviews to explore problematic areas. Such surveys might be helpful to an extent, but they cannot deliver the same breadth of honest opinion that you should be able to obtain through an independent survey.

, Informal occasions can offer a great opportunity to ask employees about how they feel the company is doing. Ask them about improvements that think could be made.


As you are not directly reviewing anyone’s performance during these small time-slots, employees may feel better about speaking their mind. “Tell me more” is a very powerful phrase you can use to deeply listen and learn more from your employees.

, Like every business, yours also has informal leaders that take the initiative. Other employees will be more likely to express their thoughts on the company with the person.


You should identify these people because they are the ones to whom employees go for advice or to vent frustrations. Tell them openly that your objective is to bring to surface the hidden employee concerns, not to affect anyone’s career.

, Using all of the mediums listed above could give you a more rounded view of what the people at your office think about the policies and how the office is managed.


Relying on only one source of feedback will never uncover the entire picture for you, therefore, avoid it at your best

, If an employee says that meetings tend to run long, it is helpful to have an example of a time when this occurred so that you can know the specific duration of time the employee is referring to. Encourage your employees to give solid examples on their surveys.


Encourage your employees to be as specific as possible.

"
"
Accept feedback without judgment.,
Do not become defensive.,
Implement some changes right away.,
Encourage continuous feedback.,
Keep implementing actionable items.",How to Get Honest Feedback from Your Employees2," Remind your employees that you will receive this feedback without judgement, and that you genuinely want to make the workplace better. Thank all employees when feedback is given, to show that you really do appreciate it.


Once you have received feedback, take a night to consider the feedback and to come up with how you will work to change the negative aspects of the work environment.

, If you get feedback that makes you feel angry or defensive, do not show your employees this. Employees will be much less likely to give honest feedback if you react negatively to what they have to say.


If something bothers you tremendously, excuse yourself from the situation to calm yourself down so that you do not show how the feedback has made you feel.

, Doing this will help to show your employees that you are serious about using their feedback to better the work environment, and the company as a whole.


If one bit of feedback was that they feel that you do not have time to discuss work-related problems with your employees, set up a time slot each day when you will make yourself entirely available to your employees.

, Rather than making your feedback session a one time event, make sure that your employees know that feedback is always welcome. Consider making feedback surveys a permanent part of each month (or week) of work.


Ask for feedback regularly, be it with how a presentation went, or if your employees like the new holiday decoration you put up.

, When your employees come to you with honest feedback, it is important to try to make changes that they suggest as soon as possible (if you agree with their suggestions). If you don’t agree with their suggestions, work with the employees to come up with a compromise.


Extend your heartiest thanks when the ideas and action items prove beneficial.

Set Expectations.,
Give regular performance appraisals.,
Be sure of your standing.,
Act quickly when problems are noticed.,
Consider personal factors.,
Focus on the problem.,
Keep records.,
Be clear with an employee when the next stage is termination.",How to Fire an Employee1," Discuss with your employees any behavior that could be grounds for immediate termination.


Don't wait until behavior is already occurring. Be sure that all employees understand the rules and productivity expectations up front. These might include such things as failing to disclose arrest records, lying about past employment, failing a drug test, insubordination, excessive absence—and what constitutes “excessive”—and other issues that affect job performance.;
, Evaluate employee work at least once a year and document deficiencies in performance versus your expectations or the actual job requirements. When an employee comes up short, discuss ways to improve and give the employee clear steps and goals to help them improve.

, Unless you are the company owner, know your employer's rules about firing someone.


There may be specific steps you are required to take to fire someone -- even if the employee is not doing their job. Never undermine your employer and risk your own position by taking such actions without informing your own supervisor.

, Be sure to communicate performance problems as soon as you are aware of them, and coach your employee on how to improve.


Sit down with your employee and discuss with them the problem. Ask them what they think is causing their performance to be substandard, and and offer suggestions for their improvement.
Keep a written record of these conversations. Either have them sign a form that covers what was discussed, or send them a formal email, or both. If sending an email, ask your employee to reply to it when they’ve read it, both to acknowledge receipt and to give them an opportunity to respond in writing.

, While companies have to keep an eye on their productivity, workplace environment and bottom line, it's wise to ask about and consider any extraneous circumstances in your employee's life that may temporarily be effecting their performance. Health problems, death/illness in the family, pregnancy, divorce or other relationship trauma, moving stress, and financial troubles are all part of life and can understandably cause otherwise valuable employees to lose focus. However these drops in productivity can be temporary, and firing someone in the midst of outside difficulties can be cruel and potentially bring bad publicity to your organization. If possible, consider giving the employee some consideration and an opportunity to resolve their difficulties so their performance can improve.

, When you counsel an employee, focus on the facts, without editorial comment. ""You have failed to meet deadlines on 11 out of the past 16 assignments"" is appropriate. ""You're slacking off"" is inappropriate.

, Should the need arise, you want to have a paper trail that shows you were neither capricious nor arbitrary in your decision to fire.


Retain a record of all disciplinary actions. Have the employee sign some sort of document outlining the conversation to cover yourself and the company. It should specifically state that the employee is not admitting fault, but has been told that job performance is not satisfactory.
Outline specific improvements or changes required in order for them to keep their job, and give them clear deadlines when these improvements or changes must be seen.
Set milestones. Don’t expect all problems to be solved immediately. By giving a timeline and some key goals attached to deadlines will help highlight any improvement (or lack thereof).

, If the employee continues to underperform, be sure they understand that improvements must match benchmarks or the employee will be fired.

"
"
Make a plan.,
Consider a severance package.,
Choose somewhere private and call them into the room.",How to Fire an Employee2," Know how your team will function without this employee. Think about that job's responsibilities and be ready to assign them to someone else, or hire a more suitable employee.


If you chose to hire another employee as a replacement, be careful about your recruiting efforts. If you’re dissatisfied with your employee, it's possible they are dissatisfied with the job themselves, and are looking for similar employment elsewhere. If they come across their job description for your company, and know that you are planning to fire them, they could take offense and take retaliatory measures—anything from sabotaging clients to stealing company secrets.

, If the circumstances around the termination could be contested, offering several weeks or months pay in exchange for signing a severance agreement can be a good way to protect your organization from a damaging legal battle. It can also be a compassionate way to help an employee make it through what is sure to be a trying time.

, You want to place where both you and the employee are comfortable speaking plainly. There may be issues that did not come out beforehand about other employees, or pay information—things that are not and should not be shared indiscriminately.

"
"
Tell the employee the purpose of the meeting within 30 seconds of them entering the room.,
Don't allow it to go on.,
Fire.,
Concisely explain any details of the separation.,
Offer to help.,
Be prepared for anger.,
Keep it professional.,
Don’t take it personally yourself.",How to Fire an Employee3," Know what you will say and get to it swiftly. By waiting to get to the point or stumbling over your words, you are just torturing the employee and yourself.


Try something like, ""Mark, I've called you in here because of your consistent failure to meet benchmarks set for your position."" Not, “So, Mark, how’s the family? Peggy is due any day now, right? Gosh, she’s a sweetheart.” At the very least, Mark’s going to think you’re a real jerk when you follow that with “You’re fired.”

, You’ve stated your case, and the reason for termination. You’ve given the employee ample time to correct any failings, and that hasn’t happened. The employee knows what’s coming, so take aim early and tell them the truth without going into details—that all should have been covered in performance discussions leading up to the firing.


You don't need to delineate your reasons—if they need reiteration, they can be stated in a letter. The less you say, the better. ""I know we've discussed the same issues a number of times. Despite repeated warnings and counseling, you really haven't made sufficient improvements.""
However if the employee asks for a reason, give them one. Unemployment insurance applications often ask the reason for the termination.

, Just spit it out. Don't allow the employee to turn it into a discussion or argument. ""Because of this, I'm sorry, but I’m going to have to let you go.""

, Make sure you describe, preferably verbally and in writing, any steps they must take, such as returning company equipment or clearing out their workspace. Explain the severance package you are offering, if any. If necessary, remind them of any legally binding agreements the employee has signed, such as an agreement not to disclose company secrets.


If you are asking them to sign any legal papers, allow them a few days to take the documents home and review them.
Let your employee know if you will contest their unemployment claim. If you are firing the employee due to misbehavior, excessive absence, or performance failures, it may be within your rights to contest the employee's upcoming claim for unemployment insurance, as such claims effect your company's tax bill. However winning such battles isn't always easy, and depriving an employee of needed unemployment benefits can turn what might be a genial separation into an angry legal war—or worse. Either way, let your employee know if you plan to contest their claim or not.

, Usually the employee you just fired is not a terrible person, just not suited to the job.


If you feel the employee worked in good faith, but simply lacked the skills necessary for the job or the right temperament for your company, you may offer to give them a recommendation regarding their reliability, their attitude, their teamwork, whatever parts of the job they were successful with. Thank them for the work they performed well, and wish them good luck on their future endeavors.

, Even if it is clear you did your due diligence, the employee you are firing may get upset. If they turn violent, call security, other employees or the police to help remove them. If they are simply insulting or lashing out emotional, do your best not to respond. You might not deserve it, but it may be what their need to get through the situation.

, Even if you liked the employee as a person, keep a professional distance at this point.


It will help the former employee to know that it wasn’t personal, just business.

, Yes, it’s hard to fire somebody, especially somebody who needs the job. Just remember that you are responsible for your employees, and if they are failing, so will you.

"
"
Practice the conversation beforehand.,
Terminate your employee in person and in private.,
Try to see the situation from the employee’s shoes.,
Don’t beat around the bush.,
Explain exactly why you are terminating the employee.,
Show supporting documentation.Firing due to performance or conduct reasons won’t be a surprise, but it’s still a good thing to have supporting information at this meeting.,
Offer the employee the chance to talk.Obviously, if you did the deed with clear and direct language, the employee will understand that the termination is non-negotiable.,
Ease the burden, if possible.,
Fire the employee as early in the week as possible.,
Refrain from getting emotional.,
Have an escort or backup nearby in case the situation goes bad.,
Avoid announcing the decision during an office meeting.",How to Fire an Employee Compassionately," No matter how many times you have had to fire someone, the deed never becomes easy. Most companies offer a general script or guidelines to use when firing.Even if you have this, it’s still a good idea to practice what you’ll say just in case you freeze up or go on and on rambling.


You might stand in front of a mirror or read from a sheet of paper for a few times before calling the employee in to see you. You might even have the opportunity to role play with someone in HR who can offer you helpful pointers.;
, Be discreet when you call the meeting. Do not announce your intentions to the rest of the team or the workplace. Do it in person, face to face and with integrity.


Remind yourself that early on the employee will likely be angry and devastated, but sometime in the future, he or she may feel appreciative of the way you handled it. Hopefully, this situation can be used as a benchmark to improving his future career.

, A big part of showing compassion is having empathy for another person. Empathy is basically the same as trying see things from someone else’s point-of-view. Even if the employee is being let go due to misbehavior, he or she will still likely be upset by the news. Be mindful of how you would feel in the same situation as you fire the employee.

, Firing an employee with compassion means getting to the point. It’s terrible to sit there and see your boss stammering or going in circles around the issue, having to wonder what all the fuss is about. Get to the point as quickly and succinctly as you can.


An example of a direct, to-the-point way of firing someone with compassion is as follows: “Good afternoon, Charles. I asked you in here because we have decided to let you go. Today is your last day working for us and I want to thank you for your service with the company. There are a few things I have to go over first. Then, you are welcome to ask questions.”Do not send any mixed signals that can be misinterpreted or leave the impression that this isn't a warranted or necessary termination. You do not want to open up the organization to a lawsuit.

, If it is for job performance and you have been doing the job yourself, it should not come as any surprise to the employee. If the company is just doing poorly and needs to cut jobs, be sure to explain that fully and praise and thank the employee for his or her contributions.

, When you produce thorough reports of incidents or performance reviews, the employee is likely to be much more accepting of the outcome.


Also, having adequate documentation to back up firing someone minimizes the likelihood that the employee will attempt to sue the firm for wrongful termination. He won’t be able to argue with clear and well-documented reports.

, Still, he or she may want to ask some questions or even argue his point about a specified grievance. Even if you have no intention of reversing the termination, it’s still considerate to hear the employee out, if only to allow him or her to leave with dignity.

, For cases in which the employee was released due to budget cuts or some other reason not of his own doing, try to help as much as possible with the transition. You might explain a severance package or bonus if there will be one provided. At the very least, if you thought he or she was a good employee, you might offer to provide a good reference to future employers.Remember, you have worked alongside this person and may even know the employee on a personal level. Make an attempt to help with the burden of being terminated. You never know, someday someone might offer the same consideration to you.

, Do not terminate an employee at the end of the week. A Thursday or Friday fire means the individual will likely spend the weekend sitting around feeling sorry for himself. If you do it early in the week, the employee can quickly dive into the action of finding new employment as quickly as possible., Knowing the person you are laying off can be a particular pain in the neck. However, you must remain objective and remember that it is not about you. Acting overly apologetic or showing emotion takes away the employee’s ability to react to the firing. Instead, he or she is forced to keep a straight face and toughen up in order to soothe your feelings.It’s not personal. Be considerate and compassionate, but reel in your emotions and allow the person to have time to react without worrying about you.

, You can never predict how a termination will go. Some employees might burst into tears, others might stare at you as if in a daze, and still others may become angry and hostile. It’s a good practice to have another manager or security on standby.


If the employee responds with anger, you might say something like “Charles, there’s no need to handle things this way. I’m willing to answer your questions, but I won’t be able to if you are cursing and yelling.”, One way to strike up the rumor mill is to call too much attention to an employee termination. Although it’s important to address the situation with the rest of the staff, refrain from too much pomp and circumstance. Don’t schedule a special meeting just to break the news.You can simply announce it briefly on the following morning. “Good morning, guys. I wanted to inform everyone that Charles is no longer with us. Unfortunately, I’m unable to share anymore.”

Gather relevant information.,
Talk to your supervisors and managers.,
Observe your employees working.,
Schedule a meeting to talk about the problem.,
Explain the problem.,
Listen to the employee’s response.,
Keep communication on-going.,
Take suggestions from your employee.,
Suggest a solution to the problem.,
Ask others about ways to resolve the problem.",How to Communicate a Workplace Problem with Your Employee," Before talking to your employee, you should gather some information so you can identify the problem. Identifying the problem will provide you with the information you need in order to engage in a discussion about the problem.


Pull employee evaluations.
Gather performance or sales statistics.
Talk to other management or employees who may have first-hand information about the workplace problem.;
, Before moving on and talking to the employee, you should talk to your supervisor or manager. Your supervisor and manager will give you a good idea about the types of solutions they want you to look for. In addition, they’ll give you an idea of the type of authority you have to remedy the workplace problem.


Call a meeting with your direct supervisor.
Let them know about the problem you’ve identified. Say something like: ""We have a productivity problem at our Spring Falls location. I'm actively working to resolve it with the employees in question.""
Ask them what they’d like you to do to address it. For instance, ask: ""Is there anything specific you'd like me to do when working to resolve this problem?""
Find out if your supervisor has any more relevant information about the workplace problem., After you’ve spoken with your direct manager, you should observe the employee or employees who are associated with the workplace problem. Observing your employees will give you solid information about the specific problematic process or employee interaction that is causing you an issue.


Take some time to observe your organization’s day-to-day activities. This will help you to form a better understanding of any workplace problems.
Hold meetings with employees from time-to-time in order to see what is going on with them.
Embed yourself in different jobs throughout the course of the year. This way, you’ll get a much better idea of how processes work and how employees engage with each other on a daily basis., Your first step is to schedule a meeting to talk about the problem. Scheduling a meeting will provide you with an opportunity to discuss and explore the problem.


When emailing or calling the employee, make sure to be relatively brief in your conversation.
While you should give them an idea of the problem you’ll talk about, try not to get too deep into the problem.
Avoid accusing your employee when inviting them to a meeting.
Say something like: ""John, I'd like to meet regarding your department. I want to talk about ways we can improve efficiency there.""
If you write an email to the employee in question, avoid writing something like “you’re not doing your job” or “your division is under performing.” This will set a negative tone and might undermine the effectiveness of your meeting. , After setting up a meeting, you’ll have the opportunity to explain the problem to the employee. Use this opportunity to fully inform your employee.


State the problem in simple and clear terms.
Identify how the problem hurts your organization.
Try being objective, rather than accusatory. Let them know what the problem is — don’t assign blame. For instance, rather than saying “You’re doing a horrible job as a customer service representative,” say “We’ve received negative feedback concerning your job as a customer service agent.”, After you’ve spent time explaining the problem to the employee, you need to listen to the employee’s response. Listening to the employee’s response will let them know you value their perspective and will provide you with valuable information.


Take their feedback. This information may help you improve your organization.
Show that you care about what your employee is saying. Consider repeating their points in different words to show you were paying attention.
Thank them for their input and response., While your employee has already offered you feedback, make sure your channels of communication remain open until the problem is solved. If you and your employee communicate often and effectively, it’ll help you find and then resolve the problem in question.


Tell your employee to contact you if they have and further concerns or problems.
Hold meetings with the employee until the problem is fully resolved., The employee will have first hand-knowledge of what's going on with them or the department. Ask where the problem is and where there is opportunity for improvement. This puts responsibility on the employee and can help them feel empowered, and also is a way for you to assess the employee's engagement and judgment.


Ask your employee something like: ""What do you think we can do to fix this problem?""
Document the solutions your employee proposes.
If you approve of a solution your employee recommends, let them know and give them the authority to implement it.
Remember, it doesn't matter who's at fault. You should focus on the solution., After listening to your employee's ideas, make your own suggestions if there are solutions they may not have considered.


Let your employee know that your suggestions are simply that — suggestions.
If you feel strongly about how your employee (or you) can implement your solution, let them know.Provide several solutions, if you can. For example, if your company has a location or franchise that has poor sales, suggest options of how that location can boost sales. You might suggest that the manager of that location puts out some print ads, runs promotions, or starts a social media campaign.

, In addition to creating solutions yourself and taking suggestions from your employee, contact other department heads and/or employees that are familiar with the workplace problem.


Call a meeting of management to discuss the problem and see if anyone can recommend a resolution. You and the employee in question might put together a presentation about the issue and then actively brainstorm with relevant management.
Hold a meeting of all employees associated with or familiar with the problem to see if anyone has any ideas of how to resolve it.
Discuss the problem with human resources, if it’s a human resource problem."

Value training.,
Keep overtime down.,
Give geeks the tools needed.,
Beware of over engineering.,
Expect at some stage to be asked by some of your geeks to ""work remote.""",How to Manage Geeks1," If a boss thinks that training is a waste of money and expects you to teach yourself, you feel pretty demotivated in any job. Training matters, especially in IT, and managers must realize that and budget for it. Sometimes you get the argument that ""if I give them training a competitor will hire them away."" That may be true, but the alternative is to only have employees who are too unskilled to work anywhere else and your organization risks lagging behind other more enlightened ones. Also, if you pay them well and have good benefits, they won't go somewhere else.;
, Avoid taking the approach of wringing as much as possible out of IT employees just because you figure they don't lead a normal life. Wrong! That’s a huge mistake and overworked geeks burn out or simply quit. It's a complete myth that long work hours are good for business.

, A fast computer may cost more money than an older one and it may not be corporate standard, but geeks use computers differently. A slow computer lowers productivity and is a daily annoyance. So is outdated software. Give them the tools they need. Understand that tools come in many forms. Caffeine is considered a standard tool among geeks. It's good to keep a supply of the caffeinated beverages your team prefers handy.

, Geeks will tend to look for a classical and beautiful architecture, with built-in capacity for future changes. They will tend to over engineer systems as opposed to wanting to bodge something together quickly, which is sometimes what's needed. If you need a quick bodge, ask for it specifically, and accept at some point in the future, that bodge will need to be undone and the system re engineered.

, This may terrify you initially but it's a valid expectation in a world where we're linked almost anywhere we go. Not all geeks will be good at working remotely, so you'll need to know if they have the right personality, if the job they're doing can be supported this way and if the culture of your organization will be sufficiently supportive. Consider trial periods with no promise of permanency as one option to at least give this a chance.

Avoid using management-speak.,
Don't try to appear smarter than the geeks.",How to Manage Geeks2," Geeks hate management-speak and see it as superficial and dishonest. Managers shouldn’t learn to speak tech, but they should drop the biz-buzzwords. A manager can say “We need to proactively impact our time-to-market” or simply use plain English and stick to “We gotta be on time with this project”. The latter makes total sense to everyone involved.

, When managers don’t know much about a technical question, they should simply admit it. Geeks respect them for that, but not for pretending to know. And they will catch it––geeks are smart––that's why you employed them after all!


Even if you do know, don't lord this knowledge over everyone. Most geeks will be thinking the answer as quickly as you, there's no need to discuss the minutiae. The best thing you can do is to make it known that you are always available to answer questions or to clarify whatever you've just said. They'll take it from there and respect you all the more for it.

"
"
Act consistently.,
Include them in IT related decisions.Never make decisions without consulting geeks.,
Come alongside your geeks.",How to Manage Geeks3," Geeks have an ingrained sense of fairness, probably related to the fact that in IT, structure and consistency is critical. The documentation can’t say one thing while the code does something else, and similarly, managers can’t say one thing and then do something else.

, Geeks usually know the technical side of the business better than the manager, so making a technical decision without consulting can be one of the most costly mistakes a leader can make.

, Geeks need to feel valued, and few ever understand what they do in order to appreciate them. If you have a problem you need a geek to solve, instead of ordering ""fix this broken report"", try ""We can't work out why this report doesn't seem to match this other one––can you help?"". If possible, allow the geek involvement in the diagnosis, and they will get to the core of the problem––you may find a novel solution that highlights other business weaknesses!

"
"
Give recognition.,
Don't make the mistake of ignoring the geeks.,
Pay transparently.",How to Manage Geeks4," Since managers may not understand the work geeks do very well, it’s hard for them to recognize and reward a job well done, which hurts motivation. The solution is to work together to define a set of goals that both parties agree on. When these goals are met the geeks are doing a great job.

, Because managers and geeks are different types of people, managers may end up leaving the geeks alone. This makes leading them difficult, and geeks need good leadership - the same as all other personnel groups.


Without fail, have regular one-to-one meetings with your geeks.

, Geeks are smart, and will spot the weaknesses in your benefits packages and corporate bonus policies in a heartbeat - that's part of the skill set of a successful geek producing high quality code! So find out what your geeks really value - you may find voucher schemes that your general staff value are as good as worthless to your geek community. Giving them mid-range technology or cheap gadgets that would impress other staff may even be seen as an insult worse than no gadgets at all!

"
Remember that geeks are creative workers.,
Acknowledge that geeks will answer the phone and emails when it is convenient.,
Try to have a mix of organic and structured meetings.",How to Manage Geeks5," Programming and system analysis are creative processes, not an industrial one. Geeks must constantly come up with solutions to new problems and rarely ever solve the same problem twice. Therefore they need leeway and flexibility. Strict dress codes and too much red tape kill all innovation. They also need creative workspace surroundings to avoid “death by cubicle”.

, This means that phones may ring to voicemail during times of intense work, when interruption would destroy the flow. If it's urgent, make the effort to turn up in person.

, Many managers like structured meetings because they have been trained to check off things––agenda, check; time limits, check; following agenda without deviation, check; and filling the time allotted for the meeting, check. Organic meetings allow for meandering, they don't have specific time requirements and they can go over the time, include random debate and actually be fun. This is how creativity thrives and you may get some of your best solutions during organic meetings. Let go your inner perfectionist and let geeks run a few of the meetings.

Low motivation
High employee turnover

Increased absenteeism

Follow through.",How to Discipline an Employee," Before you bring any disciplinary action against an employee at any stage of progressive discipline, it's important that you review the evidence against the employee.Ask yourself who is actually at fault in the situation. It's possible that the situation is more complex than you initially thought.Consider whether the employee had full control over his performance--for example, did the employee fully understand the roles and assignments of his position?;
, It's imperative that you keep any disciplinary discussions private from the rest of your employees. This is to protect your employee's privacy and reputation within the workplace.Be firm and clear, yet approachable in your request. Say something like, ""When you're finished with the task you're working on, I need to speak with you in my office, please.""

, Don't beat around the bush when you're bringing up improper or unsatisfactory performance.When addressing an employee's performance, be clear on what the problem is, but deliver that information in a way that shows the employee that you or another supervisor have observed this behavior and are concerned.Say something like, ""I've noticed that you've been missing a lot of work lately,"" or ""It's come to my attention that you haven't been meeting your quotas on time.""

, Even though you should have conducted your own investigation before meeting with the employee, it's possible that there are still some circumstances you were not aware of. In fact, many supervisors who give their employees the chance to explain unsatisfactory behavior often find that there is no need for disciplinary action of any kind.Give the employee a chance to process what you've communicated to him and let him respond with any insight he may have on the issue.Engage in a conversation. Keep yourself open to what he has to say. His input should not be a mere formality. Instead, consider the employee's response an important part of your investigation.Ask the employee to respond to the issue at hand before any mention of disciplinary action comes up. You do not want the employee to feel he's being disciplined before you've heard his side of the story. The best way to do this is to state the problem bluntly, then politely ask for the employee's feedback on the issue.Make the employee feel like he's part of a discussion on the issue, rather than being necessarily blamed for the problem.Listen actively and attentively, then re-evaluate the situation and the problematic behavior in light of what has been said. You may find that the employee hasn't done anything wrong, or that his behavior had a reasonable excuse, or you may find that nothing has changed. But the key is listening., If you still believe the employee is at fault after listening to his version of events, you'll need to spell out why that behavior or performance was unsatisfactory.If the employee is to blame for the problem, contrast his behavior with any conflicting rules in place within the office. That way you will have made it clear to the employee that there is a problem, you'll have spelled out why it's a problem, and you will have provided him with the company's desired outcome or behavior for future situations., This is the most important part of the disciplinary process. It's not enough to point out bad behavior to an employee if you're not offering some alternative behavioral goals to work towards. Whether the employee was unclear on company policies or simply had a lapse of judgment, offer him ways to constructively avoid similar problems moving forward.If an employee is having problems interacting with other coworkers, you may recommend that a representative from human resources sits down with the employee to coach him on how to interact more professionally with other workers.
If an employee is not meeting deadlines or quotas, ask him why, and offer realistic solutions. Work with him to figure out a way he can meet those deadlines or quotas.

, It's important to maintain a detailed log of any and all disciplinary discussions you've had with employees. This can help you recall previous conversations, and can also help you track an employee's progress. It also may be helpful to have in the event that an employee brings allegations of a wrongful termination down the line., This step is no different than the verbal warning. Any time an employee's performance or behavior becomes problematic, it's imperative that you personally review the facts and assess the situation. Keep an open mind, and be willing to try and see things from your employee's perspective.Consider who is at fault, and what the circumstances are., The written warning must be composed calmly and without anger or resentment. The goal of your correspondence is similar to the goal of a verbal warning: to communicate what is not working, and suggest ways to correct the problem.Make it clear in your correspondence what specific behavior or which aspects of your employee's performance are problematic, and why. Cite the specific company policies or laws that are being broken by that behavior.Refer to any previous verbal warnings or conversations about behavior/performance you've had with the employee.Give detailed instructions on what the employee needs to do in order to correct these problems, and offer suggestions on how the employee can meet those prescribed goals.For example, if an employee continues to have a bad sales record, reiterate the company's instructions on how to complete a sale. Offer remedial training on making sales calls so that the employee learns how to change his sales strategy to be more effective.
Consider whether or not to inform the employee of what the next step in the disciplinary chain would be. This could be a good motivating factor, if the employee has not taken your warnings seriously, but it may also come across as intimidating or threatening. It's best to tread carefully in this regard, and ultimately the choice is up to you., Whether you've typed and printed a physical letter or sent the correspondence by email, you will of course need to deliver that written warning to the employee. Do so in a manner that is discreet and professional, and be sure that no one else in the office is aware of what you are doing.Protect the employee's privacy and reputation by ensuring that he is the only person who sees and knows about the letter.Offer to meet with the employee to discuss the contents of the letter, and make it known that you are available to speak if he has any concerns or is unclear about any aspect of the letter. You should also allow him to state his side of the issue, if he has a defense he'd like to offer you.

, It's important that you maintain a record of any and all correspondences with employees. Any time you discipline an employee at any stage of the progressive disciplinary actions, write down a record of what was said and when, and keep any copies of letters you give to or receive from the employee.Have the employee sign a copy of the letter to acknowledge that he received the written warning and understands the accusations against him., At every stage of the disciplinary process, you should always review the information at hand and consider whether or not the employee is actually at fault., Some businesses simply offer a final written warning as the third step of a progressive disciplinary plan. Others may choose to suspend the employee without pay. This step will vary, depending on the policies of your company and the specific actions of the employee. Whatever course of action you choose, be sure that you enforce that course of action fairly and impartially towards all employees in the workplace., Whether you are offering a final written warning or intending to suspend an employee, you'll need to compose a professional letter communicating those actions to the employee.Make clear what the employee has done wrong, and how his actions violate the company's policies. Refer to any previous warnings (written and verbal), as well as any prior disciplinary hearings that employee has been a part of.If composing a suspension letter, make it clear in no uncertain terms that the employee will face further suspensions without pay or termination if his behavior or performance continues to insufficiently improve., Once again, you will need to deliver the letter to your employee, and have him sign a copy to certify that he has received and read the letter. Offer the employee a chance to explain his side of the issue, and offer concrete feedback on how he can improve his performance., Maintain your record of correspondence with the employee, and keep all copies of correspondences in the employee's personnel file. Do not delete any emails that you have sent to or received from that employee, and ensure that the employee's file is up to date., Before you terminate an employee, it's imperative once again that you fully investigate the incident and impartially assess the situation., If your company has a human resources department, consider speaking with an HR representative on how to proceed. There may be specific guidelines in place determined by governing bodies such as union organizations. For example, you may be required to bring a union representative to the meeting before terminating an employee., Depending on your business, you may be required to schedule the employee for a pre-termination conference. You may also have to write a termination letter, informing the employee by written correspondence of his impending termination.Give the employee an opportunity to respond to your evaluation, and take what he says into consideration.After consulting with the employee and any other necessary parties, determine whether you should proceed with the termination process or impose a lesser penalty, such as another suspension or an additional performance review.If you proceed with the termination process, include in your letter a written record of previous disciplinary warnings, as well as the detailed reasons for the employee's termination., If you've decided to proceed in terminating the employee, deliver the letter and inform your human resources department (if you have one). Be clear and use no uncertain terms in communicating to the employee that he is being terminated, and why."

Smile!",How to Deal with Frustrated Employees," Sometimes, having an extra workload irritates employees, especially when the workload remains heavy over a long time. If the employees are expected to worker harder without any reward, they will become frustrated and their productivity will decrease.;
, Every employee wants to be treated equally and fairly. Unfortunately, supervisors sometimes show a preference towards a certain employee or group of employees (whether intentionally or not), and this can leave those on the outside feeling frustrated.

, Being dissatisfied with a low salary is yet another common reason behind employee frustration. This is why organizations must set salary according to an employee's current market value, otherwise their frustration may lead to them leaving the company.

, Lack of bonuses, rewards (both monetary and non-monetary) despite hard work and extraordinary performance can lead to employee frustration. This can lead to a high turnover of employees, which is not good for the company in the long run.

, One of the major reasons for employee frustration is a lack of communication. Sometimes, supervisors do not bother to explain work tasks to each employee. This lack of communication between employees and management causes frustration among employees as they do not really know what to do, when to do it, why they're doing it and how to do it.


Think about it from the employee's point of view - can he/she undertake the task assigned? Maybe the employee is new or has a history of being uncomfortable with the type of task you just assigned him her. Remember that employees are hesitant to discuss their shortcomings, so it is the job of the leader to address these issues.
Therefore, as a supervisor/manager; make sure your instructions are crystal clear. Leave no ambiguities. Insist on receiving feedback so that you know that your communications were clear.
Openness is a necessity rather than an option. Employees should know that your door is always open for them and that their queries will always be addressed.

, Fear of the unknown can get a lot of people very worried. So, as a manager, you should try to understand what it feels like to be doing a job at a company which has frequent layoffs, pay cuts, etc; an insecure company.


The worst feeling for any employee is job insecurity. The fear that you can be fired from your job at any time is so scary that it causes frustration among employees which affects their performance. These employees tend to have trust issues with the management, as they are scared that any mistake they make could result in them being laid off.
A manager should not only inspire trust and give hope to his employees but also educate them. They should know that they can confidently undertake a task without fear of failure. Mistakes will not be punished as long as the intentions are good.

, Another major reason behind employee frustration is the behavior of the supervisor, especially when the supervisor refuses to be understanding towards their employees. They should avoid pointing fingers and assigning blame when a mistake has been made, and accept the fact that n employee is perfect.


Try to separate the problem from the people. A manager should carefully analyze any issues in a calm and levelheaded problem and see what is actually causing the problem before blaming an employee. Often the problem lies in company policy and is not the employees fault.
Never direct/show your anger towards the employee. If something truly wrong has been done then there are policies and procedures in place to deal with that. A manager is to retain his/her composure at all times and maintain a peaceful and calm atmosphere.

, Sometimes, supervisors are so busy with other tasks that they completely forget to act in a timely fashion with regards to employee problems. This can really be frustrating for the employees, as they expect their supervisor to help them in case of any problem.


Swift action means tackling a problem as soon as it comes to your attention. Of course, this also entails having a mechanism which allows immediate identification and discovery of problems. Once an issue has been identified, e.g. via quarterly reviews, polls, surveys, etc then action should be taken.
Never wait for the problem to solve itself. Not only is this method futile but also dangerous. It can lead to further aggravation and result in even bigger problems. For example, if an employee keeps repeating the same mistake; do not expect him to learn from his mistakes. Figure out if there are other issues affecting his performance. A manager should be quick on his feet about such matters.
Your quick response shows employees that they have someone looking after them. They will therefore be less likely to stress out over issues leading to a reduction in overall frustration.

, Resolving issues is good. Overstepping policy or rules is not, so make sure you are operating within your powers.


Make a note every time you come across a frustrated employee. Take notes on what the problem was, how it was solved and so on. Once you have a list of 4-5 cases, use them to determine a common trend and send over a plan to your superiors to implement a policy to counter this trend altogether.
Never go out of the way to resolve an issue. You are a manager and have an equal duty towards every employee. Giving one of them favors can lead to disastrous trickle-down results with every other worker demanding favors too.
Use official channels of communication if you feel things may get out of hand. Everything should be on record. Resolving frustrations may involve a change of job descriptions and so on.

, The positive point of view will transfer to others as well- it is important to solve the ""problems"" with optimism. The change is guaranteed."

Beyond letting your employees know that they are valued, these programs can also help boost productivity and performance. Before you create your employee recognition program, take a look at some of the main benefits that a program like this can bring:Gain a better understanding of how you can improve company functions and policy.
Learn where you could save money and cut expenses.
Encourage your employees to go above and beyond regular duties.
Improve attitudes and teamwork.;
, Although the specifics of your employee recognition program will be up to you, there are some common goals that all good programs will share. Knowing the basic goals can help make your program a success. Take a look at some of the following common goals to help you create a great employee recognition program.Your program should inspire employees to be their best.
You'll need to learn how to clearly communicate your goals, needs and expectations to those participating in your program.
Your employees should know how to participate in the program.
Let employees know how they make an impact on the company.

, A good employee recognition program will have two methods of rewarding performance. These methods will allow your employees to feel recognized both personally and officially. Take a look at some of these examples of formal and informal rewards for your own program:Covering for someone who is ill, staying late to work on a project with a coworker or going the extra mile for your team are all good examples of informal recognition.
Your official rewards program will deliver formal recognition for your employee's hard work.

, The first step in forming your employee recognition program will be to form a committee. The committee will handle the formation of the program, it's implementation and the management of it once it's established. To help you form your committee, keep some of these tips in mind:It can be a good idea to mix both employees and managers on your committee.
You'll want to determine how long members are appointed to the committee.
You should decide how members are selected to serve on the committee.
Decide how many members you will need for your group.

, Your employee recognition program will need to have clear objectives. These objectives will help your program have direct goals and develop steps to achieve them. A good employee recognition program will:Match the needs of your employees.
Reward desirable behaviors.
Be fair and inclusive.
Comply with other company rules and regulations.
Be sincere, meaningful, adaptable, relevant and timely.

, In order to offer rewards for certain actions, you'll need to decide which actions should be rewarded. Knowing which behaviors and actions lead to a reward can help your create a sensible and effective program. Any award criteria should encourage and reward key behaviors that you want to foster in your company. Review the following examples of behavioral criteria to learn which might be a good fit for your program: Excellent customer service
Being a good leader
Putting in extra effort
Performing professional duties well
Being a good team member
Demonstrating flexibility or being innovative

, After you've decided which behaviors you want to reward, you'll need to decide how you want to reward them. Your rewards could by anything, but they should be sincere, genuine and something that your employees feel is valuable or worth earning. You might consider using some of these examples when thinking about which rewards you want to offer to your employees:Framed certificates of excellence.
Gift certificates.
Plaques
Tickets to local events
Gift cards
Pins or stickers

, Now that you know which behaviors are rewarded and how you plan on rewarding them, you can decide how often to offer those rewards. The committee tasked with building your recognition program will need to choose which employees are eligible for a reward, when they can receive an award and how often rewards are issued.You'll want to decide how many awards an employee could win.
Decide how often an employee can win an award.
You should choose a regular time to send out rewards.
You will need to select which employees are eligible for a reward. For example, you may choose to offer rewards to only full time employees or employees that have worked with the company for a number of years.

, After you decide who is eligible for a reward and when, you'll want to determine how they can be nominated for those rewards. You will also need to decide how you select the recipients of awards, making it clear who can win the award and when. Work with your committee to answer some of these questions regarding your employee recognition program: Will nominations be kept confidential or will they be public?
Who can submit nominations?
What information about a nominee should be provided?
How should nominations be submitted?
Who will review nominations?
Who will be deciding the recipients of awards.

, Once you have the framework of your employee recognition program in place, you'll want to start promoting it. Getting employees excited and interested in the program can help them take part in it once you officially begin. Your employees will also know what to expect from the program, how to participate and which rewards they can earn. Try promoting your program by using some of these methods: Send detailed emails out to employees.
Include information about the program in your company's newsletter.
Promote the program on your company's website.
Post details of the program on company bulletin boards.
Hold meetings and discuss the program.

, Now that your program has been finalized and your employees have been made aware of it, it's time to officially launch the program. You'll want to have a clear start date for the program, allowing you to carefully track the effect it has on your company and to allow your employees to know when they can begin taking part. Make sure everyone at your company is aware of the recognition program to help make it a success.


You might have a small event or ceremony to build excitement and launch your program.
Keep track of employee engagement levels as your program beings.
You'll want to begin looking for any increase in the performance targets the program was designed around.

, After your program launches, all that's left to do is make sure it's running properly. Carefully tracking the program will allow you to determine how well it's working, the effect it's having on your employees and any changes that you might need to make. Keep track of the program and monitor its success to help engage your employees and recognize them for their hard work. You'll want to track how satisfied employees are with the program.
You may need to change employee eligibility requirements for your program.
You may decide to offer different rewards.
You may need to assign more people to the reward program committee.
You might need to adjust the size of your program due to available funding.

Make training mandatory.,
Hold regular meetings.,
Have an open door.,
Discourage gossip.

,
Prevent misunderstandings among staff members by discouraging gossip in the workplace.,
Outline employee responsibilities.,
Utilize the employee handbook.,
Post changes universally.,
Treat employees equally.",How to Avoid Misunderstandings With Employees,"


Prevent miscommunication with employees by holding mandatory training sessions for employees at all levels. These training sessions can be used to introduce new programs and ensure that all employees understand how to implement them, as well as for reviewing basic guidelines and procedural policies.;
,


Avoid misunderstandings with employees by holding regular staff meetings and encouraging employees to address questions or concerns. Make these meetings neutral and friendly so employees feel comfortable voicing their opinions and clearing up any misunderstandings. Hold separate meetings for employee-related topics and business-related topics so employees don't feel their needs are being overshadowed by business deadlines or goals.

,


Avoid employee misunderstandings by letting them know they can come to you and discuss issues or concerns they have without repercussions. If employees feel you will listen with an open mind and treat them with respect, they will be more likely to come to you with problems or areas of confusion.

,, Gossip and rumors can lead to misinformation between employees and distrust for one another. Discourage this behavior when it happens and encourage employees to support one another and keep lines of communication open between everyone.

,


Outline the job description and expectations for each staff position. Review these guidelines when hiring new staff members and provide them with a hard copy for future reference. If employees have a clear understanding of what is expected of them, there will be fewer misunderstandings about job responsibilities, quotas or workplace expectations.

,


Reference your company's employee handbook and encourage employees to familiarize themselves with it so they understand company policies and procedures. The handbook should clarify regulations and guidelines for employees, preventing misunderstandings about the basics of their jobs.

,


Avoid employee misunderstandings by posting any new policies or changes to current guidelines where all employees can read them. A public posting or email will make this information universally accessible to all employees.

,


Show each employee the same amount of respect and concern. If you bestow extra attention upon an individual employee, other employees could misunderstand this behavior as favoritism, which will cause them to distrust you and that employee. Treat each employee professionally and courteously so the level of communication is equal between everyone in the workplace.

Be aware that a good project scheme has key elements that let the manager and team to take the project to a successful end, on time and below budget.,
Explain why the project is necessary.,
Write down everything that needs to be created to accomplish the project.,
When assigning roles within the project plan, it is important to work with the strengths and weaknesses of the group.,
After you've assigned the roles, you have to have a schedule.,
Figure out the requirements for your project, including the funds you'll want, workers, supplies, and equipment, with formal approximations of what you'll need to get the project done.,
Develop a project program with the understanding that it is an involved and sometimes dull procedure, but its value is easily made in the long-run when you have a smooth-running, competent plan.",How to Produce a Project Scheme," Without these main components, the program is incomplete and will in time fail after proving itself unable to finish the project.;
, Why is it multipurpose? What motivated it? It is likewise obligatory to point the real outcomes involved to finish the project.

, This means every single bit of work. This may sound uninteresting, but it is essential to practice this to ensure that you think to get everything done and nothing is ignored. Once you've discovered the work that needs to be finished, you are required to assign project parts to proper responsibilities. What purpose will each finished aspect of the work serve? Make certain this is clear in the plan, so that work can be specified easily afterwards.

, Place the group member in a role who is able deliver that which is needed. Having people in roles they cannot accomplish is worse than having no group at all.

, Taking into account the conclusion date, determine what must be done when to get everything completed in time. Take into account any projects that must be accomplished for other work to get done, and make sure those projects are completed first. It might be that there isn’t enough time to let every declared job finish up by the end date. In that case, you either need to reconsider what outcomes you desire, inform the buyer of the issue, or add more individuals to your project.

, You should also identify your initial presumptions about how the project will unfold. Obviously, it's not possible to program for all foreseeable outcomes, but anything you consider might come up should be included in the program. With full preparation in advance, the project will start on a solid foundation, letting work to proceed as smoothly as possible.

, By seeing all the required factors and needs before starting any work on the project itself, even the most urgent or complicated project can be completed with ease.

"
"
Prioritize your projects to keep things in perspective.,
Write out a detailed process for each project.,
Keep important information in a single, designated place.",How to Manage Multiple Projects1," Not everything you work on has the same payoff for finishing it or consequences for not finishing it. As you work on projects and constantly add more to your list, use some kind of system to remind yourself what is the most important and what you can put off for long amounts of time.One way to prioritize is to take note of when things are due and make sure you mostly work on the things that are due the soonest. You will still need to work on longer term projects over time, rather than waiting until the deadline is upon you.
You can also prioritize based on the size of the project, or the difficulty of getting it done. It can be helpful to set a higher priority on difficult projects so you avoid putting them off and hurrying them at the last minute.
Develop a color coding system that gives you an at-a-glance visual of relative priority levels. For example, however you decide to assign priorities, make red the highest, purple the middle, and blue the level you can hold off on.;
, Every project will entail multiple phases, steps, or aspects. Make a habit of breaking projects down into specific chunks of work. Write these out and make a plan for how you will work through each step of the process. Assign a time limit for each task and stick to that, but overestimate how long it will take so you have some cushion.This is the kind of habit that may seem like it is just using extra time, but if you have a detailed guide to what needs to be done before you start, it helps guard against forgetting something along the way.
Don’t be afraid to go overboard on the details because the more you expand things out, the clearer it will be what you need to get done. Plus you will feel like you are accomplishing more as you work through each small part of the project.

, Storing vital information on your various projects in one location helps ensure you never lose track of it. This could mean one notebook or spreadsheet, or one specific folder for all project documents. This single place could have sections for basic info on all the projects and specific info on each individual project.If it doesn’t make sense to store information from separate projects in a central place, at least be sure to store all of the information for each single project in one place.
When you are working with a team who all need access to the set of documents, make sure they have any passwords necessary or copies of any physical documents.
Once a project is finished, consider trashing its documents (if it makes sense to do so) or relocating all of the project’s information. Maybe you would never throw away or delete work you’ve done, but you can at least store it in a separate place designated specifically for finished items.

"
"
Pick something you dread and get to work on it first thing in the morning.,
Make course corrections when you hit a wall.,
Eliminate unnecessary aspects of the work.",How to Manage Multiple Projects2," Avoiding things you dread doing never makes it easier to do them. Force yourself to tackle the hard stuff early in the day while you are somewhat fresh. You’ll rarely stop dreading something if you put it off longer. Once the dreaded task is completed, you’ll feel a burden lifted and it will spur you on for the rest of the day.Dreaded tasks may not always be things that are prioritized highest, but it’s an exception to the priority rule.
If you are dreading something that also happens to be a time-consuming task, weigh this in mind. Maybe you can tackle a significant chunk of the process in the morning one day and finish it in the morning the next day.

, You’ll have times when you are working on something important, but you just hit a wall and stop making progress. Staring at the wall and beating yourself up are not helpful, so make a smooth transition on to other work. You may need to come back quickly, but taking a break will help keep you productive.Switching off to another task may not always be an option, especially if you are under a tight time crunch. Consider your situation and act accordingly. Maybe you don’t have time to switch completely to a different project, but you can take a five minute breather and refocus.
If you have the time to switch off to a different project, give that one your full attention. It’s no use changing projects if your mind is stuck on the first one.

, You may have habits while working on projects, but you realize those things are not directly contributing to the work at hand. Don’t make extra work for yourself. Evaluate your processes and look for things that you can stop doing. This will free up time for important things and will streamline your efforts.For example, maybe you always make a themed bulletin board for new projects, which is really only a tactic to put off getting started. Or maybe you come up with funny code names for team members, but you never actually use them during the project.
You don’t want to start cutting things out that are worthwhile practices, but try to be honest about what things contribute and what things don’t.

Set limits and say no.,
Assign tasks and don’t micromanage.,
Learn your team members’ communication styles and work with them.,
Stay in communication regarding progress.",How to Manage Multiple Projects3," You have a threshold for how much you can realistically manage. It’s important to know that limit and to stay in the sweet spot. If you are at maximum capacity and another opportunity presents itself, learn to say no. It may be better to miss out on something and actually get done what you already have than taking on another project and failing them all.Learning where exactly your limit is may take some trial and error. If you don’t get it right the first time, don’t give up on yourself. You have to find your limit somehow, even if it means dropping the ball once or twice.
Maybe the newly offered project is not something you can afford to pass up. Carefully consider when this is the case. You may burn a bridge by letting go of something you already committed to working on.

, When you have a team you work with or oversee, it is always best to delegate as much of the work as you can. You may tend to want to be in control, but you have people helping for a reason. Give people assignments at the outset of a project and let them do what they are assigned. Don’t take back control partway through.When you have good workers, a group of people can get more done than you can all alone. If you tend to do all of the work but delegating is an option, consider passing off some of the work. If you have workers available to you, don’t let their help go to waste.
If you are in charge, it’s still your responsibility to make sure everything is getting done. Set some times that you will check in on progress and then leave your team alone except during those specific times.

, You may be in charge of people who work very differently than you. To be effective, you need to accept that. Knowing how each member of your team communicates best will help you get more done. Without going overboard, cater a little to each person so you can get the best work possible out of them.This could apply specifically to forms of communication like phone and email. Some team members may prefer a call when you are giving them feedback. Others will value the efficiency of email.
It also applies to who likes to joke, who prefers to be serious, and how you need to frame feedback. You want to get along with your team as much as possible so they want to work with you.
Keep notes on your people so you can be sure to apply what you learn about them. You may ask them directly about some of their preferences or you may do better to figure it out over time.

, Whether you are in charge or you report to someone else, progress updates are important. Set times with people you are in charge of for them to update you. Be proactive about reporting to your supervisor as you get things done. Consistent, if not constant, updates will keep a project moving smoothly.


It can be helpful to have established progress report deadlines at various stages of a project. This could be daily for short projects, or once a week for projects that are ongoing.
This is especially important if one part of a project builds on the part before it. If Tom is waiting for Leslie to finish her part before he can work on his, he needs to know how far along she is.
Setting expectations in the beginning for how progress updates will be handled is important. You don’t want to get halfway through a project and surprise people with a progress check.

Draw a grid with 11 rows and 6 columns.,
Write the count of processes for each knowledge area.,
Now we are ready to plot the processes.,
Lets look at Planning Process Group.,
Just like how we have done for Planning process group, let us do for Monitoring and Controlling Process Group.,
Lets look at Executing Process Group.,
We have completed Integration, Quality, Human Resources, Communications, Procurement and Stakeholder Knowledge Areas.","How to Plot the 47 Processes of Pmbok 5, in 3 Minutes Flat"," Provide headings for Process Groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing. The process groups can be easily remembered with IPEM&CC. Name the Knowledge Areas: Integration, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, HR, Communications, Risk, Procurement and Stakeholder. The ten knowledge areas can be easily remembered with the statement: I Scoped Time, Cost and Quality with HR Communications as Risk on Procurements to Stakeholders. Don't worry about the meaning of this statement. Just memorize it and you will get all the ten knowledge areas. The first letter I stands for Integration.;
, You can use this count to cross check the correct number of processes. To remember the numbers, it is 667 434 3644 (vertically). Quality and Communications are with lowest number of processes i.e. 3 each. Cost, HR, Procurement and Stakeholder each is with 4. Integration, Scope and Risk are each with 6 processes. Time is the one with maximum number of processes for a knowledge area i.e. 7 processes. These numbers for Process Groups (goes horizontally) are 2, 24, 8, 11 and 2. Your finished grid will look like this:

, First mark the four boundaries for the Process Groups. Considering Header row and first column also, I.e. (Row 2, Column 2), (Row 2, Column 6), (Row 11, Column 2) and (Row 11, Column 6). The small catch here is the bottom right boundary is to be marked at (Row 10, Column 6). Remember this. There is a process each at this boundary point. ""Develop Project Charter"" is at (Row 2, Column 2) i.e. Initiating Process Group and Integration Knowledge Area, ""Close Project or Phase"" is at (Row 2, Column 6) i.e. Closing Process Group in Integration Knowledge Area, ""Identify Stakeholders"" is at (Row 11, Column 2) i.e. Initiating Process Group in Stakeholder management Knowledge area, ""Close Procurement's"" at (Row 10, Column 6) i..e Closing Process Group in Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area. This will clear 4 of the 47 processes. The beauty of this step is, with this step, you complete Initiating and Closing Process Group processes.

, For each knowledge area, there is a corresponding Planning process. These processes are the subsidiary plans for the Project Plan. In Integration Knowledge Area, you create the Project Plan. Rest of Knowledge Areas, have their respective management plans. One thing to remember is, ""Time"" is represented as ""Schedule"". Now you plot the 10 processes one each in each Knowledge Area. You have done 14 out of 47 processes.

, For each Knowledge Area except Human Resources (you Manage Human Resources but you do not control them), you have Controlling processes. Integration Knowledge Area has two such Controlling processes: ""Monitor and Control Project Work"" and ""Perform Integrated Change Control"". ""Time"" is again represented as ""Schedule"". This will give you 24 out of 47 processes. The Process Group Count is 11, whereas we have now 10. The remaining one will appear once we complete Scope Knowledge Area.

, Remember the count is 8. Scope, Time, Cost and Risk doesn't have any Executing Process Group Processes. Integration has: ""Direct and Manage Project Work"", Quality has ""Perform Quality Assurance"", Human Resources has three Executing process group processes: ""Acquire Project Team"", ""Develop Project Team"" and ""Manage Project Team"". Communications has ""Manage Communications"". Procurement has ""Conduct Procurements"". Lastly Stakeholder Knowledge area has ""Manage Stakeholder Engagement"". This will complete the Executing Process Group. Our total number of processes plotted is now 32 out of 47.

, Good job. What is left is the critical areas of the project: Scope, Time and Cost (the basis of Project Performance Baselines) and Risk. It is good that we are plotting these processes last. We have 14 Planning Processes and 1 Monitoring and Controlling Process Group Processes left. Lets do this Knowledge Area by Knowledge Area. Scope has ""Collect Requirements"", ""Define Scope"", ""Create WBS"" in Planning Process group, ""Validate Scope"" in Monitoring and Controlling Process Group, Time has ""Define Activities"", ""Sequence Activities"", ""Estimate Activity Resources"", ""Estimate Activity Durations"" and ""Develop Schedule"" - all are Planning Processes. Cost has ""Estimate Costs"" and ""Determine Budget"" - all are Planning Processes. Risk has ""Identify Risks"", ""Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis"", ""Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis"" and ""Plan Risk Responses"" - again all are Planning Processes. Plot these in the grid and your grid is complete.

Get early warning of delays caused by the client, main contractor or your own people.,
Make sure the client knows when he is the cause of the delay.,
Freeze design changes at a certain point to allow time for procurements and approvals.,
Carefully monitor the work done by the earlier contractor(s).,
Keep an eye on what your team is doing that might cause delays.,
""Mitigate"" the impact of the delays: accelerate work, use up your ""float"" and redefine the ""critical path.""",How to Manage Delays in Construction Projects," Client delays arise because they may change their minds, give instructions too late or are slow in approving drawings. They tend to overlook the fact that these delays push back the start for E&M contractors and that the contractor is powerless to avoid these delays. Main contractor delays usually involve construction work being completed late, causing subsequent stages to fall behind schedule. In some cases, delays are the result of mismanagement and a lack of coordination. Last but not least, the E&M contractor himself may cause delays, for example by under-resourcing the project in the early stages or by not completing design drawings and getting them approved on time.;
, Clients can have selective memories. When they make design changes, issue late instructions, or are slow in approving designs, they need to realise that there is a cumulative effect. Delays cost money, typically the contractor's money. Make the client aware of the effect their actions have on the completion of project stages. Say something like, ""Mr Client, I am happy to implement these changes, but I need to point out that we need to reorder equipment and get approvals, both of which will take time."" Put it in writing, and have the client acknowledge receipt.

, When there is a fixed deadline (for example, a sports complex has to be opened on a certain date) there is a ""point of no more changes."" Too often the sub-contractor is held accountable as the ""last man standing."" Don't get caught in this position.

, Make sure delays outside your control are recognised and documented. Such delays can impact you financially and need to be recorded and the financial impact dealt with by the responsible party. You should not have to bear the cost of other peoples' delays, nor should you be blamed for them.

, Typical examples include starting late, submitting drawings late, and making mistakes in your drawings. Where your team is at fault, you will have to we have to absorb the costs and try to make good the delays. When you are honest about errors, people will more readily accept your claims when problems arise that are not your fault.

, Whatever the cause of the delay, you must try to recover your position. After all, if a critical date is missed, it may not matter to the client who is at fault.

Retrospect Project.",How to Determine Which Processes Should Be Used for Better Delivery of Scrum Projects," In this process, the Project Business Case is reviewed to create a Project Vision Statement that will serve as the inspiration and provide focus for the entire project. The Product Owner is identified in this process.;
, In this process, the Scrum Master and Stakeholders are identified using specific Selection Criteria.

, In this process, Scrum Team members are identified. Normally the Product Owner has the primary responsibility of selecting team members, but often does so in collaboration with the Scrum Master.

, In this process, the Project Vision Statement serves as the basis for developing Epics. User Group Meetings may be held to discuss appropriate Epics.

, In this process, Epic(s) are refined, elaborated, and then prioritized to create a Prioritized Product Backlog for the project. The Done Criteria is also established at this point.

, In this process, the Scrum Core Team reviews the User Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog to develop a Release Planning Schedule, which is essentially a phased deployment schedule that can be shared with the project stakeholders. Length of Sprint is also determined in this process.

, In this process, User Stories and their related User Story Acceptance Criteria are created. User Stories are usually written by the Product Owner and are designed to ensure that the customer’s requirements are clearly depicted and can be fully understood by all stakeholders. User Story Writing Exercises may be held which involves Scrum Team members creating the User Stories. User Stories are incorporated into the Prioritized Product Backlog.

, In this process, the Product Owner approves User Stories for a Sprint. Then, the Scrum Master and Scrum Team estimate the effort required to develop the functionality described in each User Story, and the Scrum Team commits to deliver the customer requirements in the form of Approved, Estimated, and Committed User Stories.

, In this process, the Approved, Estimated, and Committed User Stories are broken down into specific tasks and compiled into a Task List. Often a Task Planning Meeting is held for this purpose.

, In this process, the Scrum Core Team, in Task Estimation Meetings, estimate the effort required to accomplish each task in the Task List. The result of this process is an Effort Estimated Task List.

, In this process, the Scrum Core Team holds Sprint Planning Meetings where the group creates a Sprint Backlog containing all tasks to be completed in the Sprint.

, In this process, the Scrum Team works on the tasks in the Sprint Backlog to create Sprint Deliverables. A Scrum board is often used to track the work and activities being carried out. Issues or problems being faced by the Scrum Team could be updated in an Impediment Log.

, This is the forum for the Scrum Team to update each other on their progress and any impediments they may be facing.

, In this process, the Prioritized Product Backlog is continuously updated and maintained. A Prioritized Product Backlog Review Meeting may be held, in which any changes or updates to the backlog are discussed and incorporated into the Prioritized Product Backlog as appropriate

, In this process, Scrum Team representatives convene for Scrum of Scrums (SoS) Meetings in predetermined intervals or whenever required to collaborate and track their respective progress, impediments, and dependencies across teams. This is relevant only for large projects where multiple Scrum Teams are involved.

, In this process, the Scrum Team demonstrates the Sprint Deliverables to the Product Owner and relevant stakeholders in a Sprint Review Meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to secure approval and acceptance from the Product Owner for the Deliverables created in the Sprint.

, In this process, the Scrum Master and Scrum Team meet to discuss the lessons learned throughout the Sprint. This information is documented as lessons learned which can be applied to future Sprints. Often, as a result of this discussion, there may be Agreed Actionable Improvements or Updated Scrum Guidance Body Recommendations.

, In this process, Accepted Deliverables are delivered or transitioned to the relevant stakeholders. A formal Working Deliverables Agreement documents the successful completion of the Sprint.

, In this process, which completes the project, organizational stakeholders and Scrum Core Team members assemble to retrospect the project and identify, document, and internalize the lessons learned. Often, these lessons lead to the documentation of Agreed Actionable Improvements, to be implemented in future projects.

Understand the top-down approach to project to project budgeting.,
Understand the bottom-up approach to project budgeting.,
Choose the approach for you.,
Discuss the needs of the project with key stakeholders.,
Determine your core costs.,
Consider non-core expenses.,
Add a reserve to help reduce your risk.,
Create a table to record your costs.",How to Create a Project Financial Plan," There are two approaches to creating a project budget. The first is known as the top-down approach, and this refers to projects where the total allowable cost is known before the project begins. The project budget must therefore be within those costs.


For example, assume you own a construction business, and a large organization approaches you to see if you can enlarge their parking lot. They may tell you that they have $500,000 to allocate to the project, at which point you need to decide if you can do it or not. In the top-down situation, you would need to create a budget that costs less than $500,000.;
, The bottom-up approach is the alternative to the top-down approach, and this refers to figuring out what every part of the project will cost, and then adding it up to determine the total.


If a customer approaches you to re-build a parking lot, and asks for a quote, you could use a bottom-up approach. You would consider everything that is necessary for the project, and then determine the total cost.
In this case, you determine the cost of the project by figuring out what every piece will cost and then calculating a total. In the top-down approach, the cost is determined by available resources, and you must work within those limits.

, Sometimes, you may not have a choice, and you may need to work within the confines of somebody else's budget (meaning you would need to use a top-down approach). Other times, if you have full control over a project, you can select an approach.The advantage of the top-down approach is that it ensures a project is completed within available resources. If your organization has $1 million to spend on projects for a year, you can state that the new parking lot construction project must be done for under $500,000. These limitations can lead to efficiencies and the reduction of waste.
This approach is useful if you have limited resources. Similarly, if you are running a project, it allows you to dictate to all the parties involved how much they are allowed to spend. This can keep costs down because each party will not be creating their own budgets.
The bottom-up approach is useful because it can be very accurate. Without any immediate limit, you, or your employees can cost the project based on what the project needs. If you are constructing a new parking lot, you may task each member of your team to come up with the budget they need. The major con is this approach can lead to run-ups in cost., Regardless of the approach you choose, you will need to discuss what the project will require with key project members. Knowing the needs of the project can allow you to determine what the costs of the project will be. This is called the ""scope"" of the project and it defines the requirements and limits of the work to be performed.


For example, assume you have been approached to construct a parking lot for a large organization, and they have allowed you to cost the project (or provide an estimate). Your first step will be to discuss with them what their needs are, and what their timelines are.
They may say they need a new lot with 100 spaces be constructed within three months. You may then survey the site to realize that you will need to cut down trees, blast rock, and then construct the new lot.
From this, you can determine you will need planners to design the lot, people to blast and cut down trees, and construction workers to build the lot.

, These are the absolutely essential costs to complete the project. Core costs would include things like labor, equipment and materials. The bulk of any projects costs will come from these key components.If you are constructing a parking lot, you will need laborers to do the work, and contractors to assist/plan the project. You will need materials (like asphalt, wood, paint), and you will need equipment (tractors, jackhammers, etc).
If you know the timeline for the project, this helps in scheduling resources and expenses. For example, if the project is three months, you know you may need to pay labor for three full months, as well as rent any equipment for that period.
You can determine costs by consulting with your team and contacting suppliers. If it is a large project, you can ask your construction foreman what specifically he needs in terms of labor, material, and equipment. You can then contact suppliers for quotes and choose the most appropriate quote.
You will also need to determine any legal or owner-established limits. For instance, what is the legal minimum wage, and what is the minimum wage you will offer for the different types of work? What are the legal requirements when it comes to scheduling, and are there any additional rules you wish to establish (such as no weekend access to the site)?

, Many projects go over-budget because they forget to include non-core expenses. Think very carefully about all the things outside of labor, materials, and equipment that you may need. Consider things like any required travel, insurance, legal advice, accounting advice, fuel, food/drinks, and extra telephone/internet bills.Make sure to put a number to each indirect cost. If you need to estimate, always assume it will be on the higher end rather than on the lower end.
To determine costs, consider how long you will need the good/service, and what its price is. For example, if you need to set up internet at the work site, you know you may need three months of internet at $100 per month.

, After your direct and indirect costs have been added up, consider adding extra money to your total costs just in case your cost estimates were too low. In addition, often times projects are delayed, issues occur, or items cost more than was initially planned.How much you choose to add depends on how accurate you think your budget is. If many aspects of your budget needed to be estimated and could not be confirmed, consider adding 5 – 10% as a reserve.

, The final aspect of a financial plan is to record all your information. To do this, you can open up Microsoft Excel or any other table creating program, and create a table with four columns. From left to right, they would state: Expenditure, Cost, Running Total, and Notes. The expenditure column would list the name of the expenditure. For example, Tractor Rental, or Construction Laborers.
The cost would indicate how much the expenditure cost.
The running total would indicate the total cost up to that particular point. For example, if the first row had a cost of $10, and the second row had a cost of $10, the running total in the second row would be $20.
Notes would include any special things to remember about the expense.
While you can consider labor as one category, it is generally better to break labor down by the tasks performed and the wages paid. For example, a welder or the foreman of a crew is usually paid more than a laborer. So you may wish to group the construction laborers together in one expenditure category, plus categories for the foreman, specialists (this could include the welder), consultants, etc.

Calculate the Estimate at Completion (EAC).",How to Calculate Earned Value," To take advantage of the power of Earned Value Analysis, your schedule must define when each project task should be done and how much each task should cost. Begin by creating a space to fill out a project schedule, either on paper or in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel.


List the tasks required to complete the project. All tasks should be included.
Identify the resources required to perform each task. Include labor and materials.
For example, imagine that a security company is bidding on a government contract. This requires two separate tasks: compiling and writing the bid document, and checking it for compliance with government standards. These two tasks would be listed separately, along with the employees (resources) and any other equipment needed to complete them.;
, Generally, this will be an amount of hours needed to complete the task, separated by resource (by employee in the example).


For our example, the first task requires 20 hours of Employee A's time, and the second requires 30 hours of Employee B's time. Each employee only works on one task in this case.

, This can be hourly wages for employees or the cost of running necessary machinery or equipment for a given amount of time.


For our example, Employee A earn $25 per hour but Employee B earns $50 per hour.

, You'll need to perform some basic math for this step.


Multiply the hourly rate for each required labor resource by the number of hours required.
Total this product for all required labor resources.
Calculate the total cost of materials required to complete the task.
Add any additional costs for such items as equipment rental, insurance, transportation, government fees, etc.
The total is the budgeted cost for the task.
For example, imagine that the expected cost of completing the security contract bid is the cost of the employees' wages and materials used plus a government submission fee. Multiply and add the wage rates of each employee by the number of hours each one works. In this case, this is $500 for employee A ($25/hr * 20 hours) and $1500 for employee B ($50/hr * 30 hours). In addition, you estimate that the employees will use $200 worth of materials over the course of the project and there is a one time, $300 government submission fee paid at the end.
When split into separate tasks, this means that the cost for the first task, completed by employee A, will be $750 ($500 wage to employee A and half of both the cost of supplies and the government fee). The cost of second task will be the cost of employee B's wages plus the other half of the projected materials cost and the government fee, so $1750 ($1500+$100+$150).

, This is the elapsed time to complete the task, not the amount of labor (applied time) needed to complete the task.


In the example, employees A and B are working on other tasks at the same time as this project is being completed. You estimate that the total length of time required will be two weeks (10 business days).

, The prerequisites are the tasks that must be completed before the given task can be started.


For example, one task that will have to be done before employee A can begin compiling a bid document is to analyze the government contract offer and come up with a list of what is required in the company's submission.

, Use project scheduling software or manually determine start and finish dates for each task. Spreadsheet software is often used for small projects.


For example, the security company would create a start and end date for the government contract project that allows for the expected two week timeframe. This allows, for simplicity, one week for the first task and one for the second.

, The total is referred to as the Actual Cost (AC) or Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).This figure will be useful later when calculating earned value measurements.


Imagine that, at this point, the security company is a week and one day into their government contract project. At this point, the company has recorded $1600 in expenses for this project (including the half of the government fee recorded as an expense for the first task, even though it hasn't been paid yet). This is the actual cost.

, Planned value is essentially the budgeted cost of the project to the project status date (the date at which you are calculating earned value). It is also known as total Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS).In the example, the planned value of the project is the budgeted cost of the two tasks at this point, so $750 for the completed task 1 (completed in the first week) and one-fifth of task 2 (as we are one day into the five day duration of task 2). This means that task 2 has a planned value of $350 (1/5 * $1750) and the total planned value is $750 + $350, or $1,100.

, Identify tasks that have been started, but not yet completed. Estimate the percent completed for each of these tasks. Tasks that have already been completed will be recorded as 100% complete.


Imagine that task one was completed ahead of schedule in four days and task 2 was started at the end of of week 1 instead of the scheduled week 2 start. You estimate that task 2 is 40% complete.

, Multiply the planned value of each task by the percentage completed.The total is the Earned Value (EV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP).Multiply task 1's completion percentage of 100% by its planned value of $750 to get an earned value of $750. Then, multiply task 2's completion percentage of 40% by it's planned value of $1750 to get an earned value of $700. Total these to get an earned value of $750 + $700, or $1,450.

, Subtract the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (planned value) from the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (earned value).SV = BCWP - BCWS or SV = EV - PV
A positive Schedule Variance indicates that the project is ahead of schedule. Negative means it is behind.
In the example, this would be the earned value of $1,450 minus the planned value of $1,100. This gives $350, a positive result which indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.

, Divide the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed by the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled.SPI = BCWP / BCWS or SPI = EV/PV
If the SPI is greater than 1, the project is ahead of schedule. If it is less than 1, the project is behind schedule.
In the example, this would be the earned value of $1,450 divided by the planned value of $1,100, which gives an SPI of 1.32. This result is greater than 1, indicating that the project is ahead of schedule.

, Subtract the Actual Cost of Work Performed from the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed.CV = BCWP - ACWP or CV = EV - AC
A positive Cost Variance indicates that the project is under budget.
In the example, this would be the earned value of $1,450 minus the actual cost of $1,600. This gives -$150. The negative result means that the project is running over budget and the company may be overspending in some area.

, Divide the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed by the Actual Cost of Work Performed.CPI = BCWP / ACWP or CPI = EV/AC
If the CPI is greater than 1, the project is under budget. If it is less than 1, the project is over budget.
For the security company, their earned value of $1,450 divided by the actual cost of $1,600 yields a CPI of 0.91, meaning that the project is over budget.

, The resulting total is known as the ""Budget at Completion"" (BAC).This is simply the combined budgeted costs of the two tasks which is $750 (task one) plus $1,750 (task two) for a total of $2,500.

, There are two different ways to calculate this measurement. You should use the method more appropriate for the specific circumstances of your project.


If the current cost variance is the result of something that occurred that is not likely to continue, then the BCWS for the remainder of the project is likely still valid. Subtract the Cost Variance from the Budget at Completion to get the estimated actual cost: EAC = BAC - CV. In the example, this would be $2,500 - (-$150), which with the negative sign canceling out the subtraction sign, gives $2,500 + $150, or $2,650.
If the current cost variance is the result of circumstances that are likely to continue (such as a higher than expected cost of labor), then divide the Budget at Completion by the Cost Performance Index to estimate the total project cost: EAC = BAC / CPI. In the example this would be $2,500/0.91, which gives about $2,750.

When possible, get this information in writing so you can turn back to it if you forget.
Get the contact information of your teacher, product manager, or client right from the beginning and ask if there is a good way to get in touch if you have later questions.;
, In order to effectively get to the end of the road you need to know where you are going. Brainstorm and write down what your vision of the completed project looks like whether it is a thesis idea, an organized spreadsheet, or finding your company a new warehouse. This will help you draft the steps needed to get there.


Use this time to make sure your plan is realistic for your time frame -- a big part of finishing on time is picking a project you can actually finish.
If you don't know quite where you're going yet, that's okay. For example, if you haven't decided the topic of a presentation yet you can still sketch out goals. You might not know the topic yet, for example, but you know you must go to the library and start researching one.
Your ""final project"" may change between now and the end -- the goal isn't to get a perfect project idea now, it's to create a blueprint that you can work off of., You can't complete a project until you have the stuff needed to actually do the job. Once you know what actually has to be done, make a master list of the things needed to do it. It can help to share this list with your team, if you have one, crossing off supplies as you get them.

Any special considerations (color, size, etc.), Finding your company a new warehouse, for example, is not something you just walk out and do. You need to discuss your company's specific needs, contact a realtor, decide on a warehouse, get it inspected, and then complete important tax, mortgage, and real estate paperwork. Whether you're working alone or as a team, you can better budget time and money to these five smaller tasks than one enormous one.Make your goals measurable. Instead of ""find out what my boss wants for the warehouse,"" make specific goals to learn the right location, budget, size, and essential amenities.
You may have no idea how long it takes to buy a warehouse, but you know that talking to your boss takes one day, finding a realtor 2-3 days, inspection 1-2 weeks, etc. It's much easier to budget time for smaller goals than big ones., If your project is due on May 31st and you have ten different things to do, you don't want to be completing all ten of them by the 31st. Figure out what things you can have done by the 10th, which ones you can finish by the 20th, and what things have to wait until the end of the month to complete.


In general, people are most effective working on one task at a time, not 10 at once. Check off each goal one at a time instead of working on all of them at once for maximum efficiency.
Most projects have work that can't be finished until other work is done. You can't, for example, write a book report until you've read the book. Figure out what work has to get done ahead of others and prioritize that., Things will invariably go wrong -- an item you need is out of stock, something breaks, last minute plan changes, etc. Don't schedule yourself so that you're under the gun every single day of work. Whenever possible, build an extra 1-3 days in so that you can adjust when complications arise.


No one was ever upset to finish a project ahead of schedule. If you plan for extra days and don't need them you simply get a few days off.

, The best way to complete a project on time is to just get started. Many people fear that they don't have a final idea yet, or need everything perfectly aligned to get started, but nothing could be further from the truth. If there are tasks that can be started, start them:


If you're designing a new logo for work, you don't need the total idea to sketch and draft out some prototypes. Even if you don't use them, start throwing out the ideas and get the ball rolling.
If you have a class project, finish all the books and homework for that class as soon as possible. Get the little stuff out of the way so you can focus on the bigger project.

, Whenever you start on a new segment or part of the project, take some time to think of everything that could go wrong. You could get sick, a book you need could be checked out, the project breaks, or supplies run out. Whatever the hardships could be, write them down. Once your list is complete, the fun part starts: figuring out how to handle these problems if they occur:


If you get sick, is there any work you can do from bed? Is there someone you trust who can help take notes or run errands?
If the book you need is checked out, can your library order another? Can you reserve the book in advance?
If your project is fragile, what can you do to ensure it is perfectly safe. If it did break, how long would it take to build another? Can you build spare or alternate parts?
If supplies run out, is there anything else you can use in there place? Can you buy an extra 1-2 parts of essential or hard to find objects to eliminate the issue?

, When trying to complete a project on time with a group, it is rarely a good idea for everyone to work on the same things at once. Instead, break up tasks so that 1-2 people are doing each. Trying to do it all yourself will slow everyone down and prevent efficient work. When delegating:


Set expectations early -- let people know exactly what is wanted from them.
Give deadlines to ensure that everything is actually done when it needs to be.
Let everyone know the end goal of the project, helping everyone work towards the same thing.
Post everyone's contact information in case of issues or questions., While you're working on the individual parts of the project, don't lose sight of the larger goals. For example, say you need to create a presentation on life during the American Civil War, and you've decided to break your project into research, a slide show, and a demonstration on what soldiers used to eat. These are all good ideas, but you need to make sure they all fit together while working on them:


While deep research is good, does it all match your final goal? Is there enough information on food to make a project, or should you pivot towards something like medicine, weapons, etc?
When making the slideshow, does it fit the research? Is it short enough to fit in your presentation, or will you be pushed for time?
Are you going to have to make Civil War food? Based on your research, is this still possible, or would it be smarter to do a different type of demonstration?

, People are busy, and you are no exception. If you don't prioritize working on the project it won't get done. Make time for the project every day, even if it is only a little bit. The bigger the project, the more you must move or sacrifice other commitments in order to get things done.


A little bit of work each day is generally more effective than enormous chunks occasionally. If you only plan to work on Saturdays, but there is a family emergency or issue Saturday morning, you just lost a whole week of work time.

, Say, for example, you've decided to build a model cathedral for your medieval history class, and you're a week out and still working on the first floor. While you should always aim to finish everything, it isn't always possible. Instead of doing a poor job on the original idea, come up with an alternate project or idea that you could finish in time and still feel proud of:


Does your model need replica stained-glass windows, or can you do something simpler?
If you're writing a long paper, is there a section that can be cut or summarized without compromising your overall point?
When working on a business deal, is there a way to extend the deadlines? If not, can you get a coworker to help you complete some section in time?

, Even if things aren't done yet, do as much of a test run as you can now, keeping an eye out for problems, snags, and areas of improvement. Do your priorities need to shift to finish some section in advance? Are there things that are further ahead than you planned? Is there anything you can add or subtract to make finishing on time more likely?

, A huge benefit of scheduling extra time to work is that it allows for quality control. Whether you're testing out your science fair project to see if it works or turning in quarterly expense reports, spend a day looking for bugs and typos.


If you're down to the wire trying to finish in time, you should still set aside an hour at the very end for review. Don't let weeks of hard work appear sloppy because of a few missed typo., Don't let you beautiful project fall apart because you left your backpack at home. Even if you're running around to finish, stop for 5 minutes and take a deep breath. Using a checklist, make sure you have every single thing needed for a successful presentation.


Return to your original draft, plans, and materials list. Is everything covered?

, It is very rare that a project goes perfectly, and that is okay. What is most important is that you take these mistakes and learn from them. Where could you have scheduled better? What risks or issues did you not foresee and can plan for next time? Did the final project match your goals?


There is no need to review right after you finish. Take 2-3 days to relax and then look back on the project with fresh eyes.
If you worked with a team, ask them what they think you could all improve on next time.
If you have questions on your grade, review, etc. ask politely ""what could I do to be better next time?"""

Know who you want to interview.,
Decide when you want to conduct the interview.,
Know what you want out of the phone interview.,
Contact the other party about the interview.,
Come up with a list of questions or topics.,
Confirm the date and time the day before the interview.,
Choose a place to take the call.",How to Set Up a Phone Interview," If you're an employer, carefully read over the candidate's resume and cover letter, and be familiar with any other information you have. You can even search their name online or use their LinkedIn or other social media profile to learn more. If you're an employee, try to find out who you will be talking to, and make sure to do plenty of research about the company and position you're applying for. When conducting an informational interview, research the person you will be talking to to learn about their experiences, history, and knowledge in fields related to what you'll be asking about.;
, Choose a time when you'll be free and focused; don't schedule it for 8 AM if you like to sleep in or 3 PM if that's when you're picking up kids. Plan the call for a time when you can be in a quiet location and focus on the call. Once you've decided on the time of day, be sure to check your calendar and pick a free date so that you are not rushing from one thing to another. This will help you relax before and during the call. Then pick a back up date and time. Once you've got these two alternate dates, be prepared with a 3rd one just in case the other person is not available for either of your first two choices. You may need to consider time zones if your telephone interview is with a company in another country or region.

, Whether you're an employer trying to decide to hire a candidate, an employee trying to get a job, or a reporter seeking general information about any topic, have a goal for the interview and know what kind of information you're looking for. Being specific about this will help you ask and answer questions in the most productive, directed way possible.

, If you will be conducting the interview, contact the person you will interview by phone or email. Request a phone interview, explain the purpose of the interview, and propose your chosen dates and times or ask when the other person will be available. If you're an employee applying for a job, the company should contact you, so respond with your availability. In either case, figure out a date and time that work for both of you, allowing enough time for a long interview, if you'll need it.

, A key advantage that a phone interview has over an in-person one is that the person you're talking to won't see any written materials you use. Jot down some notes to prepare for the interview. Write down a couple of questions that you want to ask. If you're applying for the job, come up with potential questions the interviewer might ask, and jot down your answers. You don't need to refer to your notes constantly throughout the interview - and in fact you shouldn't; instead, focus on building a rapport with the interviewer - but preparing them and having them there can give you confidence in your answers and help you if you don't know what to say.

, Especially if you scheduled the interview a week or more in advance, confirm the date and time by email approximately 24 hours before the interview will take place. Confirm that the date and time still work for both of you, and double check that you're all ready for the interview.

, You'll want a quiet, calm space where you'll be able to focus completely, without distraction or interruption. Use an office or another room, and close the door. Get in position ten or fifteen minutes before the interview is scheduled to happen so that you'll be ready if the call comes a few minutes early, and have water, paper, and a pen on hand. Take a deep breath before you pick up the phone. Relax and try to enjoy the interview.

Get the office phone numbers or emails of the list of references you want to check.,
Leave the following voice mail or email for each person on the list: ""I'm considering hiring John and I know you have worked with him in the past.,
Track the percentage of people who call you back.",How to Reference Check for Employment1," Call them at night when you know they will not be answering the phone.;
, I know you are an exceptionally busy person and I don't want you to spend unnecessary time on a reference check. So please only return this call if you think John is one of the most exceptional people you have ever worked with. My number is 212-555-1212. Thanks for listening.""

, If several people fail to call you back, you can safely decide that you should not proceed with hiring this candidate.

"
"
Start off asking the standard easy questions that any reference check should have:


When did Mike work at your company and what did he do?,
Continue asking more standard questions, but be sure to ask the ""obvious"" things that you think you already know about:


Did Mike report directly to you for his entire time at the company?,
Proceed into hard questions.",How to Reference Check for Employment2,"
What were Mike's largest accomplishments at the company?
How did he get along with other people on the team?

, Whom else did he report to?
To the best of your knowledge did Mike leave your company of his own volition? Or was he asked to leave?
How would Mike perform in your boss's role?

, This can be uncomfortable and should typically be reserved for later in the call when you have hopefully developed some rapport with the person you are calling. While these questions may one squirm a bit, they have the highest odds of exposing crucial information you need before you make your hiring decision:


Mike seems great to us, but everyone has weaknesses. What are his?
What were some of the setbacks Mike encountered at your company? How did he handle them?
If I hire Mike and you hear later that I ended up firing him, without knowing any more, why would you guess I let him go?
Mike is proud of what he accomplished on the Alaska project. Can you describe to me exactly what his role on that project was? And what the role of others on the team were?

Check any collective bargaining agreement.,
Understand anti-discrimination law.,
Meet with your attorney.,
Identify the advantages of rehiring employees.,
Understand the negatives of rehiring employees.,
Consider whether you want to rehire the person.,

Explain the terms and conditions of the job.,
Make an offer.,
Explain to the rest of the company why you are rehiring.,
Monitor the employee’s integration.",How to Rehire Employees You Laid Off," Your company might have a policy regarding rehiring laid off workers. You should check with Human Resources and read your company’s employment manuals. The policy could explain the following:The time limit for being considered a “preferential hire.” For example, someone might have been laid off two years ago. If your policy states that someone is a “preferential hire” for only one year after being laid off, then the candidate is not a preferential hire.
The order of recall. Sometimes the employee first laid off is the first rehired. Check to see what your company’s policy states.;
, If your workforce is unionized, then the applicable collective bargaining agreement could describe the ground rules for rehiring laid off employees.You should find the collective bargaining agreement and read it.


Many bargaining agreements require that you rehire based on seniority. Check your bargaining agreement for any rules that limit who you may rehire.

, Federal and state law prohibits discrimination in employment, and this includes hiring decisions. You cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, age, and other protected characteristics.Accordingly, you need to understand how your decision to rehire one or more ex-employees could expose you to a lawsuit.


For example, if you choose to rehire several white employees, then those who are not white could potentially bring a lawsuit for employment discrimination.Your state law might offer protection to more people than federal law. For example, many states protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. You can find your state law by searching “employment discrimination” and “your state” on the Internet.

, If you have any questions about your legal obligations, then you should contact your attorney. If your company doesn’t have an attorney, then you should get a referral by contacting your state or local bar association.Schedule an appointment to discuss your interest in rehiring a laid-off employee. Bring any company policy or collective bargaining agreement to the meeting.
Also be prepared to discuss why you laid the employee off and why you want to rehire him or her.

, There are several. Foremost is the fact that you know the person and are happy to give them a job again. However, there are other advantages:You may increase employee morale. Your other employees may feel relieved that you are bringing back a former employee, especially if you have gone through a period of downsizing. Your current employees may feel more secure in their jobs as a result.
You don’t need to train the person. If you rehire the ex-employee for the same job, then you won’t have to train them. This can save you time and money.

, Unfortunately, there are also several negatives related to rehiring a former employee. Among the more common are:The employee might resent you. If things ended badly, the employee might not have released all negative feelings toward you. Time does not heal all wounds.
The employee might feel entitled. In particular, the employee might expect better treatment than new hires. This can create tension in your workforce.
Your current employees might resent the new hire. This is especially true if your current employees applied for the job you are filling with an ex-employee.

, Sometimes it is easy to know whether you want to rehire a person. You can definitely rehire someone you regretted having to let go in the first place. On the other hand, you should avoid rehiring any employee who you thought was a terrible fit. However, some employees fall somewhere in the middle. Consider the following:Has the employee addressed his or her weaknesses while separated from the company? For example, an employee might not have had the skills to do a job as efficiently as possible. Check to see if the ex-employee has gained new training since being let go.
Has the employee addressed problems in their personal life? Employees sometimes underperform because of problems at home: an angry spouse, a sick child, etc. If the ex-employee’s personal life has changed for the better, then he or she might be worth rehiring.
Did you do everything you could to help the employee the first time around? Sometimes an employee might underperform because, at the time, you didn’t have the skills as a manager to help your employees. Ask yourself if you have grown as a manager and whether you could effectively manage the employee if they were rehired.

, You need to perform the same kind of due diligence on an ex-employee as you would for a new hire. This means that you must look afresh at the employee’s skills and experience. Don’t assume that because you have worked with this person that you already know everything about him or her.You should conduct the same series of interviews that you would schedule for an unknown candidate. Ask the same types of questions and honestly review the answers given.
Also check references. Even if the reference is another employee in your company, you should still check the reference.
Honestly assessing the ex-employee helps you counter any argument that you discriminated against people who were passed over for the job.

, The employee might be rehired to do a different job, or the terms of the job will differ from when the employee previously worked for you. You need to make sure that the employee understands the role he or she will serve.Provide the employee with a job description, even if he or she is returning to an old job. The job requirements might have changed since the employee last worked for you.

, You should follow your standard procedures for making an offer. Don’t treat the process informally simply because you have worked with the person before. Instead, send the person an appointment letter (if you use appointment letters).

, Current employees might have applied for the job that you are giving to an ex-employee, so you need to clearly communicate to your staff why you are hiring the ex-employee. Be prepared to provide several concrete reasons why you hired the ex-employee.If you honestly assessed the person’s credentials before offering employment, then it should be easy to explain to other employees why you rehired the person.

, At least once a quarter, check in with the employee. Find out if they are getting the kind of organizational support they need and whether they need additional assistance.A rehired employee might be hesitant to reach out for help. If you want the relationship to work, you need to be proactive.

Confirm the hiring of the new employee.,
Inform rejected candidates within a timely fashion.,
Consider calling candidates to notify them of their rejections.,
Write a rejection letter.,
Refrain from engaging in lengthy discussions with rejected candidates.",How to Reject a Job Candidate," Check with the human resources department to ensure that all appropriate contracts and paperwork have been signed. If the hiring process is less formal, verify with the candidate that he has accepted the terms of employment.;
, After hiring someone else for the position, notify rejected candidates within 2 days after the hiring decision has been made.


Draft notification of rejection letters as soon as confirmation of the new hire has been made. These letters should be sent out within 2 days, if possible.
Attain all signatures or approval for rejection materials as soon as possible. The mailing time frame may have to be extended if getting approval and signatures for rejection letters is difficult due to personnel schedules or other issues.

, Many candidates appreciate being notified as soon as possible so they can continue their job searches. Your rejection phone call should be concise and brief.

,


Get straight to the point. Address the candidate's rejection for the job opening within the first or second paragraphs.
Thank the candidate for their time. Graciously let the candidate know you appreciated the time spent preparing their resume and application and any time spent interviewing.
Include personalization. Write within the letter information pertinent to the candidate, such as a comment during the interview or specific credentials.
Exercise respect within the letter. Whether qualified or not, a candidate should be treated with respect by you and your company.
Direct the applicant to your company's website for future job opportunities. Invite the candidate to apply in the future.
Establish or reinforce your company's good reputation through the letter. It is important to maintain the integrity of the company through the hiring process.
Consider sending the letter via email. If cost is an issue, distributing the letter electronically can save your company mailing costs. Additionally, candidates will receive the e-mail sooner than a letter sent through the mail.

, Avoid discussing details about the person you've hired for the position or specific details about the candidate or the candidate's qualifications. Be vague and explain that the individual hired had more suitable qualifications or experience.

Understand what a verification letter is.,
Ask for a letter.,
Accept a character reference as a substitute.",How to Obtain Free Employment Verification of Someone1," An employment verification letter is a letter from a past or current employer verifying the length of employment and the employee’s position. The letter can also include salary information.The letter should be official. That is, it should be written on company letterhead and include the phone number, email address, and mailing address of the company.
An official letter prevents the employee from faking the verification letter.;
, In your job advertisement you can state that you require an employment verification letter. Or, you may choose to request this letter during the interview process.


Request that letters be mailed in a sealed envelope directly to you.
You can always call the employer if you have questions.

, A character reference is like an employment verification but includes more information. Specifically, the person writing the character reference also gives his or her impressions of the applicant as a worker, evaluating abilities and skills.This letter should also include information about how long the employee has worked at the current job and therefore is a good substitute for an employment verification letter.

"
"
Ask for references.,
Call each reference.,
Call the human resources department, if needed.",How to Obtain Free Employment Verification of Someone2," It is standard when advertising a job to ask applicants to include a resume and references. Typically, at least 2 references from the applicant’s most recent jobs is standard.You may also ask for a contact number for every company the applicant has worked for.
You can also ask that references be listed on a separate sheet of paper and include a mailing address in addition to a telephone number.

, Ask about employment type, dates, and anything that may recommend the person for the job.


If someone lists an employer for whom they do not provide a reference, try to find the phone number of the employer and call. Confirm that the person worked for the employer.
Be advised that many employers will not give either a positive or negative reference. Therefore, all you may be able to do is confirm dates of employment.

, Sometimes you cannot reach the direct supervisor or the boss of the potential employee. In those situations, you may have to call the company’s human resources department (HR) in order to verify employment.


You may have to perform an Internet search to find the phone number for human resources. Alternately, you might call the company’s main number and ask to be transferred to HR.

"
"
Request an Employment Report.,
Allow the person to black out sensitive information.,
Review the copy of the earnings report.",How to Obtain Free Employment Verification of Someone3," You should ask the applicant to get a copy of his or her “Social Security Earnings” form. This form is available from the federal government.


The applicant will have to pay a fee for this report. However, this option could be preferable if the applicant does not want potential employers contacting his or her current employer.
A certified, itemized statement currently costs $192.The applicant can find the application for the report here.

, The employment information is available in the detailed report, and the person may choose to remove totals or their social security number. You should notify the applicant that they are allowed to black out this information.

, Make sure that the applicant’s stated work history matches up to the employment on the report. After reviewing, keep the report in a secure location or return it to the potential employee.

Provide training for older workers.",How to Woo the Older Worker," Is your company an obvious choice for an older worker to consider applying to, or is there a sense of a ""youth culture"" pervading your establishment's image? Think hard about what it is that you really want to portray - having a good mix of older and younger workers is usually a workplace strength.;
, When you advertise your employment opportunities, find your older workers and get them to help recruit other older workers. Use images of older workers as reassurances to older people that it is OK to apply.

, Write down the types of values that your organization considers older people bring to the workplace so that potential applicants can feel reassured that they're not wasting their time in applying.

, You can teach older humans many new tricks. Sometimes you need to dangle some carrots to make it worthwhile but most times having the faith that they can do it and explaining how it will improve their job will be motivation enough.



Be patient about any need for longer or extra training. Sometimes the understanding may take longer but once grasped, you will gain a very dedicated employee.

Ask the right questions.,
Hire based on skill.,
Check references.,
Give yourself as much time as possible.",How to Recruit Staff," Instead of bringing someone in from outside the company, you may have the ideal candidate already in your employ. This method has both its advantages and disadvantage.


The advantage of recruiting in-house is that the employees are already familiar with the corporate culture of your business. Corporate culture ""describes and governs the ways a company's owners and employees think, feel and act."" This kind of employee will have a valuable knowledge of the company and you will have the resources of their past work achievements to help you determine if they’re right for the job.
The disadvantages of hiring in-house include being limited in your pool of applicants and exposing yourself to the possibility of resentment from other employees who went out for the job but were not chosen.
Being very clear about the requirements of the job as well as the hiring process can alleviate any disadvantages and ensure a quality applicant.;
, Work with local colleges or schools to employ interns or students seeking work-study credits and experience. Working with interns will give you the inside edge to recruit the best and brightest as soon as they graduate.


Network with local colleges and job placement centers to increase the presence of your business. Student advisers will be more likely to send recruits your way.

, Before you write a job description, look at your company's current needs for employment. Decide what features you believe are most important to the job and the criteria that an applicant should meet.


You should include position titles, salary, time requirements, job duties, required education or credentials, and any other requirements or requests that an ideal candidate should have. This will help you present a clear vision to potential candidates.
You can also list criteria that would be a plus but that is not required. This will help outline your dream candidate but will not limit the applicant pool too much.Make sure to talk to those that will be working with the new recruit and ask them what they require. This will ensure a better placement for the new staff and keep your current staff happier.

, Think about where you believe your ideal candidate would spend time, both in person and online, and advertise your company and job vacancy in those places.


Advertise the job opening with professional organizations and online communities that pertain to your business. This will increase the number of qualified candidates that see your listing.
Think of businesses that an applicant with your intended skill set might frequent and put up a billboard nearby. You can also use skill-based language on the sign that will attract the necessary applicants.Purchase ad space that will appear when certain keywords are searched in online search engines. This will ensure that people that have the skill set you need will see your ads., Use job search sites to recruit staff by posting the job description and checking it often. You should also post on a regular basis. Many job seekers only search new postings that are less than a week old to save time. Posting more than once will make sure your posting gets read.

, The new employee that you're looking for may not frequent the traditional places that job advertisements are posted. You may also be able to attract candidates that are currently employed but that might want a promotion or are looking to change up their current employment.


Post in the sports or local news section of the newspaper. A job advertisement is more likely to be seen if it isn't lost among the crowd of other help wanted ads.Place flyers in places that are frequented by the most residents in the areas you are looking for possible employees. Gyms, recreation clubs, and libraries are visited by large groups of people on a regular basis and usually have posting boards for advertisements. Posting in these type areas will expand the reach of your job advertisements., In the modern technology age, social media platforms are more popular than ever and are visited by thousands of people on a daily basis. This option is both far reaching and cost effective for both applicants and employers. You can also add company information, link to the company website, upload business logos, and link to the application for no extra charge.Possible online venues are Facebook, Twitter, LinkIn, and MyCareer.

, Others in your industry will likely have recommendations for potential recruits. Ask around to colleagues whose opinions you trust for any recommendations of people that might fit the job requirements. You may also want to contact former employees that might know qualified candidates since they would be familiar with your company., Offer your current employees as well as third parties such as suppliers, customers, or the general public a small fee if you end up hiring someone they referred. There will be even more people searching for qualified candidates aside from those charged with hiring the new applicant.For current employees, you may can offer non-monetary rewards and instead give them company perks. These can be anything from a better parking space for a year to additional days off., Send your current employees out with recruitment cards that have the company's website and information on it. If they see someone that they believe will fit the job opening, they can hand them the card to let them know about your company and the job opening. This method will bring you applicants from places that normal job advertisements may not reach and give you a larger and more diverse pool of applicants., Enhance any perks or benefits to the job when recruiting, including health insurance, vacation options, investment and stock opportunities, employee discounts, performance bonuses, and pay raise options. Making the job look as good as possible will increase the enthusiasm of candidates.

, New hires that are fielding offers from more than one company will go where the money is, so offer slightly above the average pay for the position. You can also state that you are willing to negotiate. Not every company is, so this will add to your appeal.

, Improving diversity when you recruit staff will enhance your business and give you more opportunities to find great new staff. You should open the job to a wide variety of candidates, making sure to not distinguish who you hire based on age, race, sexual orientation, religion, gender, or marital status.Avoid putting any modifiers such as ""young"" or using gendered pronouns in your job description that might deter certain groups of people from applying., Once you have received all applications, eliminate those who do not fit the basic qualifications you laid out in your job description. If you have too many applicants at this point, consider the qualifications you listed for the ideal candidate that were not mandatory. This will give you those candidates that stand out above all the others based on their extra skill set.


Make sure you think about how much time you have to interview. You want to make sure the number of applicants you call in for interviews is low enough that you can give adequate attention to them all.
Have multiple people create a shortlist. This will ensure there is no personal bias., Perform phone interviews, in person interviews, and if necessary, followup interviews. This gives you more time with each candidate and will help you to fully understand how they would work within your business.If you are interviewing someone who lives far away or out of state, consider online video interviews. This helps to make sure your applicant reach is as far as possible.

, During each type of interview, make sure you ask pointed and relevant questions to the job you are filling. Ask the same set of core questions, but also tailor some of your questions to each applicant's particular qualifications and experiences.Take this time to ask about possible holes in their experience or qualifications. You can also ask applicants about particular skills that might be above and beyond what you were expecting.

, You want to make sure that your final decision is based off of the applicant's overall qualifications and skill set, not just their personality. While having a person that will fit in with your company's corporate culture is important, if the possible hire cannot adequately perform their new job, then you will soon be back in the same position again., By checking reference, you can find out about the applicants work ethic from past employers. Take the time to call some of the references provided in their resume and ask about work performance, strengths and weaknesses, and reliability. This will give you a better idea of whether the recruit is right for your company.

, It’s important to take your time when making staffing decisions to ensure that you choose the best candidate for the job. Leave a window of opportunity to reflect on potential candidates instead of rushing to make a hasty decision.

Ask your employee to fill out a W-4.,
Obtain a state new hire reporting form.,
Make a spreadsheet.,
Call your state's employment department for assistance.",How to Report New Employees to Your State's New Hire Reporting Program," ""Employers"" have to report ""hew hires"" to their state run directory. An ""employer"" under the law includes governmental entities and labor organizations. Basically, if you are required to have an employee fill out a W-4, you are an employer. ""New hires"" are employees that have not previously been hired by you, or employees that were previously employed but have been separated fro at least 60 consecutive days.


You do not need to report any employee that leaves and comes back if that employee was not formally fired or removed from payroll.
Some states will require you to report independent contractors. However, federal law does not require this.;
, Federal law requires that your new hires be reported within 20 days of the ""date of hire."" The date of hire is the day your employee first performs services for wages. While the federal reporting period is 20 days, some state laws require you to report sooner.For example, in Georgia, you are required to make new hire reports within 10 days of hiring the employee., Most states have an online system you can use to report your new hires. If you have access to a computer, you should consider using online resources to make reporting easier. For example, in California, you can register with the Employment Development Department's e-Services for Business. Once you establish a username and password, you will be sent a confirmation email that confirms your identity. Once you verify enrollment you will be able to use the service to file new hire reports. In California, you can report new hire information online using various methods:The File Report of New Employee option allows you to complete the state new hire form (DE 34 in California) online. Using this option, you can enter up to 30 new employees at one time. After selecting this option you will fill out an electronic form and submit it. You will receive a confirmation number as soon as you submit the information.
The Attach a Return File allows you to attach your DE 34 information as a file attachment on the internet. Once you attach the completed DE 34 using the online system, you will submit it and receive confirmation immediately.

, If you do not have access to a computer or do not have the ability to report electronically, every state allows you to report new hire information manually. Whether you gather the information in a W-4, a state report form, or a form you create on your own, you can send the required information to your state's employment department.


For example, in Georgia and California, you can mail or fax your new hire reports to the New Hire Reporting Program or the Employment Development Department respectively., If you do not want to make new hire reports at all, a lot of payroll service companies will offer reporting services. If you use a payroll service provider already, ask if they have the ability to report new hires for you. If they do, they will simply use the information they receive from an employee's W-4 to make the required report., If you are a multi-state employer who has employees working in multiple states, you can submit new hire reports in one of two ways. First, you can make multiple reports to each state the employee is working in. If you choose this option, you will simply make a separate report for each state and submit it using your preferred method.


Second, you can select one state where you will make every report for the multi-state employees. If you choose to report in only one state, your reports must be submitted electronically. In addition, you must notify the federal Secretary of the US Department of Health & Human Services, in writing, of the state you are choosing to report in. You can make this notification electronically by submitting a Multi-state Employer Registration Form online.You can also send it to the Department in the mail., If you do not report new hires in a timely manner your state might impose civil penalties for your noncompliance with the law. Federal law leaves the imposition of penalties up to each individual state. If penalties are assessed, the fine may not exceed $25 per newly hired employee. However, if you conspire with your employee to avoid reporting, you can be fined up to $500 per newly hired employee. Some states might also impose non-monetary penalties as well.For example, in California, you can be assessed a $24 penalty for each new hire you fail to report. If the failure to report is intentional, you can be fined up to $490 for each instance., The information you report is used by the federal and state governments to match the reports with individuals having child support obligations. This helps governments locate individuals, establish child support orders, and enforce existing orders. In addition, the information can be used by state agencies to detect and prevent incorrect benefits payments (e.g., for workers' compensation and/or unemployment benefits). State agencies can also use the information to prevent the improper receipt of benefits such as food stamps, welfare, and Medicaid., Federal law requires you to provide four pieces of information about the newly hired employee. However, each state can have different requirements and may require more information to be reported. Under federal law, you must obtain the employee's name, address, Social Security number, and the employee's date of hire.In Georgia, for example, you must also gather the employee's actual start date, medical insurance availability, and the state of hire., If your employee does not have a Social Security number, they will need to apply for one with the Social Security Administration. If you have an employee who can not fulfill the Social Security number requirement, you should have them fill out federal Form SS-5, which is an application for a Social Security card. The service is free.Once the form is filled out and submitted by the employee, you will be able to move forward with your reporting obligations.

, Federal law also requires you to submit three pieces of information in each new hire report. Some states may require you to submit more. Under federal law, your new hire report must contain your name, address, and Federal Employment Identification Number (FEIN).In California, for example, you must also report your business name, phone number, and your California employer account number., Some states give you the option of reporting additional information that can be used to help state and federal agencies implement the purpose of the law. If you are willing and able, you should report optional information as well. For example, in Georgia, you have the choice of reporting the employee's monthly salary, information regarding whether you provide and offer multiple medical insurances., You can collect the required information almost any way you want. One of the most efficient ways to do so is to make a copy of each new employee's W-4. The W-4 tax form will usually include all the required information you need and it is a form the employee is required to fill out irrespective of your reporting obligations. Once you obtain a copy of your employee's W-4, you will simply report the information found there. You can even send the entire W-4 and comply with your reporting requirements.


If you are using W-4s to report, make sure you put your FEIN and address at the top of each W-4.
Additionally, make sure all of the information on the W-4 is legible., Most states have created specific new hire reporting forms you can use to gather the required information from new employees. If you want to use your state's new hire reporting form, you will need to visit the appropriate government website and download a copy. Give a blank form to each new employee and ask them to fill it out. If you do not want to burden your new employee, you can fill the form out yourself using information gathered on W-4s.For example, in Georgia, you would use the Georgia New Hire Reporting Form.In California, you would use Form DE 34., If you are unable to use state and federally offered forms, you can even create your own spreadsheet to collect the required information. In Georgia, for example, you can make a spreadsheet so long as it includes all the required information and is created with at least 10-point font. Your address should be displayed at the top of the spreadsheet., If you need help reporting new employees to your state's new hire reporting program, call your state agency for help. Every state has a phone number you can call. For example, in California, you can call the New Employee Registry Hotline."

Check your dental insurance policy.,
Ask your primary healthcare provider.,
Ask family, friends, and neighbors.,
Look at internet reviews.,
Consider the convenience factor.,
Look for dentists that meet your needs.,
Pay attention to your dentist’s availability.,
Note if the appointment was easy and convenient to attend.,
Look at cleanliness.,
Ask about their ability to treat emergencies.,
Think about bedside manner.",How to Find a Good Dentist," Your insurance company may have a list of approved healthcare providers. If so, this will make your search for a good dentist easier because you won't have as many offices to choose from. If your community is small enough, you might only have one or two options., Doctors are a good place to start a search for a good dentist. They will likely have had numerous patients who have attended each dentist in the area, and may have heard about their experiences. They may also be aware of the area dentists’ reputations in the medical community.

, If you move to a new place, it is a good idea to ask a few neighbors which dentist they see. Your family and friends also have a dentist that they rely on, so they will be able to make a recommendation. This is the best way to get an honest review of a dentist, since you know whether they have any bias.


For example, your cousin may be a dental hygienist or dentist with their own practice. Unlike anonymous reviews, you will at least know their bias.

, This may not be the most 100% reliable source, since there are many internet reviews with ulterior motives; however, you may be able to get a wider range of reviews. Though there may be overwhelming good and negative reviews, look at the median experience. Since there are two sides to every story, try not to discount a dentist based on one or two bad internet reviews alone.


Take all internet reviews with a grain of salt, and pay attention to what the complaints are about rather than the aggregate score. Don't put much stock in complaints about drawbacks of getting to the office or the inconvenience of having to see a dentist — complaints that may apply to all offices; however, if most reviews are complaining about something specific, such as consistently waiting significantly past their appointment time to be seen, take the information into consideration.

, Plug the address of the dentist into map software and see how long it will take you to get there. Look at how close it is to your work or your children’s schools to see if it is convenient to travel to the office after or before work or school. Good dental care is important, but if you have no more important ways to make your decision, there is nothing wrong with choosing based on convenience.

, You may only need a general care dentist; however, it is helpful to know the classifications. You can save yourself the time of researching a practice if you know they don’t do basic tooth cleanings.Look for a private clinic with an experienced staff. Someone who targets a variety of specialities will also be helpful if you develop more complicated issues down the road.


Endodontics: these practices perform special procedures involving root canals, cracked teeth, and more.
Orthodontics: these practices are concerned with misaligned teeth. They fit you with braces, and generally don’t do basic tooth cleanings.
Pediatric dentistry: your children will need someone who is qualified in pediatrics. Ask the practice if they clean children’s teeth as well as adults.
Periodontics: this is a branch of dentistry that treats special conditions in the gums and jaw. They will deal with loose teeth that might need to be extracted.
Prosthodontics: these practices specialize in creating prosthetic teeth and other parts of your mouth., Was it easy to make an appointment? Were there different openings to choose from? When you got to the office, did you have to wait a long time after your time slot? Sometimes, going to a good dentist means sacrificing some of your time; however, if you have the option, go with the dentist you had the easiest time accessing., Plugging the address of the dentist into a map is one thing, but getting there in practice may be another. Were there dangerous roads or intersections? Could you find parking? If it is stressful getting to your dentist’s office, you will be more likely to delay or cancel appointments.


For people who take public transit to their dentist, this is an especially important step. Knowing additional costs and hassles of transportation are factors you need to consider.
Your dentist should try to cover as many issues as possible in one session. Notice if you have to return multiple times for things that could have been done in one visit.

, It is ok to glance around and make sure that the instruments and facility seem clean. After all, this is a medical office that needs to be sanitary. Since dentists are often operating in mouths that may have open cuts or sores, reducing the risk of infection means looking for clean conditions.

, While it may not be a reason to choose a different dentist for basic tooth cleanings, knowing whether they can treat you in emergencies is important. If not, ask them who they would recommend for emergency tooth operations. Preparing for that possibility now will make it much less stressful if the time comes that you need to visit an emergency dental clinic.

, Was the staff courteous and easy to deal with? Was the dentist friendly and careful? Dreading having to deal with unpleasant personnel may be another source of resistance to attending or scheduling dental appointments. Make sure you enjoy or at least can tolerate your dentist and his or her staff.

Recruit from within the company.,
Encourage employee referrals.,
Utilize your business contacts.,
Make your company and the job sound as attractive as possible.,
Build a candidate pool.,
Use social networking sites.",How to Recruit Employees1," One of the best ways to find a good fit for a new position is to consider the loyal staff that already surrounds you. Who as already put in the time required to learn company policies and earn people's trust? You'll save a lot of time if you don't have to risk hiring an outsider to fill a position. Think hard about whether someone you're working with would be right for the role, then encourage them to apply.


Create a list with the help of other department leaders or administrators of the most important qualities to look for when you recruit successful staff. Discuss elements like attention to detail, experience, education level and flexibility. Your fellow managers can provide input about the qualities that will make an employee most successful and recommend someone else in the company who might be right for the job.;
, Letting employees at your company know that you're hiring is an excellent way to recruit new candidates. You'll get referrals from people who know the company in and out, and can recommend people who will be a close fit for the job. Employees wouldn't stake their reputation on unqualified candidates, so you're sure to get some keepers if you go this route.


Employees in related positions will have connections to good candidates within the industry and be able to refer friends or colleagues that will meet the job's requirements that are looking for a new job.
Send staff an email that includes the job description and ask them to pass it along to people they know who are qualified.
Offering incentives for employee referrals can encourage people to take your hunt for the perfect candidate seriously., Sometimes a new opening is best filled by someone from outside the company who can start with a completely fresh slate. You can still use your contacts to recruit, rather than asking for applications from complete strangers. Call up people you've worked with over the years who know you and understand what you look for in an employee. Ask them whether they have suggestions as to who might be a good candidate for the position.


You can reach out to colleagues and business contacts for referrals or positive and negative reviews when you're recruiting employees.
Colleagues in the industry can also advise you about a particular website or trade show that's good for finding successful employees.

, Scouting out great employees is one thing, but you'll need to attract the best and brightest by offering a lot in return. Here's how to light up their eyes:


Play up your company culture. Tell them about what a typical day is like at your company, and give details on the company's ""personality."" Talk about how much you enjoy working there.
Offer a competitive salary and benefits. While this isn't always enough to guarantee you'll make the hire, it certainly doesn't hurt.
Make the position sound prestigious and challenging. These two factors are big incentives for bright potential candidates. Job satisfaction comes from feeling respected and having the opportunity to learn new things and excel in the face of obstacles.
Offer things other companies don't. Flex time, for example, is a highly valued benefit that many companies don't offer. Allowing people to work from home and take time off when they need it can set your company apart from the rest.

, Hold interview sessions periodically and retain the information of candidates that meet the requirements to be a successful employee, even if you don't have room for one right away. This will give you a pool of solid candidates to review when you have an open position.


Make your pool wider and deeper by asking the candidates themselves for referrals. When you call someone on a candidate's list of references, ask about the candidate, then delve into questions on the background of the person you're talking to. You might be able to recruit the candidate's old manager.

, Recruit successful employees by utilizing online recruiting resources like LinkedIn, or sites specific to your industry that have profiles of people in the field. Many job seekers use these sites to find jobs that meet their skill sets.


Even if someone you're interested in already has a job, there's no harm in setting up a meeting to get to know the person. You can discuss the job opening and see if they're interested. If they aren't, they might have suggestions as to who else would make a good candidate.

Make a doctor's appointment to discuss your physical therapy needs.,
Ask your doctor for several recommendations about expert physical therapists in your area.,
Call your insurance company.,
Ask the insurance company how to find the physical therapists that are in your network.,
Ask for advice from friends in your area who have used physical therapists.,
Search for online reviews of physical therapists.,
Check that the physical therapist you are interested in using has a registered license.,
Review the physical details of the physical therapy practice.,
Call the practice to inquire about discounts.,
Go to your initial appointment.",How to Find a Physical Therapist," The doctor should have a general view for how long you need physical therapy, how many sessions you should have and for what particular problems. Ask your doctor to write out his opinions on your physical therapy treatment in prescription form.;
, Many physical therapists specialize in things like elder care, joint care, arthritis, chronic pain and heart surgery recovery. Leave your doctor's appointment with 3 to 5 recommended therapists.

, Dial the customer service number on the back of your policy card. Ask the operator to review your physical therapy benefits with you.


Most insurance companies do not allow an unlimited number of physical therapy visits during a calendar year. Most specify coverage of between 10 and 20 after the deductible is met. You may be required to pay for any visits after that number is met.

, If you have an HMO or a PPO, chances are you get different coverage for in-network and out-of-network care. It is a good idea to try to find an in-network therapist that comes highly recommended.


Most insurance companies have a website where you can search for local in-network physical therapists. This is the easiest way to search for physical therapists because you will have a number of options.

, This is especially important if they have been treated for the same problem as you have, because you can hear how they work with patients. Compare these therapists to the list you received from your doctor and the list you have found through your insurance company's website.

, If you have an account on Angie's List, this might be the best place to find reviews, because companies cannot pay to be reviewed on this site. You can also try healthgrades.com, vitals.com, yelp.com or Zocdoc.com.


Make sure to read at least 10 reviews, including ones that are both good and bad. The ratings themselves may not say everything, and you should look for people who are reviewing the therapists based on the same preferences you have.

, Go to healthguideusa.org/physical_therapy_license_lookup.htm to find links to each state's license search engine.

, Ensure that the location and hours are manageable in your condition. In a large metropolitan area, you may want to choose a practice that is a bus ride or short drive away, if you have mobility limitations.

, This is especially important if you do not have insurance, or if your insurance does not cover many physical therapy appointments. Many physical therapists work with athletes and people who do not use insurance, so ask them if they have bulk discounts or discounts for people who cannot afford their regular rates.

, If the physical therapist does not take the time to test your pain levels, range of motion and other abilities, you may want to consider seeking help elsewhere. The initial appointment should leave you feeling comfortable with the physical therapist because they have taken care to review your condition and create a treatment plan.

Write a compelling description of your company.,
Convey the company's personality.,
Define the position you're filling.,
Give application instructions.,
Post the opening to job sites and job boards.,
Try advertising.,
Find the best applicants and start the interview process.",How to Recruit Employees2," Highly qualified employees want to work for a company that is interesting and exciting. The best candidates will pass right over a boring or poorly written job description. Your job description should catch potential employees' attention by presenting a killer description of your company's mission and the vital role you seek to fill.


Write what makes your company special and better than its competitors.
Write about your company's main goal. Make it sound important, whether you aim to save endangered animals or make the very best toothpaste on the market.

, Potential employees are going to want to get a feel for what it would be like to work for you. Air your company's true personality to attract candidates who will be a good fit. The language and content of your description should give readers a sense of what you're all about.


If your company is prestigious and formal, use serious, painstakingly correct language.
If your company is playful and innovative, feel free to use slang or jokes to let people know that having a big personality is part of the job.

, Start by listing the title and the key background requirements, which will hopefully weed out people who are under qualified and prevent them from swamping you with applications. Include detailed information about what the job entails, including general and specific responsibilities.


Make the job sound great, but be honest about the not-so-glamourous aspects of the work. For example, if you're hiring an office manager, you might want candidates to be prepared to run the office at a high level while also being willing to order supplies and keep the office looking nice. People who aren't interested in the less engaging work of being an office manager will know not to apply.
Don't go overboard listing more than 5 or so background, field and educational requirements. If you get too specific, you might weed out great candidates who can quickly pick up on how to do the job even if they haven't had the exact experience you're looking for. A person's work ethic and attitude can be just as important to their success as other skills or qualifications.

, Ask for a resume and cover letter as well as any other materials you might want, like a writing sample. Include your contact information and instructions for how to submit the materials. You might want to specify how you want the documents formatted and whether you prefer they be sent over email, fax, as an attachment, etc.


The way a candidate submits his or her application can be telling. If someone has trouble following basic instructions, you might not want to hire them.

, The benefit of posting your opening in public spaces is that you're sure to get a ton of applicants. The drawback is that you're sure to get a ton of applicants. You'll have a lot of resumes to sift through no matter what, so choose where you post the job opening wisely. Target job sites that draw people who are likely to be qualified for the position, rather than posting randomly in places that will be viewed by people who aren't qualified.Post the opening on your company website, on a page labeled ""Careers"" or ""Jobs."" This will draw applicants who actually took the time to check out your company, rather than stumbling on a posting in a public forum.
Post the opening in industry forums and relevant job sites. For example, if you're in the film industry, post the job opening on industry sites that will be frequently viewed by people who are already in the know.
Post the opening on general job sites if you want a lot of applicants. If you're hoping to get as many applications as possible, post on Craigslist, Monster.com and similar massive job sites. Beware that you'll be likely to get some spammy replies.

, Big companies might take out advertisements in trade magazines or websites to attract candidates in a bold, flashy way. In fact, advertising jobs on billboards is becoming trendy among the most competitive companies., When the applications start pouring in, it's time to hire the best person for the job. Look for applications from candidates that demonstrate the experience, skills, and personality you're seeking, and select a manageable number of people to interview. From there you'll be able to make a well-informed decision about who to hire for the position.


If you find your posting isn't recruiting the right kind of people for the job, go back and tweak it.
Be patient and go through as many application and interviews as necessary to find someone you're confident will do a good job. It's easy to get overwhelmed during the hiring process, but your hard work will pay off in the end.

There are paid services that will help you find an online doctor like healthtap.com, livehealthonline.com, and virtualdoctors.org.;
, The telemedicine industry includes a wide range of unique terms you may not be familiar with. Make sure you use your preferred search engine to research any terms you aren’t familiar with.


The California Telemedicine & eHealth Center offers an extensive telemedicine glossary you may find helpful., Some online doctor services only require a one-time fee for a consultation while others require or offer a long-term subscription. Make sure you read the terms of service closely and look for terms like “monthly charge” or “annual charge.” You can also contact the doctor or company’s customer service department to ask them directly.

, Many online doctor consultations won’t be covered by standard health insurance policies. Make sure to contact your insurance provider if you consider the consultation a medical necessity rather than elective.


Some newer insurance policies will actually incentivize or require telemedicine diagnosis for minor conditions as a way of saving money.Again, make sure to discuss these options thoroughly with your provider.

, Doctors require board certifications that are managed by the government. Many illegitimate medical professionals will pose as credentialed doctors or will practice a form of medicine that is outside of their credentialed area, so make sure you check for yourself.

, There are many free online resources you can use to review doctors. Make sure to choose multiple sources and read as many reviews as possible to get a large sample.


Web resources like WebMD, ZocDocs, Yelp, Google Reviews and Angie’s List offer patient-written reviews. Because you yourself are a patient and lack expert medical knowledge, it’s a good idea to learn what others have experienced in similar situations., While patient reviews are very helpful, you should also consult professional, independent review sources that can confirm the veracity of the doctor’s practice. As with patient reviews, the more sources you read the better.


Sources like Healthgrades, BetterDoctor and RateMDs will offer verified reviews as well as more specific information you can’t find in patient reviews such as pricing information and statistics on medical outcomes.There are some criticisms of review sites to be aware of. Some are paid by medical organizations or specific doctors that could compromise their objectivity. Some are compromised by fake reviews written by the doctors themselves.Do your research on the site as well as the doctor. Reviews are legally required to disclose business relationships with the organizations they review so look for the words “Sponsored by.”

, Doctors are used to patients asking a lot of questions so don’t feel any need to hold back. Telemedicine practices or internet doctors often have special hotlines or chatrooms/forums set up for this purpose.


Consider asking something like “How do you diagnose patients over the internet?”

, Alternative medicine is a broad term that can apply to many different therapeutic approaches, some of which are legitimate. However, the term is also broadly used to cover forms of medicine that haven’t been scientifically proven or have questionable science behind them. Because alternative medicine practitioners are not always sanctioned, they often flourish on the unregulated space of the internet.Therapeutic solutions that are based solely on nutritional choice or herbal remedies are likely not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating serious medical conditions.You don’t necessarily have to dismiss alternative medicine options out of hand. Some do have proven medical value or, at least, very little risk. Independent research is the key., Look out for terms like “detoxify,” “nerve energy,” “bring your body in harmony with nature,” or “balance your body’s chemistry.” These terms are often used to skirt laws governing legitimate medicine because they have no actual meaning in the medical world., As mentioned above, patient reviews can be valuable for learning about doctors but are less so concerning the actual therapeutic methods. Many single episodes of a disease recover for a variety of reasons that may have little or nothing to do with the treatment offered.Ultimately, patients are not experts and may not know enough to give sufficient advice so take testimonials with a grain of salt.

, Many unconventional practitioners will claim that the medical profession as a whole, drug companies and the government are conspiring to suppress whatever methods they are espousing. This is a definite red flag of quackery."

Evaluate the potential employee's work capacity.,
Look at the competitive landscape.,
Determine your company's profit goals.,
Watch out for the signs that you need to hire someone.,
Take note if your employees are consistently doing long hours at work.,
Consider whether your email inflow has been out of control.,
Think about whether you've been receiving increased complaints from over-worked employees.,
Look for frequent occurrences of missed deadlines and meetings.,
Take note if routine work is not organized or streamlined.,
Consider whether your company is growing and expanding.,
Think about whether your business would benefit from hiring employees with specific skills.",How to Know when to Hire Additional Employees," Calculating the capacity at which the new employee would operate will help you to figure out whether to hire a new employee or not. You should only consider hiring a new employee if you can ensure they will be working at 60 to 80 percent of their potential capacity.


If someone you hire will be operating at below 60 percent capacity, then it’s not a worthwhile investment decision over the long-term.






In scenarios where additional help is still needed, despite the fact that your permanent employee is not fully occupied, consider hiring a temporary worker or a contractor.





;
, Since a fierce competition for talent exists in today’s job market, certain industries never turn down the opportunity to hire skilled workers.


For example, companies in the manufacturing sector don’t take the risk of losing out on a skilled worker to their competitor, regardless of whether they currently have enough work for that person or not.
In many rapidly moving industries, such as telecommunications, ongoing hiring occurs. Other fast growing industries include: beverage manufacturing, software development, support services for mining, oil, seed and grain farming and many others.
These industries all require a consistent supply of additional employees to meet business demands.

, You need to see whether the cost of hiring additional workers eats into your profits or not.


Hiring additional workers at the right level of productivity matters, therefore, based on the unique conditions of your business, you should calculate the gross-profit-per-labor-dollar-spent. This calculation should be done for both low-wage and higher-wage workers.
Simply put, you should generate a return on an employee’s salary in sales within a pre-defined time period.

, A lot of employers are unwilling to admit there is a need to hire additional employees until things are visibly out of control. However, there are certain signs you need to watch out which indicate that additional hiring is necessary.

, If your employees are consistently spending additional time at work beyond the normal working hours, which is solely spent on official tasks, you should consider taking someone else on to lighten the workload..


Being devoted to your job is fine, but if your staff hasn’t taken time off to go on vacation for almost a year, it signals additional employees should be hired.







, When your inbox is flooded with not spam but legitimate emails, this is a sure sign that your response rate to emails not quite what it should be.


If almost 25% of your daily working hours are spent responding to emails, you are most likely behind on meetings and other important responsibilities.
Since most people expect a response to their email within 48 hours, you should hire a part-time employee to answer your emails to free up time for important tasks.

, If your staff is overwhelmed with work and they feel a burnout situation, many are likely to quit their job in the long run. Such a stressful environment will not allow employees to be as productive as required.


If your staff is underpaid and overworked, it's your responsibility as an employer to ease their burden and hire additional employees.






If hiring permanent employees is not an option, consider engaging contract employees who can get work done at a low cost.







, It is a big indicator that now is the time to hire additional employees if you are consistently missing deadlines and important meetings.


Missed deadlines or meetings not only put a question mark on your performance, but also give a bad impression to prospective clients who may ultimately lose confidence in your ability to meet their expectations.
In this scenario, additional employees can help you to manage your schedule so you can competently handle significant business matters.







, When much of your work day is spent in a chaotic and fire-fighting mode, your routine tasks need reconsideration. When you see work getting piled up despite your efforts to keep it as organized as possible, it signals you need to hire additional employees.


Most companies fail to recognize this need until they are audited by an external body and panic mode sets in to find the required documents or emails.
You can easily hire a part-time employee or an intern to organize your documents and carry out other time-consuming but menial administrative tasks.







, If your company is performing well and acquiring new business accounts or many small projects, there is a need to expand your working staff.


In order to meet client requirements, it is advisable to hire enough staff so you can offer the desired service level without any dip in quality standards.
When you start offering new services or add new locations to your business portfolio and your current staff cannot carry additional workload, you should consider hiring either temporary or permanent employees or a mix of both employee groups.

, As your business grows, you may temporarily rotate current employees, but they may not possess the skills required by the new project.


In such a situation, you cannot compromise on meeting client requirements - you have to show both efficiency and effectiveness.
Hiring additional staff becomes a need, especially if the new account runs on technology not available in your company. This translates to hiring technology experts to train staff and new employees who can operate the new technology to achieve business goals.

Establish what you need in a candidate.,
Write out your questions.,
Do your homework.,
Dress appropriately.,
Be polite, friendly, and sincere.,
Establish common ground.,
State why you brought her in.,
Provide an introduction to the company.,
Begin with an easy question.,
Ask the interviewee about herself.,
Listen well.,
Gauge your questions by her answers.",How to Open an Interview," Before starting interviews, you need to be clear about what you need in a candidate. You probably already have a list of qualifications. However, think about what other needs the company has. Maybe the company needs a real people-person or maybe you need someone who's very detail oriented. Having a clear vision will help focus the interview., Once you've established what you need, you can use that criteria to guide your questions. You'll need at least a couple of questions for each of the requirements you have for your candidate, though you may need as many as seven or eight questions for an important requirement.It's best to have one or two questions for each requirement that ask about the person's skills (positive questions). Then you need at least one question that asks how the candidate dealt with an issue in that area (negative questions).Try different kinds of questions. Sometimes, you want to just ask about the facts, such as ""How many years of experience do you have in this field?"" However, you can also ask hypothetical questions, which gives the candidate a chance to say how she would react in a certain situation, such as ""What would be your reaction if a customer got in your face and started yelling?"" Another type of question is a confrontational question, which puts the candidate intentionally on the spot, such as ""Why would you be a good candidate for this job? You don't even have a college degree."" The point of this type of question is to gauge a candidate's reaction to stress. Finally, you can also ask for examples of how the candidate acted in the past, such as ""Talk about a time you successfully headed up a project. Why did it go well?""Have extra questions on hand. Interviews can cause people to go blank, so it's courteous to have other questions the person can answer., That is, thoroughly read every resume well in advance of the interview. Look at it as a whole, and see where the candidate shines and where she doesn't. Also, take some time to find her on the internet.Doing so will mean you are at least somewhat acquainted with the candidate before she walks in the room. That way, you can ask better questions, and the interview will flow better, putting both of you at ease., You are representing the company, so you want to look your best. Essentially, the interviewee will be making a judgment about your company based on how you present yourself. Wear professional clothing that fits in with your company's culture., You show that you respect the candidate by being polite and open. Smile at her, and try to make her comfortable up front. Also, by establishing early on that you generally want to know more about her, you're likely to get more relevant information out of her.For instance, start by saying how delighted you are to meet the candidate with a smile and a handshake., Fortunately, you've already done your research, so you can do this step easily. For instance, find something you both like. If you both love the beach, try casually bringing it up.You don't need to let her know what you already know about her. Rather, say something along the lines of, ""It's such beautiful weather. I'd love to get to the beach this weekend.""
Don't be afraid of a little small talk. Take sometime to ask about the person's day or make a small joke about the hot weather., Upfront, show that you are genuinely interested in her as a candidate. Begin by talking about why you brought her in.For instance, you could say, ""I was really interested in the fact that you had attended a workshop on grant writing, and that's one of the reasons we brought you in.As an added bonus, you can use this time to offer her a compliment.

, Give some basic information about the job, such as the duties and the hours the employee will be expected to work. Offer a salary range if you are allowed to do that upfront. Also, provide some background information on the company. You don't want to overwhelm the interviewee, but you do want to take a few minutes to provide some basic information., You can try something like, ""Where did you go to school?"" Basically, you want to give the person something easy to help break the ice and ease off the tension.You could also ask other small questions about how the interviewee got there, such as ""Did you have trouble finding us?"" or ""Have you been here before?"", This question is one of the most basic. It's open-ended for a reason; it gives the interviewee a chance to highlight key aspects of her skills and background. It also gives you a chance to assess how concise the candidate can be.You can phrase this question several ways, even as a statement. For instance, you could say ""Tell me more about yourself,"" ""Why did you apply for this job?"" or ""What do you think makes you a good candidate for this role?""

, The interviewee can tell if you're not actually listening, and if she notices that you aren't, she's likely to get more nervous or stumble over her words. In addition, if you don't jump in as soon as she's spoken a few words, you give her a chance to think through her answer and provide added details.For instance, if she notes that she has a background in art, ask her how that could help her in this position.
Additionally, be sure to look at her when she's speaking. It's fine to jot down the occasional note, but try not to be writing the whole time.

, As you go along, don't be afraid to change your tactics a bit based on how she answers your question. For instance, you may need to ask for clarification, tweak a question a bit, or ask for more information overall.


For instance, maybe she already mentioned that she's had several jobs in your field and listed how they're relevant, which means you can delete any question that comes later about that topic.
If she says she pays attention to detail and you were planning on asking her how her skills fit the job, you could tweak the question a little by saying, ""I heard you say you are detail-oriented. How do you think that will help you in this position?""

Schedule your first appointment.",How to Find a Primary Care Physician," If you have insurance, whether self-provided or through an employer, your first step should be to check with your provider to see what doctors are in-network. Call and ask for a list of doctors in your area or go online and use your provider’s tool to see what doctors are available to you.In-network physicians are those who actively work with your insurance company to offer you special negotiated rates. These physicians generally charge less and cover more than out-of-network physicians.
Often, when seeing an in-network primary care physician, you will only have to pay a copay, typically between $20 and $40, for a general visit. Check your plan details to see how much your copay for each visit will be.;
, Doctor’s offices tend to have dynamic relationships with insurance companies, so it is beneficial to call their office and confirm your coverage. Give the office or clinic a call, and ask to speak with a billing specialist about accepted insurance.Ask the clinic, “Do you accept this plan?” Be sure to give them not only your insurance provider, but your specific plan, as they may accept some but not all plans from your provider.
Plan details can be found online, on your insurance card, or by calling your insurance provider.

, If you get your insurance through a school or employer, chances are that many of the people around you will have the same coverage. Ask friends or coworkers that you trust for recommendations for a good primary care physician in your network.Let your friend or coworker know, “I’m looking for a new doctor that is covered by our insurance plan. Do you have a primary care doctor that you like?”

, If you have a reason for going to a doctor out of network, such as traveling outside of your network area, contact your insurance company and ask them about doctors in the area. There may be out of network professionals that still takes your insurance so you aren't left with the total bill.Let your insurance company know about your reason for going out of network. There may be additional details in your policy that could help defray some of your expense.

, The American Board of Medical Specialties certifies doctors who have completed medical school, residency requirements, licensing by a state medical board, and passed ABMS exams. Check online at CertificationMatters.org to see if a potential physician is certified.Board certified physicians are also expected to go through continued education and training, ensuring that they stay up-to-date on new standards and best practices.

, Typically, a general practitioner serves as a primary care physician, but internal medicine doctors are also often able to provide primary care. If you require a certain type of special care for a particular disease or part of your body, check with local medical groups and hospitals to see if there is an internist there with whom you can work.Internists typically specialize in a particular part of the body, such as the heart or kidneys, or in treating a certain type of medical complication, such as diabetes care.
Internists are not surgeons. Instead, they work on diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions and complications through standard medical practices.
Pediatricians are specialists who work with children. If you are looking for a primary care physician for a child under the age of 14-16, a pediatrician is often the best choice.

, Reviews and client testimonial are a helpful tool to gauge a doctor’s bedside manner. Look online at review sites as well as specialty sites like ZocDoc and HealthGrades to see what others have to say about their experience with a physician.Keep in mind that people are more likely to review what they consider to be negative experiences. Take comments like, “they kept me waiting past my appointment time,” lightly and instead look for indicators of malpractice or poor treatment of patients.If you know anyone who has been to a physician personally, ask them about their experience. Let them know, “I’m thinking about seeing a new primary care physician. What has your experience been like with this doctor?”

, Once you’ve found a couple doctors you think you may want to work with, take a look into their backgrounds to help you pick the best doctor. Take a look at factors like where they went to medical school, how long they have been practicing, how close they are to your home or office, and whether they have extended or weekend hours.If English is not your first language, check to see if the doctor speaks any other languages. Working with a doctor in your first language can help make things more comfortable and easy for you as a patient.
Most of this type of background information can be found by checking online on the hospital or clinic’s website, or by calling the doctor’s office directly.

, Before you can set an appointment, you need to make sure your intended physician is accepting new patients. Call their office and ask, “Is your practice accepting new patients at this time?”If the doctor is not accepting new patients at this moment, you may be able to ask their office for recommendations for similar physicians in the area.

, Call your previous doctor’s office and ask them to transfer your medical records to your new doctor. You may be able to request the records be sent directly to you through a patient portal, or you may have to ask your previous doctor’s office to send them directly to your new physician.Be sure to request that your previous physician include lab results and records for any recent MRIs, x-rays, and hospital visits.
Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, your doctor must comply with a request to provide you with copies of your medical records. If your doctor will not forward your records onto your new physician, go to their office and request your records directly., Once you have chosen a new primary care physician, schedule an appointment for a general visit. This will give you the chance to get to know your new doctor, and it will help your doctor become familiar with your medical records and expectations.If you have any specific questions regarding the doctor’s practice or your care options, have them ready to ask during the appointment.
Let your doctor know about any recent or ongoing conditions for which you have been treated, as well as any medications that you are currently taking.
After the appointment, check in with yourself and evaluate how you feel. Do not continue seeing a doctor if they made you feel uncomfortable or unwelcome in their practice.

Search in the same manner you use to find a doctor.,
Search on commercial web portals.,
Look around in practically any healthcare setting.,
Recognize the benefits of PA-provided care.",How to Find a Physician Assistant1," In the U.S., you are probably a member of a particular “health system” based upon the particulars of your health insurance plan. Health care system websites typically have “find a doctor” search pages, and many of these permit you to search for physician assistants as well.


For example, on this health system website, you simply check a dialog box on the search page if you want to include PAs (as well as registered nurses ) in your physician search.;
, In addition to health system websites, there are for-profit sites that list (and often grade) medical providers, including PAs, based upon your selected location and/or other preferences. Enter the metro area in which you want to find a PA, and a long list will likely appear before you.Don’t ignore the PA ratings on such sites, but take them with a grain of salt. It is often difficult to pin down the exact criteria by which such ratings are determined. Use them as a starting point, but not the only determining factor.

, You might think of physician assistants working in primary care physician offices, but PAs can also be found pretty much anywhere else you might find a physician, performing many of the same services. You’ll find them in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, schools and colleges, military and government settings, and elsewhere.In all 50 U.S. states, PAs are authorized to take medical histories, conduct exams, diagnose and treat illnesses, order and interpret tests, develop treatment plans, counsel on preventative care, assist in surgeries, write prescriptions, and make hospital rounds.

, Some people may worry that they are somehow getting “second rate” medical care by seeing a PA instead of a physician. However, surveys and studies indicate that PAs provide a similar quality of care and produce similar patient outcomes, while achieving the same degree of patient satisfaction. And remember, PAs always work in collaboration with (and under the guidance of) a physician.PAs help to reduce costs, increase service availability, and decrease waiting times, all while providing comparably effective care. Some patients in fact find it easier to feel at ease and make a personal connection with a PA as opposed to a medical doctor. Once you find the right PA, you can feel confident that you are getting high-quality general medical care.

Check the job board on the AAPA website.,
Search other PA-specific and general job websites.,
Contact a well-regarded PA training program.,
Recognize how PAs fit into a collaborative medical team.",How to Find a Physician Assistant2," The American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) is the largest national professional society for PAs in the U.S. The AAPA maintains a “job link” website that helps bring PA job-seekers and employers together. You can search posted job openings as well as uploaded PA resumes.According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, PA jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 38% between 2012 and 2022, so there should be no shortage of job openings and an increasing number of freshly-minted PAs for the foreseeable future., Regular job websites can be used to locate PAs seeking employment, but there are also sites that focus largely or even exclusively on physician assistants.Search widely across multiple platforms to increase your odds of finding the right person for the position.


Since the demand for PAs is generally greater than the supply, you may need to work a bit harder to find the right person. Taking the time to conduct thorough searches is likely to pay off for you.

, When you’re looking to hire a physician assistant, sometimes it’s easiest to go right to the source and recruit PAs who have just or are just finishing their programs. There has been a significant increase in the number of PA programs in recent years in order to meet the rising demand for PAs, so ask people “in the know” which ones tend to produce the best-prepared graduates.


For reference, How to Become a Physician Assistant provides a rundown of the educational and training process for PAs. Briefly put, PAs (in the U.S.) generally obtain a bachelor’s degree, then complete a three year PA program, then must pass the PANCE exam for certification and get licensed by the state in which they practice.

, The concept of physician assistants was developed at Duke University in the U.S. in the 1960s to deal with the primary care physician shortage that was already underway (and has only grown more severe since). It was modeled after the fast-track doctor training used by the U.S. military during World War Two, and is focused on providing general medical training that is ideal for preventative care services.State laws in the U.S. require that PAs work under the “supervision” of physicians, but in practical terms this usually means that the supervising physician must be available for consultation by phone. Ideally, PAs operate as part of a collaborative team with physicians and other care providers.
Essentially, PAs have the skills to provide care relatively autonomously, but are trained to function best within a collaborative care system — which is becoming increasingly critical to modern healthcare provision."

, Depression, anxiety, and phobias are all medical problems.Addiction is also, at its root, a medical problem.Try comparing therapy to seeing a doctor for any other medical condition. Ask your loved one, ""You wouldn't avoid seeing a doctor for a heart or lung problem, right? So how is this any different?""

, According to recent studies, 27% of adults in America have sought and received some type of treatment for mental health-related issues. That's more than one in four, on average, or about 80 million people.Try saying something like, ""I'm here for you, no matter what. I would not think any less of you for needing to get help.""

Try opening the conversation by admitting to some of your own fears and worries. This might make the dialogue feel like more of a conversation about fear and therapy, rather than a command to get help.
If you have any other friends who have had success with therapy, consider citing that person as an example of how effective therapy can be.
You can also ask your friend who has been through therapy to discuss their experiences with your loved on to help pacify their fears and to answer questions.

, Logic and reason are the only things that will successfully dismantle fear and negative thinking.If your loved one is afraid that therapy becomes a never-ending cycle, let her know that this is not the case. Most cognitive behavioral therapy sessions span the course of 10-20 sessions, though some may go on for longer or shorter time periods.Some psychotherapy sessions can span the course of 1-2 years, depending on the issues being addressed, though some patients feel better after just one session.And remember, your loved one can always decide that she has been to enough sessions. There is no locked-in agreement.
If your loved one is afraid of the cost of therapy, help her look for therapists that take insurance or work for reduced fees.
No matter what your friend or loved one is afraid of, try to alleviate each concern by telling her, ""That won't be a problem"" and offering some kind of solution or course of action.
Some therapists offer a free consultation over the phone before committing to an appointment. This might provide your loved one with an opportunity to ask questions about their fears, and to also begin the process of getting to know the therapist.

, Finding a therapist to meet your loved one's needs can be easily done online. The American Psychological Association offers a free psychologist-locator service at http://locator.apa.org/.

, You probably won't be able to join her during the session, but having someone there to support her might make the transition into therapy a little easier. Some therapists may even allow you to join the session, with your loved one's consent, of course."

Ask your loved one what about vulnerability she finds frightening.,
Remind your loved one about the potential outcome.",How to Encourage Someone to See a Therapist3," What your loved one says in therapy is generally protected and kept private.Remember that these laws differ by state and by country, but all therapists are required to disclose the details of confidentiality verbally and in writing. You can ask for a copy of their informed consent agreement prior to making the appointment.

, Remind your loved one that it can be very relieving to cry or to talk about a problem with someone else. According to recent surveys, nearly 89% of people feel somewhat better after having an emotional release like crying,and doctors widely recommend talking about problems as a means of finding relief.Try telling your friend or loved one, ""It's okay to open yourself up to someone. It's what we do to friends and significant others. You need to build a relationship with a therapist, and open honesty is the only way to do that.""
Remind your loved one that it can be scary dealing with feelings, especially if they have been suppressing them, but that therapists are trained to help clients process and deal with strong feelings in a way that is safe and to prevent being overwhelmed.

, The worst thing that could happen from going to therapy is that nothing will change. But the best-case scenario is that your loved one will find comfort, relief, and a new perspective on life.


Reiterate to your friend or loved one once again that you care about her and are there for her, no matter what happens.
Encourage your loved one to be open and honest with their therapist and explain to their therapist what is not working. The therapist may have a different approach to try or may help your loved one find a therapist who is be better suited to help them.

There may be oral pathologists in your area that are not featured here.

, Oral pathologists are often dentists who wanted to continue their studies or specialize their expertise. You can check their licenses and formal specializations by contacting the dental board in your state. Each state has their own website that will allow you to search an oral pathologist’s name and ensure that they are licensed., Since oral pathologists rarely have their own practices and often see a patient briefly to conduct tests, they are less often reviewed than some other healthcare professionals. However, it can still be worth searching for reviews of an oral pathologist on websites like Google and Yelp.

Don’t ever take an online review for granted. For instance, good or bad reviews that do not provide a specific reason for their review are less trustworthy than reviews that explain their reasoning.

, Your physician, chiropractor, psychologist, dentist, or other medical professional may be able to recommend a qualified hypnotherapist. They will also be working with some knowledge of your medical history that may aid them in recommending a hypnotherapist who specializes in your condition.

, The General Hypnotherapy Registerand the American Society of Clinical Hypnosisare good places to start a search.


Visit a half dozen or so websites. A hypnotherapists personal website can give you a good idea of what they are like, whether or not they specialize in anything in particular, and provide some insight into their methods and background. Check to see if they have testimony from previous patients.
Make sure the site lists the hypnotherapists credentials.

, If you have insurance which covers mental health you can call them directly and ask for physicians or other medical personal in your network that practice hypnosis.


You may also be able to access this information on your insurance companies website.
Call your state psychological association or state counseling association and ask for the names of licensed psychologists or licensed professional counselors who list hypnosis as one of their specialties., When it comes to your health, quality over convenience is always the way to go. If you are having trouble finding a qualified hypnotherapist in your immediate area, expand your search radius to include other nearby towns or neighborhoods.

, There are no accredited programs at major universities that specialize in hypnotherapy. Instead, many hypnotherapists have degrees in other fields like medicine, dentistry, or counseling and have undergone additional training in hypnotherapy.Check to see if they have training in another field such as medicine, psychology, or social work.
Be wary of so called Doctors of Hypnotherapy. If they do not have a degree in another medical field, they may have received their doctorate from an unaccredited university.
A reliable and professional hypnotherapist will have a professional office facility, in depth experience in hypnosis, and evidence of previous clients' success.

, The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis (ASCH)or the American Council of Hypnotist Examiners (ACHE)are two organizations that require members meet high standards of training and have appropriate education qualifications.

, Sites like Yelp, the Better Business Bureau, or healthgrades.com will have star ratings and offer patient reviews that can help you get a better idea of what the therapist is like and what her patients' level of satisfaction is.

, Hypnotherapy can be an effective treatment for stress and anxiety. It may also benefit sufferers of chronic pain, hot flashes and frequent headaches. Most therapists will list their specialties on their websites, but you should also call and ask if they have any experience treating your particular symptoms.


For example, if you are having chronic back pain, try finding a hypnotherapist who is also a chiropractor or general physician. , In this way you are giving the therapist a chance to learn more about you. You’ll also get a sense of how well the hypnotherapist can listen to your needs.


How long did they undergo training?
How long have they been practicing?
The therapist should be able to explain to you the difference between things like formal and informal trance and what the levels of consciousness are., The hypnotherapist should be able to clearly communicate an initial treatment plan for you based on your symptoms.


Be clear about what you are hoping to achieve. ""I want to quit smoking"" or ""I would like to eliminate chronic pain in my joints.""
They should also be asking you questions about your medical history or any prior experience with hypnotherapy.

, When you go on the consultation, remember that you are interviewing the hypnotherapist to see if they are the right fit for you.


Make sure you feel welcomed by the hypnotherapist.
Was the office clean and the staff friendly?
Go on a few consultations to make sure you find the right fit.

, If you feel excited or feel good about proceeding then go ahead and make a an appointment.


Make sure you know their approach and that you feel comfortable with it. Ask about rates or prices and how many visits it typically takes to deal with your issue.

, Hypnotherapy is sometimes covered by insurance but it varies. Check your plan before making an appointment to be sure.


If your insurance does cover it, copays can be from $30 to $50 dollars a visit.
Without insurance a hypnotherapist appointment could cost $50 to $275."

Be an understanding and supportive listener.
Help you develop your ability to cope with life's difficulties.
Help you develop some of your life-skills: more effective communication, better problem-solving, better impulse-control, etc.
Help you look at your problems in different ways and with a different perspective.
Help you gain more insight into your behaviors, thoughts and emotions.
Work with you to help you make changes in how you function and feel.
Offer advice on how to find services which s/he isn't able to provide.;
, A therapist cannot:


Un-do hurt feelings and painful events.
Change other people in your life, and cannot tell you how to change them, either.
Create instantaneous change in you. Personal change requires hard and dedicated work.

, Write a brief (two or three sentences) summary of this using the above steps on what a therapist can and cannot do.


Spend some time thinking about what exactly you want help with and what you envision the end result to be.

, These can be family members or friends, favorite teachers, school counselors, your family doctor, your pastor or rabbi, and any other person whose opinion you value. Use online referral listings too, as there is a wealth of resources available online, often with an informative blurb about how each therapist works, their fees, etc.

, Many of them will have counseling facilities in order to train their students. The students will be supervised by qualified professionals and teachers.


Call up charitable and religious institutions that you are involved with or that you respect. Many of them maintain lists of therapists that may give you a price break.
Some therapists that are not necessarily low-fee may have reduced fee slots available. Ask about the fees. Tell them what you can afford. Some therapists will be able to accommodate you. If they do not, they may know someone who does and can give you a referral.

, Ask lots of questions and take notes. You could ask the therapist about his/her training, or about whatever else feels important to you to know (for example, does s/he have experience working with people of your ethnicity/sexual orientation, etc.). You're essentially acting as an employer who is giving a job interview, and you're going to determine whether you want to hire this therapist as a consultant. Keep this idea in mind during each call.


Ask the therapist about how s/he handles conflict: therapists who are able to repair the rupture in the relationship when there is conflict tend to have a better outcome than their conflict-avoidance colleagues.
Pay attention to how you feel when you talk with the therapist. If it doesn't feel like a good fit for you, don't make an appointment with that person even if you can't give a logical explanation about why you don't feel good about that person. Trust your feelings.

, Try to see if the therapist that you like has any patient or client testimonials that relate to the condition that you have. If your therapist does not have a results or testimonials page check to see if other clients or patients wrote testimonials on another website like Yelp.com

, Compare your findings to the tips and warnings below. Does s/he return your phone call in a timely manner? Do you like the way that s/he talks to you? Do you feel relatively comfortable talking to him/her about what is going on with you? When a therapist seems warm, personable, intelligent, and knowledgeable, and doesn't display any of the warning signs below, consider hiring that person.

, Different countries and states require therapists to hold different licenses and certificates to practice, so you will have to check whether your therapist holds the appropriate license for your area.


Holding a valid license for therapy helps ensure that the therapist has met in-depth educational requirements, is up-to-date in his or her training, and is held to a code of ethics and practice in dealing with patients.

, If you're paying out of pocket for therapy, make sure you can afford the hourly rates. If you're relying on health insurance to pay for your therapy, make sure that the therapist choices you're considering accept payments from your insurance company. While financial matters shouldn't restrict your ability or drive to get good therapy, you still need to consider how you're going to pay the therapist (if you don't have sessions provided by your insurance or a national/local medical care system).


Do your research before matching with the given therapist, so that you don't find yourself back at square one if you determine that the financial relationship won't work.

, Once you have interviewed all the prospective therapists, take some time to think about the best choice. If you plan on using insurance, call your insurance company to be sure that the therapist you like is covered, or if that therapist will provide 'out of network provider' statements to you.

, It's important to bear in mind that some problems will take longer to resolve than others, so treatment duration can vary considerably. But if you notice absolutely no change in your problem after the first couple of months, hire a different therapist.

Once your dentist recommends one or more oral surgeons based on your specific needs, you can go forward with the process of evaluating each surgeon.If your dentist doesn’t have anyone in mind, perform an online search for an oral surgeon in the area with good reviews. Alternately, talk to your friends and family members who have had oral surgery and find out if they were satisfied with their surgeons.;
, Within oral surgery, there are a number of subfields. For instance, some oral surgeons specialize in providing implants, while other specialize in removing teeth. Use your knowledge of what you’re looking for in an oral surgeon to choose one who will meet your specific needs. , If you live in a nation that does not provide universal health coverage, you might have to pay a fee to a hospital or private insurance company for treatment. Even if you have health insurance, your provider might not allow you to receive treatment from the oral surgeon of your choice. Before choosing an oral surgeon, find out from your care provider what your options are., If the price is an issue for you, find out how different oral surgeons charge for the operation you need. Choose the price that best fits your budget.Ask your dentist how much the surgery you need typically costs. This will give you an idea of what the ballpark price for your surgery should be.

, When you see the oral surgeon for the first time, find out what the problem is and what they recommend you do about it. The diagnosis should be similar or identical to the initial one you received from your dentist. If it is not, consider getting a second opinion.Listen carefully to your doctor and take careful note of all the possible courses of treatment available to you.
Once the diagnosis is complete, the oral surgeon should provide you with a printout describing the problem and their recommended surgical option. Each step of the procedure should be described along with a price for the services offered.

, After the oral surgeon you’re thinking about choosing offers their diagnosis and treatment options, you will probably have questions. A good oral surgeon will ask you directly if you have any questions and answer your questions in a clear and confident manner. Even if the oral surgeon doesn’t ask you if you have questions, you should come prepared to ask a few anyway. For instance, you might want to ask:Is this procedure dangerous?
Is there an alternative to the procedure?
What happens if I don’t get oral surgery?
Have you performed many surgeries of this type before?

, When choosing an oral surgeon, you are also choosing the network of people they surround themselves with or calls upon. This network might include nurses, laboratory technicians, or other dental and medical professionals. Whenever possible, you should also ensure that these individuals are qualified and reliable.For instance, if you’re getting an implant, ask the oral surgeon what laboratory they will use, and if the lab tech is certified or accredited.

, Oral surgery is generally a minor procedure, but like all surgery, it entails certain risks. Ask the oral surgeon what these risks are and what emergency provisions they provide.For instance, your oral surgeon should have a direct line available for you in case something happens over the weekend while you’re recovering from the surgery.

, An oral surgeon should have board certification, meaning they have met the requirements outlined by their profession and can be trusted to perform oral surgery. They should also meet local licensing or certification requirements, which vary from place to place. For instance, your local state or province might have certain rules that the surgeon must conform to in order to practice., When oral surgeons are members of professional societies, they demonstrate that they are committed to staying apprised of all the latest developments in their field, and deserve special consideration when you make your selection. Whenever possible, choose an oral surgeon who is a member of a society such as the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons or a similar group at the local or national level.Better still, find one who is not only a member of a professional society, but one who has received accolades or awards for their work.

, Generally, the longer an oral surgeon has been practicing, the more secure you should feel in their abilities. Select an oral surgeon who has been in practice for a number of years and is well-established in the community."

Know that not every therapist will work out.",How to Choose a Mental Health Counselor or Psychotherapist," Identifying your needs can help you to choose a therapist who has experience working with clients with similar needs. Before you start looking for a therapist, think about why you want to start therapy. You can ask yourself some questions to begin to describe the problem.


Some questions to ask yourself may include: What symptoms have you been having? How long has the problem been going on? What areas of your life is your problem affecting (social, family, friendships, work, school, romantic relationships, etc.)? How severe is the problem? Talk out your answers to these questions with a trustworthy friend or family member, or write out your answers to help you identify your priorities for therapy.
For example, you might want to see a therapist because you have been crying a lot lately and withdrawing from your friends and family. The problem may have started about six months ago and you might feel like it is affecting your relationships and ability to do your job. You might feel that the problem is somewhat severe.
Or, you might have noticed that you compulsively spend lots of money on unnecessary items, such as clothes, electronics, or other luxury items. You may estimate that you have been struggling with this problem for over a decade. The behavior might be affecting your relationship with your spouse. You might feel like this problem has gotten worse over the years and that now it is quite severe.
If you're seeing someone for mental health issues for the first time, just make sure it's someone you feel comfortable with. If you need a referral for medication later, your mental health counselor or psychotherapist will help get a referral for you to someone who can help you obtain medication.;
, Every type of mental health professional has a slightly different focus. Before you start looking for a therapist, consider the different types of mental health professionals and choose the best one to suit your needs.Psychiatrists (M.D., D.O) are medical doctors that specialize in mental health. They can diagnose and treat mental health problems with medications. Keep in mind that while seeking medication may be helpful as a short term solution to your emotional issues, keep in mind that medication alone will not be enough. You will also need to seek talk therapy from a psychologist or counselor.Also keep in mind that although some psychiatrists have a medication only practice, some psychiatrists also offer psychotherapy. You can ask before you make an appointment to see what a psychiatrist offers.

Psychologists (Ph.D., Psy. D, Ed D.) have a doctoral degree in psychology and may treat or specialize in a number of mental health problems. They are often not able to prescribe medicine unless specially licensed or they work with another provider.

Physician assistants (P.A.–C) work under the supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist. A physician’s assistant who specializes in psychiatry and who works under the supervision of a psychiatrist may have the ability to diagnose mental health disorders, prescribe medicine, and provide psychotherapy.Nurse practitioners (PMHNP) can work in teams with other mental health providers or independently to diagnose and treat mental health illness using medication and, sometimes, counseling.

Licensed professional counselors (L.P.C.) can provide psychological counseling and provide diagnosis of mental health issues. Counselors usually assume a holistic but individualized approach to counseling. They recognize that society impacts the individual's behavior, but what the individual does and how s/he feels is ultimately his/her own responsibility. Counselors do not prescribe medication.

Licensed social workers (L.S.W.) can provide mental health counseling and diagnose mental illnesses. They tend to do this from a systems perspective meaning they look at how the community impacts and can help to reduce the symptoms of distress. Social workers do not prescribe medications.

Licensed marriage and family therapist (L.M.F.T.) can provide mental health counseling and diagnose and treat mental illness. They tend to do this from a family systems perspective meaning they focus most closely on how the individual interacts with his or her family system and how that system impacts the individual. Family therapists do not prescribe medication.

, Before you select a mental health professional, it is important to make sure that you are only considering professionals who are licensed to practice in your state. The best way to find out if someone is licensed in your state is to visit a state website. For example, in Pennsylvania, you would have to check with the PA State Professional Licensing Board to find out if a therapist is licensed to practice in your state.Keep in mind that each state has its own rules about licensing mental health professionals.
You can also ask your insurance provider if the professionals that they list are all licensed.

, Not all therapists use the same methods with their clients. One professional might choose a specific approach over another based on evidence that one approach produces better results for the client’s problem. If you have a preference for a specific type of therapy based on a past experience, then you may want to seek therapists who use these methods. Some therapists may even list their preferred approaches on an online profile. However, most therapists use a variety of different approaches, which can be beneficial if you are not sure what is wrong. Approaches may include:Psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapies. This approach helps you to uncover subconscious motivations for your behavior and to change your behavior, thoughts, and feelings.

Behavior therapy. This form of therapy modifies your behavior by using strategies that attempt to change the way that you learn.

Cognitive therapy. In this form of therapy, the goal is to change your thoughts so that your feelings and actions will change as well.

Humanistic therapy. This type of therapy focuses on your ability to make rational decisions and improve yourself.

, Getting a referral to a therapist from your general practitioner may be necessary for insurance reasons. Therefore, you may need to talk to your general practitioner about how you have been feeling before starting your search.


Your general practitioner may also be able to refer you to someone who meets your specific needs. For example, if you are seeking talk therapy from someone who has experience helping compulsive shoppers, then your doctor may be able to point you in the right direction.

, Friends and family members who are in therapy may be able to help you find a good therapist.If you know that a friend or family member sees a therapist, then you might consider asking how he or she likes the therapist. If your friend or family member has good things to say, then this therapist might be someone to consider.

, Some therapists provide information about their specializations on the internet. Check to see if the therapists you are considering specialize in any of the areas for which you are seeking help.


For example, you may be able to find out whether or not a therapist is willing to work with people who have addiction problems, anxiety, or obsessive compulsive disorder.

, Before you make an appointment with a therapist, make sure that he or she will accept your insurance. You may be able to check your insurance carrier’s online directory or you may need to call your insurance company to verify your coverage.Don’t schedule an appointment until you are certain that the therapist takes your insurance. You can call the therapist before you make an appointment to be sure. Therapy can be extremely expensive if your insurance does not cover at least part of it.

, Therapists charge different prices for their time. Make sure that you know their prices and whether or not they take your insurance.


Call the therapist's office to find out their prices and whether or not they take insurance. Make sure that you know whether or not you can afford their prices before you meet with them.
Find out what therapists are part of your health insurance network. You will want to find out if your therapist takes your insurance before you choose a therapist or come for your first visit.
Know that if you want to visit a therapist outside of your network, it may be more expensive. Consider the potential cost of a therapist outside of your network as opposed to those approved by your insurance.

, Make sure your therapist is easily available, close by, and can be contacted without much difficulty. If these are not options, it may be useful to try online therapy.


Choose a therapist that nearby. This may be a problem if you live in a rural area, but try to find someone that you can visit without too much difficulty.
Make sure your therapist is accessible. You want to be able to contact when you need to make an appointment or need emergency help.
Contact with your therapist with an inquiry. Explain to them what you’re looking for and ask if they are taking new patients.
Schedule a consultation with your therapist so you can meet with them in person.
Consider online therapy if you cannot easily access a therapist or if your schedule will not permit an in-person therapist. Make sure your online therapist is qualified and holds the same accreditations as an in-person counselor., When you have made a decision about the therapist that you want to try, schedule your first appointment. Keep in mind that it might be a couple of weeks before you will have your first appointment.

, During your first appointment, the therapist will probably ask you to explain why you are seeking therapy. This is your opportunity to provide an overview of how you have been feeling and what problems you have been encountering.


You may want to think about how you will express these things before you go, since it might be a little overwhelming to describe it all on the spot.
In your own words, just try to describe how you have been feeling and acting. How long has it lasted? Why does it bother you? What do you hope to accomplish through therapy?

, Your first appointment is a good time to ask questions that will help you decide if you want to continue with this therapist. Some questions you might want to ask include:How long have you been a practicing therapist?
How much experience do you have working with people who share my issues?
What are your specialties?
What are your treatment methods? How effective are these methods?

, Being dishonest with your therapist can hinder your progress or prevent it entirely. Therefore, it is essential to tell your therapist the truth about your feelings and experiences. Keep in mind that your therapist is not going to judge you or share what you have shared with her.


If you don’t feel comfortable being honest with a therapist, then it might be a sign that you need to try someone else., Talk therapy is an effective treatment for many different types of mental health issues, but it takes time and persistence. You and your therapist can set goals and develop a plan for achieving those goals.For example, your goal might be to feel less anxious when you go out in public or to stop making major purchases without thinking about them first. Tell your therapist what your goals are and follow through with her recommendations for achieving them.
Keep in mind that it can take a while to see results, but the results from talk therapy are often more long-term than the results you might achieve by only taking medication.

, You need to be comfortable with your therapist in order to address your mental health problems.


Be aware of your comfort level with the therapist. If you feel comfortable and safe, that’s the best environment for effective counseling.
Consider if race or gender is an issue in your counseling. Don't limit yourself to the age, gender, or race of the therapist, since you may skip over a very qualified therapist.
If your specific mental health problem addresses a unique gender or racial experience, you may want to choose a therapist that may understand your experience first-hand.
Pay attention to the communication style of your therapist. Make sure the way they talk and listen to you feels like you are heard and listened to.
Keep in mind that therapists are human beings too. Some meetings may not go well. Mental health professionals are not perfect, so try to give them the benefit of the doubt.

, If you don’t feel comfortable with a therapist, that’s ok. It’s important to feel comfortable to address your mental health concerns.


Realize that your first meeting is just an interview. It’s not the end of the world if the first therapist does not work out.
Ask for a referral if your initial meeting doesn’t work out. Even if your first meeting did not go well, your therapist may be able to suggest someone that’s a better fit.
Thank the therapist for their time. They took time out to meet you as a new patient. Be grateful for their time and willingness to help. "

This letter will give the consultant background information on you, including your family and medical history.;
, Take your time and check their credentials. Double check if the consultant is on the General Medical Council's register under their listed specialty. See if there are any reviews on the specialist that you can find online. Look at their specific office hours to see which fits your schedule best.

, The location of the consultant you choose is important because the closer they are, the less time you will have to take off from work, the less distance you will have to go if there are complications, an emergency or if you need to follow up with the consultant.

, This meeting can give you a feel for each specialist to see if they are a good fit for you. You should be able to be comfortable with them and feel free to ask any questions. Ask questions about themselves, their business and how they address patient rights, and pay attention to see if they answer your questions satisfactorily. It is important that the consultant you choose makes you feel comfortable and answers your question since you will trust them with your body and health.

, Ask how often they have done the same operation you will be having done. Find out where your operation will be done and ask the consultant how often they have performed operations there. Ask the consultant about post-operative procedures and what their specific role will be in your recovery and after care in the hospital and in the office once you are discharged.

You can then print off a list of pediatricians in your area that accept your insurance.;
, People in your social circle will already know good pediatricians. Ask around to see if anyone has a recommendation. You can ask in person or use social media to reach a wider audience., It's helpful to get an idea of what the doctor is like before doing more research. Therefore, when you get a recommendation, try to ask a few follow-up questions.For instance, you could ask how that person's child responds to the doctor. You could also check how available the doctor is for questions. Another question you can ask is whether the doctor provides a satisfactory amount of information about growth and development.Ask the person to approximate how much time the doctor spends with your child, as well. The actual number doesn't matter. What's more important is if the parent feels like the time frame was enough for the problem at hand., For instance, you may prefer a male doctor to a female doctor or vice versa. You may prefer an older, more experienced pediatrician, or you might rather have someone who's young with new ideas. Decide what's most important to you.Another important criterion is how fast you can get in to see the doctor, especially if your child has an immediate need. Weekend and nighttime hours might also be important to you, or they may not.You may also consider location important, as well as the size of the practice. A large practice may offer more opportunities to get your child in, for instance, even if it's not with your regular pediatrician.Another criteria to consider is the doctor's specialty. Some doctors specialize in newborns, while others specialize in older children, for instance, so consider the age of your child., Once you've decided on what criteria matter to you, make a list of those criteria. Start with the most important at the top, then list them in descending importance. Write out a question you can ask the doctor's office or the doctor for each criteria.For instance, if you want to know about office hours, you could write ""What are your office hours?""
It can be helpful to type up this list, then you can print it out for each doctor and take notes as you gather information.

, Many offices have much of their information listed on their websites. For instance, office hours should be listed on the website. You should also be able to find information about the doctor's educational background. Take notes on what you find, and note what information you can't find.


If you have special needs related to communication, check to see if the office has ways to help, such as interpreters or multilingual staff.
The websites of some practices will even offer photos and videos the pediatricians so that potential patients can get a feel for their personality and style.

, Contact the office of each doctor to ask a few initial questions about the doctor. What questions you ask exactly depends on what you expect from a pediatrician, but in general, you should ask about the doctor's educational background and experience, as well as what usually happens when you bring your child to that office.Also ask about any criteria that are especially important to you. For instance, don't forget to ask about office hours and the doctor's specialties. You should also ask what hospitals the doctor is able to admit patients to.Another important question to ask is how care is coordinated when your child needs to be referred to a specialist.Don't forget to take notes for each doctor's office you call.

, It doesn't matter if you've found the perfect pediatrician if she's not accepting new patients. Make sure to ask each office whether they are taking on patients as you call around., Once you've talked to each office, narrow down the list more to the doctors you'd like to interview in person. Narrow it down based on what criteria are most important to you., Once you've narrowed, it's time to schedule in-person interviews. Keep in mind that these interviews will generally be short, usually only 10 minutes or so, so don't expect to be there for an hour or more. The main purpose is to get a sense of whether you find the doctor trustworthy enough to handle your child's health.Sometimes, group practices have gatherings where you can meet more than one of the pediatricians at once.Most practices offer free interviews for prospective clients, but you should call and ask the office to be sure; some only offer these for parents who are expecting.

, Ask any questions you still have unanswered. Pay attention to how the doctor communicates and whether or not you feel comfortable with him or her. If you're looking for a new pediatrician for an older child, take him or her with you to see how the doctor interacts with your kid. Also, ask your child afterwards how he or she felt about the doctor.See if the doctor's communication style matches with yours. That is, when you ask a question, do you feel like the doctor actually answers it or just flirts around the answer? Do you feel rushed in the interview?

, Once you've talked to your final choices, compare your notes on each one. How does each doctor line up with the criteria you set out? Which doctor matches the largest number of criteria you decided on? Those questions should help you narrow down your choice to one or two pediatricians., Most states offer information on any doctor in the state to anyone who wants it. Therefore, you can use the information provided by the medical board to check for complaints against the doctor, as well as any disciplinary action against the doctor. You can also make sure the doctor is board certified.Find the website for your state's medical board to learn how to obtain the information you want. You'll probably need information such as the doctor's full name, as well as the address of the doctor's office., When it comes down to it, you may find several qualified doctors. In that case, it comes down to how you feel about the doctor. If you feel connected to a particular doctor and think that he or she is trustworthy, he or she is the pediatrician for your child. Also, don't stress too much. If you find you don't like the doctor you choose, you can always switch to another at a later time., If your child is already born, go ahead and schedule an appointment with the pediatrician. Otherwise, let the office know your due date so they can be prepared when the baby is born."

Learn about their proposed treatment plan.,
Evaluate their “chairside” manner.",How to Choose a Periodontist," If you’ve been instructed to see a periodontist by your dentist, they will usually provide you with a referral. Dental professionals often work hand in hand, enabling you to receive comprehensive care. Speak to your dentist about periodontists that they work with and/or recommend., Talk to people you know to see if they have visited periodontists in your area. Find out if there are any practitioners they recommend, as well as any you should avoid., Numerous websites--such as healthgrades.com, checkbook.org, and even yelp.com--provide ratings, reviews, and comments about medical practitioners. Read over these comments and reviews. Additionally, you can ask potential periodontists for referrals from their existing patients., Just like traditional dentists, periodontists will vary in terms of cost and flexibility of payment. Talk to each potential periodontist about general pricing, payment plans, and what might be covered through your insurance. You may also want to call your insurance company to find out which services (and which practitioners) may or may not be covered.For example, your periodontal treatment plan might include:

Deep cleaning and/or root planing.
Dental implant placement.
Surgical procedures (like regeneration) or plastic surgery (like soft tissue grafting).

, Read over each practitioner’s website and available pamphlets to get an even greater sense of their practice. Find out if they put out a newsletter or provide information on their website to help you prevent future gum and/ or bone issues., The basic dental degree is a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD). In order to become a dentist, each practitioner must have earned one of these degrees. Look online or inquire directly about the presence of such qualifications., A periodontist needs to have completed an additional three-year program that focuses on the biology and procedures regarding gum disease and gum disease treatment. Make sure that each periodontist has done so.You’ll want to make sure this program was ADA-accredited.

, Periodontists may earn national board certification by the American Board of Periodontology (ABP). In order to do this, they must pass comprehensive written and oral examinations regarding phases of periodontal disease and its treatment. Additionally, they must present reports on a range of treatments. Periodontists must be recertified every six years., Finally, you will probably want a periodontist with some experience in the field. Ask each practitioner how long they have been working as a periodontist, and how long their office has been in practice., In order to get a sense of your compatibility with a given periodontist, you should make an appointment for an evaluation. A periodontist will examine you and often perform X-rays. Specifically, the periodontist will look at:

Your head, neck, and jaw joints.
Your mouth and throat.
Your teeth and gums.

, Different periodontists have different philosophies of care, and may recommend different treatments. After your evaluation, ask the periodontist for their diagnosis and treatment plan. Ask about your options, the specific costs of various treatments, and the pros and cons of each. Ask about medication and/or pain relief options.Some periodontal procedures include:

Non-surgical periodontal treatment (such as deep cleanings, scaling and root planing).
Dental implant placement.
Periodontal surgical procedures (such as regeneration, pocket reduction, and gingivectomy).
Periodontal plastic surgery (such as gingival sculpting, soft tissue grafting, and ridge augmentation.)

, Aside from just the scientific side of periodontal treatment, there is also a personal one. You will want to choose a practitioner who presents a professional, caring attitude, and makes you feel comfortable. You will want to make sure that the office staff is friendly and accommodating, as well.Examples of good chairside manner include:

Making direct eye contact.
Explaining diagnoses, treatments, and procedures in a clear way that you can understand.
Answering all questions patiently and effectively.
Having a generally warm disposition.

Ask your friend questions.,
Research your friend’s symptoms.,
Anticipate rejection or rebuttals.,
Choose the appropriate time and location.,
Be respectful of your friend's right to choose.,
Ask for help.",How to Encourage a Friend to Seek Professional Therapy1," The best way to help your friend is to gain a better understanding of what they are going through. Sit down and gently bring up the topic about your friend's mental health. Ask questions to learn more about what they might need.


You might say, ""You haven't seemed like yourself lately. Is everything okay?"" Stick to what you have observed and avoid making assumptions. You may bring in other people’s observations if needed. This may also be a good time to ask, “Have you thought about going to talk to somebody about that?”
This offers a great benchmark for bringing up the subject later when you have done some research or looked up possible counselors.;
, After you have gotten some cursory information about what kind of problems they might be experiencing, research the person’s symptoms and the type of treatment that may benefit them. This way, when you suggest they seek help, you know exactly what type of treatment to talk about.


Also, providing a possible name to what your friend is experiencing may give them a sense of hope that they can get better.
Print out the symptoms of the condition you believe your friend may be suffering from and let them see. Having this type of evidence may convince them that they need help., No matter how much you do to plan out the conversation, it may not go the way you want. Your friend may become angry with you and not want to see you again. However, you are doing the right thing by trying to help, no matter how they may see it at the time.


Go into the conversation knowing full well that your friend may deny that anything is wrong with them, yell at you, ask you to leave, and threaten to end your friendship. Walking in with the worst-case scenario already in your head may better prepare you for it, if it happens.If your friend does this, you may have no choice but to give them space to come to terms with their issues on their own. Although it's okay to show your concern and recommend them to seek help. You can't force them. Keep in mind that you may encounter some pushback at first and it might take several conversations before they come around.

, Talking to your friend about their mental health is typically something that should be done one-on-one. Attempting to have the conversation during a loud and busy event probably won’t go over well, as your friend won’t be able to give their full attention to you and what you’re saying. Instead, choose a time and place where your friend feels comfortable and will be able to understand your message.


If possible, avoid having the talk when your friend is going through a difficult or stressful time. Attempting to persuade them when they are in distress will usually end in failure. Try to find a time when you think they’ll be more receptive and responsive to your concern., Despite your best efforts, you have to accept that you can't force your friend to get help. Bring up the subject and tell them you are worried, but know that you cannot dictate whether your friend gets help or not.


Keep the lines of communication open and let your friend know that they can talk to you any time if they change their mind.

, If you think your friend won’t take your word alone, ask for support from other friends and loved ones. Or, if you think your friend will be more likely to listen to someone else, then consider having that person talk to them instead of you. Having more than just your opinion may make your case more substantial and they may take the talk more seriously. You may also want to ask a professional to sit in on the conversation to help steer it the proper way.


When asking for support, you could say, “I’m concerned about our friend and I know they value your opinion and trust you. I was hoping you could talk to them about getting help with me. I think if you share your concern for them, they’ll take it more seriously.”Again, keep in mind that your friend may not feel comfortable with you involving others. Only do this if you believe your friend is in danger of hurting themselves or someone else. For minor problems, be willing to back off if your friend clearly doesn't want your help.

Avoid putting the blame on them.,
Don’t use labels.,
Be supportive in what you say.",How to Encourage a Friend to Seek Professional Therapy2," Walking into a conversation and saying, “You’re depressed and need help” is going to make anyone defensive. Instead, put the focus on yourself and how you’re feeling. The person may not get combative with you if you make the topic more about you.


For example, you could say, “I’m really concerned that you may be struggling with depression. I’ve noticed certain behaviors in you and I think it would be helpful if you could talk to a professional. Could you do that for me?”, No one wants to hear there is something wrong with them. It can become particularly hurtful when negative words are used to describe them. Never use a label when talking to your friend; doing so can make them reject everything you are trying to say.


For instance, never say the person is “crazy” or a “lunatic.” They might even say something like, “You think I’m crazy,” and it is important to let them know that you absolutely do not think that. Similarly, don’t call your friend a “drunk” or a “druggie.” Instead, you could say they haven’t been acting like themselves, or you feel like they’ve been indulging in alcohol or drugs excessively., The point of the meeting is to encourage your friend to get help. If you let them know you will be with them every step of the way, they are more likely to seek treatment and try to get better. Thinking that they will have to deal with this alone may make them more afraid and reluctant to seek help.


Be sure to let your friend know that you are not trying to take over their pursuit of treatment, but that you are trying to help make it easier for them to get treatment. Ask what you can do to help.
One way to show your support is to lead by example. If you want your friend to stop drinking, then stop drinking yourself. Using the “Do as I say, not as I do” approach won’t work here. By bettering yourself, you may encourage them to get the help they need, too."
"
Help when you can.,
Attend appointments together.,
Do the leg work for them.,
Stick up for your friend when they need it.,
Look after your own mental health.",How to Encourage a Friend to Seek Professional Therapy3," Your friend may be reluctant to go therapy because of logistical reasons like lacking transportation or not being able to afford the fees. Offer to help them arrange transportation when you aren’t able to provide it. If you can, help to pay for the sessions and medications they may need. Or, help them research community programs that offer low-cost or free services to individuals in need.


If you can’t drive them, consider calling a taxi or ride service to get them there. Your support and willingness to make their health a priority can give them the boost they need to get better.Be sure to ask your friend before you make these kinds of arrangements for them. Let them know that you only want to help make it easier for them to seek treatment, but that you do not want to take away their control.

, Your friend may be worried about what the appointments will be like, particularly if they suffer from anxiety or depression. Offering to go to therapy with them or sit next to them during a support group meeting may make the thought of going there easier to fathom. Knowing that you will be with them every step of the way may encourage them to take their mental health more seriously.


You may only need to attend the first appointment or two until your friend becomes comfortable. After that, your friend may prefer to attend alone. Don’t take this as an insult. Look at it as a big step in their improvement.Be respectful of your friend’s privacy regarding these appointments as well. Your friend may not want you there or they might not want to talk about the appointment at all.

, If your friend is skeptical about seeking therapy, they likely aren’t going to be excited about finding a doctor and making the appointments. It would probably be a big help if you do that part for them. They may already feel overwhelmed about the process, and having to research and do the other steps may make them even more so.


If you make an appointment for your friend and they back out, attend the session anyways. You can talk to the therapist about your friend and they may be able to offer suggestions on how to help your friend cope with their condition and how you may be able to convince them to attend therapy.Only schedule appointments if your friend agrees to see a therapist. Your friend may feel violated if you go behind their back. Ask them if they want your help first.

, Mental health still carries a big stigma with it. This negativity could play a role in how willing your friend is to attend therapy. Offer to help your friend talk to their other friends and family members if they need help explaining why they are going to therapy, or if the people around them are giving them a hard time about their illness. It is especially important to do this right when the comment has been made. Let your friend hear you stand up for them.


You could say to their family, “I’m really concerned about this person, and I suggested that they seek professional help. Fortunately, they were willing to and the doctor believes that they do have a condition that requires therapy. It would be great if everyone could offer the support and encouragement needed to help our loved one get better.”
If someone says something negative about your friend, you can tell them, “I think it’s really courageous that they understood there was a problem and are taking the steps to get better. If you can’t be supportive of that, please keep your thoughts to yourself, or perhaps stay away.”, You can suggest that your friend see a therapist, but you can't play the role for them. Helping a mentally ill or unstable friend can be taxing. Don't bite off more than you can chew. And, be sure to tend to your own mental and emotional well-being. Set personal boundaries.For example, take at least one night off a week to do things you enjoy such as taking a relaxing bubble bath or seeing a movie at the cinema. Tell your friend they won't be able to reach you. Be sure to give them another number they can call in case of emergencies, like another friend, relative, or crisis hotline.

Be aware of codependent behaviors as well. As you are helping your friend, it is possible to fall into a pattern where you are enabling them.

Check to make sure the dentist office is in-network.,
Use a database to check for dentists and radiologists nearby.,
Narrow down your choices.,
Visit and evaluate.",How to Choose an Oral Radiologist1," If you have dental insurance, it's likely that only certain dentist offices are in your network. You can either start with your insurance's online tool to find a dentist or check for certain dentists once you've narrowed down a list., Using a database can help you easily narrow down your search. For instance, if you use the American Dental Association's tool, you can actually narrow your search to ""Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology.""However, if a dentist doesn't pop up under that specialty, try just searching for a dentist nearby. Most dentist offices do x-ray work in office.

, Look at reviews online to see if the dentist and radiologist have good reviews. Also, ask for recommendations from friends and family, as many may already have good dentists. Use factors like distance, services offered, and good reviews to make a list of a couple of dentists., Once you've narrowed down your choices to a few dentist offices, visit them and ask questions. You can also start out over the phone if you prefer. Of course, first and foremost on your mind is whether they offer x-rays, so establish that first. You can also schedule an appointment to meet the dentist and the radiologist. That way, you can size them up and see if you gel with the person.You can also ask questions about what other kinds of dental services they offer, as well as if they offer emergency services. You might also want to know what kind of sedation and numbing treatments they use.

Consider lithium.,
Try valproate.,
Ask about carbamazepine.,
Try lamotrigine.",How to Use Mood Stabilizers for Elderly Adults1," The most common and one of the oldest mood stabilizers prescribed for bipolar disorder is lithium. It is effective for elderly patients when prescribed, but this medication can present a problem in elderly adults. Lithium can be a difficult drug to use for the elderly because of its narrow therapeutic index; in other words, if you experience co-occurring conditions such as renal disease and cardiac insufficiency, your body may not metabolize the drug as quickly and can lead to toxicity and higher levels of lithium in your blood.Diets that restrict salt and poor hydration can also increase lithium toxicity.
Side effects of lithium include delirium, sedation, cognitive dulling, and, with long term lithium use, hypothyroidism and goiters.Serious drug interactions occur between lithium and diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Let your doctor know immediately if you are on these if lithium is being considered as a treatment option.;
, Valproate, sometimes called valproic acid or divalproex sodium, is another common mood stabilizer. It's often considered equally as effective as lithium. It was once prescribed as an anticonvulsant, but it is now used to treat bipolar disorder. It may work better than lithium for those with mixed symptoms of mania and depression or rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.Possible side effects in the elderly of valproate include confusion, sedation, tremors, hair thinning, weight loss, and loss of muscle function.It has also been linked to an increased occurrence of pancreatitis in the elderly., Carbamazepine is a mood stabilizer that is used with certain types of bipolar disorder. Rapid cycling bipolar and irritable mania are two of the more common symptoms of elderly bipolar disorder, both of which are treated well with carbamazepine.


It has a long history of use as a mood stabilizer, but you should only use it as an adjunctive treatment rather than an effective single agent.
Common side effects of carbamazepine are dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, loss of muscle control, and an worsening of heart symptoms, such as hypertension, hypotension, and congestive heart failure.
This medication with have a slightly different dosing than other mood stabilizers because, after four to six weeks, carbamazepine will create its own metabolism and require more to keep your blood levels even.Carbamazepine can also cause severely low sodium levels, so keep a check on these levels while on this medication.
Serious drug interactions occur if you are also taking some antibiotics, antidepressants, antifungals, corticosteroids, many antipsychotics, calcium channel blockers, and oral anticoagulants., Another mood stabilizer that may be helpful for bipolar disorder is lamotrigine. It has been shown to be highly effective against bipolar disorder if it is taken along with lithium or valproate.A lower dose of this medication will be prescribed because of an increase possibility of toxicity in your blood.
It may also increase the chance of anemia, so your doctor should keep a watch on your blood levels."

Brainstorm general ideas.,
Identify a need.,
Conduct market research.,
Choose your location.,
Determine your start-up costs.,
Evaluate your resources.,
Prepare a business plan.",How to Start a Business Working with Seniors1," If you're not yet sure what kind of business you want to start or how you want to work with seniors, evaluate your own strengths and weaknesses. Figure out what you have to offer seniors and come up with several ideas that you think would work for your business.You also want to look at what's currently available so you can carve out a niche for your products and services in the market. If the market is already saturated with other businesses offering the same products or services, you'll have a difficult time getting established.
On the other hand, if you find evidence of similar companies doing well in other cities or states offering localized products and services, but there isn't anyone offering the same thing in your area, you may have a strong market for what you want to provide.;
, Once you have a few ideas, you're ready to go more in-depth into your research. The most successful businesses are those that meet a need people have for a particular product or service. Choose the idea that most directly meets an important need seniors have.For example, many seniors living at home have a chronic medical condition. There may be a strong need for house or yard maintenance, pet sitting, or even running basic errands.
Because many seniors have difficulty traveling, you can almost always find a need for various services that you can take to them at their home. For example, if you are an accountant, you might want to open an accounting business for seniors that makes house calls and does their financial work with them at their home.
Visit the websites of senior organizations such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to get good ideas of needs that are currently being unmet or desires that many seniors have.

, If you're preparing a formal business plan, expect market research and analysis to be a major section. Even if you're not planning on drafting a formal business plan, market research is an important part of your planning if you want your business to succeed.Try to identify a particular subset of seniors who would be particularly interested in your products or services. Then you can better figure out how to reach those people through your marketing and promotions.
For example, suppose you've decided to start a handyman business to help seniors with home improvement projects. Your target market is not people who have a severe chronic illness, or who are unable to care for themselves. Rather, you want younger, active seniors who are still able to do basic tasks and want to take on improvement projects, but need a little help.

, Even if house calls are part of your business plan, you still may want a brick-and-mortar office. Since you're catering to seniors, this location should be easy to find and accessible to all people.Try to find office space near places where seniors would go to do other tasks, such as getting a store front in a plaza next to a grocery store. This way your potential customers can do several errands at once.
Ideally, you want a store front that is on the first floor. Both stairs and elevators can be difficult for many seniors.
Make sure your location is convenient to public transportation, and also has ample parking. Having your office in a house in a historic neighborhood zoned for both business and residential may seem nice, but seniors likely will go elsewhere if they have to circle the block looking for a place to park.

, To hit the ground running with your business, you need a good idea of how much your start-up costs will be and whether you have enough money to fund it yourself or will have to seek outside financing.Make a good estimate of the assets, such as furniture and office equipment, your business will need to get started. Then figure out what your basic daily and monthly expenses will be.
Project your expenses out at least six months, including any spending you'll need to make to acquire business assets, and you'll have a basic idea of the amount of money you'll need to start up your business.

, Once you have a good idea of what your start-up costs will be, evaluate the money and assets you have available to commit to your business. You may want to consult a professional before you take drastic measures such as refinancing your home or cashing in a retirement account, so you can make sure you've considered all the consequences.With some types of businesses, your start-up expenses will be minimal. For example, if you're planning on traveling to seniors' homes to work on their taxes and finances for them, you won't have many start-up expenses apart from buying a dedicated computer for your business and whatever software or applications you'll need.
Others will require more investment. If you plan to seek outside financing, you may want to work with a business planner or business attorney to determine the best way to structure this financing for your business.

, If you want to seek funding from outside investors, or plan on applying for a traditional business loan with a bank, you'll need a formal business plan. This document summarizes your background and experience along with your business start-up proposal, including budget, operations, and projections.Your business plan generally projects the profit and growth for your business three to five years from the date you first open your doors.
If you decide you need a formal business plan, check online for sample business plans created for businesses similar to yours, so you can get a good idea of what should be included.

Ask for a referral.,
Check with your insurance.,
Consider the type of x-ray you need.,
Meet the radiologist.",How to Choose an Oral Radiologist2," If you need an oral radiologist for medical reasons rather than dental reasons, the easiest way to find a radiologist is to ask for a referral from your doctor. Often, your doctor will have a specific radiologist that they work with, sometimes in the same building., Of course, you want to make sure your x-rays are covered by your insurance. When it comes to dental insurance, it will likely only cover a certain amount per year, though sometimes x-rays are included in preventative care. Often, as long as your dentist is in network, you should be fine.With medical insurance, you need to make sure your insurance will approve it and that the radiologist is in network. You can call and ask if you're not sure.

You can also use your insurance's online tool to search for an oral radiologist who's in-network.

, You may need different types of x-rays for different problems. For instance, if your doctor is looking for cancer in the head and jaw, you may need a panoramic dental x-ray.On the other hand, if you just need your teeth checked for decay and rubbing damage, a bitewing may be more appropriate.Check with the radiologist to see if they perform the type of x-ray you need.

, If you're still worried about choosing an oral radiologist, you always have the option to meet with them. Call up their office and ask if you can spend a few minutes meeting with the radiologist so that you'll feel more comfortable when you do need to get x-rays."

Start slow with dosing.,
Use a pill box.,
Try taking it at night.,
Monitor your health.",How to Use Mood Stabilizers for Elderly Adults2," When you start taking mood stabilizers, you should start slow. Your doctor will put you on a small dose at first and slowly increase your dosage. This help prevent having too much of any of the mood stabilizers in your body due to a decreased metabolism.


You will start at one dose for a week or two and then increase your dose slowly until your doctor gets you to the dose needed every day.
This will vary for each medication, so make sure you follow your doctor’s orders about how much of your medications to take., If you have a hard time keeping what medications you take a day straight, consider getting a weekly pill box. This can be especially helpful when you are working towards the recommended dose for your mood stabilizer. You can fill the pill box up as soon as the week starts with the correct medication dosages from your medication information.


This will cut down on the possibility of missing a dose or forgetting what dose you need to take each day., Many of the mood stabilizers have harsh side effects. Some of these can be hard on you during the day. Instead of taking your dosage of medicine during the day, consider taking it at night. This can help you avoid some of the symptoms because you will sleep through when they are most likely to occur.


Make sure this scheduling for your mood stabilizers is okay with your doctor., There are certain health issues that can arise if you are taking mood stabilizers. If you are taking most mood stabilizers, you should have your plasma levels checked regularly. You can end up with toxic levels of the medication in your blood, which can cause severe health issues. This can also help you check for anemia, which is a common symptom of carbamazepine.You should also keep a check on your kidney function while on mood stabilizers. Your kidneys filter your blood and urine and they can be affected by new medications. You should keep a close watch on your kidneys if you have had any renal dysfunction or disease in the past."
"
Diagnose bipolar disorder.,
Ask about mood stabilizers for dementia.,
Check for drug interactions.,
Make sure your condition cannot be treated without medication.",How to Use Mood Stabilizers for Elderly Adults3," Before you can be prescribed mood stabilizers, you need to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. You will need to be fully examined by your doctor for a diagnosis. This will include a physical exam to rule out other possible reasons for your symptoms.Once your doctor rules these out, you will be sent to a mental health professional for a psychiatric analysis to determine which type of bipolar disorder you have.


The symptoms of bipolar disorder will vary, depending on if you are experiencing a manic or depressive episode. , There are certain forms of dementia that can be treated by mood stabilizers such as lithium, valporate and carbamazepine. If you suffer from dementia with the added symptoms of impulsivity and aggression, your doctor may consider prescribing you mood stabilizers.


You may also be prescribed mood stabilizers if you have dementia with manic-like features.
The dosing on these will vary greatly depending on your particular case. Always follow your doctor’s dosing instructions., One of the biggest issues faced when elderly adults need to be prescribed medication is the possibility of drug interactions. Common mood stabilizers can be harsh drugs and the possibility of interaction is high. When you are working with your doctor to treat your bipolar or other disorder, make sure your doctor knows every medication you are on to lower the risk of interactions.


Since elderly adults are prescribed so many more medications, this makes them a higher risk for drug interactions., Since mood stabilizers can be hard on an elderly adult’s body, you should only take medication when it is necessary. Ask your doctor if there is any other way to treat your bipolar disorder aside from medication.


The need for medication is common with bipolar disorder in patients of all ages, but there may be alternative treatment options to consider before you are put in medication."

Choose a name for your business.,
Discuss your new business with local seniors.,
Plan your marketing strategy.,
Provide incentives for word-of-mouth marketing.",How to Start a Business Working with Seniors2," Many small business owners simply use their own name or the name of the city in which they are located. However, if you want to take your business to the next level, you need to choose a name that will attract the seniors with whom you want to work.You may want to lean on your market research here. Your business name should be something that will appeal to the people you think will most benefit from your products or services, and won't turn them off or intimidate them.
Since you're targeting seniors, you may want to include words like ""seniors"" or ""retirees"" somewhere in your business name.

, In-depth research is essential if you want your business to succeed. Talking to people near you who are potential customers can help you fine-tune your idea before you launch your business.Talking to seniors can be a good way to test your business name as well as how the products or services you plan to offer are received.
You can hire a marketing company to conduct this research for you, or you can create a basic quiz yourself with five or six questions for local seniors to answer. Talk to seniors attending local events, or at the meeting of a seniors' organization.
You also want to ask them about prices, so you can get a good idea of how to price your products or services and what kinds of sales or promotions would interest your target market.

, Marketing your new business to seniors will involve different concerns than if you were targeting a broader segment of the population. If you want customers, you need to ensure that your advertising will be seen by the people who need your services, and that they will understand the services you provide.For example, if you're offering in-home services to seniors, you probably don't want to run cable television commercials on MTV, nor would you want to run them at 1:00 a.m., when seniors are likely to be asleep.
If you decide to run television commercials, you're generally most likely to hit your target audience if you run them during the day on basic networks.
Just because you want to start a business working with seniors doesn't mean you should skip internet advertising. There are plenty of grandparents with social media accounts, and many seniors are highly internet savvy., Many seniors find new businesses because a close friend or family member recommends them. This is especially important if you plan to make house calls, because people typically won't invite people into their homes unless they have some reason to trust them.One standard option is to provide repeat customers with a small discount, say 10 or 15 percent, on return purchases if they recommend your products or services to at least one person.
In turn, you also can provide a small discount to the person who tries your products based on the recommendation of a prior customer.
Incentives for recommendations also may affect your marketing strategy. For example, you may target the middle-aged children of seniors to encourage them to send their parents to you, or to buy your products or services for their parents as a gift.

Choose a business structure.,
Register your business name.,
Get a tax ID number.,
Apply for all necessary licenses and permits.,
Consult an attorney or accountant.",How to Start a Business Working with Seniors3," In the United States and many other countries, you have the choice of organizing your business as a corporation or a limited liability company (LLC), or running it as a sole proprietorship.Which structure you choose typically depends on how big you want your business to be and how many people you expect will be involved.
In most cases, an LLC will be your best option. It gives you the same limited liability protection of a corporation, so it shields your personal assets from being reached by business creditors. But it doesn't have as many formal requirements as a corporation does, and you don't have to have a lot of other people involved in the running of the business.
If you're starting your business smaller, or plan on running it as a side business while you work full time, you may simply want to operate as a sole proprietorship. This generally means that your business isn't separate from your personal assets, however, so if you own your own home or have significant assets, you may prefer the protection of an LLC even if the business itself is relatively small.

, In the United States and many other countries, you must register the name of any business you want to establish in a given area. Registration ensures you have a unique name that can't be confused with any other business operating in the same general area.In the U.S., you typically will register your business name in the state where you plan to operate your business. You'll pay a fee, typically less than $100, to gain exclusive access to the name you've chosen.
Depending on the creativity of the name you've chosen, you also might want to consider getting it trademarked.

, In most countries, including the United States, you must get a tax ID number for your business so you can pay the business's taxes. In the U.S., this number is called an employer identification number (EIN), but you must get one regardless of whether you have any employees.To get an EIN for a U.S. company, all you have to do is go to the IRS website at irs.gov and answer a few questions. Your EIN will be issued immediately at no cost to you.
If you're located in another country, contact your country's tax agency to determine how to get a tax ID for your business so you can meet the appropriate tax responsibilities.
Once you have your tax ID number, you'll be able to open business bank accounts, as well as apply for credit cards if you want or think you'll need them., You'll typically need various licenses and permits to operate your business legally. What you need will depend on where your business is located and what kinds of goods or services you're providing.For example, if you want to work with seniors on their home improvements, you may need a general contractor's license or similar state permits. If you plan to pay house calls to help seniors with financial matters, you may need an accounting certification or other professional licensing.
Your local small business association typically will have the information you need regarding any required licenses or permits and the fees you must pay to get them.
In the United States, you can get information regarding required licenses and permits for businesses in all 50 states by visiting the website of the federal Small Business Association (SBA) at www.sba.gov. You'll also find links to the state agencies that provide these licenses and permits.

, In most cases, accounting and tax preparation software will be all you need during the first few years of your business. However, it may be worth talking to a professional if you anticipate things could bet complicated, or if you have difficulty handling financial and legal matters.It can be difficult to know exactly when you need to keep a legal or financial professional on retainer until it's too late and you're already in over your head. For this reason, it's a good idea to consult someone while you're still in the planning stages of your business.
An attorney or accountant can advise you on what kinds of things you can do yourself, and whether you require continued assistance. This also helps you establish a good working relationship with a professional you trust.

Be able to identify anxiety in the elderly.,
Start with the primary care physician.,
Obtain a mental health referral.,
Recognize how medications affect aging bodies.,
Consider therapy.",How to Treat Anxiety Disorders in Elderly People1," Sometimes, it can be hard to distinguish anxiety from ordinary worries that pop up in day-to-day life, or even an elderly person’s usual personality. In general, serious anxiety may be detected based on the person’s perceived distress and whether their overall functioning is affected.


Symptoms in elderly people may often show up as physical complains like headaches, fatigues, and gastrointestinal problems. Family and friends may also ask whether an elderly person has been having chest pains, experiencing difficulty eating or sleep, and no longer enjoying their typical interests. All of these may point to anxiety.The most common anxiety disorder seen in elderly populations is generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD.GAD may be characterized by extreme worry about issues such as health problems, financial concerns, or living arrangements, even when there is little or no cause for worry.;
, Treatment for anxiety in elderly populations should start with a visit to a primary care physician. In most cases, an elderly person will have already built rapport, or a relationship, with this doctor. Therefore, the elder may feel more comfortable discussing symptoms and accepting necessary treatment.If you are a family member or friend, it may be helpful to attend a doctor’s appointment with your elderly loved one and share your concerns about anxiety. Tell the doctor what symptoms you have observed and express your commitment to helping your loved one get the help he or she needs.
Start the conversation by saying ""I'm wondering if Mom isn't suffering from anxiety. I've noticed her complaining about a lot of aches and pains lately. She also seems to have trouble sleeping.""

, The doctor may ask various questions to learn more about your loved one’s anxiety symptoms. If the primary care doctor agrees that the elderly person is experiencing anxiety, he or she will likely provide a referral to a mental health provider like a psychiatrist or psychologist. Questions your elderly loved one may expect to answer about anxiety include:


”Has something happened recently that causes you to worry or fret?”
”Are you having a hard time putting worries or fears out of your mind?”
”Have you spotted a pattern that causes you to feel anxious (e.g. after going to a doctor or after a thinking about death)?”
”What was on your mind when you noticed that your heart was racing?”
”What are you thinking about when you can’t sleep?”, At the mental health appointment, the provider will discuss treatment options, such as taking medications. For instance, the most common classes of medications used to treat GAD are antidepressants, benzodiazepines (e.g. anti-anxiety drugs), and buspirone (e.g. another type of anti-anxiety drug). It’s important to carefully discuss whether medications are right for your elderly loved one and to consider how they will affect someone who is older in age.


The same medications given to younger people may not be effective for individuals with late-life anxiety. The doctor should consider your loved one's age when prescribing medications to treat anxiety.The doctor will also need to consider any other medications your loved one is taking that may interact with these new meds.

, Many doctors may not suggest psychotherapy, but this may be a viable option to include in your loved one's anxiety treatment plan. In younger age groups, GAD has been shown to be effectively treated with a special type of therapy known as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). However, some research suggests that CBT may not be as effective in treating late-life GAD.Still, there are many other therapeutic approaches to consider with your loved one's doctor.


Other forms of therapy shown to be useful in treating anxiety include acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and exposure therapy. The type of anxiety your loved one is experiencing will inform the doctor’s decisions on what type of therapy to try.

Come to terms with impending death.,
Develop strategies to prevent falls.,
Take an active role in long-term care solutions.",How to Treat Anxiety Disorders in Elderly People2," It is common for individuals to worry about death as they age. An elderly person may have to adjust to various friends and loved ones dying. Although it is virtually impossible to be entirely accepting of one’s own mortality, there are some strategies an elderly person can try to alleviate some of their concerns regarding death.Tie up loose ends. Having things left unsaid in relationships can contribute to anxiety. An elderly person may find it beneficial to reach out to those he or she has hurt and try to make amends. This can lessen worry about impending death. Recommend that your loved one talk to estranged friends and family members. Say ""Mom, I know you are still upset about what happened between you and Joyce. I think it would give you peace to talk to her about it.""
One of the best ways to ease concerns about death is to fully live in the present. A person is less likely to have regret as they age if they make use of their time by enjoying hobbies, traveling, and spending time with loved ones. Encourage the elderly person whom you help care for to take advantage of these activities and to regularly participate in them.
Have a conversation about their wishes. Preparing a will, making funeral arrangements, and expressing last wishes to friends and family may also remove some of the fears your loved one has about death. Suggest that you sit down and talk by saying ""Mom, you are getting older and I want to make sure your affairs are in order. Let's talk about them...""

, A common worry among older individuals is falling. This can happen in elderly persons who have experienced falls in the past or in those who simply notice themselves having difficulties with mobility. Falls can result in serious injury and may lead to greater worry among the elderly. Therefore, fall prevention should be a top priority. Try these strategies:Stay active. Exercise improves strength, flexibility, coordination and balance.
Change footwear. Shoes with high heels or slick soles can increase the chance of falls. Choose proper-fitting, durable shoes with nonskid soles.
Clear the home of hazards. Debris or spills on the floor, coffee tables, loose rugs, slipper bath mats, and unstable flooring can all increase falls.
Keep the home well-lit. Your loved one can avoid tripping over objects if the living space is adequately lit.
Get an assistive device, if needed. Buy a cane or walker. Install hand rails on stairways and in the shower or tub.

, Whether it is fretting over retirement savings or being worried about assisted living placement, you can relieve some of these worries by helping an elderly person make choices that suit their interests. Talking to a financial advisor may ease concerns about money, while visiting facilities before a move is necessary may help them feel more comfortable about long-term placement.


Listen to what the elderly person seems to be most concerned about and come up with ways you can help the person address these concerns. Helping them sort through matters like this can bring about a greater sense of control and peace about the future."

Maintain social connections.,
Take care of physical health.,
Quit smoking and drinking.,
Practice self-care.",How to Treat Anxiety Disorders in Elderly People3," Social isolation is often a symptom of late-life anxiety. However, taking measures to ensure that an elderly person is engaged in social activities can counter anxiety and increase their life satisfaction. Retiring from work, losing loved ones to death, and having family members move away all reduce an elderly person’s social connectedness. Increase your loved one's social capital by:


Encouraging them to talk to a trusted friend or loved one. Confiding in a close friend, sibling, counselor, or spiritual advisor can increase an elderly person’s sense of connection and serve as an outlet for stress and anxiety.
Suggesting a move to a community for seniors.Living nearby to others who are aging and in a community where elders have assistance and support can lead to greater life satisfaction.
Helping them find a place to volunteer. Whether it’s reading to kids at a local daycare or planting a community garden, volunteering can produce a host of positive benefits.Helping them join a club or organization dedicated to a hobby. Doing something that they love and improve fulfillment in elderly populations. Doing it in a group setting increases connection and contentment.
Recommending a class. It’s never too late to learn something new. Learning a new skill in a group setting, such as pottery, can help an elderly person feel purposeful and lead to friendships.

, Making an effort to preserve health in later years can reduce anxiety indicators and improve well-being. Even if an elderly person already has a chronic medical condition, it is still essential that they follow the basic principles of healthy living. Your loved one should maintain a healthy diet, get regular exercise, strive for 7 to 9 hours (or more) of sleep each night, and take supplements and medications as prescribed by a doctor.Ensure that your loved one consumes a diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean sources of protein, and low-fat dairy. Encourage them to drink plenty of water. They should also take medications on time and take any supplements that may help with their medical conditions.
Suggest that the whole family get active. Go with your loved one to a group fitness class at the gym. Go for a swim. Strive to include your loved one in any physical activities that match their physical abilities.
Help your loved one create a healthy sleep routine. This should allow them to go to sleep and rise at the same times each day. Suggest winding-down activities to help them go to sleep like taking a warm bath, reading a book, knitting, or listening to music.

, If an elderly person is smoking or consuming alcohol, now is the time to stop. Not only do these habits increase risk of cancer, organ damage, or disease, but they also may exacerbate anxiety. It is never too late to quit these unhealthy habits, and potentially enrich an elderly person’s later years.


Quitting smoking lowers risk of heart attack and improves lung function in older adults—as soon as 2 week to 3 months after cessation.Drinking alcohol with certain medications can increase risk of stomach or intestinal bleeding as well as living damage. What’s more, drinking alcohol with anxiety or anti-depressant medications, sleeping pills, or pain pills can be life-threatening.

, Counteract the desire to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol by developing a personal self-care plan. Create a multi-faceted toolbox of strategies an elderly person can use to fight stress and relieve anxiety and worry. Self-care strategies can lead to greater physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health and well-being.Practices to consider may be taking medicines and supplements, eating fruits and vegetables, walking around the neighborhood, meditating, going shopping, reading a good book, or watching a funny movie. Sit down with your elderly loved one and come up with a list of strategies he or she can turn to regularly to minimize anxiety.

Set up your cart.,
Head to the ice chest.,
Take your cart to the juice bar, and fill the glasses up with water.,
Head into the dining room.,
Get your cups straight.,
Know your tables.,
Remember that Dinner time, is dinner time.,
Understand that this is their dinner time.",How to Set up a Dining Room at the Nursing Home for Dinner," The first thing that must be done is setting up your cart to take into the dining room. The first thing that you do is set up your glasses, plastic glasses, cloth napkins (unless otherwise stated), and silverware.;
, The next thing you do is take your cart of things over to the ice chest. Here, you’ll fill up your glass cups with ice for their water (the CNA staff takes care of the other drinks), at least halfway.

, Leave at least half an inch of space between the water and the rim of the cup, that way we can try to avoid any unnecessary spills.

, You start going from table to table, first placing a napkin down, putting down a knife, then fork, then the spoon, and roll it up nice and tight, so it looks neat, not sloppy. Then, you ask the resident if they would like water, if so, give them their water, and any extra glasses they may need for other drinks (i.e milk, juice, tea).

, Some residents may need special cups. Some people, make need to use plastic cups, because they are a lot less heavy than glass cups, so they can hold them better, or, they need help with being fed, and drop things easily, so this way, nothing breaks.

, Most of the time, the residents are seated within a certain group. Most however, sit with whoever they want. There may be a table for choke risk’s, they will be the people that the CNAs and nurses need to be closer to, just in case of any accidents. The other types of tables, (where the CNAs will more than likely be unless needed elsewhere) is the “feeder” table. These are people who need a little extra help eating, or just need to be fed.

, This is the part where you go from table to table, serving them their dinner. This can sometimes get complicated, but some residents may not like what you are having for dinner than night, and may start a problem. The best way to avoid this is know what your residents likes and dislikes are, and if need be, offer alternatives, if alternatives are not already provided.

, The residents like to have fun, and they like to feel like they are welcome, and it’s THEIR home. Be respectful to the resident, help where needed, and give the resident what they need. However, it is okay, and well recommended to have fun with them. They love it when you’re having fun, joking, and laughing around with them.

Look for a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) verified product.",How to Boost Your Health with Garlic," Include at least one serving—or a ½ clove—in your meal plan every day.Many people like to cook garlic in their dishes, but raw garlic is just as tasty. Having a mixture of raw and cooked garlic is the best way to get the health benefits of this vegetable. Crushing, chopping, or mincing garlic can best release the compounds that benefit for your health.Eating raw garlic can also have additional benefits to cooked garlic. This includes relaxing smooth muscles in your blood vessels, which in turn dilates them and may lower your blood pressure.Some ways to enjoy raw garlic include:

Understand the mechanics behind a toilet.,
Consider a gravity-assisted toilet.,
Consider a pressure-assisted toilet.,
Consider a vacuum-assisted toilet.,
Consider a power-assisted toilet.,
Consider a dual flush toilet.,
Determine the toilet's flushing power.,
Check out the toilet's gallons used per flush.,
Compare one-piece and two-piece models.,
Evaluate the shape of the toilet seat.,
Choose a toilet height that's easy to use.,
Always buy a toilet with the correct rough-in.,
Consider any other preferences before you purchase.",How to Buy a Toilet," When you flush a standard toilet, the handle pulls up a chain, which raises a flush valve. This flush valve then releases at least two gallons (about 7.5 litres) of water from the tank into the bowl in about three seconds, which triggers the siphon to suck the contents of the bowl down the drain and into a sewer system or septic tank. However, contrary to popular belief, the tank is not the most important part of a toilet's technology. In fact, you could detach the tank from the toilet and pour two gallons of water into the bucket by hand, and the toilet would still flush.;
, This type is the most common type in North America. These toilets use the weight and height of the water in the tank to facilitate a flush. The tank then refills via a small gushing pipe (usually plastic) until a float shuts off the flow. If any water does happen to flow a little higher from gushing, hand-motion inside, or even an earthquake, a narrow overflow tube handles any overflow problems. So, as long as the toilet is functioning properly, no water should spill outside of the porcelain tank. This type is the staple toilet, simple, effective, and durable.The flushing sound for gravity assisted toilets also isn't particularly loud and they are easy to repair. However, if you have a lot of people using your toilet (say, a large family) or are going to be putting a lot of wear on the toilet's flush system, gravity-assisted toilets may not have enough power to flush consistently, after every use.Think about purchasing a standard gravity-assisted toilet if you have a small family or a bathroom that will be getting minimal use.

, Unlike gravity assisted, pressure-assisted toilets have an ‘active’ rather than a passive mechanism. This type adds pressure to the force of gravity by supplying more force than the traditional unit. Water displaces air inside a sealed cylindrical tank, usually made of metal or plastic, inside the larger ceramic tank, helping to generate a larger force.However, because the water in the tank is held under pressure, it flushes with greater force, resulting in a loud flushing sound. As well, a greater amount of pressure via your toilet can put stress on older pipes and plumbing in your home, which can lead to a leak or a busted pipe.Go for a pressure-assisted toilet if you live in a newer building or a home with new, well kept pipes, and low water pressure.

, This type innovates on the standard gravity-assisted toilet by using a vacuum that draws the water with more force into the bowl using the rim holes in the upper toilet bowl. Vacuum-assisted toilets have a cleaner, quieter flush than other models, making them ideal for a bathroom near your bedroom, or by a quiet area of your home. However, unclogging this type of toilet requires some time and skill. To unplug the bowl, you have to take the lid off and put your hand over an opening in the tank for the plunging action to work. The vacuum-assisted toilet also costs about $100 more than a gravity toilet.


Think about getting this type if you're looking for a toilet with quiet but powerful flushing, and are willing to spend some extra money up front.

, This type uses an even greater force than vacuum-assisted toilets. In fact, power-assisted toilets are known as the only ""toilets with horsepower"".These toilets have a 0.2 horsepower motor in the tank to literally blast waste products down the drain, making them ideal if your bathroom has old pipes. Power-assisted toilets can also save the average family 2,000 gallons of water per year. However, these toilets have a pump that must be plugged into a power outlet, they are known for their incredibly loud flushing sound and they are currently the most expensive type of toilet on the market.Think about purchasing a power-assisted toilet if you're in need of a model with a super powerful flush, regardless of upkeep or cost.

, These toilets have two buttons on the tank, one for a half tank flush, the other for a full tank flush (obviously, you utilize either flush based on your needs). Originally invented in Australia to respond to the country's constant drought cycle, dual flush toilets are just starting to gain popularity in North America, and have the best water conservation system of any other models. In fact, studies have shown that a dual-flush toilet uses an average of just 6.9 gallons per day, compared to 9.5 gallons of a low-flow toilet and 19 gallons with the older models. This type can save a household 2,250 gallons of water per a year, and because there are two flushing options, you have the choice between a lighter sounding flush and a louder sounding flush.However, this type has a high up front price tag, and high installation costs.


Go for a dual flush toilet if you're looking for an eco friendly, option friendly toilet. Keep in mind that the long term benefits of a dual flush toilet in terms of water savings may be worth the initial cost.

, Finding a toilet that flushes effectively without clogging is essential. But, a toilet with less water usage does not always mean it has less flushing power than another model.The ideal toilet would have great waste removal and high clog resistance.


To learn about the flushing performance of a specific toilet, use the Maximum Performance (MaP) Test at the Alliance For Water Efficiency website.Most major hardware and houseware stores label their selection of toilets with a numerical score based on their flush performance, taking into account waste removal power and clog resistance., Current toilet models use 1.6 gallons per flush (GPF), which is about half the amount of water used by older toilets.


Toilets with a Water Sense label use just 1.28 GPF and received approval as a high-efficiency toilet (HET) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). More information about the WaterSense Program is available at the EPA's website., Your preference for each model may depend on the set up of your bathroom, and your preferred aesthetic or design.


One-piece models are designed so the tank and the bowl are integrated into a compact unit, making them easy to clean and ideal for smaller bathrooms where you need to save space. However, these models can be more expensive than the standard two-piece model.
Two-piece toilet models are the more traditional design of a separate bowl and tank. They are more affordable than one-piece models, and are cheaper to install. However, they take up more space and are more difficult to clean.

, Most toilet seats are available in two shapes: elongated and round. Elongated seats are more comfortable, as their shape adds room and comfort, especially for adult. Round seats are about 2 inches (5.1 cm) shorter, which may work better in cramped bathrooms or with smaller individuals and young children., Small children will be comfortable with the standard height of 14–15 inches (35.6–38.1 cm). The Comfort Height toilet models are 17 to 19 inches (43.2 to 48.3 cm) off the floor and 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) taller than regular-height toilets. Comfort Height toilets meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), making them ideal for seniors and those with a disability.

, This is the distance between the outlet pipe for the toilet and the wall behind the toilet. Toilet models are available in various sizes to fit different rough-ins, so choosing the right size is crucial.


To determine the size of your toilet rough-in, measure from the wall behind the toilet to the bolt caps of your current toilet. Do not include baseboards in your measurements.Most toilets are available in a 12-inch rough-in, which is the standard distance, but a 10- or 14-inch rough-in may be needed in some homes.

, For example, a toilet with an antimicrobial glaze finish will inhibit the growth of bacteria inside the bowl. And if you can't stand the clanking sound when a standard toilet seat is put down, a self-closing toilet seatmay be a good option. Like anything, there is always the option of a fully custom toilet or a bidet. Keep in mind that a design choice like a unique toilet colors can make a statement in your bathroom, but they will cost more than a standard white model.

Have the child write a thank-you note to the tooth fairy.The child can leave the note under his or her pillow the next night, and you can pick it up then.,
Be considerate if your child wants to know more about the tooth fairy.",How to Be the Tooth Fairy," Many people choose to leave the tooth under a pillow. You can even use a special tooth-shaped pillow, if you can find one, or a pillow with a pocket sewn in it to hold the tooth.


You can also ask the child if he or she would rather leave a tooth somewhere else.
Another common place to leave the tooth is in a glass of water.After the tooth is removed during the night, you can tell the child that the tooth fairy jumped in and swam down to get it.;
, Some children might be curious, excited, or even nervous about the idea of the tooth fairy. For instance, your child might dream about the tooth fairy, or wonder what it looks like, or be scared of the idea of something visiting his/her room and taking teeth. Let your child talk about his/her feelings, and reassure him or her that the tooth fairy is nice, won't be scary, and loves leaving gifts for children.


Other children may have told your child scary things about the tooth fairy. If your child seems afraid of the idea, ask what other people have told him/her about the tooth fairy.
Some children feel better if allowed to leave a note for the tooth fairy instead of the actual tooth.If your child really doesn't like the idea of the tooth fairy, don't force the ""visit.""

, This note can tell the tooth fairy what the child has done to take good care of his or her teeth, and any other special messages the child would like to leave.

, Then, tell the child that you will deliver the note to the tooth fairy, or that he or she can leave the note under a pillow and the tooth fairy will pick it up.


Let the child try to decide what to say to the tooth fairy. If he or she can’t decide, help by suggesting something like: “Dear Tooth Fairy. My (first, second, etc.) tooth fell out but I can’t find it now. You can see that there’s a hole in my mouth where it used to be. I hope you come to see me. Love, (child's name).”, Most tooth fairy visits leave behind $1 to $5, with an average of $3.Really, however, it’s the thought that counts—even a nice note left under a pillow can mean a lot to a child.The tooth fairy doesn’t have to leave money—it could be a note, a book, candy, a small toy, etc. instead.
If you write a note, you can use a fancy pen or special handwriting, or dust the note with glitter—anything to make it look like it came from the tooth fairy.
The tooth fairy can also leave behind a toothbrush, floss, or other objects to encourage good dental hygiene.
Some people like to leave a special certificate from the tooth fairy congratulating the child on losing the tooth. You can find templates for these certificates online.,


For instance, the note could say: “Dear So-and-So: Wow! You’re growing up so fast! I was so surprised that you lost your (first/second/etc.) tooth already that I didn’t have time to pick up your gift, but I promise to visit again soon! Love, the Tooth Fairy”

, Wait until the child is fast asleep, then quietly slip into his or her room. Gently remove the tooth, and then place the gift (money, letter, toy, toothbrush, etc.) under the pillow or in some other location.


You may want to let your child stay up a little later on the night the tooth fairy visits. That way, you will be less likely to accidentally wake him/her when you take the tooth and leave a gift.
You can suggest that your child leaves the tooth under another pillow next to the one he or she will lay his/her head on. This will make it easier for you to take the tooth and leave the gift without waking the child. You can even tell your child it will be easier for the tooth fairy to get under the pillow this way.
If the tooth was placed in a glass of water, instead of fishing the tooth out, just bring in another, identical glass of water and remove the one with the tooth. That way, you will be able to act quickly and quietly.

, Some like to save the first tooth a child loses (or all of them) as a special memento. If you want to save the tooth, make sure to store it in a safe place where it won’t get lost or damaged.

, This is a good way to teach gratitude and good communication skills.

, If the child asks if the tooth fairy is real, ask him or her “Why do you ask?” or “Why do you want to know?” Sometimes, the child just wants to be reassured.If the child really wants to know the truth, you can explain how much fun kids have anticipating the tooth fairy, and how parents and other caregivers love to see children happy because the tooth fairy “visited” them.


You can also let your child know about traditions in other countries; for instance, in Spain, a mouse named Ratocinto Perez visits instead of a fairy.Interesting facts like this can make the “truth” about the tooth fairy more fun.

Brush your teeth.,
Floss daily.,
Use mouthwash.,
Wash your hands.,
Use flushable wipes.,
Shower frequently.,
Shampoo your hair.,
Cleanse your face.,
Change your feminine products often.",How to Avoid Common Hygiene Mistakes1," You should brush your teeth multiple times a day. Most dental hygiene experts suggest brushing 2 times daily, after breakfast and before you go to bed. This will help prevent tooth decay, gum disease, and bad breath.To make sure that your overall oral hygiene is at its best, you should also floss daily.


You should try to use toothpaste with fluoride because it will help strengthen your teeth and promote a healthy mouth. You can also use a mouth wash with fluoride as well.When you brush your teeth, you should also clean the rest of your mouth. Ignoring your tongue, the roof of your mouth, or the insides of your cheeks can leave harmful bacteria in your mouth that can cause hygiene problems. Run your brush over all the surfaces in your mouth and scrub the surface of your tongue with the bristles every time your brush your teeth.
Replace your toothbrush every three months. This will ensure that your brush is the most effective it can be for the best oral hygiene possible.See your dentist regularly for check-ups. Most dentists recommend twice a year, but your dentist can recommend a schedule that's best for you.;
, Along with brushing your teeth, you should floss every day. This will help combat bad breath and cavities. Each day, you should pull floss between each of your teeth and run it along the edges. Make sure you reach your back teeth as well.Don't snap the floss against your gums. This may cause them to bleed, which you don't want.
If your gums always bleed when you floss, you may have an underlying dental issue. You should see your dentist.

, One way to ensure that you have extra minty breath all day long is to use mouthwash. It helps prevent bacteria and can help fight cavities as well. Swish it around your mouth after each time you brush. You can also use it after meals if you can't brush your teeth to help get rid of odors lingering in your mouth.


You should never use mouthwash to replace brushing your teeth or prevent underlying causes of bad breath. It is only used to help add a minty smell to your breath and help your other oral hygiene methods., To keep up personal hygiene, you need to make sure that you wash your hands often. Not washing hands often enough is one of the most common hygiene mistakes people make. Common situations where you need to wash your hands are after you go to the restroom, after you sneeze, before you prepare food or drinks, before you eat, and after handling objects that are handled by many others. This helps keep you clean as well as stop the spread of germs and bacteria that lead to illness.


When washing hands, you should lather your soap covered hands in warm water for at least 20 seconds. Make sure to rub around your fingers and nails. This ensures that the soap has time to kill any germs on your hands. You should then rinse the soap off with warm water and dry them with a disposable towel or use an air dryer.If you want to further prevent the spread of germs, you should sneeze into your elbow. This helps cover more of your nose and mouth and keep the germs from your hands.

, Disposable wipes are not just for babies anymore. If you are feeling slightly unfresh, you can use one of these wipes to clean yourself if you cannot get to a shower. They are also good to use if you have to defecate and want to freshen up afterwards.


You can find these at grocery or general stores. They are in the adult hygiene aisles., To keep yourself clean, fresh, and smelling pleasant, you should shower or take a bath daily or every two out of three days. This is the best way to prevent unnecessary body odors as well as prevent the build up of bacteria or germs on your skin. There are some recent studies that suggest that taking a day off from showering every few days is healthy for the skin and helps promote healthy bacteria growth on your skin. Make sure you wash every part of your body, including every part of your feet and behind your ears.


If you go to the gym, commute on public transit, or come into contact with sick people daily, you should shower every day to avoid the spread of germs and to maintain cleanliness.Make sure you wash your belly button. It may be an area that you forget about, but numerous odor causing bacteria can grow there.If body odor is a constant concern for you, ask your doctor about an antibacterial body wash.

, You should wash your hair 2-3 times a week. For most people, it can be harmful to your hair if you wash it every day. If you wash it daily, you can wash out the natural oils in your hair, causing it to break and become damaged. If you have excessively oily hair, however, it may be necessary to wash your hair daily.


The amount of times a week that your hair should be washed can be different for every person. Be aware of what your hair smells like and pay attention to how oily it gets. Keep a check on your hair to assess how often you should wash it.If you work out, do sporting events, or take part in any other activity that causes your scalp to sweat profusely, you should wash your hair more often.

, As part of a good overall hygiene routine, you should wash your face every morning and every night. This helps get all the impurities off of your face from the day and any oil that accumulated on your face overnight. It also helps you remove any makeup, moisturizer, or sunscreen that you may have put on your face throughout the day. Washing your face prevents acne and will give you a clean, brighter appearance every day.


Make sure you pick the right cleanser for you. Not every person's skin is the same, so try a few different kinds until you find the cleanser that works for you. If you need some help, talk to your doctor or pharmacist, who can help you find the right cleanser for your skin.
You should moisturize after your wash your face. This will help prevent dry, irritated skin and promote skin health., If you are a female and you are on your period, you need to change your feminine products (such as pads or tampons) often. If you do not, this may lead to spills and leaks on yourself and your underwear. If this happens, you should wash yourself or find some kind of wipe to help clean you until you can shower.


Changing your products frequently will make you feel cleaner and help prevent odors.
If you find that you smell slightly during your period, you can get feminine deodorizing sprays that are specifically designed for these situations. Apply them according to the instructions on the bottle. Don't apply sprays directly to your genital area, as they can cause irritation.

Wear deodorant.,
Avoid overly fragrant scents.,
Wash and change your clothes.,
Change your sheets weekly.,
Use foot powder.,
Watch what you eat.",How to Avoid Common Hygiene Mistakes2," To avoid smelling when your body naturally sweats everyday, you should wear deodorant. This will help cover up and block the musty smell of sweat and keep you cleaner. You can also buy antiperspirant, which helps prevent your from sweating and dries up the sweat when you do. Many brands offer a combination antiperspirant/deodorant.


There are many different types of deodorant and antiperspirant, some targeted to girls and some targeted to boys. You can pick whichever works best for you. Some scents may be too overbearing or not work well with your body chemistry. Just keep trying until you find one that is subtle, keeps your dry, and makes you smell good.If you have trouble with excessive sweating, or you continue to have body odor problems despite good hygiene, talk to your doctor. You may have an underlying condition that requires treatment.

, You want to smell good, but it is just as bad to smell too much like perfume or cologne. When you pick a fragrance, you should find a scent that is pleasing, but not overwhelming. If it is stronger than some, you should apply it lightly, putting on just enough for people to smell it but not for it to be overpowering.Don't use sprays to cover up body odor smells. They should be used to make you smell nice, but not to try to cover up body smells. If you are experiencing body odor, you should find the cause and take care of it instead of trying to cover it up.

, In order to promote good personal hygiene, you should change your clothes daily. You should also wash your clothes often to ensure they are clean and smell fresh. Most clothes can be worn at least two times before you wash them, with the exception of socks and underwear. However, if you think that your clothes have an unpleasant smell, do not wear them without washing them first.Any clothes you wear to the gym, while playing sports, or during any other activity where you sweat a great deal should always be washed after one use.

, Just like you need to change your clothes often, you need to change your sheets. You sweat at night and loose dead skin cells, and they can build up on your sheets over time. If you change your sheets frequently, you don't run the risk of sleeping in your dead skin every night or transferring the sweat smells from previous nights onto your skin while your sleep.


You should change your pillowcase more often. Your face has more oils and you may also drool overnight, which also builds up on your pillows as well., Smelly, sweaty feet can also promote infections like athlete's foot.Using a drying or an anti-fungal foot powder on your feet and in your shoes can help your feet stay drier and germ-free.

, Certain foods and beverages can cause body odor. Avoid foods with strong odors, such as garlic or onions, if you need to smell fresh. If you enjoy these foods, make sure to brush your teeth or rinse with mouthwash after eating if you're going to be in public.

Clip your nails.,
Brush your hair.,
Shave certain areas.,
Pluck unwanted hair.",How to Avoid Common Hygiene Mistakes3," Having poorly groomed nails can cause dirt and germs to get trapped underneath the nail beds. This is unhygienic and does not promote general cleanliness. You should cut your nails with manicure scissors or clippers whenever they are too long, jagged, or misshapen.


You should also try to keep your nails as dry and clean as possible. You can spread infection otherwise and bacteria can grow in constantly moist nails.
To help your nails become healthier, you should moisturize your nails frequently by rubbing lotion into your cuticles and nail beds.Don't cut or trim your cuticles. They help protect the nail bed., To give yourself a put together appearance, you should brush your hair daily. This removes snares and rats from your hair and makes it looks smooth and healthy. It also has the added benefit of spreading natural oils throughout your hair, which promotes hair health. It also cleans and stimulates the scalp.


Make sure your don't brush your hair too much. This can cause breakage and actually do more harm than good for your hair.If you have natural hair, use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to detangle before going to the brush. This will help avoid breakage., Having excessive body hair in certain areas can cause body odor or make you look unkempt. Shaving or maintaining your body hair can be an effective hygiene technique because it allows more air to reach the skin, which reduces the amount of odor that is held in the area. It also has the benefit of highlighting certain areas if your body hair is more sculpted or clean shaven. However, shaving is a personal choice, and you should choose what you're comfortable with.Common areas to shave or maintain are the underarms, the chest, the legs, the genital region, and the face. Shaving under the arms and shaving or maintaining hair in the genital region helps reduce odors. These areas are known to sweat profusely and the musty smell can build up in the hair if it is not properly maintained.
Maintaining or shaving chest, leg, and facial hair is an option, but is not necessary if you don't feel comfortable with it.Shave gently with the ""grain"" (i.e., shave in the same direction the hair is growing). Use shave gel or foam to avoid irritating the skin., There are some areas of the body that grow hair that isn't necessarily thick enough to shave. In these cases, you may need to pluck the hair to maintain your personal hygiene. Common areas where these kinds of hairs may arise are on the cheeks, the neck, and the eyebrows. There may also be cases where a dark stray hair may grow on any portion of the body.


Both men and women have this problem. The areas where the hair grows may be different, but the general need for personal grooming is the same.
To pluck the unwanted hair, use tweezers to grasp the hair tightly and pull it out. Continue until all the unwanted hair is gone."

Don't trim your toenails too short.,
Trim your toenails straight across.,
Wear shoes that fit properly.,
Consider wearing protective footwear.,
Be careful not to stub your toes.,
See a podiatrist on occasion.,
Soak your foot in warm water.,
Apply some antibiotic cream.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) medication.,
Place a cotton ball or dental floss under your ingrown toenail.",How to Avoid Ingrown Toenails," One of the main causes of ingrown toenails is trimming them too short. If you trim your toenails too short, the pressure put on the ends of your toes while walking (particularly if your shoes are too tight) can drive the sharp edges of the nail into the surrounding tissue.As such, keep toenails trimmed to a moderate length — so they're approximately even with the tips of your toes.


Nails should be cut with a clean, sharp nail trimmer that's made for thicker toenails, instead of the smaller ones that are more appropriate for fingernails.
Some people's toenails grow faster than others, but plan on trimming them every week or so.
Poor eyesight, inability to reach your toes due to belly fat, and/or having especially thick nails can make it challenging to properly trim toenails.If it's too difficult to trim your toenails, make an appointment with a podiatrist (foot specialist).;
, Another major cause of ingrown toenails is trimming them at angles along the sides to match the rounded shape of your toe, which allows the skin to grow over the nail's sharp edge and get irritated.As such, trim them straight across, or tell your pedicurist to do them that way, and you'll greatly reduce your risk of developing ingrown toenails — especially your big toes.


Picking or tearing at the corners of your toenails can also cause them to become ingrown.Some people's toenails are naturally curved or fan-shaped, which predisposes them to developing ingrown nails.
People who have particularly thick toenails have a lesser risk of ingrown toenails because the nails don't piece the surrounding skin as easily as thinner ones.

, Shoes that pinch or place too much pressure on the ends of your toes can also cause a toenail to grow into the surrounding tissue and become painful.Therefore, take care to buy and wear properly fitted shoes, especially if the shoes are for sports that involve a lot of running and stopping, such as soccer, basketball, football or tennis.


If you're unsure what size of shoes to wear, ask an experienced salesperson for a proper measurement/fitting and some advice about which types are best for the shape of your foot.
Wearing socks that are too thick can also crowd your toes and increase the risk of toe trauma and ingrown toenails.
Shoes that are overly loose and too big can increase the risk of ingrown nails, especially in the big toe because of it sliding around too much while walking and running.

, If your work puts you at significant risk of injuring your toes, then wear protective footwear, such as special steel-toed shoes or boots.Such shoes or boots will protect all of your toes from trauma, which increases the risk of ingrown and lost toenails — as most badly injured/bruised nails get discolored and simply fall off.


Jobs that warrant steel-toed shoes/boots include: construction worker, factory worker, mechanic, welder, fireman and park ranger.
Always buy shoes and boots made of breathable material, such as leather and suede, because sweaty feet makes the skin around your toenails soft and easier to pierce.In addition, wearing socks that help wick moisture away from the feet are helpful as well.

, Trauma to the ends of your toes typically causes swelling, which pushes the soft tissue into the edges of the sharp nails and increases the risk of ingrown toenails.As such, be careful walking around your home and consider wearing some hard toed slippers or ""house shoes"" for added protection just in case.


The legs of tables, chairs and beds are the most commonly stubbed pieces of furniture.
The big toe and the smallest (5th) toe are the ones most likely to get stubbed and injured.
Other preventative measures include making sure your floor is free of clutter, removing slippery rugs, and wearing your glasses or contacts if you need them to see clearly.

, If you have trouble properly taking care of your feet/toenails or if you have diabetes, see a physician or podiatrist for help and treatment on a regular basis (every three to six months).Diabetes leads to poor circulation and reduced sensation in the feet, which hampers your ability to feel if your toes are inflamed or if your shoes are too tight. Your podiatrist can make special shoes or orthotics (shoe inserts) that accommodate your feet and reduce the risk of toe trauma and ingrown toenails.


With diabetes, an ingrown toenail can become easily infected and then turn into a foot ulcer (difficult-to-heal open sore).Foot ulcers increase the risk of gangrene, which involves the death of tissue from lack of blood circulation.
Although people who give pedicures can often help with toenail trimming, they are no substitute for professionally trained foot specialists.

, Ingrown toenails should be treated at home as soon as they are recognized (before infection sets in), in order to prevent complications and the need for medical treatment. One of the easiest methods is to soak the affected foot in warm water for between 15–20 minutes, three to four times daily.Soaking can reduce swelling and relieve tenderness.


Consider adding some Epsom salt to your foot bath. It can help disinfect your ingrown toe and help soothe the pain and inflammation.
If your ingrown toe is still inflamed after the foot bath, apply an ice cube to it for about five minutes. The ice will numb the pain and combat the inflammation.

, Apply antibiotic cream, lotion or ointment to your ingrown toe at least a couple of times per day, particularly just before you go to bed in the evening.After the cream has absorbed into the soft tissue surrounding the toenail, apply a bandage. Make sure to change the bandage each time you apply the antibiotic ointment.

, If your ingrown toenail is particularly inflamed and/or painful, then consider taking some OTC medication for a few days. Anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) are likely best if you notice lots of swelling.Painkillers (also called analgesics) are likely better for pain without much swelling. The most common OTC painkiller is acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol).


Anti-inflammatories and analgesics should always be considered short-term strategies for pain control. Taking too many of them at a time or taking them for too long increases your risk of stomach, kidney and liver problems or even organ failure if taken in large quantities.If you have chronic kidney disease, heart failure, high blood pressure or stroke, or if you are taking anticoagulants, do not take ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories.
You can also try rubbing a cream/lotion/ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore toe. Menthol, camphor, arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving tenderness.

, After soaking your toenail in warm water and softening it up, put a piece of cotton ball or waxed dental floss under its ingrown edge.This will relieve the pressure on the surrounding skin and help the toenail grow above the edge of the skin. Try wetting the cotton with water and some antibiotic cream first before inserting.


Do not attempt this remedy unless directed to do so by a podiatry specialist.
Consider putting some coconut oil on the inflamed skin beforehand to soften the skin and help reduce the swelling. The cotton or dental floss will then slide under the nail easier.
Change the cotton or dental floss on a daily basis to keep the area antiseptic and to prevent a bacterial infection.

You probably weren't going to get a lot done at work or school with your head stuffed up, anyway. You're better off staying home, getting plenty of rest and fluids, and going back in a day or two when the symptoms subside.


Don't use all your sick days for playing hooky from work. They are there in case you are sick, and you don't want to be the boy who cried wolf when credibility with your boss and co-workers is at stake.
If there's something that can't wait, log in from home or telephone a colleague to cover for you while you're sick.
Remember, you'll just slow everybody down even more if you give this cold to several colleagues or classmates.;
, Even if you usually carry a handkerchief, use tissues for colds and dispose of them. Don't put them in your pocket.

, You should be doing this anyway, but take special care now. Remind others who live with you to do the same.

, Doorknobs, light switches, keyboards, mice, and telephones are good places to start, but watch what else you touch. This is a good job for one of those disinfecting wipes or a bit of spray cleaner on a soft cloth.

However, what exercises and times are best for you may vary depending on your overall health. Schedule an appointment with your doctor to see you are able to do a moderate exercise program to stimulate your immune system. This can ensure you are healthy enough for exercise, especially if you aren’t currently exercising. Your doctor can also give you tips on what activities are best for you.Talk to your doctor about your desire to boost immunity with exercise. Let the doctor know about any type of exercise or activity you already do.
Ask any questions you may have about your health and ability to do exercise. For example, you could say, “I want to start taking my overall health more seriously, especially boosting my immunity with exercise. I know I have some issues with my heart, but what type of exercise could I do without injuring myself or putting too much stress on my cardiovascular system?”;
, If you are healthy, you should aim to get at least 30 minutes of exercise daily. In general, 150 minutes of moderate exercise every week is enough to help boost your immunity. Keeping an exercise journal or using a smartphone app can help you track your workout time and progress.Incorporate moderate activities such as brisk walking, biking, and swimming. Recognize that activities such as your weekly golf game, playing with your kids, and even mowing the lawn count towards your daily exercise total.Assess your current workout plan. If you are already exercising or getting physical activity every day, you don’t need to add any extra time to boost your immunity., Busy schedules can make it difficult to get in a 30-minute chunk of time. You may also be new to exercise and unable to perform 30 consecutive minutes of activity. You can easily get in exercise by breaking it up into manageable amounts of time during the day.Try three 10-minute chunks of activity every day until you can do one consistent 30-minute session. You can also vary each activity to work different parts of your body. For example, you could do a 10-minute jog in the morning, a 10-minute brisk walk at lunch, and then go for a 10-minute bike ride with your kids in the evening.
Consider trying vigorous 10-minute bursts of exercise if you would like to add some intensity to your workout.

, Another great way to boost your immunity is to incorporate strength training into your exercise routine. Lifting weights, yoga, and Pilates are types of resistance training that can promote overall health and stimulate your immune system.Meet with a certified trainer if you are new to weightlifting or resistance training. This person can help you identify the best types of strength-training moves for you. The trainer can also show you how to properly perform the exercises.
Consider the following types of strength- or resistance training: weight machines, exercises with your body weight, resistance bands, yoga, Pilates, rock climbing, and swimming with resistance paddles.

, Moderate exercise is a great way to boost your immunity. But this doesn’t mean you should amp up your daily workouts. Prolonged and strenuous bouts of activity, such as running marathons or intense cardio or strength-training at the gym, can actually cause harm.Unless you are already performing long exercise sessions, keep your activity to moderate level and shorter times.Consider decreasing longer sessions to get the full immunity-boosting benefits of exercise.


Exercise for under 2 hours a day if possible. This may protect you from decreased immune function.

, If you’re feeling slightly sick, consider doing some light activity. It can boost your circulation and may help the cells and substances of your immune system work more efficiently.However, instead of diving straight into a workout, make sure that you’re not too sick to exercise. Easy ways to identify if you are healthy enough to do light exercise to boost your immunity include:Your symptoms are “above the neck,” such as runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or minor sore throat.
Your symptoms are not “below the neck,” such as chest congestion, hacking cough or upset stomach.
You are not fatigued or have widespread muscle aches.
You don’t have a fever.
You don’t have a stiff neck (which can be sign of meningeal irritation).
You don’t have enlarged spleen (which can happen with mononucleosis).

, If you are not too sick and want to workout, go easy on yourself. Reducing the time and intensity of your workout can help boost your immunity without making you feel worse.Switch up your usual routine and try an easier activity. For example, if you usually run, try brisk walking. Biking can be a good replacement for swimming.
Avoid pushing yourself, even if you feel fine while working out. This can increase your risk of more serious injury or illness.

, If you decide to exercise when you’re ill, it’s important to let your body guide you. Take breaks if you need to, or stop your workout if you feel worse.Remember to do a light warm up before your workout. This can help you gauge if you feel well enough to continue exercising.
Watch for symptoms such as rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, chest pain, wheezing, feeling faint, or worsening body aches. If you have any of these, stop exercising and seek medical attention., Rest is a key component to any exercise regimen as well as your immunity. No matter if you are sick or not, give your body a chance to rest and recover. This can help your body build muscle and heal.Give yourself at least one full day of rest to promote your immunity-boosting workouts. If you are sick, listen to your body. You may need a few days of rest and easy recovery walks to get better., The key to a healthy weight is a good diet. Healthy foods can also boost your immunity. Eat a nutrient rich and healthy diet in conjunction with your exercise to gain maximum benefits for your immunity.Balance your diet with healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, lean meats, and beans.
Remember to adequately hydrate. Drink at least 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day.

, If you drink alcoholic beverages, make sure you only drink in moderation.It can undermine your attempts to boost your immunity by increasing your risk for high blood pressure and kidney disease.Follow recommended guidelines for daily alcoholic beverage consumption. Men can have two or fewer drinks per day and women should drink no more than one.

, Stress can have a significant impact on your body’s ability to prevent and fight illness. Actively reducing stress or controlling situations that cause it can bolster your exercise attempts to boost immunity.Make a list of things that cause you stress. Figure out what you can do to actively reduce it or control stress-inducing elements. For example team meetings may contribute to your stress. Minimize how you react in this situation, such as sitting next to someone you like or responding only when someone calls on you.

Try to avoid mercury in fish.,
Restrict your intake of mercury fish.,
Eat less fish that high in PCBs.,
Check the pollutant information in areas you fish recreationally.",How to Avoid Eating Fish Containing Pollutants1," Mercury is most dangerous to small children and pregnant women, those are who should be most concerned about mercury in fish. Children under the age of six and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or who intend to get pregnant in the next year should:Avoid ahi, albacore, and bigeye tuna (depending on where they were fished), swordfish, shark, king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, and shellfish. You should also avoid tilefish, especially from the Gulf of Mexico.
Avoid any fish caught in any waters that are subject to a mercury advisory. To find current advisories, visit the Environmental Protection Agency website.
For local advisories, visit your state, county, or other local fish agency.;
, If you do eat fish that possibly contain mercury, restrict your intake. For example, the EPA recommends no more than ⅔ of a can of albacore tuna per week.Eat 12 ounces, or two to three meals, each week of fish that do not contain mercury., To reduce your exposure to PCBs, refrain from eating fish that have high levels of it. You can have around four ounces, or one meal, every week or two of black bass, carp, freshwater perch, grouper, halibut, lobster, mahi mahi, snapper, Spanish mackerel from the south Atlantic, tilefish from the Atlantic, and white croaker from the Pacific.Do not eat striped bass, blue fish, Chilean sea bass, king mackerel, marlin, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes and Canada.

, If you fish and want to eat what you catch, make sure you check local and government websites for any state or local fish consumption advisories. If you are fishing in an area where there are contaminated waters, refrain from eating the fish.If you are unsure about the waters you are fishing in, be safe and practice catch-and-release.

Buy wild caught fish.,
Purchase fish from a sustainable source.,
Check for the best choices.,
Know the best sushi to eat.",How to Avoid Eating Fish Containing Pollutants2," Only buy wild caught fish, not farmed fish. The aquaculture industry currently does not universally follow a number of recommendations designed to decrease the levels of various pollutants.

, Because only eating wild caught fish will eventually lead to fish depletion, agencies have set up sustainable sources. These sustainable sources, such as the Marine Stewardship Council, work with fisheries to keep oceans healthy while holding these fisheries to standards. Look for fish packages that have labels from a sustainable source., Keep a check on the Environmental Defense Fund’s Seafood selector as often as possible to find the best current choices.Currently, the best fish to eat are:


Albacore tuna from the US and Canada
Atlantic mackerel from Canada
Pacific sardines from the US and Canada
Sablefish/Black cod
Wild salmon from Alaska

, When you go to eat sushi, be aware of the best seafood to eat. The best choices for sushi are:Shrimp
Abalone
Yellowtail tuna
Clams, oysters, and scallops
Flounder and Sole
Halibut
Squid
Salmon
Tilapia
Lobster and crab
Sardines
Sea bass

Learn the dangers of mercury.,
Know about PCBs.,
Be aware of pesticide contamination.,
Check your mercury levels.",How to Avoid Eating Fish Containing Pollutants3," One of the main sources of mercury contamination is through fish.The highest risk for mercury poisoning is for the developing fetus, so pregnant mothers must be particularly careful when choosing fish.


Fish that the highest concentrations of mercury include saltwater fish like shark, swordfish, and tuna. Freshwater fish, such as pike, walleye, and bass, are also known to be potentially high in mercury.

, PCBs, used in electrical equipment, building materials, and to keep dust down on roads, were banned in the US in 1979. However, these cancer-causing chemicals are still found in foods, oceans, rivers, and soils. PCBs can be degraded by sunlight and by various microorganisms, but the process can be slow., Pesticides can be very difficult to track and are often not even tested for, likely because there are so many. Pesticide contamination is most common in freshwater fish with nearby agricultural runoff.

, Have your mercury blood levels checked every year, especially if you eat a lot of fish. If you intend to become pregnant and are concerned about mercury levels, avoid any of the fish listed for six to 12 months and get re-tested before trying to get pregnant.

,
Play it safe in airplane bathrooms.",How to Avoid Swine Flu on an International Flight," It's called the ""Swine"" flu virus because it's physiologically native to pigs, and there's practically no risk in eating properly cooked pork. It is also not a type of disease that stays with you until some genius finds a cure, although the flu can last a while. On an international flight, your main concern is how it spreads among humans: Someone infected expels droplets each time he or she coughs, sneezes, or speaks and anyone in direct contact or close proximity with the sick person can ingest the virus through breathing or touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, especially after touching an infected surface.;
, Hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and tissues are some really good things to take with you on a flight. The usefulness of face masks depends on many circumstances. You can kill its purpose if you end up rubbing your eyes a lot with dirty hands.

, A routine 30-second hand-wash with warm water, soap, and good scrubbing is a must, especially after groping those escalator handrails or check-in counters at the airport. Stay hydrated, stay fit, and get your sleep. Stay clean in general, don't touch too many publicly used surfaces. Have your family and children develop the same habits and supervise the little ones.

, In terms of swine flu, a fever is one of the big giveaways. Avoid close contact with anyone who looks fatigued, pale, or is sweating or coughing. If you are sitting next to someone you think is sick, politely request for a seat change.

,,,, Always wash your hands.

Charge the unit.,
Maintain the integrity of your brush.,
Prepare your toothbrush.,
Divide your mouth into four quadrants.,
Place toothbrush bristles along gum line.,
Brush from outer to inner tooth surfaces.,
Clean biting surfaces, your tongue, and soft palate.,
Brush gently and thoroughly.,
Floss between your teeth.,
Use an antiseptic mouth rinse.,
Store your toothbrush.,
Brush and floss twice daily.,
Avoid sugary and acidic foods and beverages.,
Use alcohol-free mouthwashes and toothpastes.,
Avoid grinding your teeth.,
Visit your dentist’s office regularly.",How to Use an Electric Toothbrush," You won’t be able to use an electronic toothbrush if your batteries are dead or it isn’t charged. Either keep the toothbrush cradled in its charger or change the batteries when you notice it's losing its power, which can help ensure that you can use the toothbrush most effectively. If you run out of power, then you can either continue brushing manually or get a regular toothbrush if you have one.


Store your toothbrush close enough to the sink so it is easy to reach, but far enough away that you won't accidentally knock it into the sink and get electrocuted if the toothbrush is plugged in.
Consider keeping extra batteries on hand so that you can always brush your teeth.;
, Your electric toothbrush should have soft, nylon, and round-ended bristles for the most effective brushing.These bristles can wear with regular use and you should inspect the brush regularly to maintain its integrity, which can help ensure that you get the best brush possible.Make sure the bristles don’t have any sharp or jagged edges or endpoints.Make sure that the bristles are not falling out.Also, check the colored bristles. If they start fading, it means that you should change the tip with a new one.
Replace your electronic toothbrush head every three to four months, or more often if you notice any of the above-mentioned issues., Run your toothbrush under some water and apply a pea-sized dab of toothpaste onto the brush.This can help prepare your toothbrush for the most effective cleaning of your teeth and oral cavity.You can also apply the toothpaste on your teeth while toothbrush is turned off to better spread the paste around your mouth.


Consider using a fluoride toothpaste, which can help strengthen your teeth and remove plaque that causes disease and decay.If you have sensitive teeth, consider using a fluoride toothpaste formulated to help minimize sensitivity., Dividing your mouth into top, left, right, and bottom quadrants to tackle your brushing routine. This can help ensure that you brush each section of your teeth and mouth cavity.


You can start with whichever quadrant you like or is most comfortable to you and you should spend about 40 seconds on each quadrant while brushing every single surface of your teeth.
Make sure to brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth.

, Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gum line. Keep the bristles in contact with your tooth surface and gum line, which can help ensure you get the most effective brush possible.Apply only gentle pressure, as too much can injure your teeth and gums. The vibrations of your electronic toothbrush can also add a little additional pressure., Maintaining the 45-degree angle, brush the outer surfaces of two to three teeth using a back and forth rolling motion.Once you’ve completed this procedure for a quadrant, move to the inner surfaces of your teeth and repeat the same procedure.The rolling motion is achieved by contacting the brush to the gum line and then moving downward with the toothbrush towards the chewing surface.Also, brush your gums with gentle pressure and avoid holding the brush for too long next to the gum line because the rotation can cause gum recession over time.
To brush behind your front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and make up and down strokes using only the front half of your brush., You’ll also need to brush your tongue and palate as well as the biting surfaces of your teeth.This can help remove debris and other odor-causing bacteria.


Use a gentle back and forth scrubbing motion to clean the biting surfaces and your tongue.Use an equally or more gentle back and forth motion to clean your soft palate, or the roof of your mouth.

, Spend at least two minutes brushing your teeth, or about 30 seconds per quadrant.Doing this at least twice a day can help prevent cavities and tooth decay by minimizing the debris and bacteria in your mouth.Pressing too hard can damage your gums or wear down your enamel.Wait 30 to 60 minutes after eating or drinking acidic foods to help maintain your enamel.This will provide plenty of time for the saliva to remineralize the enamel and create an alkaline environment. Instead, chew a piece of sugar-free gum that contains xylitol after meals and before brushing.

, Even with thorough brushing, dentists recommend flossing your teeth twice a day. This can help remove plaque and food particles from between your teeth that brushing couldn’t reach.Remove about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss from the packaging. Wrap it around your middle fingers.You can then grasp the floss between your thumbs and forefingers which can help you clean more effectively.Make sure to be very gentle when guiding the floss between your teeth. Curve it against your tooth when it hits your gumline.Rub the side of each tooth with the floss in an up and down motion.Try to remove the plaque formed under your gums and practice until you get the best results.
You may brush or floss first. Some studies have shown, however, that flossing before brushing may increase the efficacy of fluoride., After you have brushed and flossed, rinse out your mouth with some clean water and a mouthwash. Some studies have shown that mouthwash can reduce plaque and gingivitis and promote overall oral health. Mouthwash can also remove lingering particles of food or other germs.Swish around the water and mouthwash in your mouth.
Mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine are generally the preferred type of mouthwash. Products that contain alcohol may dry out your mouth and cause bad breath or even sores or ulcers., Once you’ve finished your brushing routine, rinse off the toothbrush head and return it to its storage unit. This can help maintain the integrity and life of your toothbrush. Remove the brush from the handle, and hold it under running water for a few seconds. Set it upright in its holder to dry.


Rinsing off your toothbrush with tap water will clean off any lingering toothpaste or debris.Avoid covering your toothbrush head, which can help promote the growth of bacteria.
Make sure you store the toothbrush in an upright position., Brushing and flossing each day as well as after meals may promote the health of your oral cavity. A clean environment may prevent cavities, infections, and stains.Brush and floss after meals if you are able. If you have food or other debris lingering in your teeth, it can promote infection and decay. Chewing a piece of gum may help minimize this risk if you don’t have a toothbrush available., Foods and drinks containing sugar or acid can contribute to oral decay, and watching your intake can help maintain your oral health. Cleaning your teeth after consuming these items may minimize your risk of tooth decay and infection.A healthy and well-balanced diet of lean protein, fruits and vegetables, and legumes can promote your overall well-being, including oral health.Raw fruits and vegetables are best. Raw fruits and vegetables stimulate your gums and your teeth providing good blood circulation which prevents decay, gum disease or even periodontitis. Also, stick to whole grain bread and avoid sugary foods to reduce the amount of acids.
Some otherwise healthy foods are acidic. This includes citrus fruits and wine. Continue to enjoy these foods and beverages, but reduce how much you consume and consider brushing your teeth 30 minutes after you’re done to prevent enamel loss.
Some examples of sugary and acidic foods and beverages of which to steer clear are soft drinks, sweets, candies, and wine.

, Mouthwashes and toothpastes that have alcohol may damage your enamel and overall oral health. Use toothpastes or mouthwashes that have no alcohol to minimize your risk for these problems., If you clench and grind your teeth, you may damage your teeth and mouth. If you're a tooth-grinder, talk to your dentist about wearing a mouth guard.Grinding can cause tooth sensitivity and damage including chips and cracks.Biting your nails, opening bottles or keeping objects between your teeth are also bad habits. Avoid these habits as much as possible so that you don’t damage your teeth.

, Schedule regular checkups with your dentist at least twice a year. If you are having issues with your teeth, see your dentist more often. This can help promote the health of your teeth and mouth, and catch any problems in their early stages so that they don’t become major issues."

Decide what to do with your pants.,
Stand over the toilet.,
Squat down.,
Do your business.,
Clean up.,
Dispose of waste paper properly.,
Flush the squat toilet.",How to Use a Squat Toilet," Before you can sit down, squat, and make use of the squat toilet you will need to deal with your clothes first. Similar to using a western toilet, you have to get your clothes out of the way before you can get to business. However, squat toilets can be difficult for a beginner who is still wearing their pants.


If you are new to squat toilets, it can be a good idea to fully remove your pants and underwear.
If you are comfortable with squatting, you can try to leave your pants on, simply lowering them to your ankles.;
, Once you have dealt with your pants in a way that you are most comfortable with, you will need to get into position over the toilet. Stand over the toilet with one foot on each side. Positioning yourself over the toilet in this way will allow you to be properly lined up when you begin to squat.


Face the right way, looking towards the hood of the squat toilet if it is present.
Try to position yourself closer to the hood if possible.
Avoiding squatting directly over the hole as this can splash water back up when using the toilet.

, After having lined your self up directly over the toilet you can squat down. Bend at the knees and gently lower yourself down into a deep squat. Your knees will be pointing straight up and your bottom should be directly over the toilet.Squat all the way down, positioning your bottom at about ankle level, close to the toilet.
If the squat is a difficult position for you, try hugging your knees for support.

, Once in the squat position it's time to relax and let nature take its course. Although this step isn't very different from using a western toilet, it has been demonstrated that squatting during a bowel movement can make it easier on the body. Just relax and do what you need to do., Once you are all done using the squat toilet it is time to clean up. Many places that use squat toilets may not use toilet paper, using instead a sprayer or a pot of water and your hand. Look around the squat toilet to find which method has been made available to you.Most pots of water will have a small ladle. Splash water using the ladle while wiping the area with your hand.
Using a sprayer is the same idea as the water pot and ladle. Spray water and wipe the area clean with your other hand.
You can bring toilet paper with you. However, many toilets may be unable to flush paper without clogging.

, If you used toilet paper to clean up after using the squat toilet you will need to properly dispose of it. Not all plumbing systems are equipped to deal with flushing toilet paper and it can cause serious damage to those systems. Always properly dispose of your toilet paper once you are done using a squat toilet.If there is a trash bin near the squat toilet, chances are it is intended for used toilet paper.

, Some squat toilets will have a handle and will flush like a western style toilet. However, many may not have this feature and you are still required to flush and clean up after you have used the toilet. Always leave the squat toilet looking clean for the next person.


Use the water bucket provided to make sure any waste is flushed down the toilet.
There may be a foot pedal that can be used to flush the squat toilet.
If there is a brush nearby use it to wipe away any footprints you may have left on the sides of the toilet.

,, Cancer cells feed off of glucose, which helps tumors grow faster and spread more rapidly throughout the body.Beware of hidden sugars in bread, salad dressings, and cooking sauces.


Opt for honey over white sugar when possible.
Stay away from artificial sweeteners. Ironically, both natural and synthetic sweeteners may be cancerous. Artificial sweeteners were linked with the onset of bladder cancer in animal subjects., This carcinogenic substance appears naturally in certain foods when cooked at a high temperature.Foods that are high in amino acids and/or carbohydrates are prone to developing acrylamide when fried, baked, or roasted.The following are examples of such foods:French fries.

, Studies have shown that people who eat fish like salmon four or more times per week are one-third less likely to develop blood cancers like leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma., Organic produce contains less pesticides and hormones, both of which have been shown to cause cell damage and eventually lead to cancer.Shop the organic section of your grocery store or visit your local farmer's market.
Remember that not all products that say ""all natural"" on them are organic. Read labels carefully.

, Research has shown that neem has potential as a cancer prevention agent.


Grind some neem in a paste.
Roll into a marble-sized ball and consume every day., Having a sedentary lifestyle greatly increases your risk of developing any kind of cancer. Regular exercise not only improves your overall health, it reduces your likelihood for cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.


For women, moderate physical activity reduces estrogen levels, which have been linked to breast cancer.Even a 30-minute daily walk can reduce your likelihood for developing this type of cancer.
If you work a desk job, be sure to incorporate exercise into your daily routine by either waking up early to work out, or using your break/lunchtime to take a brisk walk outside.
Consider requesting a standing desk at work, if possible.

, Women who contract the sexually transmitted infection human papillomavirus (HPV) have an increased likelihood of developing cervical cancer.There are two vaccines available to protect women from the most dangerous kinds of HPV.Starting at age 21, women should have routine check-ups with their gynecologists at least once a year.

Certain illnesses can be aided by home remedies, over the counter medicines, and simple treatments. Other, more serious illnesses, will require professional medical help.;
, If they've been prescribed a certain medicine from the doctor, make sure they get it on time. If they are taking over the counter painkillers or medication to ease cold and flu symptoms, make sure you ask them regularly whether they feel like they need another dose. Carefully read the information provided with the medication to make sure that they are taking the medicine properly. Some medications need to be taken with food and drink. Ensure that all directions are followed. Do not exceed the daily dosage limit. Common types of over the counter medication to consider are: Antihistamines
Decongestants
Cough medicine

, If the relative is frequently throwing up or suffering fits, make sure you stay near them to provide support and comfort. Hold them steady, comfort them, and help them clean up any mess that may result from the sickness.

, Rest is a very important aspect of recovery for many illnesses. Make sure that your relative is comfortable and in a relaxed environment suitable for getting lots of rest. Blankets, comfy pillows, and a bed will help your relative get the added rest they need on the road to recovery.


Creating a separate sick room is also a good idea if the illness is contagious. This will give your relative some privacy and create a quiet space while at the same time protecting the rest of the family from unwanted germs. , Many common illnesses cause nasal congestion and/or vomiting. Your relative will be much more comfortable with tissues, water, and a trash can within reach. This way they can easily blow their nose or vomit without having to get up and move around.

, Being sick in bed all day can be very boring, so help them find things to enjoy. Read to them, settle them near the TV or talk to them for a while. Chances are, the less bored they are, the less down in the dumps they'll feel.

, Fluid loss can lead to dehydration and is common for people with cold and flu symptoms. Water is the best choice. Keeping your relative well hydrated means their body is better equipped to battle their illness. Signs of dehydration include: Less than normal amounts of urine.
Dry mouth and/or eyes
Dry skin that doesn’t easily go back to normal after being pinched.
Blood in the stool or blood in the vomit.

, Light foods are easier on the digestive system and some can help to aid with hydration.


Popsicles, yogurt, toast, crackers, and broth-based soups are excellent choices.

, Ginger has long been associated with alternative medicinal treatments. Ginger root, best consumed as a tea when sick, can help treat nausea and other digestive issues. Give your relative flat ginger ale or ginger tea in order to reduce the nausea associated with the flu, chemotherapy, or pregnancy-related “morning” sickness. , Research shows that sweets can actually suppress the immune system and cause inflammation.

Face your fears of aging.,
Stay in the moment.,
Focus on the good.,
Find role models.,
Talk to your friends.,
Stay connected to others.",How to Deal With Getting Older1," Be specific and concrete. Identifying the things that you’re most afraid of will help you confront them. If you've been avoiding thinking about aging because it's too upsetting, this exercise may be exactly what you need to help you deal with getting older. The way you think about yourself and the process of getting older will affect the way you view your own life.For many people, getting older means getting closer to death. Their fears of aging are partially due to fears of death, either their own or the death of a loved one. Planning your end-of-life care and confronting the root of this fear may help.
You may also fear losing your independence, becoming more physically frail, or developing health conditions related to aging. Learn more about adaptations and supports that will allow you to keep your independence for as long as possible.
You might be concerned about your altered appearance. Find role models who have engaged gracefully with aging, either famous or in your own life.
Talking with supportive friends, family or professionals can help you name your fears in a safe way. When you name your fears with close friends, you’ll likely feel better even if nothing else has changed.;
, Naming all these fears might feel overwhelming, but naming fears doesn’t mean that they’re happening at the moment. Be aware that most things that you’re afraid of are not actually happening right now.When you notice your fears rising, ask yourself, “Is this happening now?” If the answer is no, turn your attention to the present moment.
If there are steps that you can take to address the fear — such as planning long-term care options to address your fear of developing health conditions or physical frailty - then take action on these steps.

, There are many reasons to look forward to getting older. For example, you’ll be able to draw on your lifelong experiences in order to help others. You may receive respect from younger people just starting out.Aging may allow you to slow down and enjoy your life, free of active parenting and work obligations.
If you have saved for retirement, you may be able to enjoy learning and traveling for pleasure.
You may be free of work and school responsibilities for the first time in your life.

, If you fear getting older, it may be that you associate aging with unpleasant examples that you have been given. Many people reach old age with healthy bodies, their minds alert and their appreciation for life undimmed.If you realize that there are many people who’ve enjoyed old age, you’re less likely to be stuck in your fears.
Look for examples in the media, in the community, and in your own life.

, Even though many people are private about age-related topics, your friends can be a valuable source of experience and insight. Perhaps you have friends who are older, or who’ve already made long-term plans for themselves. Asking them about their experiences will help you better able to make your own plans.


Your friends can help you realize that everyone has to deal with getting older. You’ll find examples that you can use in your own life, both positive and negative.
Older family members can also be helpful. If your parents are living, talking with them about their own aging process can offer you some ideas about what your own process might be.

, Clinical studies have repeatedly shown that healthy aging is supported by feelings of social connection. Whether you spend time with friends, family members, or participate in other community activities, developing social connections is one of the best ways to care for yourself as you get older.Taking part in volunteer organizations, mentoring children, tutoring in schools are all ways you can interact with others and develop relationships.
Try connecting with others online. If you have mobility limitations, or if you live far from your family, use online options to maintain communication. Video chats, such as Skype, Facetime, or other, are great ways to stay in touch.

Visit all of the retirement communities in your desired area.,
Ask the right questions.",How to Choose a Retirement Community," Different communities offer different levels of care, from housekeeping to live-in nursing, and your community of choice should be able to provide you with healthcare services that are tailored to your individual circumstances. It is important that you also plan for your future healthcare needs when choosing a retirement community.;
, Upon entering into a retirement community, you will have to agree to pay an entrance fee and a recurring monthly fee, both of which will be relative to the type of residence you choose, and you may also have to pay additional fees for any extra services and amenities you opt for. Therefore, it is important that you decide how much money you are able and willing to spend before you shop around for a community.

, Take the following into consideration:


Support staff. In addition to your healthcare needs, you should also think about what other services you would like to receive from on-site staff. Your options may include things like maid service, transportation and personal shopping.






Culture. Each retirement community has its own culture, and it is important that you find one that is well-suited for you. For example, you may prefer an upscale, formal environment, or more relaxed, casual surroundings. Additionally, you may favor a very social lifestyle, or value privacy instead.

Activities. Many communities offer a range of activities designed to enrich retirement living. These may include sports, social gatherings, games, classes and clubs.






Facilities. Decide what you want your community to have in regards to on-site amenities. Retirement communities may offer gymnasiums, pools, shops, restaurants, clinics, libraries, community centers, salons, churches and more.







, Stay the night, if possible, in order to get the full experience. Take note of the following:


Cleanliness. The communal areas, medical facilities, administrative offices and restrooms should be neat, clean and well-stocked.






Residents. A great way to gauge the quality of a community is to pay attention to how its residents seem to feel about living there. Spend some time walking around, and stop to talk with the locals.






Staff. The staff should be friendly, helpful, accessible and knowledgeable. There should also be an ample amount of staff members in relation to the size and scope of the community.






Contract. Read over the contract while you are at the facility and in the presence of an administrator. Be sure to ask for clarification, if needed.


, Here are some basics you should know about any retirement community you are considering:


Accreditation. Make sure the community you choose is accredited with the Continuing Care Accreditation Commission (CCAC), also known as the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF).






Refund policy. Some retirement communities will refund your entrance fee if you change your mind about living there, while others keep the fee regardless.

How they handle those who can no longer afford to pay. Although most communities run thorough financial screenings before approving your application, it is inevitable that some of their residents may eventually fall into the predicament of running out of money. Some communities have special fund reserves in the case of such circumstances, while others will simply evict you.

Tell them what the technology is.,
Differentiate between an “upgrade” and new technology.,
Explain the benefits of the technology.,
Address physical limitations.,
Show them how they can see pictures of their children and grandchildren.,
Be their volunteer tech support.,
Use new communication technology.,
Don’t get frustrated when they say no.,
Tell them they can stay connected with their family, loved ones, or friends.,
Ask them why they are avoiding technology.",How to Convince Elders to Buy Technology," Explain to the elder, in clear terms, what the technology is. This may sound like a simple task, but many elders may become quickly confused by the vocabulary that a younger person might consider common. Take your time while describing the technology to an elder to fully go over every major detail that the technology holds.Avoid using brand names and instead use the names of the technology. For example, use telephone over iPhone, tablet over iPad, or mp3 player over iPod.
It might be helpful to ask yourself questions like, “How would I explain this to someone who has never used technology like this before?” or “What would I say to someone who has never seen something like this before?”;
, Framing what the technology is and how it will affect their life is key to convincing elders to purchase new technology. Being able to differentiate between upgrading their current technology and adopting an entirely new one will help with their transition. Be sure to focus on what is different with the upgrade, how it will change the way the interact with the technology, and what its benefits are.


All technology can be seen, in some sense, as an upgrade. However, focusing on smaller shifts will help make these transitions more understandable. For example, try to differentiate an operating system upgrade from an transition from flip-phone to smartphone.

, There are many benefits to staying current with technological trends. Explaining these benefits will help motivate an elder to continue learning and using a new technology. Whether they are using the internet, an iPhone, or a Smart TV, many new technologies offer a range of benefits and accommodations.


Try explaining how using an iPhone or Facebook will help them keep connected with family members across the state, country, or globe.
Explain, for example, how a Smart TV will let them record TV shows that they can then playback at anytime they would like.
Try using phrases like, “This phone will let you view pictures of your grandchildren whenever you like” “This watch can also monitor your activity, heart-rate, and give you health alerts” or “This TV can record shows and let you watch them back whenever you would like to.”

, Many elders resist learning new technology due to physical limitations, such as vision or hearing impairment as well as chronic or significant diseases. Addressing these physical limitation will help both you and the elder understand what technology can be used and what technology they will be unable to use., Taking the time to show an elder how the technology they have works will help them not only understand but also adopt this new technology into their current lifestyle. Give them a few lessons on how to turn things on and off and other basic functions of the technology. Continue practicing by giving them small task to try and complete, like calling you on your phone, sending an e-mail, playing a song, or recording a TV episode.Try to schedule regular times to sit down and go through one aspect of the technology. For example, you could meet once a week for an hour. One session you might set-up email on a smartphone, another might be signing an elder up to Facebook and connecting them with family members.

, Elders will likely need continuing support, especially from those who have a larger cultural and generational understanding of emerging technologies. Make yourself available to an elder whenever they might have issues with their technology and talk them through to a resolution. Making yourself available will keep elders engaged and help them feel like they have consistent assistance in learning this new technology.


Let the elder know that they can call you when they have an issue with their new technology. Granted, this may become too frequent and disruptive, so be sure to remind them of your regular meetings.
Reassure them by telling them “Don’t worry, I’ll be here to help you if you are confused or have any problems” or “It is important that you stay connected with the family, so I will do whatever you need to make sure you do.”

, Using the technology that an elder is attempting to learn will help them stay motivated and connected. The more often you can encourage an elder to continue using new technology, the more likely they are to adopt it into their lifestyle.Try to message an elder on Facebook frequently if they have just set up an account.
Try only sending text messages to an elder who has just received a smartphone.

, Many elders will be firm about their resistance to new technologies, especially those that use different and unfamiliar vocabularies. Instead of getting frustrated at their lack of understanding or lack of acceptance, stay calm and try again. Some resistances might run deep and could take time to change. Remember that acting out of frustration can do harm to your argument for using new technology.


If you find yourself getting frustrated, take a deep breath and try to relax.

, Some elders may not see the point in new technologies and think that they are unnecessary. However, the more you stress the importance of staying connected with the rest of the family, the more likely they will be to want to be a part of that connection. Let the elder know that you want them to be a part of the communication and interaction that you are having on a daily basis.Try using phrases like, “Well, we are all using smart phones now. We video chat with one another every week” “All of us are on Facebook so that we can share our family memories with everyone no matter where they are” or “We all really want you to be a part of our group chat so that we can keep you updated and receive updates about you.”

, Asking elders why they are uninterested in using new technology can provide you with information to help better make adjustments for their eventual use. Whether they don’t understand what the technology does, don’t want to learn anything new, or don’t think they need anything to replace what they already have, understanding what they are avoiding and why they are avoiding it will help you convince them to change.For example, if they don’t understand the technology then provide them with resources for learning, like IT classes geared specifically toward seniors, or teach them yourself."

Be present.,
Learn about their condition.,
Provide support.,
Be aware of changing needs.",How to Aid a Sick Family Member2," When a family member is diagnosed with a chronic illness such as arthritis, diabetes, or multiple sclerosis they may begin to suffer from depression. It is very important you are present and supportive. Chronic illnesses are not curable, and although there are treatments to help manage the symptoms, individuals diagnosed with a chronic illness can often feel hopeless. Depression is one of the leading complications associated with chronic illness. You may also want to look into providing your relative with a social network or support group to help them stay connected with others and avoid the feeling of isolation.

, It is very important that you learn as much as possible about their condition because this will help you provide treatment, manage pain, and understand what they are experiencing. For example, if your loved one has been diagnosed with diabetes you will want to have a thorough understanding of what foods they can eat and how to administer any medications, such as insulin.

, People suffering from chronic illness often have a team of medical health care professionals including doctors, nurses, and counsellors. The best way that you can be supportive is by working with the health care professionals to administer medications and provide emotional support. Try and allow your relative to maintain a normal life as much as possible. If there were activities they enjoyed prior to their illness try and allow them to continue to engage in these activities. You will not be able to cure their illness, but you can greatly improve their quality of life. , As their illness progresses or changes they may need different forms of treatment. For example, they may require medical aids and new equipment, nursing care, or other forms of assistance. Monitor their symptoms and comfort level to ensure that they are being cared for in the best possible way. Speak with their doctors and health care professionals whenever you notice a change in their symptoms and behaviour. "

Talk with your family member about their condition.,
Assist in finding professional help.,
Educate yourself about their mental illness.,
Allow your loved one to have some control.,
Be calm and supportive.",How to Aid a Sick Family Member3," If you notice a family member may be suffering from a mental health illness or they have recently been diagnosed, it is important to talk openly with them about their health. Mental illness is something we don’t talk about enough in our society. The best way to show your relative support is by talking openly and positively about mental illness. Some tips for talking about mental illness include: Communicate in a direct and clear manner. For example, you might say “I have been worried about you lately. Is there anything I can do to help?”
Use language that is appropriate to the age and developmental level of your relative. If you are speaking with a child don’t provide too many details.
Discuss mental illness in a place where your family member feels safe and comfortable.
Be aware of their reactions and slow down if they seem overwhelmed or confused during the conversation.

, Some mental illnesses will require professional therapy. It is important to know that in some instances you will not be able to help your relative overcome their mental health issues. Your relative may feel more comfortable discussing their mental health issues with someone they don’t know, like a therapist or support group. In these circumstances it is important that you are supportive and encourage them to seek out a professional therapist. You may say “I know you have been struggling lately and you may not be comfortable talking to me about your condition. That is okay. Can I assist you in finding someone to talk to?”

, By knowing the details of the specific illness you can provide better care and support. Not understanding the illness and symptoms may lead to misconceptions and will impact your ability to give adequate care. For example, you are more likely to understand and sympathize with the suicidal thoughts of a loved one suffering from depression if you are educated about depression.

, Often when an individual is suffering from a mental illness they feel as though they have lost control over their life and they struggle with self esteem. You can help them feel in control again by allowing them to take part in decision making. For example, if your loved one decides to wear an outfit that doesn’t match don’t criticize them. This is not a major decision and by letting them choose their own clothing they will feel some sense of normalcy.

, At times caring for a loved one with mental health issues can be frustrating and exhausting. It is important to remain calm and positive even during stressful periods. Remember that they also feel frustrated and likely have less control over their actions. Try and avoid responding to your loved one in an angry manner.


For example, if your loved one is aggressive or violent you may respond by saying “I understand you are frustrated, but we do not allow violence in our household.”

"
"
Make time for yourself.,
Ask for assistance.,
Be physically active.,
Avoid drugs and alcohol.,
Talk with your employer about sick leave.",How to Aid a Sick Family Member4," Caring for a loved one can take up a lot of time and energy. Schedule time to rest, have fun, and get away this will allow you to return to your loved one refreshed and in a positive mental state. , At times you may find it too difficult to be the sole caregiver of a sick family member. You can find assistance in a number of places:


Ask another family member to pitch in and help out.
Look into hiring a nurse or other health care professional to assist with home care.
Find a service that will deliver meals. This will enable you to focus more specifically on emotional support.
Seek out a support group. Depending on your relative's illness you may be feeling emotionally and mentally exhausted from providing constant care. A support group will help you meet and talk with other people who are dealing with similar situations.

, One of the best ways to protect your mental health during times of crisis is by looking after your physical health. Try and find a way to exercise daily. This does not have to be strenuous exercise, and includes anything from taking the stairs when possible to joining a group exercise class. This will help alleviate the stress associated with your relative's illness while keeping your body healthy. , Some people will turn to drugs and alcohol during periods of stress. They do not actually help relieve stress and often times can worsen feelings of anxiety or stress. It is best to turn to other family members or friends when you are feeling overwhelmed. , Some employers will allow for paid sick leave which can include caring for a seriously ill family member. Check with your employer to see what your benefits are. This will help give you both the time and financial assistance necessary to look after your ailing relative. Individual benefits will vary, but it is a good idea to speak with your employer about this type of financial assistance. "

Make sure your senior understands the system.,
Ask about price.,
Find out if there is a long-term commitment.,
Get the facts on the monitoring services.,
Ask specific questions about the technology.,
Check reviews.",How to Choose a Medical Alert System for Seniors," Depending on where you live and how independent your senior is, you may or may not opt for a system that includes monitoring services.


There are many systems on the market that are connected to call centers, allowing emergency response teams to be dispatched directly to the senior's home upon activation. These products typically charge monthly fees.
If you don't think your senior needs this level of monitoring, or if there are many close friends and family members nearby who can check on the senior, you may also consider a wearable product that automatically calls a list of pre-programmed phone numbers, allowing your senior to call loved ones for help without having to get to the phone.;
, Many systems offer a simple push button that allows seniors to call for help whenever they need it. There are also newer products on the market, however, that offer a higher level of protection.


Many companies now offer units with automatic fall detection capabilities, which means your senior will get emergency help even if she is unconscious or otherwise unable to press the emergency button.Some units are also capable of automatically calling for emergency help if they detect fire or carbon monoxide.

, If you want to be able to check on your senior's health regularly, even if there isn't an acute emergency, you may want to consider a monitoring device that keeps track of the senior's movements and vital signs. These products allow you to view data on your computer or via a smartphone app, so you will know how long your senior has spent sitting or lying down, and whether there are any abnormal vital signs.There are also products on the market that will send health monitoring information directly to the senior's doctor.
If you're worried about your senior forgetting to take her medications, look for a system that has a pillbox monitoring function that will automatically send an alert if the pillbox is not opened.Video monitoring is also an option if you want to be able to keep an eye on your senior from far away.

, You will need to decide where you want your senior to be monitored. If your senior does not leave the house alone often, you can choose a home-based unit, which is connected to either a landline or a cellular connection, and only connects the senior to monitoring services within a specific range. If your senior is more active, you may want to consider a GPS-enabled device, which will allow your senior to signal for help from anywhere and will notify emergency responders of her exact location.If you are considering a home-based unit, find out if the base unit can be easily transferred to a different house. This will be important if your senior moves one day, if she spends the winters in a warmer climate, or if she just visits out-of-town family from time to time.
Be sure to check the range on home-based units, as they are all different. Some may allow for a connection while the senior is in the yard, for example, while others may not. If your senior spends time in the yard, you will definitely want to make sure this area is covered.
Some GPS-enabled devices may also allow caregivers to see the senior's location via a mobile app, which could be helpful if your senior is prone to getting lost.

, One of the most important things to consider when choosing a medical alert system is whether or not your senior will actually wear the device. There are many different options available, including pendants, bracelets, belt clips, and more. Some are more stylish than others, which may encourage a reluctant senior to wear them. Even the best system will be of no use if the senior does not wear the device, so make sure she is comfortable with it and agrees to wear it every day.Some systems include the option for stationary buttons to be placed around the house. If you are concerned that your senior may not wear a pendant or other wearable device, consider placing emergency buttons in the areas of the home where she is most likely to fall.There are also a wide variety of products on the market that include automatic sensors for the home. Depending on the system, you can monitor things such as movement in the home and temperature, and you can even get alerts if your senior leaves the water running or doesn't close the refrigerator, which can be great cues for you to call and make sure everything is okay. Some seniors may panic in the event of an emergency and forget to use the medical alert device. If you think this is likely to happen to your senior, you may want to opt for automatic detection options.

, Make sure to think not only about how the medical alert system will function for your senior right now, but also about how it might function for her as she continues to age.


The senior may be able to push a button to summon for help or reset the system today, but may not be able to a year from now. Think about what other options the system offers.
Be sure your contract is flexible, allowing you to make any necessary changes so the plan will continue to meet your needs down the road.

, Be careful not to choose a system that your senior will not be able to operate. If she is not tech-savvy, choose a more user-friendly device. No matter what system you choose, make sure to go over the operation with her so she knows exactly how to use it in case of an emergency.


Requesting a trial of a system is a great idea, especially if you are unsure if your senior will be comfortable with the technology.

, Depending on the system, you may have the option to buy or lease the equipment. Find out about the upfront and monthly costs for all the systems that meet your senior's needs.Ask about false alarm charges. If the senior pushes the alert button accidentally or uses it for any little problem, determine whether you will need to pay a penalty.
In the United States, Medicare does not cover the cost of medical alert plans. Most private insurers will not cover the plans either, but check to see. Medicaid will cover the costs in some cases., Be sure to ask if you are required to sign a contract, if there are cancellation fees, and if you are required to pay for a minimum number of months. Some systems may give you many different contract options, so choose the one that makes the most sense for you.


If you only need temporary monitoring for your senior, while she is recovering from surgery, for example, be extra careful about making sure you won't be on the hook for any extra fees.

, Ask the companies lots of detailed questions about their services to make sure you are getting the best quality service for your loved one.


Ask about response time. It will be very important to know how soon your loved one will get help in the event of an emergency.
You should also understand what systems are needed for the device to work. For example, if the system is tied to a cellular network, but your senior has poor cell reception at home, this might be a bad choice.
Find out if the company takes care of the monitoring in-house or if they outsource the service. If they do it themselves, ask about how they train their employees. If they outsource monitoring services, do some research on that company as well.
Seek a plan that provides 24/7 coverage if you want and can afford around-the-clock monitoring and service.

, You will probably already know a lot about the medical alert systems that fit your needs by this point, but there are still a lot of important technical questions you will need to ask the providers.


Determine if there is a guarantee on parts or service and whether the company offers technical support.
Find out if the battery is rechargeable or replaceable. If it is rechargeable, ask how often it needs to be charged.
Inquire about the availability of waterproof monitoring devices.
Ask if the system automatically tests itself. It is vital that the system is monitored regularly to ensure that it is working properly.
Find out where the speaker is. Some devices allow seniors to communicate with the response team through a speaker on the wearable device, while others have a speaker connected to the phone.If you have two or more seniors who you would like to monitor in the same house, find out if the system is capable of handling your needs., Research the company online to determine if it is reputable and to find out what other people are saying about their services. Think about how long they have been in business and how their prices compare to their competitors. If possible, reach out to people you know who use the system.

Seek out an ally.",How to Convince Elderly Parents to Move Closer1," Providing care across the country or even in a neighboring state can add up quickly. Adult children may have to take off work to visit their parents, purchase plane tickets, obtain hotel accommodations, or arrange childcare. Do the math in terms of time and money. Gain a clear picture going in as to how much relocating would save the family.When you have the conversation, the information you learn can help you convince them that moving is a good idea for everyone.;
, Don’t wait until a crisis to broach the subject of relocating your parents. Open the lines of communication early. Waiting until after an accident or health scare can lead to a hasty decision.

Plus, if your parents have been living in the same area for an extended time, or they manage quite well right now, there’s a chance they’ll turn down your offer.
Bringing up the topic early allows for them to start incorporating it into their list of options when making future plans. Simply put, they’ll have more time to mull it over., Of course, your parents need to be active participants in the decision-making process. However, it will also help if you have the talk in person. Avoid busy holidays or gatherings. Plan a visit when you and your siblings (if you have any) can talk with your parents without distractions. Then, be forthright about your concerns.

Pose the discussion as your problem, not theirs. Say, “Dad, Mom, we’re really concerned about how you guys are managing. You live in a large house. It’s a lot to take care of on your own. Plus, with Dad’s hip surgery, he hasn’t been able to get around as well. It would give us peace of mind to have you closer. What do you guys think about moving out to Denver?”

, Keep in mind that you’re asking your parents to make a major move. If they flat-out refuse, be respectful. It doesn’t mean it won’t be possible in the future. It just means they’re not quite ready. Instead of forcing the issue or starting an argument, try to understand their objections and validate their decision to stay in their current home.Say, “I understand you not jumping for joy, but why are you so against the idea? Help us understand.” It is also helpful to let them know, ""The opportunity is here in the future if you ever decide this is something you want.
Finding out their reservations can help you gradually develop counterarguments for a future discussion.Realize that unless your parents are cognitively impaired and unable to make sound decisions for themselves, they have a right to refuse to move.
If it has been determined by medical professionals that they are unable to make decisions on their own, you will still need to complete an advance directive or durable power of attorney enabling you to make decisions on their behalf., In order to persuade your parents to move nearby, you will have to make sure your siblings are on board. You are more likely to present a convincing argument if everyone is on the same page and agrees that this is the best decision.

Talk to your siblings first. Say, “Mom and Dad aren’t getting any younger. What are we going to do about their long-term care? They live too far away for us to adequately care for them.”
If everyone agrees, you can all have separate talks or do it as a group. The important thing is that the message is consistent., Perhaps just one of your parents isn't so sure about the move. Or, maybe they both don't fancy the idea. Find someone they trust, and pitch your idea to this person. It could be another elderly family member or a family friend. Explain your concerns and ask if they will speak to your parents on your behalf.

Sometimes, people need to hear an idea from more than one source to truly consider its legitimacy. If you find an ally, they may be able to communicate your concerns in a way that doesn't come off as pushy.
Ask an aunt or family friend, ""I think Mom and Dad need to move closer to me, but they don't want to. Could you maybe discuss it with them and try to see if they will change their minds? They have always respected your opinion.""

Cope with loneliness.",How to Deal with Anxiety Brought on by Aging1," If you fear falling, you may limit your life in a way that makes it less enjoyable. A normal trip to the grocery store or taking your dog on a walk may induce feelings of anxiety like never before. Your fear of falling may lead to inactivity, disability, and even falls. Fearful older adults may limit their activities, which can make their muscles more frail, leading to an increased risk of falls. Instead of limiting your movement, take a different approach. Remove rugs, improve your lighting, and make modifications to your home (like installing railings or grab bars). Don’t let your fear of falling ruin your quality of life. While it’s good to be cautious, stay active and keep moving.;
, As you age, you may experience compounding health problems. These problems can affect your health every day. For some, poor health can lead to feelings of anxiety. Even thinking about your medical condition may fill you with fear. You might even think that a new diagnosis means only bad things will happen to you from now on.If you’re having fears about your health, ask direct questions to your treating physician.


If you fear the side-effects of medications, ask, “What side effects might I experience with this medication? What can I do if that happens?”
If you have anxiety about your medical conditions, ask, “How will this affect my health? How can I prevent limitations?”

, You might start to notice problems with your memory as you age. Learning new things may be more difficult, and remembering names or information can be challenging. If you’re worried about your memory, there are things you can do to help improve it. Eat a healthy diet and do some exercise. Quit smoking and keep your mind sharp by doing activities like sudoku or crossword puzzles.Speak with your healthcare professional if your memory loss is significant. They may have some recommendations for you.

, As you age, you may begin to fear death coming closer to you. While it can be easier to ignore death when you’re young or in shining health, it can be more difficult as you age. It’s up to you how to approach death, but it can be helpful to confront death. Some people approach it intellectually, others through a faith or spiritual practice that brings them meaning to life.It can be difficult to see friends and family close to you dealing with death and dying. If their experiences fill you with anxiety, you are not alone. It’s normal to have many, often mixed emotions when grieving, and it’s okay to express your feelings as they occur., Many older people worry about money and whether they will have enough to support themselves or whether they will leave enough for their families. Don’t be afraid to ask for assistance regarding finances. You can find professional help such as working with a financial planner or attorney, or reach out to your family for help in managing day to day expenses. Create a budget and stick to it. Consider allowing a trusted family member to manage or monitor your accounts.If you are afraid of being scammed, run financial decisions by trusted friends or family members and don’t be afraid to get a second professional opinion.

, Aging adults may experience a greater level of social loss as friends and family members pass or decline in their function. You may fear being isolated from your friends and family due to losses in your own mobility. Loneliness can lead to feeling sad or depressed, so it’s important to stay connected no matter your age.If you fear being isolated, alone, or lonely, take steps to ensure a happy social life.

Take baby steps.,
Identify specific needs prior to moving.,
Ask your parents to indulge you by visiting for a week.,
Allow them to be more involved with the grandchildren.,
Help them identify a residence and activities.",How to Convince Elderly Parents to Move Closer2," Your parents may actually be open to the idea of moving closer. However, they may act the opposite because they don’t want to encroach on your lives or lose their own independence. You can help them get reintegrated into your life by talking to them about increasing your level of contact. This means more phone calls and more visits.

Over time they may start to appreciate your caregiving efforts and slowly come around to your original proposition.
Be sure to see if this is okay with your parents first. They may be satisfied with the current level of contact they have with you.

, In the planning phase prior to the move, contact extended family or family friends who live near your parents. If no family members are able to assist, contact a neighbor, caregiver, or a health care professional that may assist in understanding your elderly parents' basic needs.

Working with someone else can help you better understand the daily needs of your parents that you may not have encountered living away from them.
Arrange a trip to visit your parents in their own home and community and schedule a caregiving coaching session with their providers. Their geriatric provider may help you set up a group meeting with you, your parents, their health care team, and possibly a social worker. These meeting will help you gain a clear picture of how the move would not only impact your parents, but also how it may impact you.

, Again, it can help if you slowly introduce your parents to the idea of moving. Invite them to stay with you for a week or so in order to get acquainted with your area. Or, if possible, you can even conduct a trial run in which they find a temporary rental or assisted living facility in your area., Grandparents are usually over the moon at the prospect of spending more time with their grandchildren. When your parents come to visit, give them the chance to spend quality time with your children.

Remind them of how much they miss out on by being so far away. Show them the video of your baby’s first steps. Get them seats at your daughter’s recital. Offer for them to babysit while you go on a date, if they’d like.
Helping them transition into the role of close-by grandparent may convince them in a way that your words could not., While they are in town, give them a tour of potential apartment buildings, rental homes, or assisted living facilities. Ask them about their location preferences and show them some options. Introduce them to some elderly neighbors and tour the local community center.If your parent will be living with you, prepare a room just for them during the trial run.

Ensure access to quality health care.,
Recognize the downsides for them.,
Determine how them being closer will impact your life.,
Keep a list of resources at hand.",How to Convince Elderly Parents to Move Closer3," It is extremely important for your elderly parents to have easy access to quality health care wherever they reside. If you are assisting them with a move so they can be closer to you, be sure to research offices and hospitals where they can access a good health care provider.Have your parents connect with their current health care provider prior to moving to ask for recommendations in your area. Help them call prospective physicians and specialists to set up initial appointments. This will help them become acquainted with their new services.
It is advisable that these phone calls happen well in advance of any move.
Be sure that your parents sign all releases of information with their current primary care providers so that all medical documentation can be faxed over to the new provider in advance. Have your parents keep a hard copy of the records, as well.

, If you are upset or frustrated because your parents refused, think about the gravity of the decision. Moving can have a major impact on their life satisfaction–leaving familiar surroundings, friends, familiar medical care, and possibly a home they built and you grew up in.

Pressuring your parents to move can have negative ramifications. Elderly adults who move nearer to their children may sacrifice many elements that made their lives their own. In fact, many elderly adults feel lonely, out of place, and depressed.You can alleviate these concerns by taking the whole process slowly. That's why it's important to have such a conversation well before your parents need to be close by. Give them time to gradually get used to the idea, or to consider possible alternatives.

, Having your parents move nearby can also create a shift in your own lifestyle. Research shows that caregivers may spend as much as 40 hours providing care when their parents relocate. The move won’t just be a dramatic change for them, it will affect you and your family, too.Carefully weigh the personal cost of your parent’s move. Will it actually be better for everyone involved if they relocate? Will your siblings help you manage caregiving responsibilities?

, A move to a new area requires a lot of planning. If you are intending to bring up the subject again in the future, it’s best to compile a list of resources. That way, you’ll have everything handy next time.

Assess the quality of health care in your area. Research and contact local elderly care advocates in your area. Get pamphlets from assisted living facilities to learn more about their amenities.
In the meantime, it may also be helpful to identify services like ElderCare Locator that helps you arrange transportation to doctor’s appointments and other needs for your long-distance parents."

Deal with your changing body.,
Navigate changes in sexuality.,
Embrace your decisions about having children.,
Accept that children get older.,
Boost your self-esteem.,
Acknowledge the benefits of aging.",How to Deal with Anxiety Brought on by Aging2," You might notice your first wrinkles, gray hairs, or varicose veins and wonder, “When did I get those?!” The changes in your body during the aging process may not be especially welcome. Your self-perception can take a hit once you realize that age is beginning to take its toll on you, and watching your own metamorphosis can be saddening. It’s up to you how to handle this fear: you can accept it or change your body via exercise/nutrition or, more extremely, plastic surgery. Think about what will bring you lasting happiness and what matters to you.


If you’ve had a difficult time learning to accept your body, this can be the perfect opportunity. You don’t have to tie your worth to how you appear, and this can be a time for you to finally accept your body as it is.
Find a new way to define beauty and youth that isn’t tied to physical appearance.What does being beautiful mean to you? How can you be youthful even as you age?

, Your sexual vitality may change as you age. Women go through menopause and can experience hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and emotional fluctuations.Men might experience problems with erectile dysfunction, which can include obtaining or maintaining an erection. Sometimes, medication can cause or contribute to sexual problems. Talk to your physician about any sexual problems you experience and ask what you can do to improve your sexual experience. Many problems can be treated or even reversed.Talk to your partner about your needs and find ways to navigate these changes together. If you’re nervous to bring up your changes, say, “It’s difficult to talk about this, but it would be helpful to discuss new and different ways to approach sex.”

, If you wonder whether you’ve made the right choices in having or not having kids, it’s probably time to accept your decisions. Especially if you chose not to have children, you may fear whether you’re fully ready to accept that you will likely never have a biological child, especially if you are reaching a point where pregnancy is no longer viable. Getting stuck in “What if..?” thoughts can be dangerous, so accept your position or make some adjustments to include children into your life in a different way.


If you’re feeling anxious about not having children of your own yet your biological clock has stopped ticking, don’t lose hope. You can adopt or foster a child.
Volunteer at a children’s organization to help local boys and girls.
Enjoy the freedoms you have as a result of not having children. For example, you can travel the world, get involved in many different activities and social circles, and make choices that only involve you.

, You may forget that you are aging until you notice how fast children around you are growing up. It can be difficult to watch children get older, and this can make you uneasy about your own aging process. Watching your children grow older can also be anxiety-provoking if you have health problems. You might begin to fear whether you will see your children grow older, get married, or have kids of their own. If you fear watching children grow, take heart in knowing that they have turned out (or will turn out) okay. Celebrate their successes with them and trust that they will do just fine.


Whether you worry or not, children will grow older and into adults. Trust that you’ve been a good parent or otherwise positive influence on the children in your life.

, Some fears about aging might include your outward appearance. If you think turning to plastic surgery or making changes to your appearance will help you feel better about yourself, you may struggle with self-esteem issues. Think about who you are as a person: what are your strengths, abilities, and the things that make you feel good?Plastic surgery may be the right choice for you, but make sure you take care of yourself and your self-esteem as well.


Ask yourself, “Are there certain activities or situations in which I excel? What are they? What strengths do I have that not many other people have?” Focus your thoughts on these things about you.

, While it can be difficult to accept that you are aging, recognize the benefits that come along with growing older. For example, you hold wisdom and experience that you can share with others. Adults and older adults are better decision-makers due to extensive knowledge and experience.If someone asks for your help in making a decision, remember that you have skills and experiences that they do not and that may be helpful to them.

Accept uncertainty.,
Challenge negative thoughts.,
Practice relaxation.,
Confide in family and friends.,
Talk with a therapist.,
Take medication.",How to Deal with Anxiety Brought on by Aging3," One of the hardest parts about having anxiety is accepting the uncertainty of situations. The effects of aging are not under your control and are largely uncertain. Thinking about all the things that could go wrong doesn’t make life any easier or more predictable. Instead of focusing your thoughts on worries, focus on accepting uncertainty. Recognize that life is not predictable and it’s impossible to have 100% certainty on everything.Ask yourself, “Is this a reasonable concern to think about right now? Can I be okay knowing that this is uncertain? Is it possible to live with the possibility of something going poorly, even if it’s a small chance?”

, A big part of anxiety is negative thought patterns. You might overestimate the possibility of something going wrong or consistently assume the worst. You might underestimate your ability to handle problems. For example, you may focus on all of the negative things and ignore positive things or possibilities. Learn to challenge these thoughts and replace them with more positive ones.For example, if you feel anxious about health problems, ask yourself, “Is there a more positive way to look at this? Am I looking at it objectively? How is this thought hurting me, and is there a more realistic way to approach it?”

, If anxiety is a large part of your day, engage in relaxation as a regular practice. Relaxation can help calm your body and mind. This can help you calm your anxious thoughts and deal with them daily. Aim to relax 30 minutes each day.Find relaxation methods that feel good that you can practice daily. Try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation.

, Lean on your partner, siblings, friends and family as a source of support. Even if they cannot change things for you, it can be helpful to know you have someone to talk to when you feel anxious or worried. Even the act of talking about your feelings can help you experience a sense of relief and support. Being near people who love you and support you can be integral in helping you deal with your anxieties.Avoid talking about your worries with people who will make you feel more anxious; instead, talk to someone who is loving, calm, and supportive.

, If your fears of aging seem too much for you to handle, discuss them with a therapist. Therapy is a safe place for you to talk about your fears openly. Your therapist can help you understand your fears and how to work with them or overcome them. Consider using a therapist who practices cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), as this is the most widely-used form of therapy treatment. CBT allows you to confront and address negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.CBT can help you look at the thoughts that contribute to anxiety and respond differently to them.

, Often, anxiety is treated through both therapy and medication. If your anxiety has become excessive and interferes in various areas of your life, consider discussing medication with your prescriber. Look over your symptoms of anxiety and talk about them with your physician to decide whether medication is right for you.You may feel more comfortable talking with your regular physician than seeing someone new. Ask your physician whether they are comfortable treating anxiety before pursuing treatment. If your physician is not comfortable, then consider a referral to a mental health specialist.

Pick a thermometer.,
Wash your hands.,
Clean the thermometer.,
Use a thermometer orally or under the armpit.,
Take a rectal reading.,
Apply an ear or forehead thermometer.",How to Check Vitals1," To take someone's temperature, you have several options when it comes to thermometers. Glass or digital thermometers can be used orally, rectally, and under the armpit. Special thermometers can be used on the forehead (skin) or in the ear.For babies under 3 months, always use a digital or glass thermometer to take a rectal reading. For children under 4-years-old, you should take their temperature under their armpits, rectally, or on their forehead.;
, Before using a thermometer on yourself or someone else, your hands need to be clean. Wash them with soap and warm running water, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds., If you don't know if a thermometer is clean, start by washing it in cold water. Apply rubbing alcohol to the thermometer, and then wash the alcohol off in cold water., Next, you will need to insert the thermometer into the patient, going by your chosen route. For an oral thermometer, insert it under the tongue, and have the patient hold it there for at least 40 seconds. Most digital thermometers will beep when done.For the armpit, the tip of thermometer goes in the armpit. It should touch the skin (not cloth). Hold it for 40 seconds or until it beeps.

, For a rectal reading, have the patient lay on their back and lift their thighs. Apply a bit of petroleum jelly to the end of the thermometer before pushing it in the anus. Don't go past an inch. Half an inch is usually enough. Make sure you don't push past any resistance. Leave it in for 40 seconds or until it beeps., For an ear canal thermometer, insert the thermometer gently into the person's ear. Wait until it beeps before pulling it out to read the temperature. Always read the manual that comes with the thermometer, as it will give special instructions on how that particular thermometer should be inserted.For a forehead thermometer, also called a Temporal Artery thermometer, turn it on and slide it across the forehead of the patient. It should read the temperature immediately.
Anyone with a temperature over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) should be seen by a doctor."

Point out that care might actually enable your loved one to remain independent for longer.",How to Care for the Elderly," Many children will eventually need to provide care for their parents. Planning ahead can help solve some of the issues before the situation becomes a last-minute emergency (for example caused by sudden illness or injury). Use technology, make the home safe for elderly people and anticipate the expenses of providing care in advance.


Be sure that you’re ready for an emergency. This includes having an emergency plan in place, posting emergency phone numbers, and preparing a home first aid kit.
There are many technologies available which can help keep track of the elderly, make sure that they are moving around and thus safe and are taking their medications. For example there are GPS trackers and medicine boxes that light up when medicines need to be taken. This helps allow them to stay in their homes for longer.
Make the home safer by installing anti-scald devices to protect sensitive older skin, carbon monoxide detectors, special smoke detectors with strobe lights or vibration to wake up the elderly (many elderly cannot hear conventional smoke detectors) and grab bars in showers and near toilets.
Caring for the elderly can be quite expensive. Do your research in advance and explore your options and potential grants or programs that might benefit your loved one.;
, Exercise can help protect older people from disease and reduce their functional age by 10 or 15 years. It can even result in big health benefits for those who have been sedentary for many years. It can delay the need for care and keep them away from disease for longer.


It is recommended that elderly people do 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (running, swimming, walking, biking) five times per week. Those who do more intense activities where the heart rate is significantly elevated and breathing is heavier should exercise a minimum of 20 minutes per day three days a week. Weight-strengthening exercises (using free weights, resistance bands or body weight) should be performed two or three times per week on non-consecutive days. They should also perform exercises for flexibility (stretching, yoga, tai chi) for at least 10 mins every day.Those who are unable to exercise independently, or at such intensity, can still benefit from being active. Passive Range of Motion (POM) exercises can help elderly people maintain joint mobility, for example.It’s also important to have older people change positions frequently – this will prevent skin breakdown and painful ulcers, which are susceptible to infection. Using devices like donut or egg crate cushions on chairs and beds can be helpful in this., If he/she has pains or medical issues, tell them to see (or take them) to a doctor. If the pains/medical issues are severe enough, it is imperative that you call a hospital and see what they can do for him/her right away.


Watch for signs of weakness, extra forgetfulness, lack of direction or other unsteadiness.
Mental health is often overlooked but is an important part of caring for an elderly person. Keep an eye out for signs of depression such as lack of interest, listlessness or deep feelings of sadness or anger. This can be a very difficult time for elderly people so make sure to monitor their mental well-being as well as their physical health., The elderly may be prescribed different drugs by different doctors and only the pharmacist will know all the medications your loved one is taking. Make friends with them and speak to them regarding possible side effects and interactions.

, The idea of stopping driving can cause a lot of anger and resentment for an elderly person. Remember that being able to drive is an important component of maintaining independence and it can be difficult to accept that they are no longer fit.Sometimes classes are offered for elderly drivers that may result in car insurance discounts.
There are tools that aid the elderly with driving, such as by assisting an arthritic wrist in turning the key in the ignition.
If it is really unsafe and your loved one continues to resist then get the help of their doctor or the DMV to prevent them from driving.
Keep them mobile using public transport or a three-wheeled bicycle so that they can maintain their sense of freedom and independence.
Your area might also offer transit alternatives. Some communities and non-profit organizations offer programs like volunteer driving pools, paratransit services, and escort services that can be planned ahead and provide door-to-door or curb-to-curb transport. Taxis are another option.
Look for voucher programs, too. Certain agencies for the elderly or disabled help with fare assistance, which might cover partial costs for public transit but also volunteer programs, taxis, and private transport companies. You will need to apply to these programs.

, Speak to your loved one regarding their finances and possible insurance plans for long-term care. Sometimes additional benefits can be applied for to reduce heating bills or the cost of prescription medicine and these should be identified if they exist. It might be better to downsize into an affordable senior-friendly condo if they wish to remain in their own home.


The elderly are particularly vulnerable to scams so make sure to discuss these and protect them. Get a credit report check at least once a year to make sure no one has stolen his or her identity.

, Find out about their power of attorney, , and health care proxy documents. These will sort out who can make medical decisions and financial decisions for your loved one if there is an emergency or they are incapacitated in some way.If your loved one has not obtained these documents yet, help him or her to create them.
Determine what sort of care your loved one wants and doesn’t want if they become unable to speak or communicate. Legal documents called “advance directives” specify this – including whether or not to use dialysis and breathing machines, tube feeding, or to resuscitate in case of cardiac arrest.

, Sometimes senior centers will organize dinners, which can include transportation, and these are a great way for your loved one to meet with others and share a meal. Oftentimes the elderly lose interest in food, particularly if they are depressed, and these shared meals can make eating more enjoyable.


Delivery services can also help elderly who experience difficulty with preparing their own food.

, This will solve the physical difficulties of caring for your loved one. A home caregiver can help the person accomplish whatever they need and take a lot of the burden off of the family members. They can also help the elderly person maintain some independence by keeping them in their homes.


Sometimes government aid can help offset some of these expenses. Look into your options and speak to your local agency on aging if there is one.
If they do not yet need a home caregiver or the home caregiver cannot perform these tasks, help them around the house. For example, help them with chores such as cleaning, laundry or gardening.

, Sometimes a home caregiver is not possible, for example if the elderly person requires too much assistance or it is not affordable. A senior home will provide for and take care of your loved one.


Sometimes they organize activities and have trained medical personnel keeping an eye on the elderly, making them safer and happier.
Do not feel ashamed or guilty if you can no longer care for your loved one in their home or at your home. Sometimes circumstances make it impossible or even unsafe to care for the elderly at home, and this is not your fault., Caring for your loved one at home can help them to feel better and maintain strong family relationships while allowing you to spend time with them and monitor their health. Home care will require a large investment of time and energy, however, physical as well as emotional.


Most falls occur at home, so fall-proofing your house is a must if you are caring for an elderly loved one. This means removing obstacles and hazards and leaving plenty of room for walking, but also installing railings and grab bars, improving lighting, and moving items so that they’re easier to reach.Home care also means helping your loved one with personal hygiene and grooming. You may need to assist them with getting dressed, clipping nails, using the bathroom, brushing teeth and oral care, bathing, and other things.
As an at-home caregiver, you should also maintain a schedule of routine exams for your loved one. Regular wellness check-ups – once a year or more – allows the doctor to monitor your loved one’s general health and spot potential issues., Caring for an elderly loved one puts lots of financial, emotional, and mental stress on caregivers. Think about how to give yourself a break, from time to time, in terms of time and energy but also finances.

You may find that you need an occasional or regular break. Think about getting some backup with respite care. You can ask friends or family for help, use an elder companion, hire a personal care assistant, or consider adult day services.Don’t forget about easing your financial burden, too. As a caregiver, you may qualify for tax breaks. For example, you may be able to claim an elderly parent as your dependent for tax purposes. To do this, you need to provide at least half of your parent’s support in housing, food, medical care, and utilities, along with meeting other requirements. You may also be able to claim their medical care as an itemized deduction or claim a dependent care tax credit., Always be respectful to the elderly. Even though they have aged and may be losing their health, they are still people with emotions and ideas. Don't judge them by their physical condition. Aging is simply a part of the natural cycle: you are born, you're a kid, you grown into your teen years, adult years, and one day you will be elderly too. Have respect for them and their lives.


Don't swear or say words which they may find inappropriate; having grown up in a different time, they may not take this lightly.

, Encourage them to maintain friendships, stay active, develop new interests and keep in touch with other family members. Explain that the loss of independence is not a personal failing and rather just part of the natural cycle of life.

, A recent study found that elderly people who volunteer are happier and healthier. This is especially true for elderly people who have chronic conditions. The feelings of being valued and needed as a volunteer can greatly improve the mental well-being and thus health of your loved one.


The benefits can be seen with as few as 2-3 hours per week of volunteering., Visiting will provide an emotional connection and improve the mental well being of your loved one. Visiting will also allow you as the caregiver to check up on their health and well-being. You can see whether they have been watering the plants, opened their mail or show any bruises, all of which may signify that they need additional assistance. Get friends and family members to help.

, If they are moving to a senior center or into your home, bring some of their physical home with them. This will make them feel more comfortable and at home in their new surroundings and help them to cope with the big changes taking place for them.

, Some younger people may mistakenly think they cannot connect with elderly people, but remember that they might also feel they cannot connect with you are your interests. Try to open your mind and find out what gives them joy. If you can't share their interest at least you can share their excitement.

, Many elderly people are uncomfortable and nervous about change, especially when they are moving out of their home. Try to keep everything as stable as possible. For example, you might bring their pet in with you if bringing your loved one home or bring their pet to the senior center with them if it is permitted.

, Try to get them to participate in the activities of the senior center or include them in activities in your home. Encourage them to be active participants in their environment.


You can also encourage them to get outside or take them outside for walks or other activities. This can help them to feel happier, especially if they suffer from depression.
You can even surprise them with gifts from time-to-time or hold parties for them as a way of keeping them involved.

, You may find them interesting and they can even help you navigate issues or situations in your own life. The elderly have a lifetime’s worth of experiences to offer, you can learn and improve your own life by listening and engaging with them. Find the beauty in their stories and learn from them.


This will also deepen the connection between you and can help them feel more connected to the world around them.

, Resistance is one of the most common challenges people face when caring for the elderly. Your loved one might feel the loss of independence, physical loss or mental loss. This can lead them to feeling frightened, vulnerable, guilty and/or angry and cause resistance in accepting your care.


They also can think it is a sign of weakness to accept help, be stubborn or be worried about the physical burden and costs involved.
The person might also be experiencing memory loss, which might cause them to forget why they need care.
Certain techniques for dealing with resistance may not be appropriate for elderly who suffer from dementia.

, Assess the kind of care and help that your loved one needs. Be honest as to the type of services and assistance the person will require.

, Choose a time when you are both relaxed and open to conversation. This will make it easier for you both to speak openly and honestly while listening to what the other person says.

, They may be feeling the loss of freedom and independence by requiring assistance and it is important to take their wishes into consideration. Ask them for their choices in terms of which family member or type of service provides care. You may not be able to accomplish all of their wishes but it is important to hear and consider them.


If your loved one has trouble understanding you, try simplifying your explanations and questions to help them understand.

, Get family and friends to help when speaking to your loved one. They may be able to help persuade your loved one to accept assistance.

, It may take time and effort to convince your loved one to accept help. If they are unwilling to discuss the topic at first, try again later and don't give up.

, If they are still very resistant to the idea of requiring help then you can suggest a trial run so that they do not have to make a final decision right away. This gives them the opportunity to see how things go and discover the benefits of receiving help.

, You can describe care centers as clubs or a care provider as a friend so that your loved one sees care as a positive experience.

, Tell the elderly person about how it will help you and make your own life easier if they accept care. Sometimes your loved one might feel guilty about the burden they are placing on you, but if you tell them how much it will help you for them to accept care, they may be more willing.


Remind your loved one that you will both need to compromise on some issues.

, You are unlikely to agree on everything. Choose the topics that you wish to discuss and avoid fighting over minor issues. Focus on the major issues relating to the care of your loved one.

, Accepting help and assistance might enable the elderly person to remain in his/her own home for as long as possible."

You can also pick a moisturizer with a sunscreen.Make sure to pick a broad-spectrum sunscreen, meaning the sunscreen protects you from both UVA and UVB rays.Some experts recommend SPF 30 or higher. Also, try to pick one that is at least water resistant so it will stay on your skin.;
, Moisturizing your skin every day can make a large difference in how your skin ages;however, it's important to pick one that's right for your skin.For oily skin, pick something light that's water-based. You should look for one that's noncomedogenic (it will say it on the bottle) to help keep your pores from clogging. For dry skin, you need something with more weight. An oil-based moisturizer is preferable. If you're somewhere in the middle, you should probably stick with a something lighter that's water-based. Most moisturizers are labelled for skin type. As you get older, though, your skin will need more moisture, so pick an oil-based moisturizer no matter what your skin type as you age.If your skin is sensitive, pick a moisturizer that will soothe rather than irritate. Ingredients that may irritate include scents, dyes, and acids. Ingredients that will soothe include aloe and chamomile.To cut down on your routine, consider buying a moisturizer with a built-in sunscreen, so you don't need to apply two products.

, While a sunless tanner isn't anti-aging on its own, tanning in the sun or at tanning beds can age your skin faster; therefore, using a tanning cream instead can be safer for your skin.If you're new to sunless tanners, pick a lotion or gel, which are easier to apply than mousses. Also, stick with a lighter color, as you can always apply more if you need to do so, but you can't take it off as easily if your skin becomes too dark.Also, apply a tiny bit in a small area before applying it to your whole body. That way, you can see what the color looks like on you.Skip applying sunless tanners around your mouth, nose, and eyes. While sunless tanners are generally more safe than tanning in the sun, the FDA hasn't approved their use near these areas., Washing the day off your face at the end of the day is important in keeping your skin healthy and young. Cleansers are often better than soaps.They are better targeted to deal with various skin problems.When choosing a cleanser, look for one that's meant for your skin type. They should be labelled to help you choose.If you have a specific problem, like acne, pick a cleanser that helps deal with that issue. Once again, the bottles should be labelled for skin problems, too., Creams with antioxidants can be beneficial. They help absorb free radicals that can cause damage to your skin.Antioxidants to look for include vitamin C, vitamin B3, and vitamin E. These vitamins are particularly effective in a cream because they are able to be absorbed into the skin more readily than others.A free radical is just oxygen that isn't stable.As an added bonus, vitamin B3 helps your skin retain moisture., Though vitamin A is also an antioxidant, it does more than just work on free radicals. It can also help increase production of collagen fibers in your skin. Collagen fibers affect elasticity, meaning it can cut down on wrinkles.Retinol is a form of vitamin A, so look for that on the label., This ingredient can also help reduce wrinkles. In addition, it may help protect your skin against the sun., These ingredients mimic peptides in your skin. Specifically, they can mimic collagen or elastin, the fibers the help regulate elasticity. They encourage your skin to produce more of these molecules, which in turn helps reduce wrinkles on your skin., Certain extracts also act as antioxidants. In addition, many of them are also anti-inflammatory, helping your skin be less puffy. Two to look for are green tea extract and grape seed extract. Grape seed extract also helps you heal from skin injuries., Using multiple anti-aging products, such as wrinkle creams, can actually work against you. Multiple products can irritate your skin, which does not help you with aging. Stick to one main product directly aimed at anti-aging., Before you slather a cream all over your face, it's best to test it on your skin. Put a small amount on the side of your neck. Leave it on for 24 hours, checking to see if you have a reaction to the cream, such as a rash. If you do, you don't want to use it on your face., Just because a product is more expensive, that does not mean it's more effective. Some less-expensive products can have the same or similar ingredients., You may think you are able to self-diagnose your skin, but a professional can help you decide what you actually need. Ask your dermatologist what's best for your skin. You may also consider talking to other skin care professionals."

Read the person's pulse manually.,
Use other methods to take a pulse.,
Count breaths for the respiratory rate.,
Check for a pulse and breathing in an emergency.",How to Check Vitals2," To read a person's pulse, place your index and middle fingers on the person's radial artery. This artery is on the inside of the wrist, closest to the thumb. When pressing, you should be able to feel the heartbeat using a firm but light pressure. Pressing to hard may only complicate your reading. Count the number of heartbeats in 30 seconds and multiply by two for beats per minute.You can also count the beats over 60 seconds, if you prefer.

, Instead of feeling for a pulse, you can also listen with a stethoscope to the heartbeat, still counting the beats in 30 seconds. Each ""lub-dub"" of the heart counts for a single beat, not two. In addition, blood pressure machines also read pulse, and most clinics and hospitals also have a finger monitor that can check pulse rates.

For a typical adult, the pulse should be between 60 and 80 beats per minute., To check for the respiratory rate, count the number of times a person breathes in a minute. One full cycle of inhaling and exhaling counts as a single breath. If you're doing it on someone else, you can simply watch how many times their chest rises and count.Normal respiration is generally 12 to 16 breaths per minute for an adult.

, If you come upon a person in a emergency, you'll need to check to see if the person is breathing and if they have a heartbeat. To check for breathing, watch the person's chest, listen close to the person's mouth, and feel their chest to see if they are breathing. To check for a pulse, place your index finger and middle finger on their carotid artery, which is in the middle of the neck between the neck muscle and windpipe. Hold your fingers there to see if you feel a pulse.If the person isn't breathing or doesn't have a heartbeat, you'll need to begin CPR. If the person isn't breathing and they're on their back, first try to tilt their head back, which may move the tongue out of the way.

Have the person sit quietly.,
Try an automatic machine.,
Set up a manual blood pressure cuff.,
Inflate the cuff on a manual blood pressure cuff.,
Release the air to read blood pressure.",How to Check Vitals3," Before you take blood pressure, the patient should be sitting for a few minutes (about 5 minutes) beforehand. Blood pressure readings should be taken while the patient is at rest with their legs and arms uncrossed., Place the cuff on the upper arm (above the elbow), tightening it well. A mark on the cuff will indicate where it needs to be placed in relation to the artery. The wired part of the machine should be on the inside of the arm. If it's a wrist cuff, place it so the monitor is on the inside of the wrist. Once secured, turn the machine on, and start the reading. Try to remain still or have the patient remain still while it's reading. You can take more than one reading for better accuracy.A reading of less than 120/80 is considered normal. Any higher starts getting into prehypertension (pre-high blood pressure)., Apply the cuff to just above the elbow, tightening enough that you can just fit two fingertips underneath. Slip the stethoscope between the skin and the cuff in the middle of the antecubital fossa, or elbow pit, and put the earpieces in your ears. The gauge for the machine should sit in your cuffed hand, if you're taking your own measurements, or you can just hold it if you're taking someone else's measurements., Squeeze the pump quickly (with the opposite hand if you're reading yourself). When you get to 30 points above what your systolic pressure (high end) normally is, you can stop. If you are working on someone else, inflate it to the 160 to 180 range, though if you immediately hear heartbeats, you'll need to go higher., Begin letting the air out by turning the knob counterclockwise. It should only drop the gauge two to three points a second. Make sure deflation shows steady on the gauge. When you hear the first heartbeat, note where the gauge is, as that's the systolic pressure. When the heartbeat stops, note where the gauge is again, which is the diastolic pressure. You can deflate and remove the cuff."

Observe the patient.,
Weigh the patient.,
Discuss pain levels.,
Take a reading of oxygen saturation.",How to Check Vitals4," Don't forget to observe the patient while taking readings to see if they seem worried. Have them sit in a relaxed position with their legs uncrossed. Pay attention to see if they are in obvious distress or if they have something wrong with them that's visible to the naked eye., Sometimes, weight is included in vital signs. To weigh a patient, ask them to get on a scale, and then write down the number. Make no judgment on the person's weight, whether by comment, facial expression, or body language., For this vital, you'll need to ask the person how they are feeling and to rate their pain on a scale from 0-10. Of course, everyone's pain scale will be different, but if you can get a good idea of what level of pain the person is having, that helps assess their overall condition.First say, ""Are you in any pain?"" If the answer is ""yes,"" ask ""Can you rate your pain on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt?""

, Oxygen saturation is how much oxygen is in your blood. It is an important indicator of whether the patient is breathing properly and/or pumping blood to the body properly. A simple device that fits over the patient's fingernail will give you a reading for oxygen saturation, which normally is at 95 to 100 percent."

Pick your bandage.,
Prepare the bandage.,
Position the bandage.,
Add extra padding, if necessary.,
Decide if athletic tape is right for you.,
Begin with an underwrap.,
Secure the anchor.,
Create a stirrup.,
Create an ""x"" over the foot.,

Work your way toward the ankle.,
Wrap the ankle.,
Finish the wrap.",How to Wrap a Sprained Ankle," For most people, the best choice of wrapping for a compression wrap is a cloth elastic bandage, sometimes colloquially known as an “ACE bandage,” after a common brand of elastic bandage.



Any brand of elastic bandage will work. However, wider bandages (between one-and-half and three inches wide) are usually easier to use.
Cloth elastic bandages are comfortable, since they're made of stretchy cloth. They are also reusable. (When you're finished, you can wash it and use it again when you need it.)
Some bandages come with metal clips for fastening the end of the wrap. If yours does not include metal clips, medical tape can also be used to secure the end of the bandage when the wrap is complete. You can also securely tuck the end of the bandage into the wrap.;
, If your elastic bandage is not already wrapped, roll the bandage into a tight coil.








Compression wraps should fit against the foot and ankle snugly, so it helps to have the cloth wrap coiled tightly from the beginning, making it less likely that you will need to stretch and readjust the bandage as you go.

, If you are wrapping your own ankle, it may be easier to position the rolled bandage on the inside of your foot. If you are wrapping someone else’s ankle, it may be easier position the rolled bandage on the outside of the foot.











In either case, it’s crucial that coil face away from the foot, so that the coiled portion of the bandage is on the outside of the foot as you wrap it.
For example, if you think of the coiled bandage as a roll of toilet paper and the foot as a wall, the coiled bandage should be in an “under” orientation., For extra support, you can place a gauze pad on either side of the ankle before wrapping. Horseshoe-shaped padding cut from foam or felt is also used for extra stability in compression wraps.










, In most cases, it’s best to use a cloth bandage to wrap a sprain; however, some individuals engaged in athletic activity, such as running, prefer the feel of athletic tape.


While athletic tape works to wrap an injured ankle, it is primarily made to wrap an uninjured joint before activity to avoid injury, not to protect an already injured ankle.
Even though the thinner, sturdier athletic tape makes continued activity easier than the bulkier, more flexible cloth bandage, continued athletic activity on a sprained ankle is not advised., Underwrap is a nonadhesive material used to wrap the foot and ankle before the tape is applied, so that the tape doesn't pull at the surface of the skin. Starting at the ball of the foot, wind the underwrap around the foot up to the ankle, leaving the heel uncovered.











Underwrap is available at drugstores and sporting goods stores.
It is possible to tape an ankle without underwrap, but it is much less comfortable.

, Cut a strip of tape long enough to wrap 1 1/2 times around your ankle. Wind it around your ankle, over the underwrap, to hold the underwrap in place. This is called the anchor, since it anchors the rest of the taping in place.











If the ankle has a lot of hair, it can be shaved so that the tape doesn't stick to it.
If necessary, use a second piece of tape to make sure the underwrap is secure.

, Place the end of a piece of tape on one side of the anchor. Bring it down under the arch of the foot and back up to the other side of the anchor. Press it lightly to secure it in place.











Repeat with two more pieces of tape overlapping the first one to create a sturdy stirrup.

, Place the end of a piece of tape at the ankle bone and run it diagonally over the top of the foot. Bring it down under the arch and toward the inside of the heel. Then bring it around the back of the heel and back up over the foot to create the other part of the ""x.""










, Place the end of a piece of tape on the outside of the ankle, just above the bone. Run it over the top of the foot at an angle, then bring it under the arch and up the other side of the foot. Next bring it around the ankle and back to the point where you started.











Repeat the figure eight. Use another piece of tape to make a second figure eight that overlaps the first one. This will ensure that the wrap is held securely in place and provides enough support for the ankle to heal properly.

, Place the end of the bandage where the toes meet the foot. Begin by wrapping the bandage around the ball of the foot. Hold the end of the bandage against the ball of the foot with one hand, and use the other to bring the tail around the foot from the outside.











Keep the bandage tight, but don't wrap it so tight that it decreases blood flow to the foot and toes.

, Wrap the ball of the foot twice, to hold the bandage in place, then begin moving up towards the ankle, being sure to leave at least one-half inch of bandage overlapping the previous layer.











Make sure the layers are smooth and even with no unnecessary bulges or lumps. Start over if you need to do the job more neatly.

, When you get to the ankle, bring the end of the bandage up outside of the foot, over the instep and around the inside of the ankle. Then bring it around the heel, back up over the instep, under the foot, and around the ankle.











Continue making this “figure eight” around the ankle several times to fully stabilize the ankle.

, The last wrap should rise several inches above the ankle to help stabilize it.



Use the metal fasteners or medical tape to secure the remaining bandage. Excess bandage can also be tucked under the last layer of bandage, provided there’s not too much excess.
If you are wrapping a child's ankle, there may be too much excess bandage, and it will have to be cut.

Recognize the symptoms.,
See a doctor.,
Do extensive tests.,
Rate your injury with he Croft’s Classification system.",How to Treat Whiplash1," Whiplash is a problem that causes damage to the soft tissue and ligaments surrounding the upper spine. If you are in an accident or undergo trauma, you could have immediate symptoms. You also may have symptoms that start within a day after the incident. Symptoms of whiplash include neck stiffness or pain, headaches that start at the top of the back of the neck, the inability to move your neck around, soreness of the shoulders, arms, and upper back, tingling to the arms from nerve damage, tiredness, dizziness, depression, blurred vision, ringing ears, insomnia, and memory and concentration problems., If you are having neck pain after an accident, injury, or sports injury, it is important to got to the hospital or your doctor right away. You need to make sure you do not have fractures or other damages to your neck. You should also see a doctor right away to check you out if you experience any of the delayed symptoms in the days following the accident or trauma.If you don't have any pain or the doctor sends you home without much treatment, you might have to make another trip to the doctor. Your injuries may not be recognizable until hours after the trauma has happened. Even if you only have minor neck pain, seek treatment the day or so after the accident or trauma.
Make a through evaluation of bruising and swelling of your neck. Keep a check on this. If your symptoms worsen and you are unable to move your neck, go immediately to the hospital. If you do not go to the hospital, a prolonged disability may be the result.If you notice any head impact or loss of consciousness during your accident, call an ambulance right away or have someone drive you to the hospital.

, Make sure your doctor takes X-rays to look at your bones. You need to rule out fractures to your neck and spine. If the X-rays come back normal but you still have neck pain, you may need an MRI to look closer at the soft tissue in the neck. If your MRI is normal but the pain persists, the doctor may order a CT scan. This looks at the body even closer with computer technology showing all different angles of imaging.


You doctor will use these to assess the extent of the injuries before she advises you of future treatment recommendations., To understand how bad your whiplash is, you can compare it to other possible levels of injury. This system was invented by Dr. Croft to grade the whiplash injury from Grade 1 to Grade 5. Grade 1 consists of minimal whiplash with no motion issues, ligament injury, or neurological injury. Treatment can last 10 weeks. Grade 2 means you have slightly limited motion, no ligament injury, and no neurological injury. Treatment can last 29 weeks. Grade 3 patients have moderate motion limitation, some injury to ligaments, and do have neurological symptoms. Treatment can last 56 weeks. Grade 4 is considered moderately severe, which includes motion limitation, injury to ligaments, positive neurological symptoms, and fractured disc or disc misalignment. Grade 4 requires continued treatment with an unspecified end. Grade 5 is severe and requires surgery and rehab for treatment."

Keep your arm straight as much as possible.,
Sleep with straight arms.,
Get hands-free technology for your phone.,
Keep pressure off your elbow and the inside of your arm.,
Cushion your elbow.,
Avoid the activity that irritated the nerve.",How to Untrap a Nerve in Your Elbow1," Don’t sit for long periods of time with your elbow bent, and try to avoid repeatedly bending your elbow. Whether this involves setting up your work desk differently, taking frequent breaks from typing, or taking time off from playing tennis, do what you can.If you type a lot at work, try to get dictation software.;
, Lots of people sleep with their elbows bent. Try not to do this. Wrap a towel around your arm with tape to prevent yourself from bending it while you sleep. Wrap the towel over your elbow while your arm is straight and secure it with tape on both sides of your elbow - loosely enough so you don't cut off circulation, but tightly enough so the towel acts like a splint, keeping your arm straight. If this doesn’t work, ask your doctor for a splint that you can wear at night., You may be bending your arm all the time if you’re on the phone a lot.Instead of holding your phone up to your ear for long periods of time, get hands-free technology like Bluetooth., Don’t lean on your elbow for long periods of time on hard surfaces. This can compress and irritate the nerve. Try to readjust your posture so you don’t lean on your elbows.

Don’t rest your elbow on the armrest of your chair.
Don’t rest your arm on your open window while you drive.

, If you have to put pressure on your elbow, cushion it first. Place a pillow or other soft object beneath your elbow for extra padding, or wear an elbow pad., If you’re aware of what is causing the nerve to get inflamed, stop doing that activity. Usually it’s something that requires you to bend your elbow over and over again, or keep your elbow bent for long periods of time. Think about what you do on a daily basis and pay attention to the position your arm is in.

Try keeping a journal of your daily activities.

Sprinkle sugar on the affected wound.,
Splash some Listerine or mouthwash on the nick or cut.,
Add a few eye drops to the affected nick or cut.,
Invest in an old-fashioned styptic pencil or alum block.",How to Treat Razor Nicks and Cuts1," One of the traditional methods to treat a nick or cut is to apply a small piece of toilet paper to the area and wait for it to clot over.While this method works, it often takes longer to stop the bleeding than some of the other remedies discussed below.
Don’t forget to remove the toilet paper before leaving the house.;
, Cold water constricts the blood vessels, which slows blood flow to the area and helps stop the bleeding. Grab an ice cube from the freezer and hold it to the affected area.You can also try to run the affected area under cold water or hold a cold cloth against the wound.
Some people recommend soaking a hand towel with water, wringing it out, and then placing it in the freezer so it is available to treat these minor shaving nicks and cuts.

, Hot water will also help stop the bleeding because it basically cauterizes the wound. Hold a warm cloth firmly in place over the wound.


You might have to keep running the cloth under warm water for maximum effect., Witch hazel is an astringent that also constricts blood vessels and should relieve the bleeding. Soak a cotton ball with witch hazel and apply it to the location of the nick or cut.Since witch hazel is an astringent, be prepared for it to sting when you apply it.

, The next time you nick or cut yourself shaving, reach for the lip balm or vaseline. Since the texture is waxy, it seals the skin and forces the blood to clot over.Don’t apply the lip balm directly from the tube because then you can’t use it again. Instead, scrape a little off with a cotton swab so your lip balm is still sanitary to use.

, Many antiperspirants and deodorants contain aluminum chloride, which can cause a blood clot to form and help stanch the bleeding. Coat your fingertip with the deodorant or antiperspirant and then gently apply it to the affected area.So you don’t have to throw the tube of deodorant away after using, it’s best to apply with a fingertip or a cotton swab.

, If the cut is small, sprinkling a little sugar onto the wound will stop the bleeding and also disinfect the wound.Some people also recommend cayenne and black pepper, but these will sting more than the sugar.

, Before being marketed as a mouthwash, Listerine was originally used as a surgical antiseptic. Splash a little mouthwash on the affected area to disinfect your wound and stop the bleeding.As you might imagine, it stings quite a bit, but it should get the job done.

, Eye drops such as Visine constrict blood vessels, which help slow and stop bleeding. As a result eye drops can also provide relief when you cut or nick yourself while shaving., Once standard issue in medicine cabinets and shaving kits, these products have been around for centuries. Styptic pencils usually contain titanium dioxide, potassium alum, or a sulfate formulation that helps the blood clot. Similarly, alum blocks are bar-soap sized blocks of potassium alum, which constricts the tissues and stanches blood flow.To use a styptic pencil, you wet the tip and press it against the nick or cut.
To use an alum block you wet it and rub it on the affected area.
The astringents in these products make them sting, but they should stop the bleeding quickly. They can also prevent razor burn.
Styptic pencils and alum blocks can leave behind a powdery, white residue, so be sure to check the mirror and rinse it off before heading out the door.
You can usually find styptic pencils and alum blocks at pharmacies, beauty supply stores, and online. Traditional barber’s shops might also sell them.

Limit activities.,
Use ice to relieve pain.,
Switch to heat.,
Take over-the-counter pain medication.,
Take prescription pain medication.,
Get steroid injections.",How to Treat Whiplash2," After your accident, you need to rest the first 24 hours. Try a firm mattress with a neck support pillow for comfort. After this time has passed, you can slowly resume activity instead of sitting in bed. Limit your work and other daily activities for the first few days after the injury occurs, then return to normal activities as pain allows.


Avoid lifting anything heavy for 6 weeks to 6b months, depending on the severity of your case.Spread out your activities throughout the day. If doing household chores, do not lift heavy clothes from the washer to the dryer. Have breaks often to rest your neck. If carrying children, use the stroller or switch arms often.

, Apply ice to your neck, back, or shoulders for the first 48-72 hours after the injury. This helps reduce swelling and the pain. Ice treatments are most effective if you apply them 10-30 minutes at a time, as often as once an hour. Do not put ice directly on skin. Use a towel to wrap the ice to avoid frostbite.


Avoid heat initially because it promotes swelling., Switch to moist heat on the fourth day after the injury. This will help restore flexibility to your muscles. Apply the heat on the neck 10-30 minutes at a time, as often as once every 2-3 hours. You can make your own moist heat pack. Fill a cloth sock with 4 cups of uncooked rice. Tie the sock at the end. Microwave for 1-3 minutes.If you want you can add essential oils to the rice to make it smell good.

, Your doctor may recommend over-the-counter pain medications. He may also suggest anti-inflammatory medications to decrease the pain and promote healing. Tylenol is used mostly for pain, though it does not help with swelling. NSAIDS like ibuprofen, aspirin, and Aleve will help with the swelling and pain. You can take Tylenol and NSAIDS together because they do not interact with one another and work differently for pain control., If your injury is severe enough, the doctor may prescribe you medications for the pain. These can include muscle relaxants such as Valium to help the spasms caused by the trauma. Narcotics like Vicodin and Percocet can be used as well for pain in severe cases.


If you run out, another follow up is recommended to see if further testing needs to be done., In more severe cases of whiplash, a doctor may use trigger point or epidural spinal injections to treat whiplash. For the epidural steroid injections, the medication is injected to help with pinched nerve pain in your neck. The spinal cord has nerves that branch out to the arms and legs. Injecting the medication in the epidural spaces helps the pain in these nerve areas. The steroid also helps with the swelling directly on the nerve that is swollen. There may be a total of 2-3 injections needed for this pain.


Facet joint injections or facet blocks are also used for helping pain. The facet joints help us move, so you may need medication to help them feel better. Though not as common as epidural injections, they are effective. Trigger points are balls of muscle that become inflamed. The doctor can inject a painkiller in this area to help with inflammation as well.The stronger medications and spinal injections reduce your pain so that you can work on healing the soft tissue injuries. You do this through treatments such as physical therapy.

See a physical therapist.,
Wear a neck brace.,

Consider massage therapy.,
Consider Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).,
Try acupuncture.",How to Treat Whiplash3," Once you have the pain and inflammation under control, you will need to go see a physical therapist. Physical therapy is a variety of techniques used to help recover the movement of your neck and areas affected by the whiplash. It can often be used to help restore a person’s range of movement after a whiplash injury. The physical therapists will help you know what stretches and exercises you can do to increase the strength and range of motion of your neck, back, and arms. Stretching and exercises should not cause pain. If they do, stop them and talk to your doctor or physical therapist.Your physiotherapist will be able to show you neck exercises you can do at home.
Applying moist heat before your therapy may help aid in the therapy.
Common practices in physical therapy include rotating your neck left to right, tilting your head side to side, moving it up and down, and rolling your shoulders., Occasionally the doctor may immobilize your neck with a soft cervical collar. This is no longer standard practice with all cases of whiplash because evidence has shown early movement is helpful. If surgery is indicated, immobilization is required., You may need to see a chiropractor for adjustments and spinal manipulations. Most chiropractors are using the modern early movement protocol. This guides the practitioner to help rehab patients affected by whiplash. They have noticed early movement is better and recovery is shorter. This can help restore normal movement to your neck and back., Massage therapy is great for soft tissue rehabilitation. A massage may be helpful later in the recovery stages of whiplash, but in the beginning, the massage is not indicated. Massage increases the blood flow to the injured muscles and ligaments and speeds the healing process. In the recovery of whiplash, the massage can be helpful in relieving spasms., TENS is used to give small electrical impulses to your nerves in the affected areas. It distracts the pain sensors in the brain. Though it is expensive, there is no disadvantages to using TENS. However, there is not enough evidence that it helps mild cases to recommend it for every whiplash patient., Acupuncture can be used as a helpful tool for those with whiplash. It breaks up muscle tension similar to a massage. Putting a small needle into the body helps relieve pain by relieving muscle tension and promoting blood flow. This helps after your injury to recover the tissues faster."

Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.,
Put ice on your elbow.,
Wear a brace or a splint.,
Try a nerve gliding exercise.",How to Untrap a Nerve in Your Elbow2," Try over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen to alleviate pain and inflammation. This can help reduce pressure around the nerve, letting it move more freely and painlessly. Ask your doctor or pharmacist which medication is right for you if you have any medical conditions, especially if you have liver or kidney problems.

Corticosteroid injections are sometimes used to reduce swelling and pressure.Some doctor prefer not to use these, however, because of the risk of damaging the nerve. Ask your doctor.

, Wrap ice or an ice pack in a towel and place it on your elbow where it’s tender. Keep this on for 20 minutes, several times per day. This can help relieve inflammation and pain., Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist about whether an assistive device like a brace or a splint is right for you. This can help you keep your arm straight while you’re being active, which will let the nerve rest and recover. Wear your brace or splint as often and as long as your doctor tells you.You might wear your splint only at night, only when you’re active, or during the day and night., Hold your arm out in front of you with your elbow straight. Curl your fingers and wrist inward toward your body. Then extend them away from you, and extend your wrist so that your fingers point towards the floor. Then bend your elbow.Some doctors think this exercise may help your nerve slide over your elbow more easily and alleviate symptoms.

Discuss surgery with an orthopedic surgeon.,
Talk about your surgical options.,
Recover from surgery.",How to Untrap a Nerve in Your Elbow4," Cubital tunnel syndrome can usually be managed with lifestyle changes and bracing, but you may need surgery for severe cases. Talk to your doctor about surgery if conservative measures don’t help after 6 weeks, or if your pinched nerve is causing damage or muscle weakness in your hand.Ask for a referral to an orthopedic surgeon, a surgeon who specializes in bones, muscles, and nerves., There are several possible surgeries you can have. Ask your surgeon to discuss the risks and benefits of each, and help you determine which is best for you:

Cubital tunnel release: this cuts the ligament that may be restricting your ulnar nerve.
Ulnar nerve anterior transposition: this moves the ulnar nerve from its place behind the elbow bone to in front of it, which prevents it from getting caught.
Medial epicondylectomy: this removes part of the bone that the ulnar nerve catches on.
If there is a tumor or cyst in your elbow that is rubbing on the nerve, surgery can remove it., After your surgery, you will probably wear a splint for a while – up to 3-6 weeks. Your doctor may send you to physical therapy. Talk to your doctor about when it’s safe for you to return to work and your other normal activities."

Rinse the wound under cold water.,
Apply pressure to the wound.,
Elevate the wound.,
Clean the wound.,
Bandage the wound.,
Remove the bandage after a few days.,
Seek medical attention if the bleeding continues or you see signs of infection.",How to Treat Razor Nicks and Cuts2," This will help stop the bleeding and give you a better idea of how severe the wound is., Find a tissue, a wad of toilet paper, or a towel and press down on the area where the bleeding seems the most severe. Apply pressure to the wound for 5 to 15 minutes.If blood soaks through the cloth, add another cloth without lifting up the one on the wound.
If applying firm pressure did not stop the bleeding, you can pinch the skin together with your skin and index finger, which should help stop the bleeding.
If this technique doesn’t work and you continue bleeding, seek medical attention as soon as possible.

, If possible, try to elevate the body part with the wound so it is positioned above the heart. This should help slow down blood flow to that area., After the bleeding stops, use hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or an antibiotic cream on the affected area. This will help prevent infection and ensure the cut heals faster.

, Place a sterile bandage on the wound to keep dirt and bacteria out and prevent the bleeding from starting again.Change the bandage if blood soaks through or it gets wet. This will help keep the wound clean and dry.

, If the cut was not too severe, you can probably remove the bandage from the wound after a few days. This will help it heal faster., If you are unable to stop the bleeding or notice any redness, irritation, or pus around the cut, it’s best to seek medical attention as soon as possible. A medical professional will be able to evaluate and provide appropriate care for your wound."

Moisturize the area before and after shaving.,
Have a warm shower before you shave.,
Replace your razor blade regularly.,
Avoid shaving dry.,
Ditch the single-blade disposable razor.,
Keep the razor clean and dry.,
Handle the razor properly.,
Consider using a different type of razor.",How to Treat Razor Nicks and Cuts3," Moisturizing before and after you shave will help prevent nicks and cuts from occurring in the first place.

, Taking a warm shower before you shave or washing the area you are shaving with hot water for a few minutes prior to shaving will help keep the razor from dragging on your skin. This reduces the risk of nicks and cuts.This technique is called wet shaving.
When you wet shave, use a gentle soap that won’t strip away your skin’s oils or dry out the skin, which makes shaving even more difficult. , Replacing your razor blade regularly will prevent the nicks and cuts that come from shaving with a dull razor. Changing your blade often will also prevent razor bumps and redness, and reduce the growth of bacteria that might lead to infections. Change your blades as soon they seem dull. When the razor drags on your skin or when it feels uncomfortable to shave, this is a good indicator you need to change the blade.
Changing your razor after 5 to 10 shaves is one recommended timeline, but it depends on how often you use your razor.Gillette recently revealed that their razor cartridges are designed to last for five weeks., Although it might be tempting to try and save money and time, shaving dry or without gel or cream increases the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Use shaving gel or shaving cream so the razor will glide smoothly over your skin.


Hair conditioner also works well as a shave gel or cream, and can be less expensive depending on the brand. , Disposable razors with a single blade, while often more affordable, tend to drag on the skin, leading to nasty nicks and cuts.For a smoother shave, opt for a razor with more blades.

, Most of us don’t bother to clean or dry our razor blade after using, but research suggests this increases longevity, and prevents the blade from getting dull, which usually results in bad cuts and nicks. Try these tricks to keep your razor clean and dry:Rinse your razor after use in clean, hot water.
On a dry towel or a pair of jeans, wipe the razor in the opposite direction from shaving. This helps get rid of any hair or shaving cream residue that might dull the blades or result in a less than perfect shave.
Lubricate the blades after use with olive oil or an oil that won’t irritate your skin. You can use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of oil to the blade.
Let the razor air dry, and store it away from water.

, Handling your razor properly and avoiding a few common mistakes will help prolong the life of your blades. You should avoid:Pressing too hard on the razor, which wears the blade down but also increases the risk of nicks and cuts.
Tapping the razor head against the sink or shower can damage the blade edges, shorten the blade’s life, and result in nicks and cuts.

, If your current shaving method continues to cause irritating nicks and cuts, research and experiment with other razor options or other hair-removal methods.


To get a smoother shave without the nicks and cuts, many people are turning to more traditional shaving methods with double-edged (DE) razors or straight razors."

Rest.,
Apply ice or cold therapy.,
Wear a brace.,
Perform tennis elbow exercises.,
Perform the ball squeeze exercise.",How to Treat Tennis Elbow1," Like all illnesses and injuries, the most important thing you can do for your body is to rest. In this case, be sure you’re getting all the sleep you need as well as resting your arm by avoiding repetitive movements that might strain the tendon even more., Wrap an ice pack in a thin towel and apply to the affected area for fifteen minutes three to four times a day.

, Tennis elbow braces help to protect the damaged tendon during the healing process. However, be sure to wear it just below the painful area of the arm, not directly over it., These are special stretches that help to encourage healing. However, do not do any of these exercises if you still experience a lot of pain, as you could worsen the situation.


Perform a wrist extensor stretch. To do this, elongate your affected arm so that it is perpendicular to your torso, and make your hand into a fist. Take your opposite hand and grab the top of the fist and push it down, so that your arm is still extended but your wrist is now facing the ground. Hold this for twenty seconds and release, and repeat up to five times.Perform a wrist flexor stretch. To do this, elongate your affected arm so that it is perpendicular to your torso, with the forearm facing up. Turn your hand back, so that your fingers are facing the ground. Take your opposite hand and grab your fingers, pushing back towards your body until you feel a mild stretch in your forearm. Hold for about twenty seconds, and repeat up to four times., For this exercise you will need a “stress” or tennis ball. This exercise targets the forearm flexors and small muscles in your forearm and hand. It will drastic help improve your grip strength which will once again allow you to carry and hold items with confidence once again. Sit in a chair and grip the ball in the hand of your affected arm. Squeeze the ball and keep it squeezed for 3 seconds, then release. Work your way up to holding the squeeze for as long as you can. Do this exercise for 10 squeezes, twice every other day.

Check the wound.,
Prepare a serious wound for travel to a doctor.,
Do not attempt to thoroughly clean the wound or seal the wound with household products.,
Get to your doctor safely.",How to Treat Deep Cuts1," If you can see fat, muscle, or bone through your cut, or if the cut is wide and jagged, you will most likely need stitches. If you are unsure, you should check with a doctor or nurse.Signs that it is a problem needing quick attention can include any or a combination of the following: extreme pain, a lot of bleeding, signs of shock (such as cold, sweaty skin, feeling cold, or paleness of skin and appearance).
You know a cut is through the skin if you can see fat (yellow-tan, lumpy tissue), muscle (deep-red, stringy tissue), or bone (tan-white, hard surface).However, any cut that is more than three centimeters long or 1/2 inch deep requires medical attention.
If a cut does not go all the way through the skin, it does not need stitches, and can be cared for at home.;
, If you believe your cut needs emergency medical attention, there are a few things you can do to care for the wound before traveling to the emergency room. Quickly rinse the wound under water to wash away any loose debris or dirt. Try to wipe any debris or dirt away from the injury site first with sterile gauze to ensure that the water does not wash the debris into the wound. Next, apply pressure with a clean cloth or bandage and continue to hold pressure as you get transported to the emergency room.


The wound will get cleaned again when you see your doctor to make sure it is thoroughly disinfected.
If the wound is large and bleeding a lot, try to wrap the area with a towel or bandage, then continue to apply pressure.As you travel, try to position the wound above the level of the heart to reduce severe bleeding.

, Don't remove any object that does not wash away easily. If glass or debris is lodged in the wound, you can do more damage by trying to remove it yourself. Also, do not attempt to sew or glue the wound shut, as household products can cause infection and/or prevent healing. Do not use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine to clean the cut, as it can slow healing., If possible, do not drive yourself, as it may be dangerous. If you are alone and bleeding seriously, it may be a good idea to call an ambulance.

Rest and take it easy.,
Apply cold therapy for acute muscle soreness.,
Apply moist heat for chronic muscle soreness.,
Take pain medicine.,
Stretch your sore muscle(s).,
Drink more water.",How to Treat Sore Muscles1," Most muscle soreness happens from either lifting too much weight, doing some activity too often, moving awkwardly or experiencing physical trauma (motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries).As such, the first step with any pulled or strained muscle that becomes sore is to rest it and stop doing the activity that caused the injury. You may need to take a few days off work or away from your sports team (depending on severity), but sore muscles recover quicker if they are given the appropriate time to rest.


If your muscle soreness takes longer than a few weeks to fade away, then either a significant proportion of muscle fiber is torn (considered a Grade 2 or Grade 3 muscle strain) or related joints and ligaments are also injured.
Dull, achy pain usually indicates a mild-to-moderate muscle strain, whereas sharp and/or shooting pain with movement is often caused by joint and/or ligament sprains.
If your sore muscle is exercise related, you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — consult with a personal trainer.;
, If your muscle soreness is acute (developed recently), then inflammation is likely an issue and should be addressed with cold therapy.Apply cold therapy (crushed ice, a frozen gel pack or a bag of peas from the freezer) to the sorest part of the involved muscle in order to reduce inflammation and pain. Cold therapy causes the local blood vessels to constrict, which prevents excessive swelling, and it numbs small nerve fibers. Apply cold therapy for 10 to 20 minutes every few hours (the larger or deeper the affected muscle, the longer the time), then reduce the frequency as your muscle soreness subsides.


Compressing the cold therapy against your sore muscle with a stretchy bandage or elastic wrap will also help combat swelling, but be careful not to completely cut off circulation.
Wrap any type of cold therapy in a thin towel in order to prevent irritation or frostbite on your skin.

, If your muscle soreness has become chronic (lasting for more than a month) and feels more stiff instead of acutely inflamed, then apply moist heat instead of cold therapy to get relief.Microwavable herbal bags (usually filled with bulgur wheat or flaxseed, and then mixed with herbs) work well for relaxing tension in muscles and reducing achiness, especially ones infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender or rosemary). Unlike an acutely injured muscle, chronic muscle soreness benefits from the increased blood flow that heat provides. Apply the herbal bag for about 20 minutes at a time, up to five times per day.


As an alternative, soak your chronically sore muscle(s) in a warm Epsom salt bath for about 20 minutes. The warm water improves blood circulation and the magnesium-rich salt works well to reduce muscle tension and pain.
Applying moist heat to your sore muscle just prior to stretching it (see below) is a good idea in most instances because it makes muscles more pliable and less likely to tear further.
Don't use dry heat, such as electric heating pads, on your sore muscles because you risk dehydrating the tissue and making the problem worse.

, Inflammation is a significant problem with acute muscle injuries, so taking over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the initial stages of the injury is a good strategy.Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) and aspirin, but they tend to be hard on stomachs, so limit their use to less than two weeks at a time. On the other hand, if your muscle soreness is chronic, then you can try acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead, which is much easier on your stomach, but can negatively impact your liver with longer-term use.


If your sore muscle is also significantly tight or spasming, then consider taking a muscle relaxant (such as cyclobenzaprine), but never take them at the same time as NSAIDs or painkillers. Ask your doctor for a prescription.
Keep in mind that aspirin and ibuprofen are not appropriate for young children, so consult your doctor before taking any medications or giving them to your kids.

, Muscle stretching is often recommended as an injury prevention strategy, but it can also be used to help recover from muscle injuries (albeit with some caution and common sense).Once the initial soreness of the acute muscle injury settles down after a few days, do some light stretching just to keep the muscle pliable and to prevent it from spasming (strong, painful contractions). Start with two to three stretches daily and hold them for 15 to 20 seconds each while taking deep breaths. Stop stretching if the soreness significantly increases or the type of pain changes (from soreness to sharp pain, for example).


Use the internet to find demonstrations of stretches that apply to your specific sore muscle(s), although make sure they are provided by reputable and trained sources, such as physiotherapists, chiropractors, athletic therapists, personal trainers and the like.
Chronically sore muscles are likely even more in need of stretching (due to tightness), so increase to three to five times per day and hold for 30 seconds until the discomfort fades away and the muscle loosens up.
If you stretch properly, you should not have more muscle soreness the next day. If you do, then it may be an indication you've overstretched and need to go a little easier next time.
A common cause of overstretching issues is doing them while your muscles are cold. As such, make sure to get your blood flowing or apply moist heat to any muscle before you attempt to stretch it.

, If your sore muscle involves any degree of cramping, then your problem may be related to dehydration (not enough water in the muscle tissue). Playing sports or being active in general, particularly if the weather is hot and humid, can cause excessive water loss from sweating. If you're not diligent about replacing the loss of water and maintaining normal blood volume, then dehydration and muscle cramping can ensue.Dehydration also significantly increases the risk of muscle pulls and strains. As such, aim for eight 8-ounce glasses of filtered water on most days, and maybe a little more on the weekends during summertime.


As a good indicator of dehydration, look at the color of your urine. Dark yellow can indicate dehydration, whereas colorless urine is usually an indication of normal hydration.
When replenishing yourself, avoid beverages with caffeine (coffee, black tea, soda pop, energy drinks) — it acts as a diuretic and stimulates you to urinate more often.
Fresh squeezed juice (citrus, carrot, tomato) is a great option because it also contains electrolytes — ionic mineral salts that are lost when you sweat. Sodium is the most important mineral, but calcium, magnesium and potassium are also important for muscle function.

Follow the RICER rule.,
Manage the formation of scar tissue in your knee.,
Restore the function of your legs by being active.,
Perform balance, coordination, and proprioception exercises to restore function of the nervous system to the damaged tissue in your knee and the surrounding areas.,
Perform low impact cardio to help strengthen the muscles around the affected area and build up endurance.",How to Work out With a Knee Injury," As soon as the knee injury occurs (for an acute injury) or becomes apparent (for a chronic injury), follow the RICER rule: ""Rest"" it, ""Ice"" it, ""Compress"" it with bandages, ""Elevate"" it and get a ""Referral"" from your doctor to visit a specialist.;
, Injuries often produce scar tissue, which can hamper movement and become painful if not treated. See a physiotherapist or sports massage therapist for treatment such as ultrasound and heat therapy, as well as massage therapy.

, You need to enhance the circulation in your legs to increase the blood flow, so nutrients can get to the injured area and waste products can be removed. You should focus on regaining your range of motion, as well as your strength and power, endurance, balance and proprioception.


Start with simple leg bending and straightening exercises, followed by gentle rotations of the legs.
After 14 to 21 days, depending on your progress, build up to slightly more intense leg stretching exercises and isometric exercises, such as pressing the ankle or the foot against a wall.
When you're ready for more strenuous exercises, use the weight machines at a gym to strengthen your legs. The leg curl machines and leg extension machines are an excellent way to build the strength in the muscles surrounding your knees.
Work with a certified personal trainer to do exercises with free weights.

,


You can use balance disks, balance trainers and Swiss Balls. You can also start with the training drills used in your sport such as light sprints and jumps.

, Low impact cardio can be swimming, cycling, rowing, or the elliptical trainer. Always warm up and cool down for 5 minutes, and follow each work out with some easy stretches.

Get physical therapy.,
Get a professional massage.,
Take prescription medications.",How to Treat Tennis Elbow2," This is by far the most beneficial treatment for tennis elbow, as it helps to release scar tissue and reduce tension in the tendon. Visiting a therapist also gives you the ability to practice specialized exercises and stretches that require a partner.

, Manipulating the muscles and tendons in your forearm a certain way can help to relieve the stress that builds up over time. This can help to reduce inflammation in the long run., Your doctor may be able to prescribe you an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) that can help to reduce the amount of swelling and pain experienced as a result of tennis elbow.

"
"
Avoid repetitive movements.,
Continue exercises.,
Try autologous blood or platelet injections.",How to Treat Tennis Elbow3," Straining the tendon is easy to do again, so whenever possible avoid over-using your arm. Also avoid lifting heavy objects or performing strenuous exercises.

, The exercises used for treating tennis elbow can also help to prevent a future case of the ailment. So practice your wrist flexor and extensor stretches whenever you’re able.

, These are treatments where a patient’s own blood or platelets are injected into the area of chronic pain in the forearm to try to boost healing. If your tennis elbow has been a reoccurring issue, talk to your doctor about one of these treatments."

Clean the cut.,
Apply pressure to stop the bleeding.,
Dress the wound.,
Watch for infection.",How to Treat Deep Cuts2," Wash it well with soap and water for at least 5 to 10 minutes. Any type of soap and clean water is generally fine. Studies have shown that there is no significant difference if you use antiseptic solutions like hydrogen peroxide or antimicrobial soap for a generally clean cut.


The key is to use copious amounts of irrigation. If there is dirt, glass, or another object in the cut that does not wash out easily, or if the wound is from a dirty or rusty object or animal bite, you should call your doctor., After the cut is clean, press a clean cloth or bandage to the area for at least 15 minutes. You can also help slow the bleeding by holding the cut above the level of your heart.


To prevent the clotting blood from coming off when you remove the pressure dressing, you can use a nonstick cloth like Telfa gauze.
If the cut continues to bleed after this, call your doctor., Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment and cover it with a bandage or gauze. Keep the wound dry and clean by changing the bandage one or two times daily until it heals. Try to give the wound a couple hours of time in the open air after the first two or three days, as this helps speed healing.

, If you develop signs of infection, call your doctor. These include warmth or redness around the wound, pus draining from the wound, increased pain at the site, or fever.

"
"
Call emergency services.,
Place gloves on if you are treating someone else.,
Check the severity of the wound and the injured person's responses to the injury.,
Assess life-threatening issues.,
Dress the deep cut.,
Place another dressing over the bandage if blood seeps through.,
Monitor the patient's breathing and circulation.,
Get further treatment from a medical professional.",How to Treat Deep Cuts3," It is important to get medical personal on the scene as quickly as possible. If you and the injured person are alone, you need to get extreme bleeding under control before going for help.

, It is important to keep a barrier between you and someone else's blood. Latex gloves will protect you from any possible transfer of disease from the other person's blood.

, Also check the patient's breathing and circulation. Ask the person to lay down or sit down if possible, to allow the person to rest and relax.


Check it to see what the problem is. Cut away clothing, if needed, so that you can see the wound. Be careful to avoid getting debris in the wound as you cut away the clothing.

, If the wound is causing severe bleeding from an arm or leg, ask the patient to elevate his or her affected limb. Then, place supports under the limb, such as pillows or folded blankets, or have helpers hold it up. Keep it in this position until the bleeding stops.


Shock can also be a life-threatening issue. If the patient is in shock, keep him or her warm and relaxed as possible. Symptoms of shock include pale, cold, clammy skin, disorientation, and decreased alertness.
Do not try to remove any object, such as a glass splinter, unless you are properly trained to do so; removal could cause a great deal of blood loss if the item is the only thing stoppering the flow.

, Put a clean and non-fluffy dressing pad over the cut. Apply firm pressure directly to the cut.


A compression bandage can be made from clothing, fabric, rags, etc., if you don't have any first aid bandages. If you have one available, wrap the compression bandage around the wound. Do not wrap too tightly; ensure that two fingers can slip under the bandage.

, Do not attempt to remove the existing dressing and bandage, as this would disturb the wound.


Leave underlying bandages on. This will help to leave in place any clots that might form. These prevent more blood from flowing out of the wound.

, Reassure the person until help arrives (if severe) or until the bleeding stops (less severe). An ambulance must be called if the cut is severe and/or the bleeding fails to stop.


Be sure to describe the person's injury when you call emergency services. This will make it easier for paramedics to arrive on the scene prepared to immediately assist.

, For example, if the cut was deep or dirty, you may need a tetanus shot. Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection that can cause paralysis and death if not treated. Most people receive a tetanus vaccine and boosters as part of their routine physicals every few years.


If you are exposed to the bacteria through a cut from something dirty or rusty, it is important to get a booster shot to prevent future infection. Call your doctor to see if you need one!"
"
Get stitches, or staples, applied to a severe wound by a medical professional.,
Take proper care of the wounded area.,
Avoid activities or sports that could hurt the area for at least one to two weeks.,
Return to your doctor's office once the wound has healed.",How to Treat Deep Cuts4," If your cut is deep, wide, or jagged, your doctor may decide that you need stitches (a.k.a. sutures) or staples for it to heal well. When a doctor stitches or staples a cut, he or she will first clean the cut and give you numbing medicine by injecting it around the wound. After the doctor completes the stitches, he or she will dress the cut with a bandage or gauze.Stitches use a sterile surgical needle and thread to join the edges of a cut together. They can be absorbable, and dissolve over time, or non-absorbable, and will need to be removed after the wound heals.
Staples used on cuts are special surgical staples that perform the same task at stitches and must be removed like non-absorbable stitches., It is important to take care of your stitches or staples to make sure the wound heals well and does not get infection. To do this:Keep your stitches or staples dry and covered with a bandage for several days. The doctor should tell you how long this should be. It is usually one to three days depending on the type of stitches and the size of the wound.
Once you can get them wet, gently wash the wound over the stitches or staples with soap and water when you shower. Do not submerge the wound underwater, like in a bath or when swimming. Too much water can slow down healing and result in infection.
After washing the area, pat it dry and apply antibiotic ointment. Cover the area with a bandage or gauze unless otherwise directed by your doctor.

, Your doctor should tell you specifically how long to do this. Stitches can break, causing the wound to open again. Call your doctor if this happens.


Call your doctor if you develop signs of infection (e.g. fever, redness, swelling, drainage of pus, or red streaks radiating from the wound).

, Non-absorbable stitches and staples will usually be removed five to 14 days after they are put in. Once they are out, make sure to protect the scar from the sun using sunscreen or covering it with clothes. Ask your doctor if there are any lotions or creams they can recommend to help your scar heal.Creams with vitamin E or silica in them can often help reduce keloid scars (raised, red marks) that result from major wound healing.

"
"
Get a professional massage.,
Consider some acupuncture.,
Get referred for physiotherapy.",How to Treat Sore Muscles2," Deep tissue massage is helpful for muscle function in general because it reduces muscle tension and promotes better circulation, which are important factors for preventing strains, spasms and cramps.If your muscle soreness doesn't fade away after a few days of rest and using home remedies, then schedule a 30-minute massage with a registered massage therapist. Have the therapist focus on your sore muscle and all directly related muscles and allow them to go as deep as you can tolerate it without wincing. Your therapist may also use trigger point therapy that focuses on the injured muscle fibers.


In terms of frequency, everybody's financial situation and muscle injury is unique. Some people may derive benefit and value from a single massage, others may seek it out multiple times per month.
As an alternative, ask your partner or spouse to massage your sore muscle(s). There's lots of instructional videos on the internet that can teach the basics of massage and offer pointers, although it's no substitute for professional training.
Always keep well hydrated after a massage in order to flush inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from the body. Failure to do so might lead to nausea or a mild headache.

, Acupuncture treatment is based on principles of traditional Chinese medicine and involves inserting very thin needles into specific energy points under your skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for muscle and joint soreness can be very effective, especially if it's done when acute symptoms first develop. Acupuncture works by triggering your body to release endorphins and serotonin (among other chemicals), which act to combat musculoskeletal pain. Acupuncture has a good safety record and is relatively affordable, so it's worth a try if your muscle soreness lingers and is not impacted by other treatments or approaches.


There is mixed evidence that acupuncture is effective for relieving chronic muscle and joint issues, but there's many anecdotal reports that it can help.Realize that the acupuncture points used to reduce your soreness may not be located in or near the problematic muscle — some points can be in distant areas of the body.
Acupuncture is practiced by more healthcare professionals than ever before, including some physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

, If your muscle soreness is recurring (chronic) and acerbated by weakness, poor posture, overuse and/or degenerative conditions (such as osteoarthritis), then you need to consider undertaking some physical therapy and muscle rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your chronically sore muscles.It may seem counterintuitive to exercise while you feel soreness, but chronically weak muscles often quit generating pain when they are strengthened and start to function normally. Physiotherapy is usually required two to three times per week for four to eight weeks to positively impact chronically sore muscle issues.


In addition to strengthening exercises, physical therapists can also use therapeutic devices to treat your muscle soreness, such as electronic muscle stimulation (EMS), therapeutic ultrasound, infrared (heat) therapy and/or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).
EMS and TENS devices can be purchased from medical supply and rehabilitation stores (online too) and used at home. However, they should only be used under the supervision or advice of a healthcare professional.
Good general muscle strengthening exercises include swimming, rowing and bouncing on a mini-trampoline.

Rest a sore arm.,
Ice your arm.,
Compress the arm.,
Elevate the arm.,
Take an over-the-counter pain medication.,
Differentiate soreness from pain.,
See a doctor when rest doesn’t suffice.,
Discuss treatment options with your doctor.,
Emphasize prevention as the best cure.,
Improve pitching mechanics.,
Focus on conditioning key muscle groups.,
Consult with an expert.",How to Treat Pitcher's Arm," Professional pitchers often say you can pitch through a “dead arm,” which is more of a non-specific fatigue, but even they don’t try to pitch through a sore arm. Soreness is the body’s way of saying that muscles have been over-stressed and may even have suffered micro-tears. Time and rest are essential to heal sore muscles.Rest your arm for at least a few days, if not a few weeks, to give it a chance to recover.
Pitching with a sore arm causes an increase in the risk of a significant elbow or shoulder injury. Follow the recommended or required limits for pitches or innings, and for rest between outings, to limit the likelihood of soreness in the first place. However, always listen to your body first — if your arm is sore, do not pitch until it feels better.;
, At any professional ballgame, you are likely to see the starting pitcher in the dugout with his arm wrapped in ice after his outing is complete. Ice has been used for decades to help address pitching arm soreness by reducing inflammation. It should be applied to the upper arm and shoulder areas immediately after a pitching performance, and as needed thereafter.If you don’t have ice, then you can also use a bag of frozen vegetables, such as frozen peas or corn, to ice your arm. Wrap the bag of vegetables in a paper towel and place it on your upper arm.
Make sure that you remove ice after about 15 to 20 minutes and then allow your skin to return to its normal temperature before using ice again.

, Compressing your arm can also help with recovery, especially if there is any swelling in your arm.Get a compression stocking or ACE bandage that you can apply to your upper arm.


Wrap the upper part of your arm so that it is snug, but not too tight.

, Elevating your arm may also help with recovery. Try placing your arm up on a couple of pillows while you are sitting. Keep it raised above the level of your heart. This may help to reduce swelling., Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also help reduce arm soreness temporarily. However, never use medications as a way to mask pain so that you can pitch again. This is a recipe for a more significant arm injury.For example, you can take a 400 to 800 mg of Motrin every 6 hours as needed. Do not exceed the maximum dose of 3,200 mg per day.
Follow the instructions for any over-the-counter pain medication that you decide to take.

, Arm soreness indicates that the muscles have been overworked or overstressed, and should usually present as a fairly consistent, dull ache in the muscles. If you have pain in the elbow or shoulder capsule, and especially if it becomes more painful depending upon arm positioning or motion, you probably have something more serious than just “pitcher’s arm.”Sore muscles improve with rest. Injured muscles, tendons, ligaments, etc. often do not. Don’t discount, ignore, or try to mask arm pain, or you may be risking a major arm injury that could end your time as a pitcher for good.

, If you have recurring arm pain, or soreness that does not go away after several days of rest, consult a physician. Only a proper medical exam can determine the condition of your arm and any muscle or other problems in it.Depending upon the findings of the initial examination, the doctor may recommend an x-ray, CT scan, and/or MRI scan of the arm in question. Don’t pass up the opportunity to make use of these diagnostic tools.

, Once the findings of any arm scans are interpreted, your doctor may recommend any number of treatment options. He or she may say that continued rest and perhaps some anti-inflammatory medications are in order. Or, the doctor may recommend physical therapy. Finally, surgery may be deemed the best option. Discuss the pros and cons and your preferences and concerns with your doctor before moving forward.Surgeries to repair the rotator cuff area of the shoulder are not uncommon for injured pitchers, but in recent years elbow surgeries have become increasingly common. Elbow ligament repair and replacement operations (the latter often called “Tommy John surgery” in honor of the first big leaguer to successfully undergo the procedure) continue to increase in number at all levels of baseball as pitching velocity (again at all levels) goes up.

, Some people no longer see arm surgery as a big deal, and indeed many pitchers do return to their former level of performance after surgery. However, it is always preferable to avoid surgery through proper training, technique, and rest. Preventing arm soreness is easier and safer than treating it.Rest a sore arm, and always follow recommended or required pitch and inning counts and recovery periods.
Give pitching arms longer periods of rest throughout the year — for youth pitchers, at least four months total and at least two or three months consecutively.
As a coach, focus on teaching good mechanics and remove pitchers once signs of fatigue or poor mechanics appear.
Take special precautions when youth pitchers are throwing in high-pressure situations like a championship game, a “showcase” for college recruiters or pro scouts, or when a radar gun is being used to measure velocity. Reaching back for some extra “oomph” on the fastball increases the risk for soreness, pain, and injury.

, The best pitchers don’t rely simply on their arms to whip the ball toward the plate. Instead, they use their entire bodies, and especially their legs and core muscles, to propel the ball forward. An effective and repeatable pitching motion reduces stress on the smaller shoulder muscles around the rotator cuff and makes arm soreness less likely to return when you resume pitching.While resting a sore arm, watch videos of good pitching motions, as well as of your own if you can. Talk to experienced pitching coaches to help develop a motion that works for you, that can be repeated consistently, and that will reduce strain on your arm.
If you are into even more advanced technology, new arm sleeves have been developed that can track and analyze key data like arm motion, angle, and torque. This is probably more applicable to a big leaguer than a little leaguer, though., Professional pitchers with “explosive” fastballs tend to have thick, powerful legs and well-developed core muscles. They do exercises specifically designed to increase muscle strength while maintaining flexibility in the leg, core, and shoulder areas. Pitchers at any level can also benefit from such exercises, and many elements of the regimen can be continued even while resting a sore arm.Cut out or limit the arm exercises while resting a sore arm, but continue to work on your core and legs. The more developed they become, the more likely you are to prevent future arm soreness.

, If pitcher’s arm has been a common problem for you, then a sports trainer, physical therapist, sports medicine doctor, or pitching coach, may be able to help you develop a “global strengthening program” to increase muscle stability and strength. The “Thrower’s Ten Program” is one such example — it includes ten simple exercises that utilize resistance bands, dumbbells, and an exercise ball."

Call a doctor.",How to Treat a Facial Burn from a Curling Iron to Prevent Scars," You’ll need to focus on cleaning off the burn right now, and you don’t want to worry about the curling iron. Turn it off or unplug it, and set it down somewhere out of the way so you don’t accidentally touch it while taking care of yourself.;
, There are three kinds of burns you can get on your skin. Each type requires a different kind of treatment, so you’ll need to be sure what you have before doing anything else.First-degree burns are the most common and least serious. These are minor burns that you can treat yourself. A first-degree burn will have redness, swelling, and pain. If the burn involves most of your face, though, treat it more seriously and get emergency medical help.
Second-degree burns are more serious, and your treatment will depend on the size of the burn. A second-degree burn may have red, white, or splotchy skin, swelling, pain, and blisters. If the burn is 3 inches or smaller, you can treat it like a minor burn. If it is larger, treat like a major burn and get medical help immediately.
Third-degree burns are the most serious, and involve burning off all the skin and underlying fat. The area may be charred black or white. If you have a third-degree burn, you may also experience difficulty breathing, carbon monoxide poisoning, or other toxic effects from smoke inhalation. You probably won’t get a third-degree burn from a curling iron, but it is something you should be aware of.

, Running water is not recommended for any burn, as it can damage the swollen, injured skin and increase blistering/scarring. However, you can hold a cool, clean wet cloth on the burn for 5 minutes to help cool it down.The water should be cool, not cold, so avoid ice or cold water.
Water is the best choice for cleaning. Irritants like harsh soap, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and alcohol will probably only delay healing, making a scar more likely., Use some pure aloe vera gel to help sooth the wound. Apply a thin layer of the gel to the burn. This will give you some relief and it can also prevent scars from developing.Do not use cream, lotion, oil, cortisone, butter, or egg whites on the burn.

, A pressure bandage on the burned area will break up the scar tissue and prevent rubbing. This will help to reduce the appearance of scars.Make sure to avoid using a dressing or bandage that sheds fibers, as they can get caught in the burn. If you need the bandage for longer than a day, be sure to change it once a day, or whenever it gets wet., To reduce pain, go ahead and take the recommended dosage of over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), naproxen sodium (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).This can help prevent you from feeling or itching the burn area, which can help lead to further scarring.
If the person who was burned is a child, they can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief as well. However, do not give aspirin to individuals under 20 years of age, as it can lead to severe complications.
Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle.Children can take naproxen as well, but the usage should be managed by a doctor., A burn is a wound, and you need to be careful that it doesn’t give you a common infection like cellulitis. Cellulitis symptoms include fever and chills, swollen glands or lymph nodes, and a painful red rash. The skin around the rash may blister and scab over. If you notice signs of an infection, go see your doctor for treatment., Make sure the burn area is kept moist with cool water or ointments.Aloe vera is another good choice for soothing the burn area and keeping it hydrated.Petroleum jelly can be another way to help keep moisture trapped on your skin. Make sure you wash your skin before applying it. The jelly will help trap moisture on the location and keep it moisturized a little longer.You can use petroleum jelly after the first 24 hours, once the heat from the burn has dissipated.
You can also try applying some vitamin E oil or an anti-scar cream that contains silica in it.
Another good way to help keep your skin hydrated is to drink water. 8 to 10 glasses a day will help keep your skin moisturized and prevent scarring if you should burn yourself with the iron.

, Sunlight isn’t great for the skin as is, and can increases the chances of a scar appearing. Try to go outside only during early mornings and late evenings when the sun is least intense. Wearing something like a hat to protect your face is also a good idea.If you do go outside, make sure to use sunscreen on your whole face, including the burn site. Look for sunscreens with blocking agents like zinc or titanium dioxide, and an SPF of 30 or higher., Skin-healthy foods will help keep bacteria away and allow for the formation of new skin cells. Eating well will help your skin avoid scarring if you do burn, and will help scars heal more quickly.Skin-friendly foods include yellow and orange fruits and vegetables like carrots and apricots, leafy green vegetables like spinach, beans, peas, lentils, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon and mackerel. More general healthy foods like low-fat or fat-free dairy and whole-grain breads and pastas are also helpful for maintaining healthy skin.
Some foods can be associated with skin damage, and avoiding them can keep your skin healthy and strong. These include refined sugars, other foods high in processed or refined carbohydrates, and other intakes like caffeine and tobacco.

, The scab that appears on your burn will help keep the area moist, and prevent bacteria from getting in. Avoid the temptation to scratch and pull off the scab. This will only make the healing take longer, and could create a larger scar. When the wound is healed, the scab will fall off on its own., Breaking any small blisters that may appear over the burn area can lead to scars. If they do break, gently clean with a mild soap and water, apply an antibiotic, and cover with a gauze bandage.If you start to see large blisters, those could be a sign of a more serious burn. You should see a doctor right away. , While you may want to cover up your burn area to make sure people can’t see it, don’t do it. Chemicals in the makeup can irritate your injury, and even cause an infection. This will make the burn take longer to heal, and can lead to a bigger scar., If your burn is turning into a scar, you can also talk to your doctor for advice on what to do next. The deeper the burn went into your face, the more likely it will develop into a scar.Your doctor will examine the burned area, see how large it is and how deep it goes. He will probably also check your body for other injuries, especially near the burn site. He may suggest further testing from a lab or with X-rays if he suspects further injury or infection.When you talk to your doctor, be sure to tell him how the burn happened, what symptoms you have been experiencing, what may have changed since you burned yourself, and any treatments you have used so far. Be prepared to also to discuss any underlying health conditions you have, like diabetes, that may have affected your recovery or potential treatment.Depending on what additional concerns your doctor has, you may be advised to use a variety of medications and treatments. For infections, you may be given intravenous antibiotics, or even a tetanus shot."

Return to your regular routine gradually.",How to Treat a Pulled Hamstring Muscle," A severe injury may require surgical reattachment, and should be brought to a doctor's attention as soon as possible.If any of the following symptoms match your condition, your hamstring muscle may be completely torn, or pulled off the bone:


A popping sound of feeling at the time of injury.
An injury very close to the buttock or knee.
A large amount of bruising.
Difficulty walking.
Severe pain or weakness in injured leg.
See Warnings, below, for symptoms that require medical attention at any point in the healing process.;
, If the location of the injury is not obvious, gently press along the length and circumference of your thigh to locate it. Stretching injuries tend to involve the upper thigh, while sprinting is more likely to tear muscle near the knee.If there is no obvious injury site and there was no impact or fall that may have caused your hamstring to pull, the pain could be due to pelvis or back problems instead. Contact a doctor if you think this might be the case.

, Get off your feet as soon as you can after injury, even if you only feel mild twinges. Some pulled hamstrings, especially those in the upper thigh, involve damage to a tendon. These feel less painful than muscle injuries, but take longer to heal and still require rest. Walk as little as possible for the first few days, and avoid all running and leg exercises. If walking involves any pain at all, shorten your stride to a non-painful distance.If even a short stride causes pain, use a pair of crutches and visit a doctor.

, Use a cold pack, or wrap ice in a wet towel, and place it on the injury site. Leave this on for 10 to 15 minutes, then take it off. Repeat this once an hour during the day you pulled your hamstring.Continue icing once every two or three hours for the next couple days after that.


To avoid damage, do not apply ice directly to skin, and do not leave it on for more than 15 minutes.
Do not use this treatment if you have Raynaud's phenomenon or other blood circulation issues., Wrap an elastic compression bandage or athletic tape around your thigh, starting above the knee and ending about 3 inches (7.5 cm) below the groin. When circling around your leg, make sure each new circle overlaps with about 50% of the last. The end result should be snug, but not uncomfortably tight or cutting off circulation.


You can purchase a slip-on thigh wrap from a sporting goods store instead.

, To reduce swelling, sit or lie down and prop your leg up on a tall object, so the site of the injury is higher than your heart. Do this as much as possible for the first 24 hours after the injury., In order to manage pain and potentially reduce swelling, take an NSAID painkiller such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen.These should only be used for short-term pain management in order to minimize side effects, unless you have a recommendation from a doctor. Some doctors discourage their use during this period, due to the possibility of slowed healing.


Talk to a doctor first if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, or kidney disease, or if you have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding issues in the past., Besides avoiding running and other exercise, stay away from the following for the next few days, until you can walk without pain:Avoid heat (take lukewarm baths or showers)
Avoid alcohol
Avoid massages

, Until you can walk without pain or twinges, ice your injury once every two or three waking hours, for 10 to 15 minutes, and minimize the amount of activity involving your leg. This usually lasts for three or four days after the injury., At this point, instead of icing the injury, you can apply a hot pack for 3 minutes, then a cold pack for 1 minute. Repeat this six times, for a total of 24 minutes. Perform this treatment twice a day until your leg is recovered enough to jog for five minutes without pain.Be aware that this treatment is not completely understood, and some doctors prefer to switch entirely to hot treatments.In general, cold treatment reduces blood flow, while heat increases it. Increased blood flow encourages healing but also increases swelling, so heat should not be used while the injury is still painful and significantly swollen.

, Cautiously begin using one or both of the following stretches, but stop or reduce the amount of stretching immediately if you feel pain at any point. The goal is to slightly stretch the injured area, not to increase your flexibility, so keep these stretches lighter than they normally would be.To begin with, hold each stretch for no more than 10 seconds, relax, then repeat for a set of three to six stretches, depending on your comfort. Do this several times per day.Place your foot on a low table or a chair, and stretch forward from the hip into a comfortable, relaxed position with a gentle stretch at the back of your leg.
Lie on your back and lift your leg vertically, or as high as is comfortable. Gently pull back on your thigh with your hands, with your knee slightly bent.

, If you can stretch without pain, begin additional exercises to get your muscles back to full strength. Ideally, you should consult a doctor to learn which exercises will focus on your injured muscle with minimal risk of damage. If you do not have access to a doctor, try the following once every one to two days, but stop immediately if you experience pain:


Lie on your back and bring your knee up to a slight angle. Contract your thigh muscle with about 50% of its maximum force, hold for thirty seconds, then relax and repeat several times.If still pain-free, repeat with your knee at a narrower angle, bringing your foot back up toward your hip.
Sit on a wheeled chair or stool and place both heels on the floor, flexing your hamstrings to pull yourself forward. After a few days of this, try using just the heel of the injured leg.

, After this stage is done, you should be able to job for a few minutes without pain, and have an almost normal range of movement. A slight pulled hamstring can get through this stage in one to ten days, while a more significant injury can last two to three weeks. An injury that involves a massive tear and severe pain can take many weeks to heal, or may even require surgery.

, Once the injury is essentially healed and you are trying to regain former flexibility, your stretching exercises should involve dynamic motion once every other day, with the leg swinging during the stretch. If you feel pain, stop and return to gentler stretches. Here are a couple examples, but consult a sports injury specialist for advice specific to your needs:Stand on your uninjured leg and gently swing the injured leg forward. The leg should stay relaxed, but swing out as far as is comfortable for you. Do this in three sets of ten reps.
Lie on your back and bring your hips into the air, supported on your hands. Cycle your legs upside down.

, There are many ways to strengthen your hamstrings, and a doctor or sports trainer can tell you which methods are best for your purpose. Try performing hamstring curls by lying on your back and lifting your ankle with ankle weights on, eventually progressing to seated hamstring curls, then standing hamstring curls.


If you exercise your quadriceps, add these hamstring strengthening exercises to your regular routine. Quadriceps that are much stronger than your hamstring muscles increase the risk of another strain or tear., To minimize the chance of re-injury, aim to increase the intensity or duration of your exercise routine by no more than 10% each week."

Try professional massage therapy.",How to Treat a Sore Shoulder," The most common cause of a sore shoulder is either overuse (repetitive shoulder movements) or overexertion (lifting things that are too heavy). If this is likely the cause of your sore shoulder, then stop the causative activity for a few days and rest it. Consider asking your boss if you can temporarily switch work stations or jobs to something less repetitive and demanding on your shoulders. If your sore shoulder is caused from working out at the gym, then you may be lifting too heavy or using bad form — ask a personal trainer or athletic therapist for advice.


Resting your sore shoulder for a few days is helpful, but putting it in an arm sling is not a good idea because it can lead to ""frozen"" shoulder syndrome. Your shoulder needs to move a little bit in order to stimulate blood flow and healing.Shoulder soreness is usually indicative of a simple muscle strain or pull, whereas sharp pains are indicative of joint/ligament injuries.;
, If your sore shoulder developed recently and looks or feels inflamed, then apply a bag of crushed ice (or something cold) to the most tender part in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain.Ice therapy is most effective for acute (recent) injuries that involve some sort of swelling because it reduces blood flow. Apply the crushed ice for 15 minutes 3-5x daily until the soreness subsides or completely fades away.


Compressing the crushed ice against the sorest part of your shoulder with a stretchy Tensor or Ace bandage is even more helpful for combating inflammation.
Always wrap ice in a thin cloth before you apply it to any body part — it helps to prevent skin irritation or frostbite.
If you don't have crushed ice handy, then use ice cubes, frozen gel packs or a bag of frozen veggies (peas or corn work great).

, If your sore shoulder has been bothering you for many weeks or months, then it's considered a chronic injury. Avoid cold therapy for chronic injuries and use moist heat instead. Moist heat warms up muscles and other soft tissues by increasing blood flow, which can be helpful for soreness caused by old sports injuries and arthritis.A good source of moist heat is microwavable bags filled with grains (such as wheat or rice), herbs and/or essential oils. Zap the herbal bag in the microwave for about 2 minutes and then apply it to sore muscles for 15 minutes first thing each morning or before any significant exercise.


Adding lavender or other specific essential oils to your herbal bag can help reduce your discomfort by relaxing you.
Taking a warm bath is another great source of moist heat. Add a cup or two of Epsom salt to the bath water for even better results — its high magnesium content relaxes and soothes tight muscles and tendons.
Avoid applying dry electrical heat from standard heating pads because it can dehydrate muscles and increase the risk of injury.

, If your sore shoulder ache isn't impacted greatly by applying ice or moist heat, then consider taking some OTC medication short term. Anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) are likely best for shoulder soreness that also involves significant inflammation — common with bursitis and tendinitis of the shoulder.Painkillers (also called analgesics) are likely better for shoulder pain without much swelling, such as low-grade muscle strains and osteoarthritis (the wear and tear type). The most common OTC painkiller is acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol).


Anti-inflammatories and analgesics should always be considered short-term strategies for pain control. Taking too much of them at a time or taking them for too long increases your risk of stomach, kidney and liver problems.If your sore shoulder feels extremely tight and is spasming, then an OTC muscle relaxant (such as cyclobenzaprine) might be a more effective medication. OTC muscle relaxants may not be available in the United States and must be obtained from a doctor.
As a safer alternative, rub a cream/lotion/ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore shoulder. Menthol, camphor, arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving musculoskeletal pain.

, Your sore shoulder may also involve tight or stiff muscles, possibly due to repetitive strains, long-term bad posture or simply lack of use. As long as your shoulder pain isn't too unbearable with movement, then some light stretches 3-5x per day are likely of benefit. Sore and stiff muscles respond well to light stretching because it reduces tension, promotes blood flow and improves flexibility.Hold any shoulder stretch for 30 seconds while deeply breathing. Stop if the soreness significantly increases.


While standing or sitting up, reach around the front of your body and grab behind the opposite elbow. Pull the back of your elbow across your chest until you feel the muscles stretch in the corresponding shoulder.
While standing or sitting up, reach behind your back and grab the wrist of your affected shoulder. Slowly pull down on the wrist until you feel the muscles stretch in the corresponding shoulder.

, Some sleeping postures can cause sore shoulders, especially those positions that involve placing your arm above your head. People who are obese also risk compacting and irritating their shoulder joints if they sleep on the sides (called the recumbent position). To avoid aggravating or causing shoulder pain, avoid sleeping on your side or stomach — sleep on your back instead.If only one shoulder is sore, it may be comfortable to sleep on the other side if your upper body isn't too heavy.


Choosing a supportive pillow for your head can also take some pressure off your shoulder joints.
While sleeping on your back, consider using a small pillow to support and slightly elevate your sore shoulder.
Sleeping on your side or stomach with your arm raised above your head not only irritates your shoulder joint, but it can compress the nerves that run from your neck to your arm. When this happens your typically feel numbness or tingling in your arm.

, If your sore shoulder doesn't respond to the above-mentioned home remedies, then schedule an appointment with your doctor for a physical exam. Your doctor can take x-rays and other tests to determine the cause of your shoulder soreness. Depending on the findings and diagnosis, your doctor may recommend stronger prescription drugs, corticosteroid injections, physical therapy and/or shoulder surgery.


Rotator cuff injuries are a common cause of chronic shoulder pain — more than 4 million doctor visits per year in the United States are due to rotator cuff problems.The rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons that hold the bones of the shoulder joint together.
X-rays can detect fractures, dislocations, arthritis, bone tumors and infections, although an MRI or CT scan is needed to see serious issues in muscles, tendons and ligaments.
A corticosteroid injection (such as prednisolone) into a sore and inflamed shoulder (bursitis, tendinitis) can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and allow for greater range of motion and flexibility.Shoulder surgery is reserved for mending broken bones, cleaning up damaged joints, reconnecting severed tendons and ligaments, removing blood clots, and draining accumulated fluid.

, If your sore shoulder is caused by a rotator cuff injury or another issue related to overexertion or overuse, then get a referral from your doctor for physiotherapy so your shoulder can get rehabilitated. A physical or athletic therapist will show you specific and tailored strengthening exercises and stretches for your sore shoulder, which will make it stronger and more flexible.A physical or athletic therapist may use weight machines, free weights, rubber bands, exercise balls, therapeutic ultrasound and/or electronic muscle stimulation to rehabilitate your shoulder.
Physiotherapy is usually needed two to three times per week for four to six weeks to positively impact chronic shoulder problems.
Good strengthening activities for your shoulder include push-ups, rowing exercises, swimming and bowling.

, Your sore shoulder may be related to your neck or mid back, so an appointment with a chiropractor may be appropriate. Chiropractors are joint specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function within spinal and peripheral joints, such as those of the shoulder. Shoulder soreness can be caused by problems with the underlying joints (glenohumeral and/or acromioclavicular joints), or it can be referred from issues in the thoracic spine (mid back) or cervical spine (neck). You chiropractor can determine where the pain is coming from and, if need be, manually adjust or slightly reposition the problematic joint.


Manual joint adjustments often create a ""popping"" or ""cracking"" sound, which is safe and rarely painful.
Although a single joint adjustment can sometimes cure a shoulder problem, more than likely it will take a few treatments to make a significant impact.
Chiropractors can use manual joint maneuvers to reset a dislocated shoulder, although they don't treat broken bones, joint infections or bone cancer.

, If your sore shoulder is lingering for much more than a week and you think it's due to tight or strained muscles, then consider a deep tissue massage from a qualified massage therapist. Deep tissue massage is great for relieving muscle soreness, tightness and tension, which can limit your range of movement and reduce flexibility in your shoulder.Massage also promotes better blood circulation and encourages relaxation.


Massage therapy is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains and sprains, but it's not recommended for more serious joint or nerves injuries.
Start with a 1/2 hour massage session focusing on your sore shoulder, but also ask the therapist to include your lower neck and mid-back. You may find a 1 hour session more effective or prefer to have multiple sessions over the course of a week or two.
Allow the therapist to go as deep as possible without you wincing — there are many muscle layers in your shoulder that should be addressed for best results.

This is important because lacerations, or cuts, require sutures or glue for treatment. A scrape is a shallow skin abrasion that is over a portion of the skin.


If you have a wound that is over 1 centimeter (0.39 in) deep, you should seek medical help to treat the wound and stitch it up.;
, Before you take care of your wound, you need to make sure you have clean hands. As long as your wound is not bleeding excessively, take the time to wash your hands with antibacterial soap. If the deep scrape is on your hands, try not to get the soap on the wound because it will hurt., After you decide it is a scrape, you need to rinse it with water. Run water over the wound to remove any debris that may have gotten into it when you were injured. The water should be lukewarm. Continuously pour water over it for a few minutes at a time. In between, check to make sure there is not more debris in the wound.


If you are not in a place where there is a clean and available water source, remove the obvious debris by brushing it away with a cloth.If you notice excessive bleeding, rinse for as little time as possible to remove the debris. Then, move on to the next step.

, Once any large debris or matter is removed, you need to stop the bleeding. To do this, take a clean cloth, towel, or gauze and cover the wound. Apply solid pressure to the wound. If you only have a used shirt or dirty cloth, don't worry too much. Your wound is already dirty because it hasn't been disinfected, so don't worry too much about infection at this point. Just focus on stopping the bleeding.


As you are applying pressure, so not check on the wound for at least seven to 10 minutes. If you remove it before then, you will remove the clot and bleeding will begin again.
If you have waited seven to 10 minutes and your wound has stopped bleeding, your wound can now be cleaned., If your compression cloth becomes soaked with blood or if there is any noted squirting blood flow, seek medical attention immediately. This means that your wound is severe and needs more advanced help that can only be received at the doctor. This may happen with large scrapes, such as road rashes or scrapes of a excessive length.There are also some health factors that may require you to go to the hospital if you get a deep enough wound. You should go to the hospital right away if you have blood or bleeding disorders, diabetes, heart disease, kidney and liver disease, and poor immunity. A deep scrape could put you in danger when combined with other health conditions that you have., There are some pieces of debris that may be lodged in the skin that did not come out with rinsing, especially with scrapes. Once the bleeding has stopped, look at the wound for extra debris in the skin. If you see any debris, use tweezers to gently remove any excessive particles from the wound. If the debris will not come out, see your doctor to have it removed.


Do not dig the tweezers into the wound. You don't want to injure yourself further.
If there is no debris, you can move on to the next step., Once the bleeding has stopped, you need to run warm water over your wound again to rinse away the blood. Next, pour an antiseptic wash over the wound such as alcohol, peroxide, or providone-Iodine solution. You can also soak gauze in the solution and rub it over the wound gently to clean it out. This may sting, so brace yourself for the possible pain.Pat dry the wound with sterile gauze or a clean towel.


This process may disrupt the clot on your wound and it may ooze or begin bleeding again. This is normal and does not indicate a more serious wound since you were able to stop it at one point.

, Even if you think you have removed all of the dirt and debris, there is still a chance that your wound could become infected. Because of this, applying some antibiotic cream to the wound is always a good idea. This ointment will also keep your scrape moist so it won’t crack and get worse when you move around. A thin layer of ointment, or antibiotic powder, covering the area of the wound should be enough.Neosporin, Polysporin and Bacitracin are the three of the most common products used.
You can use hydrogen peroxide to initially clean the wound but it should not be used in the long run because it can do damage to the tissue in and around your wound.

, Once you have added ointment, you need to bandage your wound. Take gauze or large bandage and cover your wound. Take medical tape and cover each of the edges. This will help keep out debris, germs, and other particulates. If your scrape isn't too large, you may be able to use a large band-aid instead of gauze.


These supplies can be found in most drug stores and pharmacies.
If the wound is over a flexible joint, rolled gauze may be more easily managed. You can make it more easily secured with this kind of gauze on the wound and it will be less likely to fall off.

, Redress your wound two to three times a day. Taking the bandage off allows the wound to be cleaned and give fresh bandages, and it allows you to take a look at the wound and check to see if any infection is occurring. Do not leave a dressing on for more than 24 hours.You should change the bandages any time they get wet or dirty, as dirty bandages can lead to your scrape becoming infected.

, Despite your efforts to keep the scrape clean, you may still get an infection. This will depend on the size of the scrape as well as other factors such as your age, overall health, and any conditions such as diabetes and obesity. These can also affect your healing time as well. Signs of infection to look for are redness around the wound or on the edges, especially if expands in area from one day to the next. It may also start draining or ooze pus from the wound.


If you notice that you develop a fever as well, you may also have an infection.

, If you think your wound might be infected or if the bleeding will not stop after applying pressure, you need to seek medical attention. If you have had the wound for awhile and have noticed that it has gotten infected, you should also go see a doctor. Letting an infection linger can actually lead to blood poisoning and other life-threatening situations.If you have a fever or your skin is feverish around the wound, go to the hospital.
If your scrape is leaking yellow or greenish discharge, go to a hospital.
If you notice bright yellow or black colorations around your wound, go to the hospital.

, If your wound has become infected, you will most likely be given a tetanus shot to combat the infection. Tetanus shots are normally given every 10 years, but if your wound is deep enough, your doctor may recommend that you get one of these shots.You should get the shot as soon as possible after the injury to ensure that you do not develop tetanus.

, If your scrape is deep or badly infected, you will most likely be given antibiotics to take to combat or prevent further infection. The antibiotic you are most likely to receive is erythromycin. If your doctor suspects a MRSA infection, you will probably take something much stronger. Follow your doctor’s instructions when it comes to taking the medication.


You will most likely be prescribed 250mg, four times per day for five to seven days. The medicine should be taken half an hour to two hours before meals for maximum absorption into the body.
You may also be prescribed painkillers depending on how painful your wound is.

If your bone is fractured, moving it is nearly impossible, while you will still be able to move it if it is sprained. Pain, swelling, and the inflammatory cells causing your ankle to swell contribute to this loss of function.Moreover, proprioception is altered during injury. Proprioception is the awareness of the brain in terms of a position of a part of your body without the aid of vision. Therefore, coordination between your brain and your ankle is damaged when you fracture your ankle.;
, The muscles, ligaments, and tendons surrounding your ankle are highly peppered with pain receptors. Once injury occurs, these receptors send signals of pain to your brain. The brain reciprocates and lets the affected area feel pain—which you are probably experiencing right now.While pain can be associated with sprains too, fracturing a bone in your ankle will probably feel very painful, unless you have a high pain tolerance.

, If you have fractured your ankle, your body will try to protect the injured ankle from further damage by sending a lot of inflammatory (“healing”) cells to the affected area. The inflammatory cells carry repair kits to mend the injury. Unfortunately, these cells also cause swelling and discomfort.Believe it or not, your injured ankle actually benefits from swelling indirectly, even if it causes you feelings of pain and frustration. Swelling prohibits large degrees of movement of the involved ankle. Therefore, it promotes speedy recovery.

, Redness or flushing of the affected ankle means that there is a rush of blood in the area. Blood carries recovery cells to the area to promote faster healing., When blood rushes to your ankle, it will also cause your ankle to feel really hot. You may feel like you have a fever that you can only feel in your ankle.

, PRICE stands for: Protect, Rest, Ice, Compress, and Elevate. How to do the things in this acronym will be explained in the following steps. You should continue to follow these rules after you have seen a doctor while your ankle heals.

, If you think your ankle may be fractured but cannot go to a doctor immediately, put a splint on it. The most basic splint is a sturdy flat object, like a ruler, that you can press up against your broken bone. You can keep it in place with gauze or medical tape; this helps to keep the broken bone from moving.To learn how to properly splint an ankle, click here.


If you do not have a splint but are wearing shoes that support your ankle, like hiking boots or regular boots, tighten the laces as tightly as they can go to keep your ankle immobile while you make your way to the hospital.

, Continuing to walk and bear weight on the affected ankle will cause injury. You should stay put while waiting for help. If you are in a situation where you need to leave the area you are in, ask others to support you while you hobble away, or find a sturdy branch or pole that you can use as a crutch.


Rest should be continued even after your initial treatment. The first three days after injury should be dedicated to rest. Wait for the doctor’s clearance before resuming any activities that involve using your ankle.

, Use an ice pack, bag of ice, or even a bag of frozen veggies to cool down your injured ankle. Ice decreases the flow of blood to your ankle, thus reducing swelling. The cold also masks the pain you feel. Ice your ankle for 15 to 20 minutes every hour.If you can, use crushed ice because it can follow the contours of your ankle.
Avoid applying the ice directly to your skin as really cold temperatures can burn your skin just like heat will.

, Compression of the affected area reduces blood flow to the injured site. Hence, less inflammatory cells will be available to cause swelling. If you have put a splint on your ankle and wrapped it with elastic bandage, you are already compressing your ankle.You can also skip the splint and wrap your ankle in elastic bandages while you make your way to the hospital.

, When you elevate your ankle, you reduce the flow of blood to that area. Because of this, the swelling in your ankle will decrease. You can elevate your ankle while sitting or lying down.Sitting: Your ankle must be elevated higher than your hip.
Lying down: Your ankle must be elevated higher than your heart and chest.

, On top of using the PRICE acronym, you can also take acetaminophen to regulate the pain. Take 325 to 650 mg tablets, 1 tablet every 4 hours, unless you have previous orders from a doctor to avoid acetaminophen.


Do not take other painkillers like ibuprofen, until after you have gone to the hospital. Painkillers like ibuprofen thin your blood and could cause problems if you have to get surgery.

, Once you have taken some precautions for your ankle by following the acronym outlined in Part Two, you should go to the hospital to get your ankle treated medically. The form of treatment you receive will depend on how severe the break is in your ankle. A doctor will take an x-ray of your ankle to determine what to do.

, If you have a mild break (which means a fracture without a dislocated ankle) you will most likely have a cast put on your ankle. A cast is a cement boot that immobilizes your foot and allows the broken ends of the bone in your ankle to unite naturally.You will most likely have to wear the cast for four to eight weeks.

, Closed reduction is a maneuver performed by doctors to restore a bone in its proper place without having to perform surgery. It is important get the ankle back into its normal location so that you are able to move around like normal once your ankle heals. An orthopedic surgeon will usually do the maneuver.Casting is required after reduction to ensure that the bones stay in place. In extreme cases of ankle joint instability, metal plates and screws have to be inserted externally (called external fixation) or internally (called internal fixation) to hold the bones in place.

, Getting surgery done will help put your bones back into their proper places, and keep them in those proper places. On the positive side of things, getting surgery will speed up your recovery time—while you have to wait out a cast, you will be on the mend within days after your surgery.There are two parts to ankle surgery. First, you would undergo open reduction, during which your bones would be put back into their proper places. Then, through external fixation, metal plates are drilled into the bone and screws are placed to ensure very minute movement of the affected bones.

, Regardless of what kind of treatment you receive, you should give yourself a break for the next couple of days. Your body has been through a traumatic experience and needs time to recover. Follow the PRICE acronym outlined in Part Two as a way to make sure you are giving your ankle the tender care it needs.

, If you are experiencing a lot of pain after your medical treatment, take some painkillers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. If your doctor prescribed a different painkiller, follow his or her instructions.

, In the first few days, you should take short walks in your house, using the crutches that the doctor gave you. It might be very uncomfortable in the beginning, but you will get used to them. You must not put pressure on your leg, unless stated otherwise by your doctor. You should not even put your leg on the floor for the first few days.

, if you wet your cast, immediately contact your orthopedist for a new one. This is very important because if water accumulates inside the cast (between the cast and your skin), your skin can be affected and an infection can occur very quickly.


Another issue with a wet cast is that it can get loose, which means it won’t hold your ankle in place properly.

, As your ankle recovers, you will need to start gaining strength back in that ankle. To do this, you will need to go to physical therapy and perform exercises that will help to build your ankle’s mobility and flexibility. This will be covered in Part Five.

, Having a cast or surgery bring your bones back together is only half of the recovery process. Rehabilitation (aka physical therapy) is equally important to recover the stability, mobility, and function of your ankle. Rehabilitation includes ankle joint stability and mobility exercises, calf muscle strengthening, and stretching.Stability should be trained before mobility. Stability exercises reinforce the maximum allowable degree of movement in the ankle without risking injury. Stability is also necessary to withstand external pressure applied to the ankle.

, Ankle joint stability exercises are usually done within a week after surgery or when the cast is removed. This is a walkthrough of a simple ankle joint stability exercise:


Stand in front of a wall so that you are an arm’s length away from it. Push against the wall. Look straight, keep your shoulder blades down and back and make a double chin. Standing like this will make sure that your spine is properly aligned.
Suck in your gut as if someone were trying to punch you in the stomach. Squeeze your butt muscles together. Doing this maneuver will train the core and posterior chain muscles. Both are vital for training the proper alignment of the ankle joint and preventing re-injury.
Raise the healthy foot off the floor. Maintain this position for 30 seconds. Standing on one leg will introduce an unstable situation. This will train the injured ankle to resist unstable forces. Resist the urge to look at your foot. Looking in a straight direction throughout the movement will train proprioception as well.
It is common to experience wobbling in the first few tries. Rest for 1 minute and then repeat this process twice. Do this once with the other leg to make sure that it receives the same strength training.

, Ankle joint mobility is very important in everyday activities such as walking, climbing a flight of stairs, driving and more. The goal is to restore ankle mobility to normal movement patterns. Ankle joint mobility exercises are usually done when ankle joint stability is established. “The Alphabet” is an example of ankle joint mobility exercise:


Sit in a chair and extend your leg with the injured ankle so that it is parallel to the ground. Pretend that the affected foot is a pen and draw the letters of the alphabet in the air from A-Z and reverse.
You might feel stiffness in your ankle. Work through the stiffness but not so hard that you feel pain. Your focus should be on the movement of your ankle and not the smoothness of the strokes.
Rest for 2 minutes and repeat the movement twice.

, The calf raise targets the calf muscles, Achilles tendon, and the ankle joint ligaments. It mimics the motion that our foot makes for everyday activities such as walking, running, climbing a flight of stairs, and reaching for tall objects. To do it:


Stand with the balls of your feet on the edge of a step on your stairs with your heels hanging off. Keep the gut sucked in, stand tall, and rest your hands against a wall or handrail.
Rise on the balls of your feet in a tip-toe fashion. Try to stand as high on your tip-toes as you can. You heels should lift above the step. Exhale while you do this to keep your blood pressure normal.
Slowly descend until your heels are a few inches below the edge of a step. Inhale while you do this. This works the calf muscle to its whole range of motion leaving no weak point behind. Repeat 10 times for one set. Rest for one minute and do 2 more sets.

, The soles of the foot contain a lot of small foot muscles. The small foot muscles are enclosed in a sheath called the plantar fascia. The mobility of the plantar fascia is very crucial in preventing injury of the ankle. The towel curls will help the fascia stay loose despite everyday stress to the foot. To do the towel curl:


Sit in a chair or on the couch. You can even do this while watching TV or reading a wikiHow article. Place one medium-sized thin towel on the floor lengthwise. Put your foot on the end of the towel.
Draw the other end of the towel towards you by curling only your toes. The heel should be planted to the ground at all times. Repeat this exercise three more times and switch with the other foot.

, Flexibility is as important as strength when it comes to the health of your ankles. The calf stretch mainly targets the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Both are vital to great ankle flexibility. To do this:


Stand in front of a wall and push against it with your arms. Your arms should be at chest level and shoulder-width apart. The shoulder blades should be drawn back and down.
Put your right foot behind your left foot and keep your right leg straight. The heel should come in contact with the ground and toes should point forward throughout the stretch.
Bend the left foot forward to stretch the right calf muscle. You should feel a stretch or a slight discomfort that is tolerable in the calf muscles of your right leg. If you feel pain, stop.
Hold this position for 30 seconds for people younger than 40 years old. Those older than 40 years old should hold their stretch for 60 seconds. The muscles become stiffer as we age. Keeping longer stretches will help loosen the muscles up.

, Tennis ball rolls relieve accumulated stress of the foot muscles and plantar fascia. To do them:


Place a regular tennis ball on the floor. Sit in a chair and place the middle part of your foot on the tennis ball.
Roll the ball in circles. Do it in clockwise fashion for 1 minute followed by counter-clockwise motion for 1 minute as well. Roll the ball back and forth for 1 minute. Roll the ball side-to-side for 1 minute.
Switch to your other foot. Do this process three times on both feet.

In order to repair itself, your body tends to swell, become painful, warm or reddened. Check to see if your knee is warm to the touch, enlarged, or red in color by placing your hand on your knee and studying how it looks. Additionally, check for pain and tenderness.Warmth in the affected area is caused by increased blood flow designed to carry body heat from your core to cooler peripheral tissues.Inflammation is caused by your body's reaction to tissue damage and results in increased movement of white blood cells.Redness is caused by increased blood flow to an injury.Sometimes the affected area is not red, but rather discolored or bruised from improper twisting or stress due to hyperflexion or hyperextension.;
, After a knee injury it is common for the damaged area to be stiff and to experience a decrease in your range of motion. Stand on your uninjured leg and gently lift your damaged leg to see if your knee feels especially weak or unstable. Your knee may feel particularly limp or you may experience shakiness in the affected area.The tendons or tissues connected to your muscle are affected, causing you to feel stiff or weak., Sometimes an injury can cause the area to feel numb or cause sudden and sporadic muscle spasms. Be sure to check if your knee or the surrounding area feels tingly due to the trauma it suffered during your injury.


The numbness is caused by brief loss of sensory or motor function triggered by an accident that damaged muscle tissues.

, Cautiously move your leg around and notice any unusual noises such as grinding or popping coming from your knee. These types of noises can be a sign that you have torn something. When you check to see if you hear anything usual, determine if you are able to fully straighten your leg. Being unable to completely flex or extend your leg and knee is a sure sign of a strain., Your muscles and tendons are not as strong as they were before you were injured. Stand for a while on your leg with the damaged knee to see if you are able to, or if your leg buckles under the pressure. Another test is to walk or climb stairs to determine if you are able to move with ease. If your muscles, tendons or ligaments are damaged, doing so will be painful and difficult.

, During your appointment you want to be sure to share with your doctor any past joint problems, complications with past surgeries, trouble with inflammation or injuries and your level of physical activity.


Recall recent falls, walking or running on uneven ground, twisting or turning of your ankle or leg, trips, or sudden impact to your knee.

, Your doctor can perform several tests to check your knee ligaments. It is important to see how your ligaments are functioning, as they are what stabilize your knee. Your physician may check the following: collateral ligaments, posterior cruciate ligament, and anterior cruciate ligament.The valgus and varus tests check your medial and lateral collateral ligaments.
The posterior drawer test check your posterior cruciate ligament.
The Lachman, anterior drawer, and pivot shift tests check your anterior cruciate ligament or ACL.
If your doctor believes that you are having problems with your menisci based on results from the knee ligament tests, she may perform a McMurray test.
If undergoing regular physical exams like the ones above cause you too much pain, your doctor might order arthrometric testing to measure the looseness of your knee. This is, however, very rare.

, Your doctor may want to perform a physical examination of the affected area to determine your degree of pain, amount of swelling, stability within your joints, and degree of mobility. At that point, he can recommend additional testing such as x-rays, MRIs, or an ultrasonography. These types of tests will provide a closer look into what may be going on with your knee.


These types of tests should be done only when tests to check your knee ligaments don’t determine the problem.
An x-ray can check for fractures.
MRIs will allow the doctor to view the internal structure of your knee to check for swelling and damage to your soft tissues.An ultrasonography can be used to produce images of tissues in your knee and is also a form of therapy., NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, are common pain relievers that you can take to reduce pain, swelling or fever associated with your knee strain. Be sure to check with your doctor prior to taking any medications, as they may cause kidney problems or bleeding. If these over-the-counter medications do not work, prescription medications can be used., It is important to rest after an injury, but you can usually still move around. Use support devices such as a splint, cast, brace, bandages or crutches to reduce your movement while your knee heals. These devices will also help to reduce pain because your knee will be constrained. Your doctor may also recommend not putting weigh on the affected leg for 48 hours., To help manage your pain you should elevate and rest your knee. Make sure you raise your knee above your heart in order to reduce the amount of blood flow delivered to the area.Try sitting in a recliner or in a chair with an ottoman in front of it with a couple of pillows under your knee, or lie in bed with a couple of pillows under you knee.

, To lessen the pain and swelling, apply ice and steady compression to your knee. Use an ice pack or crushed ice in a bag and apply it for no more than 20 minutes at a time. You can repeat this every hour. Applying ice will also prevent further damage to your tissues. Applying compression using bandages can also reduce swelling and pain.Use ice for the first 48 hours after injuring your knee.

, Applying an elastic bandage or compress, such as an ace bandage, can help to improve blood flow to the injured area and support your knee as well. Wrap your knee to help with your recovery or have it wrapped by a medical professional., Depending on the severity of your sprain, your healthcare provider might recommend physical therapy. By getting physical therapy you will learn exercises to reduce your pain as well as improve your strength and range of movement.

, In some cases, you will need to go to an emergency room for a knee injury. Seek immediate medical assistance if you:Can’t put weight on the injured leg or if your joint feels unstable.
Have redness or red streaks spreading out from the affected area.
Have been re-injured in the same place as you have been injured many times before.
Your sprain seems severe.

It also helps your body warm up before exercising and cool down after exercising.For instance, try doing push-ups before you exercise to get your body going.You can also do things like bending over to touch your toes. Another option is to stand with your arms over your head and your hands touching. Lean over to one side, and then lean over to the other, stretching your arms as you go.;
, To be physically fit, you should get at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week or 75 minutes if your aerobic exercise is more intense.Aerobic exercise helps your body absorb more oxygen, and it improves the function of your heart and lungs. You'll also find that you have more energy, and it can help with high blood pressure. This is true whether your goal is to lose fat, gain muscle or both.


Examples of aerobic exercises include jogging, swimming, dancing, and riding a bike., You should do strength-training exercises at least two times a week.This is also true, even if your goal isn't to bulk up. Losing weight requires replacing some of that weight with muscle to get a toned look. Strength training helps you build up your muscles over time.Try chest presses. Lay on your back on a flat surface. Bend your knees. Hold a weight in each hand. Start with them at chest level with your elbows bent, and then push the dumbbells into the air. Return them back to chest level. Repeat for 6 to 8 reps and then take a break before starting again.Use bicep curls. Standing up, hold a dumbbell in one hand, palm up. Your arm should be bent at the elbow. Lift the dumbbell up to your shoulder by bending your arm up, and then bring it back down slowly. Lift it back again. Repeat 6 or 8 times, then take a break. Do the same for the other arm.Practice knee extensions. Sit on a solid bench or table where your feet don't touch the floor. Put on ankle weights. Lift your knee up until it's fully extended, then bring it back down. Repeat 6 to 8 times and then rest. Build up sets of repetitions over time. Do the same with the other leg.Do calf raises. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Slowly push up until you are standing on your toes or at least the balls of your feet. Lower yourself back down. Repeat 6 to 8 times, and then rest. Build up the number of sets over time. This exercise works your calf muscles., Balance exercises help improve your balance. Try doing balance exercises several times a week. One easy way to improve your balance is to try balancing on one leg. After a time, move to balancing on the other leg.Balance and core exercises are some of the most neglected types of exercises. Remember that everything starts from your core - even your posture during everyday life! Your core must be strong and so must your balance.

, Flexibility helps protect you from injury, as it's often tight muscles that are injured.It can also help you increase your muscle size, as it stretches your muscles out.To improve your flexibility, try activities such as pilates or yoga. Both of these incorporate slow movements to help stretch your muscles over time. They can also improve balance. Try joining a class at a local gym.Stretch everyday or at the very least, several times a week. Stretching regularly helps stretch out your muscles, increasing flexibility the longer you do it.You can use some of the same stretches you use before workouts. However, you can also do exercises such as laying on your stomach and pushing your chest up at your shoulders, holding it for about 10 seconds. Another stretching exercise is to sit on the floor with your legs outstretched. Pull a leg up, using both your hands, and bending your foot back while you do. Hold in position for a few seconds. Move to the other leg., If you haven't been exercising much, don't jump into an intense exercise program. Instead, slowly increase how much you exercise over time. If you do too much too fast, you could injure yourself.As with anything new, the body needs time to adjust and gradually get up to speed. Adding too much to soon can cause injury or illness. Listen to the limitations of your body.

, Your body needs proteins to rebuild many parts of your body, from your muscles to your blood. They also provide essential nutrients your body needs to survive. For instance, many proteins are high in iron, which carries oxygen in your blood.The U.S. Government recommends that women 19-30 get the equivalent of 5 1/2 ounces of protein a day while women 30 and older should limit themselves to 5 ounces of protein daily based on a moderate lifestyle. Men 19-30 should get the equivalent of 6 1/2 ounces of protein a day while men 30-50 should get 6 ounces; men over 50 should limit themselves to 5 1/2 ounces., It's important to choose lean proteins because proteins high in saturated fat can be detrimental to you health over time.Some good options include chicken, fish, and turkey. However, you can still eat beef, especially if you buy leaner varieties. For instance, choose ground beef that is less than 10% fat.Beans, nuts, and seeds can provide the protein you need if you are a vegetarian. Eggs are also a great source of protein if you choose to eat them on your diet.One way to make proteins leaner is to cut off any fat you see before you start cooking, such as cutting the fatty edge off a pork chop., Vegetables help you get the right vitamins and minerals in your diet. They also provide you with fiber to keep your digestive tract healthy. They should make up a large portion of your diet, especially since they keep you fuller with fewer calories than many other foods.Women aged 19-50 should eat 2 1/2 cups of vegetables daily. Over age 50, they should cut back to 2 cups, based on a moderate exercise level.Men aged 19-50 should eat 3 cups of vegetables daily. After age 50, they can cut back to 2 1/2 cups daily, based on a moderate exercise level., Fruits should be an important part of your diet, as they provide important nutrients, as well as fiber. Some also help keep you hydrated.The government recommends that both men and women from age 19 to 30 should get 2 cups of fruit per day. Past age 30, men should still eat 2 cups while women should eat 1 1/2, based on a moderate to light exercise level.To put it more simply, half your plate should always be fruits and veggies.

, When eating bread or pasta, it's best to pick ones that are made with whole grains. Also, incorporate other whole grains into your diet, such as oatmeal, quinoa, and brown rice. The government recommends that 50 percent of your grains should be whole grains.Adult women should eat 6 ounces of grains per day until age 50 when they should switch to 5 ounces. Adult men should 8 ounces until they are 30, 7 ounces until they are 50, and 6 ounces a day after that.One ounce is basically equivalent to one serving. For instance, 1 slice of bread is an ounce. Similarly, 1 cup of cereal is an ounce while 1/2 a cup counts as an ounce for cooked pastas and rice., Though the government doesn't make a recommendation on how much dairy an adult should eat, dairy can provide calcium and other nutrients in your diet. Pick low-fat versions of your favorite dairy products to keep it healthier.If you don't eat dairy products, canned fish, such as salmon with the bones still in, is a good option for getting your calcium in.If you're vegetarian, try fortified foods. For instance, fortified cereals and juices have calcium. You'll find calcium in milk alternatives, such as rice or almond milk. You can also eat certain beans, soy foods (such as tofu), and some dark greens to get your calcium (such as kale, collard greens, or bok choy)., Oils are important of your diet. They do provide nutrients you need. However, they are also high in calories, so you should limit your daily intake.Women age 19 to 30 should limit themselves to 6 tablespoons. After that, they should only eat 5 tablespoons a day. Men should eat 7 tablespoons until age 30, but limit themselves to 6 tablespoons after that.Though you do need some oils, it's best to limit other types of fats, as solid types of fat are generally worse for you. They tend to raise your bad cholesterol because they have more trans fat and saturated fat., Water is essential to how your body functions; in fact, water makes up about 60 percent of what you weigh. Your body cannot function properly if you don't give it enough water every day.Though the standard recommendation is 8 glasses of water a day, the Institute of Medicine actually moves that recommendation a little higher: 9 glasses a day for women and 13 for men.When exercising, the body is sweating more and more water is needed to replenish those stores.

, If you are exercising, you need to up your water intake. Similarly, if you are doing an activity that causes you to sweat a great deal, you also need to up your intake. For a small amount of exercising, you may only need a couple of cups. However, when you are doing hard work for more than an hour, you need even more.You also need extra water at other times, such as if it's particularly hot outside. You'll also need to increase your intake if you're sick or breastfeeding, as you lose more water during those times., If you are getting enough fruits and vegetables, that can help your water intake, especially if you choose ones high in water content. Examples of fruits and veggies with a high water content include leafy greens, watermelon, and cucumber., Your water intake doesn't need to come solely from pure water; other drinks count towards your total. However, you should skip drinks that dehydrate you rather than hydrate you.For instance, juice is hydrating, but it adds extra calories.However, you can cut it with water to help keep the calorie count lower. Milk also falls in this category.Drinks with caffeine can provide hydration, but they also tend to cause you to go to the bathroom more. Therefore, though they can be part of your daily total, you should limit them.Alcoholic beverages are generally not very good at keeping you hydrated., If you're not a huge fan of drinking plain water, you can spice it up a bit. Add a slice or two of citrus to give it flavor. You can also add other fruits and even veggies to your water for better flavor. Try muddled berries or cucumber., While it's tempting to stay up late finishing a great book, getting enough sleep is essential to staying healthy. It also keeps you happier and more alert.Make sure you are getting the required 8 hours of sleep a night.


To help yourself get your sleep, make sure you stick to a schedule. Always go to bed at the same time. If you have a hard time sticking to it, try setting an alarm to remind you to go to bed. Your body likes routine, and once you get on a schedule, it will know it's time to get sleepy when bedtime rolls around.Also, take 30 minutes to 1 hour before bed to relax. Turn off the screens, and start getting ready for bed. Giving your self time to relax before it's bedtime ensures you'll be asleep when you need to be, rather than just heading for bed at that time.It is interesting to note that a body that is sleep deprived tends to crave more carbohydrates and eat more throughout the day. This is your body's way of trying to get energy, which is what it should have gotten from adequate sleep.

, It's important to have yourself checked out at least once a year by a doctor. That way, the doctor can monitor you for any conditions you might develop, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure, and get you started on treatment early.Don't forget to ask your doctor about the appropriate level of exercise for you. Also, your doctor can advise you on the right diet.

, Recent research has shown that some alcohol may be beneficial, especially wine. It may help reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.However, too much drinking can lead to a slew of health problems, from higher risk of cancer to liver disease and high blood pressure.Drinking in moderation for women means only one drink a day. For men, two drinks is considered moderate, until age 65, when they should switch to one drink a day., Smoking affects all parts of your body. It decreases your lung capacity, making it harder to exercise. It increases your blood pressure, putting you at risk for heart disease. It can also make it harder to increase muscle size because not as much oxygen is reaching them.Get your loved ones involved. They can help keep you from smoking, as long as you tell them how you want them to help. For instance, maybe you can ask them not to smoke around you for a month or two.Stay busy. The busier you are, the less you'll think about smoking. Try to think about activities that take you away from cigarette smoke, such as hiking or going to the movies, rather than to it, such as going to a club or bar.Skip your triggers. If you always smoke while doing a certain activity, try not doing that for awhile so you won't be tempted., Increasing how much you move overall, even if it's not aerobic exercise, will make you more fit. For instance, park your car farther out in the parking lot when you go places; you'll need to walk more to get inside. Choose to go up the stairs, skipping the elevator. Instead of sitting while you're on the phone, walk around. All of the little things will come together to make you a healthier person."

Use protective gear.",How to Treat a Paintball Welt," A paintball welt usually does not require any medical attention. However, if you notice any of the following symptoms developing make an appointment with your regular doctor:


Very painful swelling around the welt
A welt that does not improve within a week
A lump forming around the welt
Any welts to the nose or eye area
A raised area with extreme discoloration
A bruise that shows the pores of the skin (looks polka-dotted)
If you experience abnormal bleeding elsewhere, such as from your nose or in urine or stools;
, As soon as you notice a paintball welt, take time to wash it with soap and water. Any dirt and debris caught in the bruise should be removed to prevent an infection. Pat the area dry when you're done washing with a clean paper towel. Rubbing the area dry could cause irritation and make the welt worse. It's not a bad idea to use rubbing alcohol or Neosporin to make sure the wound is clean, though you should not use alcohol on an open cut or wound., Apply a cold compress to the welt within the first 48 hours after the injury occurs. The cold temperature causes the blood vessels to constrict, therefore reducing blood flow and inflammation in the affected area.After that, apply a hot compress. This can help reduce pain and swelling.


You can buy an ice pack at a drug store. Just be sure not to apply it directly to your skin. Wrap it in a towel beforehand. You can also put ice cubes in a plastic bag or use a bag of frozen vegetables.Make sure the ice or cold pack is wrapped in a towel or cloth to protect yourself from frostbite.
You should apply a cold compress for 10 minutes at a time a few times a day as symptoms persist.After 48 hours, run warm water over a washcloth and then apply it to the bruise.

, A welt can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications. This can reduce discomfort caused by the wound as well as reduce swelling and inflammation.


Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) are probably your best options for over-the-counter pain relief and reduction in swelling. Follow dosage instructions on the package.Before taking an over-the-counter medications, you should always talk to a pharmacist to make sure the meds won't interact negatively with any existing medication you're taking., It is recommended to stop activities that may cause further injury to the affected area for the first 24 to 48 hours. This helps to promote the body’s healing process without causing further injury or damage to the affected tissue and muscles. Ideally, you should elevate the affected area over your heart., Some people claim using banana peels and raw eggs resulted in improvement of welts and bruises. If your welt is not healing in response to other treatments, try rubbing the peel of a ripe banana on your welt or breaking a raw egg over the wound., This may be because both vitamins have a positive effect on the immune system.


Stop by your local pharmacy and see if they carry Vitamin K creams. Ask for instructions on how to apply. Some people find Vitamin K cuts down on healing time.Vitamin C is found in foods like citrus fruits, pineapples, and apples. Upping your intake of natural Vitamin C may have some effect on the healing time of a welt., You can buy Epsom salt at most drug stores and supermarkets. Run a warm bath and add a cup or so of Epsom salt. Let it dissolve and soak for about 20 minutes.Adding essential oils to the bath may also be beneficial. Try lavender or geranium.

, The sooner you treat a paintball welt, the better. After you finish playing paintball, examine your body for any signs of wounds or injuries. Clean them and begin icing as soon as possible.

, You should not be under the influence of alcohol or any other mind altering drugs while playing paintball. This can lower your inhibitions and overall coordination, increasing the likelihood of accidents. You may also use poor judgment when inebriated, neglecting to use proper safety equipment., Solid ground is important to prevent injury during paintball. Make sure the area where you're playing is safe.


Do not play paintball if it's rained recently as wet terrain can be dangerous.
Choose flat, open terrain over wooded areas with lots of hills and cliffs., Paintballs are hard and can cause serious injury without proper padding. Paintball padding should over your arms, legs, hands, feet, chest, face, and eyes. While you may still experience some welts and bruises with padding, protection can prevent serious injury."

Take an over the counter pain killer.,
Notice signs of more serious injury.",How to Treat a Black Eye1," This is the most effective treatment for a black eye, and you should begin immediately.The cold will reduce swelling and pain. The color from a black eye is a result of blood pooling under the skin, and the cold will constrict your blood vessels, which may lessen or slow the bleeding.Use gentle pressure to press a bag of crushed ice, frozen vegetables, or an ice or old pack to your eye.Make sure you wrap the ice in a clean, dry cloth. Applying the ice directly to your skin could cause a cold burn.Apply the ice pack to your eye for 20 minutes each hour until you go to bed. So, you will alternate 20 minutes on, 40 minutes off, for at least the first day.Don't put a steak or raw meat on your eye. If there is bacteria on the meat it could easily infect an open wound or pass to the mucous membrane on your eye.;
, Don't try to force your eye to open while it's still swollen.Don't poke or prod the injury or press the cold pack against your eye with too much force.If you wear glasses, you may have to go without until the swelling goes down. Your glasses may put pressure on the area around your nose and eye.
Don't participate in any athletic activities that could result in further injury. Wait for the swelling to go down until you get back on the field., Acetaminophen can be particularly effective in reducing pain. Aspirin will help reduce your pain as well, but it also thins blood and affects your blood's ability to clot., A black eye is usually a simple bruise resulting from a blow to the head, nose, or eye, or surgical procedures on the face. In some cases, however, a black eye can be part of a larger problem. If you notice any of the following symptoms, call your doctor or go to an emergency room for immediate treatment:


Blood in the white or iris. You should see an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) as soon as possible.
Double vision or blurred vision.
Severe pain.
Bruising around both eyes.
Bleeding from the nose or eye.
You are unable to move your eye.
Your eye begins leaking fluid or your eyeball appears deformed.
An object has pierced or may be inside your eyeball.
If you take a blood thinner or have hemophilia, go to the ER.

Tape up with horizontal strips.",How to Tape an Ankle Like an Athletic Trainer," If you are not trained to wrap ankles, you should seek a medical professional. In the case of an emergency, you may need to attempt to wrap the ankle yourself. Only attempt to take over where a medical professional is needed if you are in a serious situation, as you may cause further harm.;
, Make sure you have everything you need in order to properly tape the ankle. Without all the proper equipment, you may cause further injury to the person whose ankle you wish to wrap. Plan to have these four things ahead of time.You will need:



Tape adherent. Tape adherent helps to prevent slippage and eases the wrapping process.

Heel and lace pads. Heel and lace pads protect against blisters caused by friction and chafing.

Pre-wrap. Pre-wrap acts a barrier between the skin and the tape. Pre-wrap is a foam- or gauze-type cloth pad. It is made with different things depending on the manufacturer. It can be made of cotton, latex, other synthetic materials, as well as blends of these materials.

Athletic tape. Athletic tape is the main structural component used when wrapping ankles.

, Ask the patient to sit someplace sturdy where his or her foot can be elevated and extended such that it can be easily accessed. The foot should be pointed upright at a 90 degree angle and should remain in that position throughout the duration of the tape job., This comes most commonly in spray form, as QDA (Quick Drying Adhesive). The adhesive is lightly sprayed evenly over the area you will wrap. By applying this adhesive, you will ensure the wrapping remains in place., Place the heel and lace pads on the top and backside of the ankle. The pads prevent blister-causing friction under ankle tape. When positioning, think about the points where your shoe meets your foot. These are the most likely place to experience blistering due to wrapping.For added protection, skin lube can be applied underneath the pads themselves, although this is not strictly necessary.
In emergency situations, heel and lace pads may not be necessary.

, Apply pre-wrap from the mid-foot to the bottom end of the calf muscle. Cover the foot entirely in order to prevent the tape from sticking to the skin. The heel may remain uncovered. This will provide a barrier between the tape and the skin, as well as an additional layer of support. , Put one to three anchor strips at the top of the pre-wrap. Each consecutive strip should overlap at about its midpoint. Place one around the arch of the foot, where the lower portion of the pre-wrap ends.


Make sure that each anchor strip is applied with even tension. Too light and the tape won't anchor the the pre-wrap strongly enough; too tight and the circulation to the foot could be pinched or cut off.
Check with the athlete after application to find out if the tape is comfortable.

, Apply three semi-overlapping stirrups, beginning on the medial side (inside of the ankle) and working to the lateral side (outside of the ankle). These stirrups will be U-shaped strips. The tape starts at the top anchor, goes over the bottom of the heel, under the foot, and back up the other side. It ends at the starting anchor on the opposite side of the foot.


Make sure you're using even tension as you put the stirrup on the inside anchor, under the foot, and on the outside anchor., These go from either side of the foot, back around the achilles tendon, to the opposite side of the foot. Horseshoe tape wrappings stabilize the stirrups. They also add support to the ankle., Apply the tape in two figure eight patterns, with one going in each direction. Start at the top of the foot where the foot connects with the ankle, take the tape under the foot, back up, and around the back of the ankle. The tape should end up where you started it.

, Heel locks start on one side of the foot, wrap about the heel, and then are taped back on the side you began from. Four are applied in alternation, two on each side of the foot.This helps to stabilize the ankle.

, These are meant to fully cover the pre-wrap. This helps to hold all the different pieces of tape together. It also helps to add additional stability and closes up the wrap."

Be aware that serious closed fractures may require surgery.",How to Treat a Closed Fracture During First Aid," The first step in providing first aid is to prevent the injured person from moving. Ask them to sit or lie still, and try to make them as comfortable as possible.


This is especially important if they feel any pain in their neck, as moving them could cause serious injury to their spine. Call an ambulance if you suspect there may be injury to the spine.
As you wait for medical assistance, ask the patient how the injury happened and where they feel pain. This information will help you to decide the best course of action and to inform the medial professionals when the time comes.;
, If there is any bleeding at the site of the closed fracture (or anywhere else on the body), you can stop or minimize the blood loss by applying direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth. The pressure constricts the blood vessels, keeping the bleeding under control.Covering the wound with a clean cloth will also help to prevent it from becoming infected. If possible, wear gloves to prevent your hands from coming in direct contact with the patient's blood — this will also help to prevent infection.
Keep in mind that this technique will only work if the blood is coming from a vein (which pumps blood at a low pressure). If the blood is coming from an artery, the bleeding will be impossible to control using pressure alone and the patient will require medical attention immediately.

, The next step is to immobilize the fractured limb using a splint — this will prevent the bone from becoming displaced further. Don’t try to move or realign a deformed bone.


If you have one easily at hand, a padded splint can be applied to the the fractured bone to immobilize the injury and reduce discomfort. Make sure to apply the splint very carefully to avoid making the fracture worse. If applying the splint causes the patient too much pain, set it aside.If you don't have a padded splint you can improvise and make your own using any available materials. For example, a length of cardboard or wood, a bundle of twigs, a rolled newspaper can be placed along the fractured limb, then held in place using a piece of rope, a belt, a necktie or a length of cloth.

, As quickly as possible following the injury, apply an ice pack to the site of the fracture. The cold from the ice narrows the blood vessels, helping to reduce blood flow to the injury and prevent excess swelling. The ice also helps to numb the pain.


Hold the ice against the injured limb for 10 to 20 minutes, then take a break to allow the skin to warm up before reapplying.
Make sure to wrap the ice pack in a clean cloth or towel — the ice should never come in direct contact with the skin, as the extreme cold may cause tissue damage.
If you don't have an ice pack, a pack of frozen vegetables will do nicely. Never apply a heat pack or warm compress to the injury, as this will increase blood flow to the area, increasing swelling and pain.

, If it is possible to do so without causing further injury, try to keep the injured limb elevated above heart level. This reduces blood flow to the area and prevents swelling. If the injured person is lying down, you can prop their fractured arm, hand, leg or foot on a stack of pillows or cushions.

, Try to provide a quiet environment for the injured person. This will help them to remain calm and stay still. Make them as comfortable as possible, using cushions, blankets and pillows as necessary, and prevent other people from crowding around them.

, If the injured person has any open wounds, do your best to clean them out, as this will help to prevent injury.


Dip a clean cotton ball in hydrogen peroxide or betadine and use it to clean the wound from the center out, using a gentle circular motion.
Dress the wound using a clean bandage. Make sure the bandage is not applied too tightly, otherwise it could restrict blood flow to the injured area and slow healing.

, If the injured person goes into shock, place their body lying down with their head lower than their trunk. If possible, elevate the legs. This promotes blood flow to the heart and brain.


Keep in mind that placing the injured person in this position is only possible if their neck or back is not injured. Otherwise you risk making the injury worse.
The major symptoms of shock include rapid, shallow breathing; cold, clammy skin; a rapid, weak pulse; feeling very weak or faint. Less common symptoms of shock include: anxiety and agitation; bluish lips and fingernails; confusion or unresponsiveness; seizures, sweating or chest pain; eyes that appear to stare.
For more information on how to give first aid to people suffering from shock, see this article.

, Remove any constrictive clothing or jewelry that could obstruct blood circulation. If necessary, use a scissors to cut away any clothing that you can't easily remove.

, If the injured person is in a lot of pain, you can give them an over-the-counter pain medication, such as Ibuprofen. This will help to keep the pain under control under the person receives medical attention.


Don't give the injured person a higher dose of pain medication than the dosage indicated on the packaging, regardless of their pain level.
Before you give them injured person any pain medication, make sure that they are able to swallow properly, otherwise they may start to choke. The same goes for giving the patient any food or water.

, Once the ambulance arrives, or you can get the injured person to a hospital, transfer the care of the patient over to the medical professionals. Inform them of the cause of the injury and the details of the first aid care you provided.

, The pain associated with a closed fracture can be described as knots of sharp and stinging pain. Pain occurs when the muscle fibers in the injured area become stretched or torn. This causes the muscle fibers to constrict, leading to insufficient blood flow to the affected area and a lack of oxygen. This results in a build up of lactic acid around the site of the injury. Lactic acid causes pain by disrupting the pH levels around the injury.


As a result of the pain, the injured person will be unable to put any weight on the injured part of the body. If they do, they may experience very severe, pulsating pain at the site of the body.
The pain may also be accompanied by a grating sound and sensation, which occurs when the two halves of the broken bone rub up against each other.
The injury should also feel tender to the touch when light pressure is applied.

, A closed fracture will make it very difficult or even impossible to move the injured part of the body. This limits normal function and prevents the injured person from doing simple activities and tasks.

, If a closed fracture has occurred, you should be able to see signs of swelling or bruising at the site of the injury.


Bruises appear when blood vessels beneath the skin break as a result of extreme force or a blow to the skin. Blood leaks out of these blood vessels, resulting in red, black or purple marks on the skin.
Swelling occurs when the body’s immune system releases inflammatory chemicals through the blood in order to eliminate harmful stimuli around the site of the injury, such as irritants, damaged cells, and pathogens. This allows the body to start the healing process., A pulse is the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the blood vessels in order to distribute blood efficiently to different parts of the body. If the pulse feels low or weak below the site of the injury, this means that blood circulation has been compromised and a muscle or bone injury is likely. To learn how to look for a pulse, see this article.


If the blood flow has been compromised, it's likely that the injured person will experience numbness or even paralysis below the fracture site.
Although loss of sensation is usually due to lack of blood, it could also be the work of a damaged nerve.

, Following a closed fracture, the muscle fibers surrounding the injury become stretched and torn, which affects the flow of blood to the site of the injury. This reduced blood flow causes the fracture site to become pale and discolored, as it is blood that gives skin its regular color.

, In some cases (though not all) a closed fracture will result in the injured limb looking twisted or deformed, when compared to the normal, uninjured limb. This is caused by broken bone fragments at the site of the injury.

, A fracture is defined as a disruption in the continuity of the bone. There are two types of fractures, open and closed:


Open fracture: This type of fracture is visible to the naked eye. The skin over the site of the injury is lost and the underlying muscles and bone fragments may be seen. There is often a lot of bleeding with this type of fracture, and it is more susceptible to infection

Closed fracture: A closed fracture occurs when the bone breaks or cracks but does not penetrate the skin, so the skin covering the injury remains intact. Closed fractures are more common than open fractures and are usually easier to treat., Certain groups of people are at higher risk of sustaining a closed fracture than others. These include:



People above the age of 65: As people grow older, their body's are not able to absorb nutrients as well as they used to. When the body is unable to absorb sufficient amounts of calcium, the bones become weaker, making them more susceptible to closed fractures and other bone injuries.

People with osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones become weak and hollow, making them more prone to breakage.

People with cancer: Cancer patients have fragile bones and weakened muscle tissue. This makes them more susceptible to injuries.

Women with abnormal menstrual cycles: Abnormal menstruation usually occurs as a result of low estrogen levels. Estrogen is a female hormone that also helps to regulate bone growth. If estrogen levels are low, the bones become weaker and more likely to break or fracture upon impact.

People who play sports: People who engage in sporting activities such as soccer, basketball, tennis and squash, are more like to fall heavily or receive forceful blows to the limbs, which can cause fractures.

, With less severe fractures, the bone will be manipulated back into the correct position and the limb will be covered by a cast to protect it as it heals. However, with more severe closed fractures, surgery may be required.


During surgery, any broken pieces of bone will need to be put back into place.Then, nails, plates or screws will be inserted into the bone to stabilize it and ensure that it heals normally. In some cases, metal rods will be placed through the center of the bone to keep it in line.
Depending on the severity of the injury, the fractured bone may take up to several months to heal. The healed limb may feel stiff at first, but with physical therapy, most patients regain full mobility.

Understand common causes of burns in children.,
Identify the severity of the burn.,
Know when to seek medical attention.",How to Treat Burns in Children1," Scalding liquids are the most prevalent cause of burns in children; this can occur from a bath that is too hot, or the child placing his or her hand under the tap in water that is too hot.Other causes of burns include:


Chemical burns (these can be caused by paint thinner, gasoline, and strong acids)
Fire burns
Steam burns
Burns from hot objects (such as hot metal or hot glass)
Electrical burns
Ultraviolet burns (from sunlight or from excess time in tanning beds)
Abuse (in children especially, this must always be considered as a potential cause of a burn if there is any doubt whatsoever surrounding the circumstances of the burn);
, There are three ""severities"" of burns — first degree, second degree, and third degree.Examine the area of the burn to get an idea of the severity and to assess whether or not you need to bring your child to the hospital.


First degree burns affect the outermost layer of skin only, causing pain, redness, and/or swelling. Generally, first degree burns are not too concerning and do not need to be seen by a doctor.
Second degree burns affect the outermost layer of skin as well as some of the inner layers. For this reason, they may cause blistering in addition to pain, redness, and swelling. Second degree burns greater than two to three inches wide require evaluation from a doctor right away.
Third degree burns travel through the full thickness of the skin. They may cause whitened or blackened skin, and may leave the skin feeling numb. Third degree burns always require evaluation by a medical professional.
It is also important to note the location of the burn. Burns on the hands, feet, face, buttocks, or over a joint and/or genitals are more serious and, if in doubt, warrant being evaluated by a medical professional., In the case of a more serious burn, prompt medical attention is key to proper healing. It is important to go to the hospital if any of the following are present:You think it qualifies as a third degree burn.
The surface area of the burn is equal to or larger than the surface area of the child's palm.
It is a chemical burn or an electrical burn.
There was smoke at the time of the burn — this can cause a smoke inhalation injury.
The child shows signs of shock. (Symptoms include altered consciousness, paleness, dizziness or fainting, weakness, rapid heartbeat, or rapid or difficulty breathing.) Call 911 if these symptoms are present.
Physical abuse is suspected as a possible cause for the burn.
If at all uncertain, it is best to seek the professional opinion of a doctor.

Hold a handheld hair dryer set to a high setting 2"" (5 cm) over your bite.",How to Treat Chigger Bites3," Doing this will help to alleviate scratching.


This remedy is based on the myth that chiggers burrow into the skin, and thus sealing over the bites will cause them to suffocate. However this is incorrect—chiggers do not actually stay under the skin, and are easily dislodged. Coating the affected area with nail polish or glue may help prevent too much scratching, but will do little to stop itching., Apply the powder to the chigger bite.

, After showering, apply the paste to your bites.

, You can dab Listerine on the bite, apply castor oil or spread on some Vick's Vap-o-Rub or Rawleigh's Medicated Ointment. The Camphor, Menthol & Eucalyptus oils in both will help stop itching and aid in quick healing of the bites.

, Mix water with any common household ammonia like a blue window cleaner. Use a cotton ball to dab this onto your bite, repeating the treatment as necessary., Blow dry the bite for a few seconds. The itching sensation should fade away after your skin releases the heat."

Place the burned area under cool water.,
Reassure the child.Oftentimes, a burn can be a scary experience for a young child.,
Gently clean the skin.Prior to bandaging the burn, be sure to clean it thoroughly with soap and water.,
Leave small blisters unbroken.Oftentimes burns will leave the skin with some blisters present; if this is the case, let them heal naturally and do not attempt to break them open.,
Try moisturizing ointment.After cooling the burned area, as long as there is not any broken skin or open blisters, applying a moisturizing ointment can have a soothing effect as well.,
Cover the wound from the burn with a sterile dressing.This will help to protect it from the environment, and will help it to heal.,
Consider your child's last tetanus immunization.Whenever there is an open wound, medical protocol calls for the administration of a tetanus shot.,
Encourage your child not to scratch.Scratching the wound that remains following a burn only predisposes the wound to opening up further and increases the chances of infection.",How to Treat Burns in Children2," Assuming it is a minor burn that does not require immediate medical attention, have your child place her affected area under cool water. Cool, flowing water is preferable to an ice pack for the treatment of burns, as ice can sometimes cause further damage to the injured tissue.If the burns are multiple, you can consider placing your child in a cool bath to cover more areas of her body at one time.


Keep the affected area in cool water for at least five minutes.After that, depending upon the pain level, your child can keep it under cool water, or simply place a cool towel on the affected area to diminish pain and to reduce the amount of swelling that follows.

, Their fear around it, in many cases (assuming it is a minor burn), exceeds the injury itself. This is why reassurance and helping your child to stay calm and to cope with any pain is one of your top priorities.


To help with the pain, you can offer your child Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and/or Ibuprofen (Advil). Both of these medications are available over-the-counter, and help with pain control as well as with minimizing inflammation.
Read the dosages on the bottle and be sure to offer your child only the ""children's dosing.""

, Also, be gentle while cleaning so as not to cause any further damage to the affected area.

, If they have broken open on their own, clean them gently with soap and water and apply an antibiotic ointment prior to covering them with a bandage to prevent infection.


Don't use hand sanitizers or harsh soaps and don't use rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean the area.

, Aloe vera lotion or gel has naturally soothing properties for burns. Use this if you have any of it available at home, or if you can easily get to the store to buy some.

, Be sure to change the dressing at least once a day to keep it clean.


If it is a small first degree burn without any broken skin, you may not need to cover it.

, If your child has previously had a tetanus shot, the immunity will last for 10 years after the shot and he will not need any additional shots during this time period. However, if you are uncertain if your child has had the shot, or when he last had it, consult with a physician to see if a tetanus shot is needed.


Many doctors recommend getting a tetanus shot if it has been more than five years since the last one and the child has second or third degree burns.

, Explain to your child the importance of not scratching, and keep the wound covered with a sterile dressing as a reminder to your child that it is not to be touched.

Go to the Emergency Department.In the case of a severe burn, smoke inhalation, or a fire, bring your child to the Emergency Department as soon as possible.,
Ensure adequate hydration.In the case of severe burns that require medical attention, your doctor will recommend keeping your child well-hydrated while the burn heals.,
Obtain skin grafts as needed.In very severe burns that cover a large surface area, plastic surgeons may need to use what are called ""skin grafts"" (pieces of skin that are sewn over the area of the burn) to help with healing.",How to Treat Burns in Children3," All of these qualify as emergencies, and deserve the attention of a medical professional immediately. For less severe second degree burns, you can usually see your family doctor.


If you suspect that abuse may be the cause of your child's burn, it is also key to see a medical professional. If you cannot get in to see your family doctor on the same day as the incident, proceed to the Emergency Room as official documentation of the injuries and the extent of the burn by medical professionals will be key in investigating what really caused your child's burn.

, Burns, depending upon their severity, can cause significant fluid loss; therefore, drinking lots of water, or even receiving IV fluids, may be necessary as part of the healing process.

, These are reserved only for the most severe and extensive burns.

Pour fresh water over the area without touching. Even though the pain can be intense during the first few minutes, by avoiding any touching or rubbing, you may prevent the pain from lingering for days.The chemical irritants from the plant can dry on the surface of the skin, then they can be removed by soap and water. By avoiding any rubbing or touching at first, the chemicals are not pushed further into the skin, which can cause the painful reaction to last longer, possibly even days.The chemicals released by the plant include acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, moroidin, leukotrienes, and possibly formic acid.;
, Soap and water cleans the affected parts of the skin, and removes the chemicals released by the plant that cause the pain, swelling, redness, and itching. In many cases, once the area is washed, the pain either goes away completely, or is greatly reduced., If you are not near soap or water, use a clean cloth to gently remove dirt and plant debris from the area until it can be more thoroughly cleaned., Lightly apply a strong tape, like duct tape, to the area involved, then remove the tape. This can help to remove any remaining fibers that may be lodged in the skin., If the tape did not remove all the unwanted plant material from the skin, you can try using a wax hair remover.Apply a layer of the wax removal, let it dry for about 5 minutes, then gently peel off the wax, taking the plant debris along with it., The stinging, burning, pain, and itching, is quite intense. The duration of the symptoms varies from person to person, and varies depending on the initial measures taken to clean the area as just described.


The rash looks similar to hives, with raised areas of whitish blisters. The entire area can appear swollen and inflamed, with a reddish tint to the area affected.

, Applying the juices contained in the leaves from either a dock plant or jewelweed plant may help. These plants often grow in the same areas as the nettle plant. Locate either plant, and crush a few leaves to release their juices. Apply the crushed leaves to the area affected.The actual science behind the use of plants to treat this condition is very limited. Yet, this has been common practice in treating a sting from a nettle plant for centuries.A dock weed plant commonly grows in the same general areas as the stinging nettle plant. The plant grows in height from 20 inches to about 50 inches, and the leaves grow to be about 16 inches long. The leaves are very large, oval, have rounded tips, and have a wavy look to the edges. The lower leaves have a reddish color to their stems.A jewelweed plant is the same plant as an impatiens. These plants also grow naturally in the same areas where you may come across a stinging nettle. The chemical content found in the juice from the leaves and stem of a jewelweed plant is reportedly effective at counteracting the sting from a stinging nettle., The areas can itch quite strongly, but try to avoid scratching. Scratching can irritate the area even further, possibly break the skin, and cause the symptoms to linger.For young children, you may want to put soft gloves or mittens on their hands to help avoid scratching. Also keep nails short.

, Keep the area covered with cool compresses to help provide some relief from the stinging. The cooler temperature can help to reduce the redness and relieve some of the discomfort.

, Using just baking soda and water, make a paste material and apply to the rash. Use cold water in your paste. The paste can help to relieve some of the itching, inflammation, and the burning sensation.


Apply any treatments gently to the area by using a dabbing motion to prevent further irritation.

, Apply the juice from an actual aloe vera plant leaf, or use a manufactured product with high concentrations of aloe vera. Using aloe vera can help to manage the red and inflamed areas, and reduce the burning sensation., Take baths or showers in cooler water, and avoid applying anything warm to the area. Cooler temperatures are more soothing and help to reduce the redness and inflammation., Topical creams, ointments, or lotions, containing hydrocortisone can help to reduce the redness and stop the itching.


Apply over-the-counter topical products containing hydrocortisone to treat the rash. Follow the package directions. A rash that includes redness, itching, and inflammation may persist since the skin has been injured from the direct contact from the stinging nettle plant.Calamine or Caladryl® lotion can help to provide a soothing feeling and help to reduce the itching and burning.
Over-the-counter oral antihistamines might also help to counteract the reaction that is occurring in your body. Available products include agents such as cetirizine, or Zyrtec®, loratadine, or Claritin®, and diphenhydramine, or Benadryl®.
Apply antibiotic creams or ointments. Products are available over-the-counter that contain a mixture of anti-infective agents. Apply the antibiotic cream or ointment directly to the areas involved. The coolness of the product will have a soothing effect, and the active properties of the cream or ointment can help prevent infection.You can take an NSAID pain reliever for pain as long as you have no contraindication.

, In rare cases, someone may be allergic to the plant or to one of the chemicals released. Allergic reactions can be life-threatening. Immediate medical attention is warranted.

, Call 911 or go to the emergency room right away if you see one of the following symptoms of an allergic reaction:


Difficulty breathing, wheezing, or feeling like your throat is tightening.
A tight feeling in your chest that makes it hard to breathe.
Swelling in your mouth area, including your lips or tongue.
A rash that extends beyond the exposed area, and can be all over the body.
Stomach upset, cramping, vomiting, or diarrhea, can sometimes be part of an allergic reaction.

, Your doctor may be able to help guide you by prescribing topical medications or suggesting ways to treat the symptoms specific for young children.

, If the areas of skin exposed to the plant are widespread, or if your symptoms do not improve in 24 hours, contact your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe prescription strength topical agents to treat the exposed areas, or stronger oral products to help resolve the reaction systemically.

, If the areas have been scratched and the skin is broken, it is possible for an infection to set in.


If you have areas of broken skin that are warm to the touch, draining pus, or more inflamed than the surrounding areas, then you may be developing an infection. Call your doctor right away if you experience these symptoms or if you have a fever. Your doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic cream or ointment, or may want you take a course of oral antibiotics.

Beware of skin cancer.,
Watch out for heatstroke.",How to Treat a Severe Sunburn," Use mild soap and lukewarm/cool water. You can use a cool, damp towel applied to the affected area, but avoid any rubbing that may irritate the skin. Gently place the towel on the skin. Be sure that the temperature of the water is not too cold, as this can have negative effects on the skin immediately after a burn (cooling burned skin with excessive cold too rapidly slows down healing and increases the chances of a frostbite injury on top of the burn).If the burn continues to cause irritation, you can relieve this by taking frequent showers or baths in cool (mildly cool) water.Do not completely dry yourself out of the shower, but allow for a little moisture to remain to aid in healing.;
, If your burn is very severe, you may encounter blisters and leaking pus from the blisters. It is important to keep the area clean by washing it with running water and mild soap. Blistering of your skin means you have a second degree burn and infection becomes a concern. It is important to see a doctor if your burn is blistering and leaking pus. Your doctor may choose to prescribe antibiotics and can pop blisters if necessary.Silver sulfadiazine (1% cream, Thermazene) can be used to treat sunburns. This acts as an antibiotic to help prevent infection around areas of compromised and damaged skin. Do not use this medication on your face.While you may be tempted to pop the blisters yourself, you run a high risk of infection. Since the skin is already damaged, it does not fight off bacterial infections effectively. It is best to let your doctor treat the blisters, as she can provide a sterile environment and tools.

, If you do not have a pre-made compress, dip a towel in ice-cold water and apply to the sunburned area.Apply the covered cold compress for 10 – 15 minutes several times a day., Aloe vera gel or soy-based moisturizers are the best choice since they will cool the burn. Preliminary studies have shown aloe vera to help burns heal faster. In a review of available scientific literature, patients treated with aloe vera healed almost nine days earlier (on average) than those who went without aloe vera.Generally, medical professionals recommend that aloe is best used for minor burns and skin irritations, and should never be applied to an open wound.For soy-based moisturizers, look for organic and natural ingredients on the label. A good example is the brand Aveeno, commonly found in most stores. Soy is a plant that has natural moisturizing capabilities, which helps your damaged skin maintain moisture and heal.Avoid lotions or creams that contain benzocaine or lidocaine. While once used commonly in the past, these can cause irritation and allergic reactions. Avoid using petroleum oil (also known by the brand Vaseline). Petroleum can clog pores and trap heat within the skin, preventing proper healing of your skin., Try to avoid harsh lotions with perfumes, as this could cause more irritation.


Continue using aloe vera, soy moisturizer, or a mild lotion with oatmeal. These products are currently recommended by many doctors and they will help to keep your skin moisturized with minimal irritation so that your body can naturally heal.Continue taking cool showers or baths throughout the day if you are still feeling any burning. You can take multiple showers or baths to help the skin stay moisturized.

, Further exposure to the sun may cause additional damage, which may require medical attention. Your skin needs protection, so make sure to keep it covered when it is exposed to the sun or any other excessive UVR.


Wear fabrics over your sunburn that won't irritate your skin (avoid wool and cashmere specifically).
There is no “best” fabric, but a loose-fitting, comfortable, and breathable fabric (such as cotton) will keep you comfortable and may provide some additional protection from the sun.
Wear a hat to help protect your face from damaging UV rays of the sun. The skin on your face is especially sensitive and protecting it from the sun with a hat is a good idea.
When you are considering protective fabrics and clothing, a good test is to hold up the fabric to a bright light. The most protective clothing will have very little light penetration coming through.Avoid being outside between 10 am and 4 pm. These are peak hours for sunburn.

, Sunburns will heal on their own. Most sunburns will heal on their own within a few days to a few weeks. You can expect a longer time-frame if you have a second-degree burn with blistering that is closer to the 3 week healing time. Proper treatment with medical attention for second-degree blistering burns will result in the fastest recovery time. Sunburns can usually heal completely with little to minimal evidence of scarring (if any at all)., Follow all manufacturers’ directions on dosage.


Ibuprofen — This is an over-the-counter medication that can help to reduce inflammation, redness, and pain. Ibuprofen for sunburns is generally taken by adults in 400mg doses every 6 hours for a short period of time. Follow instructions as indicated by your doctor or the manufacturer’s label. Children under 6 months old should not take Ibuprofen. Follow the instructions on the bottle. Naproxen — Your doctor may alternatively prescribe this medication if ibuprofen hasn't worked for you. The upside is that the anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects will last longer once they begin. Naproxen can be found in over-the-counter medication such as Aleve.Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) and as such can cause some stomach discomfort., Acetic acid in vinegar alleviates pain, itching, and inflammation. Pour one cup of white cider vinegar into tepid bathwater and soak. Alternatively, dab a vinegar soaked cotton swab on the most painful parts of your sunburn. Dab, don't wipe. You don't want to add any sort of friction to the outside of the burn., Wet a washcloth or cotton gauze with this anti-inflammatory astringent and apply to the skin three or four times a day for 20 minutes to minimize pain and itching.There are very few side effects of witch hazel and it is completely safe to use with children.

, Sun poisoning is a term used to describe severe sunburns and reactions to UV rays (photodermatitis). If your skin develops blisters, if the burn is very painful, or is accompanied by a fever and extreme thirst or fatigue, seek medical attention immediately. These may be signs of a more serious medical condition. There may be a genetic sensitivity that causes this. Additionally, metabolic causes can result from a lack of niacin or vitamin B3.The typical symptoms and treatment are described in this article, but the most severe symptoms that require medical attention include:


Blisters — you may experience itchiness and raised areas of your skin where you were excessively exposed to sunlight
Rashes — along with blisters or bumps, it is common to see rashes that may or may not be itchy. these rashes can resemble eczema
Swelling — there may be pain and redness in areas of excessive sunlight exposure
Nausea, fever, headache, and chills — These symptoms may arise as a result of a combination of photosensitivity and exposure to heat
If you experience these symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention right away for further evaluation of the severity of your sunburn., The two most common forms of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma — are directly related to sun exposure. These cancers form primarily on the face, ears, and hands. A person’s risk for melanoma — the most serious form of skin cancer — doubles if he has had five or more sunburns. More importantly, if you have a severe sunburn, you are at greater risk for melanoma., Heatstroke occurs when the body fails to regulate its own temperature, and body temperature continues to rise. Since sun exposure can lead to both extreme sunburns and heat stroke, many people who experience extreme sunburns also run a risk of heatstroke. The primary signs of heatstroke are:


Hot, red, dry skin
Rapid, strong pulse
Extreme body temperatures
Nausea or vomiting"

Running away to your house or car is recommended, but sometimes force may be needed to drive the animal off. Throwing rocks from a distance is probably safest, but kicking or hitting the animal to get it to release its bite is sometimes required and can save a life.


Try making yourself as big as you can and yell loudly in attempts to scare the animal off before getting physical with it.
Almost 50% of all dog bites involve an animal owned by the victim's family or neighbors, so getting away from the dog is usually not too difficult.Getting attacked in the wild by a large animal (bear, wolf, badger) is much more serious. ""Playing dead"" has worked for some, but so has running away or counter-attacking. Animals are unpredictable and bite for many different reasons.
If an animal seems to be protecting its territory or family, running is the best option. If it seems to be hunting or attacking by its own accord, scaring, playing dead, or attacking are the best options.;
, If you or your child is bitten by an animal, once you're safe from further harm, clean the wound as soon as you can by running water over it for a few minutes.Carefully remove any objects from the bite (teeth, hair or dirt) and then gently wash the wound more thoroughly with soap and warm water. Using saline (a saltwater solution) is also a good idea. You may have to remove clothing or roll up pants/sleeves to get to the wound.


Use anti-bacterial soap if possible in order to help sanitize the wound — the mouths of all animals (including humans) contain lots of bacteria.
Don't forget to wash your hands with soap and water if you're treating an animal bite on someone else. Better yet, wear protective gloves if you have any.
If you need tweezers to remove any debris from the bite wound, rinse them in rubbing alcohol first to prevent the transfer of bacteria.

, If the bite wound is relatively minor, encourage it to bleed slightly by gently squeezing it or by putting pressure on the sides of the wound.Allowing the wound to bleed a little helps to flush out any bacteria or debris that's deeper in the tissues. A minute or two should be enough before trying to stop the bleeding (see below).


If the bite wound is already bleeding freely then don't encourage it any further. A continual trickle of blood is sufficient to help clean out the wound and reduce some of the pressure caused by inflammation.
Any spurting of blood from a bite wound is an indication that a blood vessel is severely damaged and medical attention is needed as soon as possible.

, If the bite wound is still bleeding heavily after washing and cleaning it, then stopping the flow of blood is important to prevent the victim from going into shock.The best way of doing this is to put a clean cloth, pad or sterile dressing over the wound and applying significant pressure for a few minutes.


Applying pressure to a wound triggers the blood to coagulate and clot, which seals the wound and starts the healing process.
Keep the bite wound elevated above the level of your heart to slow bleeding and swelling.
If you can't control the bleeding with pressure and you are far from help, you may have to tie a tourniquet above the wound, which puts pressure on the arteries and cuts off circulation. Rope, cord, belts, a scarf, and pieces of ripped clothing can be used as tourniquets.
Tourniquets should only be used in emergency life-threatening situations and for short durations because tissue starts to die within a few hours of not getting blood.

, After the bleeding is under control, dry the wound as best you can and cover it with a clean dressing or bandage that covers the wound entirely.Before applying the bandage, apply some antibacterial cream to the wound (Neosporin, Polysporin) if you have any to help prevent infection. The cream will also keep the dressing from sticking to the wound and causing more bleeding when the bandages are changed.


Natural sanitizers you can add to the wound include as iodine solution and hydrogen peroxide, although both will sting and cause some discomfort for a few minutes.Butterfly bandages help to hold the edges of a wound together. Place the across the wound (rather than lengthwise) and pull the edges closer together.
If the bite wound is quite deep and/or jagged, you'll likely need stitches from a doctor.
Change the bandage daily. Replacing the old bandage with a fresh one each day keeps the wound clean and promotes healing.

, In extreme cases, people lose body parts from animal bites, particularly fingers and ears. If this is the case with you or your child, save the part and wash it thoroughly along with your body wound. Rinse it with saline water, ideally.


Wrap the severed body part in a clean tissue/dressing and place it in a plastic bag surrounded by ice so it can be transported to the hospital.Ice slows tissue decomposition.
It's often possible to surgically reattach the severed body part at a hospital if the tissue isn't too damaged.

, The pain related to an animal's bite is due to tissue damage and swelling of the puncture wound. Thus, take an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) — it can be helpful to reduce pain and inflammation in the short term.Painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol) can be used for animal bites also, but they don't impact the swelling.


Children and teenagers shouldn't take aspirin,and children under two should not be given ibuprofenso stick with child's Tylenol or something similar.
If you are severely bleeding from an animal, then take acetaminophen for pain relief instead of NSAIDs because they tend to ""thin"" the blood and reduce your body's clotting ability.

, Getting bitten by an animal is a traumatic experience, especially if it's a vicious attack or by your own pet. Calm yourself or your child down with deep breaths and reassurance that they're safe and going to be fine. Keep yourself or your child warm with a blanket or appropriate clothing to help prevent shock. Signs of shock include: rapid breathing, rapid pulse, pale skin, dizziness, weakness, shaking and mental changes (confusion, anxiousness, agitation).Encourage crying or venting if need be. Don't bottle up any emotions.
Prepare for any potential vomiting. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects from fear and pain due to the increased release of hormones, such as adrenaline.

, Most animal bites don't puncture the skin, at least not very deeply, so the risk of severe bleeding or infection is minimal. In these cases, seeing a doctor is probably not needed. However, with more serious injuries involving lots of bleeding and deep wounds, medical attention is always recommended.If your doctor thinks the risk of infection is low, then they will close the wound with stitches. However, if the wound is deep and caused by a puncture, then then it will likely be left open and cleaned regularly.
Dog bites are much more common than cat bites, but infection is more likely with cats because they inflict deeper puncture wounds that can't be thoroughly disinfected.Your doctor might take x-rays to rule out broken bones and check your nervous system to rule out nerve damage.
Your doctor may want to know more about the location of the bite and type of animal so they can report the attack to the animal control office or police. Animals that bite people are a public hazard.

, Regardless of how serious you think your bite wound is, you should be vigilant about watching for signs of infection. Slicing or tearing bite wounds and gashes are less likely to get infected than deep puncture wounds, even with careful washing.Signs that indicate your bite wound is infected include: increased swelling and pain, discharge of yellow or green pus from the wound, red skin that's very warm to the touch, high fever, chills and/or a feeling of fatigue.If you notice any of these signs, don't try to treat the infection at home. Instead, head to a walk-in clinic or make an appointment with your doctor.
Any red streaking around the wound indicates an infection in the lymph system (lymphangitis), which can be life threatening.
In addition to treating the wound with antibiotic cream, your doctor may prescribe some antibiotic pills for a few weeks to either fight an infection or prevent one.
Between 15 and 20% of dog bites get infected, whereas the infection rate is higher with cat bites — almost 50%., Bites from non-immunized domestic animals (such as pets) or any wild animal carries the risk of rabies — a potentially deadly viral infection that affects the central nervous system.Rabies is more common from the bites of bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes than it is from dogs and cats because most domestic animals are vaccinated against rabies.


Some animals, such as rabbits, squirrels and other rodents rarely carry rabies.
A rabies shot should be given within 48 hours of getting bit, although it can be avoided if the animal is documented to be vaccinated and is free of infection.
Signs of rabies start out like most other viral infections (fever, headache, weakness), but it can progress to confusion, agitation, hallucinations, paralysis and foaming at the mouth.Death usually occurs within days once rabies infects the brain and causes advanced symptoms.

, Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection that can develop from any infected wound, especially if it's caused by a deep puncture. If you have not received a tetanus booster shot within the past 10 years and get a puncture wound from an animal (not just a surface scratch), then you should see your doctor and get vaccinated as soon as you can.Most people are vaccinated against tetanus shortly after birth, but immunity often wears off after ten years, so booster shots are occasionally needed.
Signs and symptoms of tetanus tend to appear anytime from a couple of days to a few weeks after the tetanus bacteria enters your body from a bite wound.
Common symptoms of tetanus include: fever, sweating, stiff neck, stiffness or spasms in jaw and abdominal muscles, difficulty swallowing."

Keep an eye on the bite.,
Determine the rabies vaccine status of the dog, if possible.,
Seek medical attention for other health-related complications.",How to Treat a Dog Bite1," The majority of dog bites will be minor wounds you can treat at home. If the bite barely broke the skin or the teeth dragged to form a shallow scratch, then you can treat the wound at home.This differs from a wound where the tissue is deeply punctured, torn, or joints/bones have been crushed. Always seek medical attention for these wounds, which are covered more in Method Two.;
, Spend several minutes washing the bite with plenty of soap and water at a comfortable temperature.This helps clean the wound of any germs around your wound or that came from the dog’s mouth.


Any soap is fine, but an antibacterial soap is best if you have some in your home.
The soap and water might sting the site of the bite, but it’s still a much better idea to wash the area thoroughly.

, Use a clean towel or gauze to apply pressure to the bite if it is still bleeding after washing it.The bleeding should stop or slow enough to bandage the wound within several minutes.


If the wound continues bleeding too much to bandage it after fifteen minutes of pressure, then you should seek medical attention., Antibiotic creams such as Neosporin or Bacitracin can also help prevent infections as the wound heals.Apply the cream to the wound as directed on the packaging.

, As soon as you apply the antibiotic ointment, bandage or dress the wound appropriately.Apply with enough pressure to help protect the injury, but do not apply with so much pressure as to affect circulation or lead to discomfort.

, You should change the bandage on the bite each time you soil it, such as when showering. Wash the bite again gently, reapply the antibiotic cream, and apply a fresh bandage.

, Tetanus is a potential infection that can stem from any dog bite that breaks the skin.Medical professionals recommend a tetanus booster after a dog bite if your last immunization was five or more years ago., Watch for signs of other infection as the bite heals. If you think the bite is becoming infected, then see a doctor immediately. Signs that an infection might be developing in the bite include:Worsening pain
Swelling
Redness or warmth around the bite
Fever
Pus-like discharge

, Rabies is another possible infection you can get from even a minor dog bite. Those bitten by dog’s often know the dog that bit them and can verify that the dog has previously received a rabies vaccination, in which case rabies is not a concern.If the dog’s vaccine status is uncertain—such as if the dog was a stray—the dog should be observed for fifteen days (if possible) to see if it develops signs of rabies. You should also seek professional medical assistance if you can’t verify the vaccination status of the dog.

, Even for minor bites, some health-related complications mean you should still seek medical attention. These other conditions include:Diabetes
Liver disease
Cancer
HIV
Medications that can weaken the immune system, such as those taken for autoimmune disorders.

Assess burn damage.,
Remove the burning agent.,
Remove any hot, charred, or smoldering material.,
Cool the skin.,
Cover the burn.,
Care for blisters.,
Prevent shock.,
Manage the pain.,
Follow up with your doctor.",How to Treat a Serious Burn1," Check to see if the burn is a first, second, or third-degree burn. If the burn was caused by chemicals, an electrical shock, or molten tar or plastic, understand that burn will require different first aid than a burn caused by a thermal source such as fire.First-degree burns only impact the top layer of skin. These burns do no blister. Though they may be painful, they often heal in under a week, and do not scar.
Second-degree burns extend beneath the top layer of the skin into the dermis. These burns usually blister, and cause pink, moist injuries that may heal with some scarring.
Third-degree burns extend all the way through the dermis. They may or may not have blisters, and often appear white, brown, bright red, or black. They may or may not peel.
When evaluating people with severe body burns, you have to assess the burn damage. This is accomplished by the rule of 9’s. This helps guide clinical decisions such as fluid resuscitation and pain control. Clinicians use this in severe traumatic third degree burns over a large surface area of the body.;
, No matter what type of burn a person is experiencing, the first step in treating it is to smother or remove the burning agent. This means putting out the fire, or otherwise removing any hot liquid, steam, chemicals, or electrical components from the person’s skin.If a person has contact with fire, get them out of the way of the fire source. If necessary, help them “stop, drop, and roll” to extinguish the flames.
Chemicals should be removed with care. Gloves and protection for the eyes, mouth, and nose should be worn while handling chemicals that may cause burning. Never put an alkali on an acid burn, and never put an acid on an alkali burn. Use copious amounts of water to dilute the alkali or acid/chemical burn.
Electrical components should be handled with care, as well. If possible, allow a professional to intervene in the situation. In most situations, it is unlikely that you will have to pull someone away from an active electrical component.

, Remove any clothes and other material from the burned area. If fabric is sticking, cut around it to expose as much of the burn as possible.Do not try to remove sticking fabric or embedded objects from the skin. Leave this to a trained medical professional so as to avoid further injury.
Remove all restrictive clothing such as jewelry and belts, and loosen ties, shirt cuffs, and collars. Burns can cause rapid swelling, and restriction may cause further injury.

, Cool the burned skin using cool water or a cool compress. Avoid applying ice or near-freezing water to the burned area, as this can constrict blood flow to the burn and worsen the injury.If possible, cool the burn by placing it under clean running water for up to 20 minutes at a time. If running water is not practical, the burn may be placed in a bowl or tub of cool water.
A cool compress may be used to treat first degree burns if a constant running water source is not available. You may find one in a first-aid kit, or make one using cool water and a clean towel. Hold it over the burn for no more than 20 minutes.

, Apply a protective covering to the burn such as a sterile, non-adhesive bandage or a clean cloth. Do not use an adhesive bandage or previously-used gauze.Avoid applying ointments or other treatments to the burnt area, as this may cause infection.
Wrap dry gauze or a burn dressing loosely around the burnt area. Do not apply too much pressure or constrict the burn with the dressing.

, Do not pop any blisters that may have resulted as a part of the burn. Wrap the blisters loosely in the same way as the rest of the burn, and keep them from any stress that may cause them to rupture.If a blister does pop, keep it wrapped in a sterile dressing. Do not apply an ointments or other treatments, as these may cause infections.

, Keep the burn victim in a position that helps prevent shock by laying the person down and elevating their legs and the burn area above the level of their heart, if possible. Use props or furniture to help the individual hold the pose, and cover them with a coat or blanket.Do not move the individual if they have injuries around the head and neck or spinal area unless you have been trained to do so by a reputable first-aid program. Moving them incorrectly with such injuries could result in permanent damage to the body or brain.
Shock is one of the more serious concerns of a large 2nd or 3rd degree burn and should be dealt with in a burn unit or ICU, or the burn victim may die.

, An over-the-counter pain medication such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage the pain for a first-degree burn. Take as recommended on the manufacturer’s packaging.If an over-the-counter medication does not work to alleviate the pain, contact your doctor for further recommendations.

, All burns should be seen by a doctor, even first-degree burns. Follow up with your doctor when you can get an appointment. Request expedited service if you or the burnt individual believe a tetanus booster is necessary, or if you notice symptoms like:Oozing
Swelling
Fever
Worsening redness
Increased pain

Verify that your burns are second-degree burns.,
Rinse the burned area of your skin under cool water until you no longer feel pain.,
Remove any jewelry and clothing from the burned area.,
Wash your hands thoroughly using mild soap and water.,
Gently use your hands or a soft cloth to clean the burn using mild soap and water.,
Pat the burned area dry using a piece of gauze or soft cloth.,
Inspect your burn to determine whether a bandage is needed.,
Apply cream, ointment, or a natural product to your burn that promotes healing.,
Wrap your burn loosely using gauze or a bandage.,
Apply gentle pressure to the wound if bleeding occurs.,
Apply a new, clean bandage when the bandage becomes wet or soiled for any reason.,
Consult with your healthcare provider to receive professional treatment and product recommendations.,
Ask your healthcare provider about the possibility of undergoing surgery.",How to Treat a Second–Degree Burn," Third-degree burns, which are far more serious, require immediate emergency medical treatment. The symptoms of second-degree burns are as follows:


Deep redness
Swollen skin
Blisters that may break open and look wet and shiny
Skin that is painful to the touch
Red, splotchy skin color
Burned area is white or discolored in an irregular pattern
Severe pain;
, Cool water helps lower the temperature of your skin and prevents the burn from becoming more serious. Alternately, you can place the burned area of your skin in a tub or basin of cool water, or apply cool compresses to the affected area.


Avoid using ice or freezing water to treat your burn, since this can lead to tissue damage.

, This will prevent jewelry or clothing from becoming too tight and difficult to remove if the burned area becomes swollen., This helps prevent bacteria from infecting your burn, especially if open blisters have formed.

, Keep in mind that some pieces of burned skin may come off at the time you wash your skin.

, This helps reduce pain and prevents the burned area from becoming irritated further.

, Burned skin or closed blisters may not require bandaging; however, broken blisters or burned skin at risk for becoming dirty or irritated by clothing may require a bandage.

, Purchase creams and ointments for burns from your local drugstore, or apply aloe vera, honey, or a mixture of turmeric powder and all-natural yogurt to the burn., This prevents extra pressure from being applied to the burned area.


Avoid taping bandages in a circle around a limb, as this can increase swelling.

, This will help reduce and stop bleeding., This lowers your risk for bacterial infection.


If the bandage becomes stuck to your burn, soak the affected area in warm water so the bandage can be more easily removed.

, Your doctor can recommend over-the-counter medicines or prescription medications that can help decrease pain and accelerate the healing of your burn.

, Surgery can help prevent infection, decrease inflammation, and remove damaged tissue. Surgery can also replace lost skin, improve blood flow to the burned area, and reduce scarring.

Recognize the effects of hydrofluoric acid.,
Distinguish the categories of burn.,
Remove all contaminated clothing immediately.,
Flush the burned area.,
Have another person call for medical assistance.,
Treat the wound after flushing it.,
Get treated.",How to Treat a Hydrofluoric Acid Burn1," Hydrofluoric acid (HF) contact with skin can cause severe chemical burns. Direct contact with HF can cause major damage to your skin tissue, as HF is a corrosive substance that burns. It can also penetrate the skin and cause even further damage under the skin.This can be even worse, depending on the concentration of the acid and the length of exposure.
No matter the concentration, however, the burns may cause a deeper penetration of the underlying skin tissue after a longer time of detection. Any increased time can allow for a burn to become more severe.;
, There are 3 categories of HF burns. A burn that is grade 1 appears with white burn mark and has surrounding painful redness along the skin.


A burn that is grade 2 appears with a white burn mark and surrounding painful redness, but also demonstrates blistering and edema, which is leakage of intra-cellular fluids outside of damaged cellular tissue.
A burn that is grade 3 appears in the same way as grade 2, with the addition of blistering, and necrosis, which is cell tissue death.
Cell tissue death is seen as discolored blue or black tissue around the burn. , If there is any part of your clothing that has been saturated with HF, remove it immediately from your body or any portion of your skin. This will prevent more acid from touching the skin, as well as stop continued exposure that may cause more serious burning.


Make sure that the clothing comes into contact with as little skin as possible as it is removed. Do not touch clothing directly with bare skin if you believe it has also been contaminated with HF.
Use gloves, masks, and gowns, if possible.

, If you come into contact with HF, flush the burned area under a safety shower or suitable hose. Orient the burned area so that water runs down and off your skin. Make sure that the water coming into contact with the affected area does not come into contact with any other part of your body.


This constant flow of cool water should not overly cold but cool enough to soothe the burn.
Continue flushing the area for fifteen or more minutes.

, HF burns are very serious and can lead to many systemic issues and even death. You need to get help as soon as possible because HF burns require expert medical attention regardless of how you feel or what you believe is necessary. Have someone else call for you while you deal with preventing continued exposure to the acid.


Seek medical attention as soon as possible from the time of exposure to reduce the time the acid can continue to linger and cause damage., You can do a few things after flushing your burn. Massage a generous amount of calcium gluconate gel into and around the burn. Keep applying gel for at least twenty minutes. This should be the first line of care if available after extensive rinsing with water.


You can also use hexafluorine, which is a chemical compound that has also been used extensively for HF burns. However, some studies have not found it to be any more effective in reducing electrolyte disturbances than proper rinsing with water.Magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids can also be used with some benefit if calcium gluconate is not available. Look for common antacid brands such as Mylanta., Seeking medical care from professionals will help assess long-term side effects of the burn. The goal of treatment is reduce the effects of HF burns while simultaneously controlling the pain from exposure. Prior to discharge, your doctor will assess your electrolyte balances with a blood test, test for any heart palpitations and arrhythmias, and review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to make sure it is normal.


Your doctor may continue with similar tests during follow-up to make sure that long-term symptoms do not develop after you have been discharged.
If exposure to HF is only on the fingers, you will likely be discharged with calcium gluconate gel and instructed to wear a latex glove after applying the gel. This will help to maximize the efficacy of the gel by increasing absorption. Your doctor should follow-up with you at least once after 24 hours from the time you are discharged. This follow-up may be in person or over the telephone, depending on the severity of your exposure and the doctor’s judgment.

Burns are categorized by degree, where a higher degree means a worse burn. A first degree burn is a superficial burn to the top layer of skin. The symptoms you experience from a first degree burn include:Damage to the top layer of skin
Dry, red, and painful skin
Skin blanching, or turning white, when you press it
These will heal within three to six days without scarring;
, If the water is hotter or you are exposed for a longer period of time, you may develop a second degree burn. This is considered a superficial partial-thickness burn. The symptoms include:Damage to the two layers of your skin, but only in a superficial capacity on the second layer
Redness and leaking fluid at the burn site
Blistering
Blanching of the affected area when pressed
Pain when touched lightly and with temperature changes
These take one to three weeks to heal and may scar or discolor, where it is darker or lighter than the surrounding skin

, A third degree burn happens when the water is extremely hot or you are exposed for longer periods of time. It is considered a deep partial-thickness burn. The symptoms of a third degree burn include:Damage to the two layers of your skin that penetrates deeper into, but not completely through, the second layer
Pain at the site of the burn when pressed hard (though they can be painless at the time of injury, as there may be nerve death or damage)
The skin will not blanch (turn white) when pressed
Blisters forming at the site of the burn
Charred, leathery appearance or peeling
Third degree burns require a visit to the hospital and often require surgical intervention or hospital treatment to recover if they are over 5 % of the body

, A fourth degree burn is the most severe burn you can have. This is a severe injury and requires immediate emergency assistance. The symptoms include:Damage completely through the two layers of your skin, often with damage to the underlying fat and muscle. With third and fourth degree burns, even the bone can be affected.
It isn't painful
Color change at the site of the burn - white, gray, or black
Dryness at the site of the burn
Requires surgery to be treated and likely hospitalization to recover

, No matter what degree a burn is, a burn can be considered a major burn if it covers the joints or is over the majority of your body. If you have any complications with your vital signs or cannot do normal activities because of the burn, it may be considered major.


A limb is equal to about 10% of an adult's body; 20% is an adult man's torso. If over 20% of the total body surface area burned, this is considered a major burn.
5% of body area (forearm area, half a leg, etc.) burned in total thickness ie: third or fourth degree, is a major burn.
Treat these kinds of burns the same as you would a third or fourth degree burn - seek immediate emergency treatment., Even though a burn may be minor, which is a first or second degree burn, it can still need medical attention if it meets certain criteria. If the burns wrap around the entire surrounding tissue of any or several of your fingers, you should seek medical attention as soon as you can. This can restrict the flow of blood to your fingers, which, in extreme cases, could lead to finger amputation if left untreated.You should also seek medical attention if the burn, mild or otherwise, covers your face or neck, a large area of your hands, groin, legs, feet, buttocks, or is above joints., If the burn is minor you can take care of the wound at home. The first step is to clean the burn. To do this remove any clothing that covers the burn and immerse in cold water. Running water over it can damage the skin and may increase the likelihood of scarring or complicating damage. Do not use hot water because it can irritate the burn.


Wash the burn with a mild soap.
Avoid using any disinfectants, such as hydrogen peroxide. These can slow healing.
If your clothes are stuck to your skin do not attempt to remove them yourself. Your burn is likely more severe than you think and you should seek emergency medical attention.Cut the clothing, except for that attached to the burn, and place cold packs/wrapped ice on the burn and the clothing for up to two minutes

, After you wash the burn immerse the burned area in cool water for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not use ice or running water because this can cause further damage. Next, wet a washcloth with cool water and apply it to your burn, but do not rub. Just lay the cloth over the area.


You can prepare the cloth by dampening it in tap water and refrigerating it until cooled.
Do not use butter on the wound. It will not help cool the burn off and can actually cause infection., In order to help prevent the burn from becoming infected, you need to take care of it after you cool it off. Apply an antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or bacitracin with a clean finger or a cotton ball. If the burn is an open wound use non-stick gauze instead because the fibers of a cotton ball may catch in an open wound. Next, cover the burn with a bandage that doesn't stick to the burn area, such as Telfa. Change the bandage one to two times a day and reapply the ointment.


Do not pop any blisters that form.
If the skin begins to itch while it heals avoid scratching it or it may become infected. Burned skin is highly sensitive to infection.
You can also apply ointments to help ease the itching such as aloe vera, cocoa butter, and mineral oil.

, Any minor burn you experience will likely cause pain. Once you cover the wound, raise the area of your burn above your heart. This will decrease any swelling and ease your pain. To help with any lingering pain, take over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin). Take these pills several times a day as instructed as long as the pain stays.


Recommended dosage for Acetaminophen is 650 mg every four to six hours, with a maximum daily dose of 3250 mg.
Recommended dosage for Ibuprofen is 400 to 800 mg every six hours, with a maximum daily dose of 3200 mg.
Make sure to read the dosage recommendations on the medication container, as dosing may vary with different types and brands.

, If you think you have a severe burn, which would be a third or fourth degree burn, you need to call for help immediately. These are too severe to treat at home and need to be treated by professionals.Call emergency services if the burn:Is deep and severe
Is more than a first degree burn and you haven’t had a tetanus shot in more than five years
Is bigger than 3 inches (7.6 cm) or encircles any body part
Shows signs of infection, such as increased redness or pain, areas that leak pus, or fever
Is on a person less than five years or more than 70 years old
Happens to someone who has difficulty fighting infection, such as those with HIV, those on immunosuppressive medications, those with diabetes, or those with liver disease

, If you are helping a loved one who has been burned, check for responsiveness after you call emergency services. If they are not responding or going into shock, tell emergency services so they know what to expect.


If the person is not breathing, focus on doing chest compressions until emergency services arrive., While you wait for help to arrive, take off any constrictive clothing and jewelry that are on or near the burn site. However, leave on any clothing or jewelry that might be stuck in the burn. This will pull off the skin at the site of the burn and cause further injury.


Place cold packs around any metal jewelry such as rings or hard to remove bracelets, as metal jewelry will conduct the heat of the burn up from the surrounding skin and back to the burn site.
You can cut loose clothing off around the area where it is stuck to the burn.
Keep yourself or the victim warm because severe burns can cause you to go into shock.Unlike with minor burns avoid soaking the burn in water as this may cause hypothermia. If the burn is on a moveable part of the body, elevate the area above the heart to help prevent or reduce swelling.Do not take any pain medication, pop blisters, scrape dead skin, or apply any ointment. This could interfere with your medical treatment., Once you get any problem clothing off of your burn, cover the burn with clean, non-stick bandages. This will keep it from getting infected. Make sure you don't use any material that may stick to the burn. Use non-stick gauze or a wet bandage.


If you think the bandage may get stuck because the burn is too severe, do nothing and wait for emergency services."

Prepare and submit your bid.,
Adjust your man-hour estimates as the work progresses.,
Collect information on your workers.,
Track your workers’ time.,
Send your client payroll reports at regular intervals.,
Use your records to prepare future estimates.",How to Calculate Man Hours," The first part of calculating the man-hours you will need to do a job is to split up the project into smaller components. Then estimate the amount of hours needed to complete each component. These components should be designated according to the type of labor involved. If you are building an apartment complex, you will need excavation, construction, electrical, plumbing, and so on. Make sure that every component of your project is included in the estimate.;
, This largely depends on the complexity of the tasks that need to be accomplished. You don’t need a foreman to do every job. Some simpler tasks can be done by assistants or apprentices. Figuring this out is harder for larger jobs that require a mix of labor to do tasks that range from simple to complex., Once you have determined your components and the types of labor each requires, estimate the total number of man-hours it would take your workers to complete a step from start to finish. Do not include breaks. This number should be the hours of dedicated labor it will take to finish a step.


If you are familiar with the type of work required in a step, you can draw from past projects to get time estimates. For example, if you know it took one worker ten hours to install four new windows, or 2.5 hours per window, your current project will likely be similar.
If a step in your project includes a type of labor you're not familiar with, you should do some research in preparing your estimate. Depending on the project, you may be able to get valuable information online or from another contractor. You can also hire a consultant familiar with the type of labor you need. This person can help you estimate the hours required in a certain step.
Factor in things like job difficulty when making your estimate. If the windows on your upcoming project are on the seventh story of a building, and your old project's windows were on the first story, increase your hours-per-window rate to reflect this difference.
Include estimates for time spent on administrative tasks that may be required by the contract.

, You may also include project hours for a foreman or manager, who will lead the team of workers and manage reporting details and timeline compliance. Some projects may require more than one supervisor or foreman, managing different components of the project. Other projects may require different levels of supervision. You may have foreman managing workers in different components of the project and an overall supervisor who manages all of the foremen.

, Your client will likely specify a time for completion of the project. Perhaps he will ask you to indicate in your bid how soon you can complete your work. You can use the steps and hours you have calculated to develop a project timeline. Determine which components can be completed simultaneously and which must be completed sequentially, where the input of one process depends upon the output of the previous process. If you know when each step of the project needs to be completed, you can divide the number of hours needed to complete a step by the number of eight-hour workdays in the time period. You may be able to extend or shorten the project timeline by adding or removing laborers. The more laborers you have, the faster you can complete a step.


Some projects may require more than 8 hour days or 40 hours week to meet schedule. They will require overtime which should be charged to the job
For example, if you have one month to lay the foundation of a new home, and you know the foundation requires 1000 hours of labor, divide 1000 by the number of eight-hour workdays in the month to calculate the number of laborers you need to hire to complete that step on time. (1000 project hours / 20 work days in the month = 50 hours per day; 50 hours per day / 8 hours per worker = 6.25 laborers needed.)Round the number of laborers up or down to a whole number, and adjust accordingly the number of workdays required.
Be realistic about the number of workers you can hire in a given time period. If you need seven electricians to complete wiring in a week, this may be unrealistic, depending on the availability of electricians in your area. You may need to extend your timeline to accommodate the availability of labor for your project.
If you plan to complete multiple steps at the same time, you'll need separate laborers to work on each step.

, Add the hours for each type of labor you need, so you have a total for each type. If you require just one type of labor, you can combine all of the project hours into one number. If you need multiple types of labor, your bid should specify the total hours for each type. You should include all labor costs including taxes and benefits. Some Federal contracts may require a minimum wage for each category of workers. Also, include any markup you plan to charge.


As an example, imagine you have been hired to install a new kitchen in a medium-sized home. You have divided your project into steps, each requiring plumbing, electrical, and general construction work. Your bid should reflect the total electrician man-hours, plumber man-hours, and general-laborer man-hours, as well as the pay rates for each type of labor.

, Because time estimates are really just guesses, you will need to update your estimates as your project goes along. You will probably bill your client based on the actual hours your team works, so you should provide your client updated hourly estimates as time passes. This helps prevent surprises for your client when billing time rolls around.


Include a ""fudge factor,"" which is an increase in estimated time due to unknown causes. The amount of fudge factor depends upon the complexity of the job, availability of labor, dependence upon outside agents, and the relationship of one process to another.
Most contractors make it clear that their bid is only an estimate, that actual hours will vary, and that clients will pay for actual hours worked as the job progresses. However, it is possible a client will want to pay you a lump sum based on your estimate and not pay for actual hours worked. Pay close attention to any contract language that would signal this kind of arrangement, as this requires very careful estimation on the part of the contractor.
If your client will pay you based on actual hours worked, remember that your bid served as an estimate, and that you should not charge for significantly more hours than you planned unless you can cite reasonable justification. If you run into problems and know you are going to go over your time estimates, keep the client informed in order to prevent miscommunication.
Have a written agreement that defines contingencies and out-of-scope work. Include the process for identifying and approving these changes, such as necessary approvals and documentation.

, Maintain accurate employee files for everyone working on your project. That will include payroll records and all legally required documents. If you are using engineers, electricians, plumbers, or other licensed workers, you will need to keep on file proof of their active certifications. This is required for most engineering and construction jobs whether or not they are government contracts. It is your responsibility to ensure everyone working for you is properly certified, including subcontractors.


You may pay people who are not your employees to do work on your project. These ""subcontractors"" work for you, the contractor, and you bill your client for their labor. Even though subcontractors are not actually your employees, you should gather their certification information and keep it on file. As the contractor, you are responsible for ensuring that anyone you hire to work on a project is qualified, unless otherwise specified in their contract.
Government contracts generally require additional employee and subcontractor information indicating compliance with federal law. This may include reporting on employees’ ethnicity and pay rates to ensure there is no discrimination taking place on the jobsite. If you have a government contract, read it carefully and follow all of the instructions for hiring and reporting in order to prevent difficulty in getting paid. , To submit accurate reports to your client, you need a reliable method of tracking how many hours your workers are on the job. You can use a time clock or a written time sheet, but these records should be verified to ensure they are accurate. Depending on your contract, you may be subject to periodic audits and may be required to prove that the hours you submit are justified.


One way to ensure the accuracy of time reporting is to establish supervisors over each employee or employee group. At the end of the week when an employee submits his or her timecard, the supervisor can review and sign the card, certifying the information is correct. This will prevent employees from submitting time cards for hours they did not work.
You may also consider using an electronic timecard system to track your employees’ work on the job. Be sure the system is controlled to prevent abuse. You'll want to be able to prove that's the case if your hourly reporting comes under question.
Government clients are required by law to gather all of this information before paying their contractors, because they are using taxpayer money to pay for the work. You can expect a heightened level of scrutiny when reporting time on government jobs. Carefully follow all reporting instructions detailed in your agreement.

, Your contract should specify how often you are to report man-hours to your client in order to receive payment. When you submit these reports, you will likely transfer information from your payroll and timekeeping documents to a dedicated report for your client comparing a number of hours you are charging to the estimates you submitted during bidding. If there are large variances between your actual hours and your estimates, you will need to provide explanations of these variances to your client.

, At the end of a project, your time-tracking information will be extremely valuable, as it gives you details about how long it took to complete specific jobs. You can use this data to create hourly estimates, such as the number of hours per square foot of laid tile or the down time after laying fresh cement. Use this information to improve your future bids and keep your business profitable.

Examine the bite.,
Apply pressure to the bite.,
See a doctor.,
Take any prescribed antibiotics.,
Change your bandages as suggested.",How to Treat a Dog Bite2," Severe bites will have one or more deep puncture wounds from the dog’s teeth that may or may not have severe tearing of the tissue that followed the puncture(s).Due to the crushing power of the jaw of certain dog breeds, you may also have signs of bone, ligament, or joint damage, such as painful movements or the inability to move the area around the bite. Additional signs that the bite will require medical attention rather than home care include:If the bite is deep enough to see fat, muscle, or bone
If the bite has jagged edges or ones that are far apart
If blood is spurting from the bite or the bleeding cannot be stopped within fifteen minutes of applying pressure
If the wound is larger than one or two centimeters
If the bite is on the head or neck

, Before heading to the doctor, use a clean towel to apply pressure to the bite to slow the bleeding as much as possible.Keep the bite covered with pressure applied until you see a doctor.

, Medical professionals will determine the best course of action for a severe bite, including how to stop the bleeding and whether or not the bite requires sutures. The doctor will irrigate the wound to thorough clean it (with a surgical disinfectant such as iodine) and perform any necessary debridement of the bite site, which is the removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue that can interfere with the healing of the healthy surrounding tissue.The doctor will also look into your shot record to determine if a tetanus booster is necessary.
If the doctor suspects bone damage based on your bite, you will likely be x-rayed to determine the proper treatment as well.Tell your doctor at this time whether or not you know if the dog that bit you has received a rabies vaccination. If a doctor believes you are at risk for rabies, she will treat you with a course of multiple rabies shots., If you’ve come in with signs of infection or the doctor determines that you’re at a high risk of infection for the bite, he will likely prescribe a course of antibiotics.The most commonly used antibiotic is amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin). It is a pill that is generally prescribed for three to five days. The most common side effect is GI upset.

, Your doctor will also direct you how often to change the dressing of the wound once he or she has treated it.You will probably be instructed to change the bandages once or twice a day.

Call emergency services.,
Protect the burn.,

Get to a hospital.",How to Treat a Serious Burn2," First-aid can be administered to help third-degree burns while waiting for medical attention, but such severe burns always require treatment by a medical professional. Call emergency services, such as 9-1-1 in the US, and let them know a severe burn needs treatment.Be prepared to tell the dispatcher your location, what happened to cause the burn, and about the severity of the burn.
Request an ambulance be sent immediately. It is not advisable for untrained individuals to transport someone suffering from a severe burn unless absolutely necessary.

, Loosely cover the burn with a sterile, non-stick bandage such as gauze or a burn dressing. If the individual has sustained a large burn, a clean, lint-free sheet or other non-linting fabric may be used.Use a sterile dressing to separate burned fingers and toes in addition to any other dressings being applied to the burn.
Do not soak or cool the burn prior to dressing it, and do not use any ointments or topical treatments on the burn. These may lead to infection.
Do not remove any clothing or other material stuck to the burn area.

, Lay the person down flat and elevate the legs slightly and the burned area to above the level of the heart, if possible. Use props to help them keep this position without exerting great effort. Do not move the person if they have sustained additional injury to their head, neck, or spine.Cover the person with a blanket or jacket once they are in position.
Monitor the person’s heart rate either on their wrist or on their neck, if possible, and watch for a rising and falling chest to indicate breathing. Do this until emergency help arrives.

, Emergency services should bring the burn victim to a local hospital. There, doctors can treat the burn and additional injuries, as well as provide fluids and oxygen as necessary.Once the individual has been treated, ask the doctor about what is expected for aftercare, as well as follow-up visits. Try asking, 'What kind of aftercare will be required to make sure the burn heals properly? When will the burn need to be seen by a doctor again?""
Stick to the doctor’s prescribed aftercare routine and medicines as precisely as possible. Keep all follow-up appointments during recovery.

Care for a chemical burn.,
Manage an electrical burn.,
Deal with a plastic burn.",How to Treat a Serious Burn3," Chemical burns are generally best cared for by removing the victim from the contaminated area and removing contaminated clothing. From there, dilute the chemical on the skin by washing it consistently with fresh, running water. Wash the affected area for at least 20 minutes.Chemical burns can be caused by a number of products, including household cleaners such as drain cleaners which contain sulphuric acid, refrigerant which contains hydrofluoric acid, and bleach.If available, use a chemical shower or eye rinse station to rinse the burn. Use copious amounts of water to dilute the chemical burn.
Even if the burn is small or isolated, contact a doctor immediately to assess whether the victim should come in for care and to discuss treatment.

, Unplug the source of the electrical shock if possible, or stand on a rubber mat in a dry area and use a dry wooden object to push the person away from the electrical source. Once contact with the electrical source has been broken, check for a heartbeat and see if the individual responds to talk or touch.After the individual has been safely removed from the electrical source, call emergency services immediately. Major electrical burns may come with other complications that need immediate medical treatment.
Even minor electrical burns should be examined by a doctor as soon as possible.
Never directly touch a live electrical source or a person caught in such a source yourself.

, If a burn results from molten plastic or tar, immediately cool the plastic or tar by running it under cool water. Do not peel off the plastic or tar. Instead, use mineral oil to see if you can remove it. Then, treat the burned skin by washing it with cool water and loosely bandaging it in a clean dressing.Contact your doctor if you cannot gently remove the plastic or tar from your skin, or if you experience excess pain from the burn.
Do not dress the exposed burn with any ointments, as these may cause infection.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Flush the eyes with water.,
Seek medical attention.,
Apply an ice pack.,
Get treated by an eye doctor.,
Have tests done.",How to Treat a Hydrofluoric Acid Burn2," If your eyes are exposed to HF, they will experience rapid symptoms. If your eyes only have mild exposure, expect rapid irritation and possibly pain. This may be followed by a clouding of the cornea of the eye, which may be reversible.


If severe exposure occurs, expect a rapid onset of pain and damage to the cornea. The cornea may degrade and the eye may swell. Clouding of the eye may become permanent as well as any other visual defects in the eye. , As soon as your eyes are exposed to HF, flush them with large amounts of cool, running water for at least thirty minutes. This will flush out the acid and help prevent continued damage to the eyes. If only one eye has been contaminated, be sure to not wash acid into the other eye. Keep your eyelids apart and away from the eyeballs while washing.


Tilt your head to the side so that water runs off your eye from the side closest to your nose towards your temples. This will prevent the contaminated water from rinsing back into your eye, nose, mouth, or other vital areas on the face. , Once you wash your eyes out, seek medical attention immediately. Ideally, you should see an eye specialist so he or she will know the best way to treat you. This cannot be reiterated enough. HF is a highly reactive substance and can cause severe damage, visual defects, and blindness.

, On your way to the emergency room, you should apply an ice pack to your eyes. Applying an ice pack to the affected area may lessen the effects of the HF, while also helping to alleviate the painful symptoms., Once you get to the emergency room or eye doctor, he or she will assess the damage in order to limit the long-term effects to your eyes. You will most likely continue to receive flushing of the eye, as well as topical tetracaine ointment and a 1% calcium gluconate flush.


The goal of immediate treatment is to reduce your pain, neutralize the effects of burns, and then to assess and come up with a treatment plan based on the outcome.

, Prior to discharge, your doctor will assess your electrolyte balances with a blood test, test for any heart palpitations and arrhythmias, and review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to make sure it is normal.


Your doctor may continue with similar tests during any follow-up to make sure that long-term symptoms do not develop after you have been discharged. Just like with a skin burn, your doctor should follow-up with you at least once after 24 hours from the time you are discharged, which can be over the phone or in person depending on the severity of your case."

Recognize the symptoms.,
Immediately remove the person from the HF source.,
Seek medical attention immediately.,
Get treatment at the hospital.",How to Treat a Hydrofluoric Acid Burn3," The symptoms for inhalation of HF can be complication because the symptoms for mild and severe inhalation will overlap. The symptoms for mild exposure may be include irritation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat, coughing, burns on the passageways, and narrowing of airways, which will cause difficulty breathing.


Symptoms for severe exposure include all of the above as well as an immediate narrowing of the airways, along with pulmonary edema, which is a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Lung collapse can also occur., You will likely not be able to check yourself for inhalation of HF because of the symptoms. However, if you come upon someone who has or might have inhaled HF, check the affected person’s vital signs.


Check for a pulse and respiratory breathing on him and make sure his airway is open so that he can breathe.
Continue to monitor the individual for any observable symptoms and do your best to alleviate those symptoms as professional medical attention is obtained.
If the person looks as though they are having a hard time breathing, administer oxygen if available.
Artificial respiration such as CPR is necessary and should be administered by trained professionals if breathing has stopped. , Inhalation exposure is rapidly lethal, which means you need to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Inhalation of HF can cause serious damage and treatment should be done in a medical setting because there is little to no effective treatment outside of a clinical setting.


While there is a lot of literature and research available about HF exposure to the skin, inhalation exposure has had relatively little research completed. The process of treating HF inhalation injury is highly complex, and more experimental research is still needed to learn proper care techniques., If inhalation HF is suspected, time is of the essence and medical attention must begin as soon as possible.Your doctor may do imaging scans and spirometry to assess any damage or decreased functioning of your respiratory system.


Spirometry aims to determine your ability to utilize your expected lung capacity and will involve blowing into a tube to measure your effective lung capacity. You will be tested on your ability to inhale, exhale, and the rate at which you can achieve these actions.
Just as with other HF exposure, your doctor will take a blood test to check your electrolyte balances, look for any arrhythmias or heart palpitations, and will review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to check for any abnormalities. Your doctor will also follow up within 24 hours of discharge by phone or in person, depending on your case."
"
Recognize symptoms of ingestion.,
Drink a lot of water.,
Seek medical attention immediately.,
Neutralize the acid.,
Get additional tests.",How to Treat a Hydrofluoric Acid Burn4," Ingestion can lead to many symptoms, and it can be complicated since symptoms based on systemic exposure cannot be ruled out. Exposure through ingestion can lead to nausea, vomiting, burns to the mouth and airways, and abdominal pain. You may also experience necrosis of areas of the stomach and digestive tract, which can cause severe pain due to localized tissue death.


You may also suffer gastric bleeding, which is accompanied by an inflammation of the stomach.
Pancreatitis can also be a symptom, which is an inflammation of pancreas that results from internal digestive tract exposure to HF., If you ingested HF, you need to drink a large quantity of water right away. This will help dilute the acid in your system and ease the severity of the damage. Do not induce vomiting. You can also drink some milk. If exposed person is alert, give them 4-8 ounces of milk or water.


Give no more than 4 ounces of either liquid to a child.
Be very careful with this kind of exposure. Death has occurred within 90 minutes of ingestion of HF contained in rust remover., Ingestional exposure is life threatening and can cause a lot of permanent damage to organs. Always seek immediate medical attention as soon as you suspect HF exposure. You will likely be started on a treatment regime that will help neutralize the acid, even if you have done it yourself on the way to emergency care.


You will be carefully monitored for increased effects of the burn over time, as HF burns can damage your body on a varying time scale depending on the concentration and exposure level.

, After drinking milk or water and calling for help, it is necessary to attempt to bind certain substances in HF with a neutralizing substance. Take some Tums, which are chewable calcium tablets that can help during HF ingestion. The calcium can help bind the HF in your system.


If you don't have Tums, try milk of magnesia, Maalox, or other liquid antacid. Drink 4 to 8 ounces of these liquids to help.
Don't overdo it with the liquids by trying multiple methods. You don't want to induce vomiting. Vomiting can cause the acid to further damage unexposed areas that are undamaged.

, Your doctor will perform additional blood tests to assess any large decreases in calcium due to binding with the ingested HF. This can lead to cardiac problems, including cardiac arrest. A urinalysis will also be done in order to assess your fluid levels. This will help to guide fluid management and help with replenishing of any depleted electrolytes.


Your doctor will run the same test as with other forms of exposure, which check for electrolyte balance, heart complications, and other lasting issues."

You want to make sure they have current vaccinations and do not have other serious medical conditions such as hepatitis. This can help your figure out if you should see a doctor and what type of treatment is the best for you.


If you can’t get the medical history of the person who bit you, administer first aid and then see your doctor.
The two diseases of highest concern are hepatitis B and tetanus. Though they don’t occur with every bite, hepatitis and tetanus can develop, especially with infected bites.Transmission of HIV or hepatitis B during a bite incident is not likely but it can happen.If the biter is unknown, testing for HIV can provide peace of mind for the person who was bitten.;
, As soon as you experience a human bite wound, inspect the site where of the bite mark. Evaluate the severity of the wound and try to determine the best course of treatment.Remember that all human bites are serious.Human bites can range from everything from deep flesh bites from a fight or other situation, to something like a tooth scraping on your fingers or knuckles.If a human bite breaks your skin, you’ll need to see a doctor and get medical care in addition to administering first aid., If your wound is bleeding, apply pressure with a clean and dry cloth or bandage. Don’t administer any other first aid until you get control of any bleeding so that you don’t lose too much blood.You can lie down on a rug or bed if the bleeding is severe to help prevent you from losing body heat and going into shock.If you bleed through a bandage or cloth, don’t remove it to apply another. Simply place the new bandage on top of the wound until it stops bleeding.If there is anything in the wound, such as tooth fragments, don’t apply too much pressure or attempt to remove the object., Once you’ve got any bleeding stopped, wash the wound with soap and water. This can help remove any bacteria and may minimize the risk for infection.You don’t need to purchase any special soap; any soap will help to remove bacteria.Make sure to wash and dry the wound thoroughly, even if it is painful.Wash the wound until there is no visible soap or until any debris such as dirt is washed away.You may also use povidone iodine as an antibacterial treatment instead of soap and water.You can apply the iodine either directly to the wound or with a bandage.Do not remove any embedded debris such as tooth particles because this could spread infection., Applying an antibiotic ointment or cream can help prevent infection. It may also help to reduce swelling and pain and enhance the healing.You can use anti-biotic ointments such as neomycin, polymyxin B, bacitracin to prevent infection.These are available at most drug and grocery stores and their online retail sites.

, Apply a new bandage that is clean or sterile and dry once the wound is not bleeding and disinfected. This may limit exposure to bacteria and help prevent infection., If your bite is not very large and/or you decide to not seek medical treatment, it’s important to watch the wound for signs of infection. This can help prevent serious medical problems including sepsis.If your wound is red, hot to the touch, and very painful this is a sign of infection.Other symptoms of infection are fever and chills.If you experience any of these symptoms, it’s important to consult a medical professional so that you don’t develop a severe infection or other serious medical condition., If the bite broke the skin or doesn’t heal with first aid, see your doctor as soon as possible. You may require more in-depth treatment than what you can do at home, which can minimize your risk for infection or nerve damage.It’s important to see your doctor if a human bite breaks your skin, as it can very easily become infected.You should seek treatment for a broken skin wound within 24 hours.If your wound doesn’t stop bleeding or the bite has removed significant tissue, seek help at an emergency room.If you have any concerns even about the smallest bite or scrape from a human mouth, talk to your doctor.Tell your doctor how you got the bite. This might help him with your treatment or getting help if it involved violence.Your doctor will measure the wound and take notes on presentation including location or if you appear to have nerve or tendon damage.Depending on the severity of the bite, your doctor may order blood tests or X-rays., If there are any foreign objects in your bite wound, such as teeth, your doctor will remove them. This can help minimize your risk of infection and may relieve any pain you have., If you have a significant bite mark on your face, your doctor should enlist the help of a plastic surgeon to stitch the wound so it will heal properly, with minimal scarring.


It’s not uncommon for stitches to itch. If this is the case, you can use a light layer of antibiotic ointment to relieve itching and help prevent infection., Your doctor may prescribe one of several different antibiotics for a human bite wound. These can minimize your risk of developing an infection.


Your doctor may prescribe one of the following antibiotics to combat infection: cephalosporin, penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, or aminoglycosides.Antibiotic treatment usually lasts between three to five days.If there is an infection, it may be necessary to follow up with a longer course of treatment, up to six weeks., If you haven’t had a tetanus shot within five years, your doctor may prescribe a booster shot. This can help prevent the infection that causes tetanus, or lockjaw.Make sure to tell your doctor the date of your last tetanus shot or if you’ve never had one. Tetanus is a potentially fatal infection.If you know the medical history of the person who bit you, a tetanus shot may not be necessary., If your biter’s medical history is unknown to you, your doctor may test for the transmission of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B at regular intervals. This can not only identify possible infection, but also put your mind at ease.It is very unlikely you will contract any disease such as HIV, hepatitis B, or herpes from a human bite., It’s normal to have pain for a few days following the a bite wound. Use either over the counter pain relievers or a prescription pain medication to help alleviate pain and some swelling.


Take over the counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Ibuprofen may also help alleviate some of the swelling associate with the surgery.
Your doctor may prescribe a pain medication if over the counter pain relief doesn’t work for you., If you had an extremely severe bite that resulted in the loss of tissue, your doctor may suggest plastic surgery. This can repair your skin to its earlier state with little scarring.

Clean the bitten area and bite very thoroughly with water and soap.,
Use a disinfectant like povidone-iodine if you have any disinfectant on hand.,
Wash any area of the body that was exposed to the saliva of the infected animal.,
Take the bitten person to the hospital immediately after cleaning the wound.",How to Treat a Human Suspected of Having Rabies1," Once bitten, you should clean the wound thoroughly with a lot of soap and water as soon as possible. Washing the bite right away will lower the chance of infection. Rabies is passed through the saliva of an infected animal, and if you are bitten by such an animal, the virus could enter your body through the bite.Rinse the bite with clean water and apply several applications of soap to the wound. Rinsing the bite will lower your chances of actually becoming infected because you will rinse out the virus before it has a chance to move any further into your body.;
, Pour or dab some disinfectant onto the wound. The disinfectant will work to kill off the virus before it can infect the person who has been bitten.

, If the animal's saliva touched any other part of the person’s body who got bit, it is very important to wash that area with soap and water.Most importantly, wash the eyes, nose, and mouth if they came into contact with the animal’s saliva, as in some cases, the virus can pass through the mucus membrane of a person’s eye, nose, or mouth.

, After you have thoroughly rinsed the bite, take the person to the hospital right away. Once there, tell the nurse and doctor exactly what happened so that proper treatment can begin right away.

Find the hours worked by part-time employees.,
Compute the number of hours worked by full-time employees per period.,
Combine the hours worked by full-time and part-time employees.,
Divide the total hours worked by the number of full-time hours.",How to Calculate FTE1," Use accounting records to identify hours worked by part-time employees. This is applicable for companies that employ both full-time and part-time workers.Multiply the total weekly hours by the number of weeks each part-time employee has worked. Example:

1 Part-time Employee worked 15 hours every week for 30 weeks: 1 x 15 x 30 = 450 hours
2 Part-time Employees worked 20 hours for 40 weeks each: 2 x 20 x 40 = 1600 hours


Add the results together to obtain their total hours.


Example: 450 + 1600 = 2,050 part-time hours

;
, A full-time employee is someone who works a maximum of 40 hours (30 hours minimum) every week for over 120 days every year.Multiply the number of workers by 40 (8 hours a day x 5 days a week).


Example: 6 full time workers: 6 x 40 = 240 hours


Multiply the result by 52 (weeks in a year).


Example: 240 x 52 = 12,480 full-time hours



, This is the total number of hours worked by all the employees.Example: 12,480 (full-time) + 1600 (part-time) = 14,080 total hours

, This will determine the FTE of the company for a particular period.Holiday hours and other paid leave (sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, etc.) are already accounted for as part of the hours worked. So you don’t need to make any special calculations for these hours.
Divide the total hours by 2,080. This number is a fixed number that is arrived at by the following equation: 8 hours a day x 5 days a week x 52 weeks a year. This final step will help you to calculate your yearly FTE.Example: 14,080 total hours ÷2080 = 6.769 FTEs


Divide the total hours by 173.33 to find the FTE per month.


Example: 4,000 hours for February ÷173.33 = 23.07 FTEs


Divide the total hours by 8 to obtain FTE per day.


Example: 80 daily hours ÷ 8 = 10 FTEs

No matter how many people or steps are involved, make sure to stay focused on the final outcome. The ability to keep one’s eye on the prize is a hallmark of successful project managers.By focusing on the big picture, you keep your team focused on a shared goal, rather than individual whims or interests. For example, if the goal is opening a new retail location downtown, the team can stay focused on that. If a team member suggests that they'd actually be interested in a series of pop-ups at the mall, you can keep the team on track by reminding people that you've already established a clear goal.
Make the goal clear. Communicate it verbally (as in a meeting) and in writing (as in an email or memo). This way, team members can always look back at the stated goal for reference.;
, Every project has certain things that are the most important or most impactful for success. Do these things first. If you don’t prioritize the most important parts of the project, you can get bogged down in small details or distractions.As the project manager, your tasks might involve checking on team members' progress or following up on meetings. Remember that your team may be waiting for you to approve certain decisions or sign off on things before they can move forward.
One way to do this is by completing all important tasks first thing each morning. Don’t move on to the rest of your workday until they are done.
You might need to turn off email notifications or your phone to prevent getting distracted by external alerts.
Once you’re done with your high priority items, take a quick break and move onto things lower on your list.

, As the project manager, it’s your responsibility to keep track of all the moving parts. If there is something that you see as a potential obstacle or speed bump, take the steps to deal with that before it slows down the entire project.Remember that “a stitch in time saves nine.” For example, if your computer system hasn’t been updated in a while, it may be tempting to keep the system working as it is. Updating the system and training employees on new technology may take up time and slow things down initially. However, the time spent transitioning may turn out to be well spent when it actually makes the office more efficient and productive once implemented.
Ask your team members if there are things you haven’t noticed that could improve efficiency.

, Being a manager is all about communication. Every step of the way, make sure that the people on your team understand what is expected of them, and what the timeline is.Use a variety of methods for communication. Speak to people in person, use bulletin boards, send individual and group emails.
Always seek to understand as well as to be understood. This means that you need to ask questions and listen, which are important aspects of effective communication.

, This may be difficult if you’re not naturally extroverted. However, managing people and projects require that you be able to communicate and make people feel engaged in the project. The best way to do this is to demonstrate your appreciation of them and their contributions. You can do this by:Smiling and making eye contact with people you’re working with
Asking team members how their work is going and how you can be of assistance
Creating opportunities for discussion and group problem solving
Appearing accessible. Don’t spend all day locked inside your office out of sight.

, A large project can be daunting to even the most experienced project manager. Make sure you “lead from the front.” This means putting yourself in a position to take risks, make mistakes, and figure out decisions.If you’re always asking others to stick their necks out and take personal risks, they may lose trust in you as a leader.
Remember that it’s okay to mess up. If you make a mistake or a poor decision, let others know that you take responsibility, and apologize if appropriate.

, Many people think that charisma is something people are born with, not something that can be learned. However, there are many ways to cultivate and demonstrate charisma. People are drawn to charismatic leaders and usually find them pleasurable to work for.Show your emotions. Charismatic people let others know when they’re pleased, upset, excited, or nervous. You may think you need to hide how you’re feeling in order to appear professional. However, there’s a happy medium that charismatic people know how to strike.
Show your interest in others as well as the things that are interesting about you. Don’t be afraid to tell an interesting story about yourself if it will help people engage with you.
Show your smarts. Don’t try to hide your own intelligence or skills. They’re part of what has gotten you to where you are.
Be detail oriented when dealing with other people. Notice small things about your interactions, such as body language, facial expressions and language.

, Other people on your team may lose faith in the project at times. They may feel overwhelmed or unsure of the eventual outcome. As the manager, maintain an optimistic attitude so that everyone knows you are confident about meeting the final goal.Employ a “can do” attitude. If someone on your team is floundering, step in to support their efforts.
Be willing to make adjustments to the plan if things seem to not be working.

, As a project manager, you must appreciate the value of the team. Even if everyone involved is working individually on disparate aspects of the project, it’s your responsibility to make sure people understand how the parts fit together and are dependent on one another.You can hold project meetings or get togethers to help team members see how their work fits together and get to know others on the team.
Remember that every role is important. Don’t treat some team members as though their contributions are more important than others’.

, You can’t do it all alone. You may have many skills that have brought you to the point of being the project manager; however, you need to make sure that the rest of your team has ample responsibility as well.Assign tasks based on people’s strengths. There’s no reason to give people jobs they aren’t prepared for.
If you’re unsure about someone’s capacity to carry out a role, give them a buddy or a team. Check in on them periodically to see how they’re doing.

, This stifles creativity and smothers motivation. Keep a pulse on the progress of the various project functions at timed intervals that are reasonable and allow team members the freedom to work productively.

, Every project has some risks attached to it. These might be financial risks to the company, or other kinds of risks. At the outset of any project, make a list of things that seem like they could be risks and keep that list handy.Risks may be very concrete, such as, “We’re paying for a larger workspace, but we might not get enough orders to make it worth the increase in rent.”
Risks may also have to do with personnel, such as, “We hired a new department head, but he’s very young and inexperienced in this field.”
There may be personal risks to you, such as, “If I don’t meet the quota set by the board, I could lose my position.”

, Some projects or companies will require a risk analysis before a project begins. This can be a great tool for helping you as the manager know which risks make sense to take and how risk can be avoided or lessened.You may be able to perform a risk analysis yourself, or there may be someone at your company whose job it is to do that.

, It’s great to make a list of risks at the outset of a project. However, as the project evolves, the risks will likely change. New ones will appear and others may dissolve. Keep your eyes open for potential risks at all times.You can add new risks to your original list and cross out ones that are no longer present.
Ask your team members if they’ve noticed anything along the way that may pose a new risk.

, No matter how much you try to plan, there will always be surprises and things you can’t prepare for. However, you can do your best to make sure that you’ll be ready for a curveball, should one come your way.For example, make sure there’s extra money in any budget for contingencies. You may come across unexpected costs and you want to be able to cover them easily.
Make sure you’ve got ample personnel. If someone gets sick or has to leave the project, you don’t want to feel severely understaffed.
Back up all files and relevant information.
Run plans by upper management to make sure there aren’t things you’ve overlooked or important factors you’re unaware of.

, Once you’ve identified a risk, take action. You may not be able to completely solve the problem or make the risk go away, but you can probably find a way to minimize the risk or mitigate whatever fallout might occur.If you notice that a person on your team is a liability for any reason, keep an eye on them and make sure they have the support and oversight they need to pose as little risk to the project as possible.
If the project is risky due to its scope and timeline, ask for an extension or talk to upper management about what a more realistic goal might be.
If there are risks to people’s personal safety, address them immediately. No one should be working in a situation that is dangerous to their physical or mental health.

Have the bite site washed with disinfectant.,
Understand that the doctor will assess the bite and dress the wound.,
Get laboratory tests done to determine whether or not the rabies virus is present.,
Be prepared to get a tetanus shot.,
Take antibiotics.,
Be ready for a series of anti-rabies vaccines if the rabies virus is present.,
Know that there will be some tenderness where the vaccine gets injected.",How to Treat a Human Suspected of Having Rabies2," When the bitten person gets to the hospital, the bite will be washed again. The nurse will first wash the bite with soap and water, and will then apply a disinfectant to the site.

, The doctor will inspect the wound to ensure that it is clean and that there are no signs of bone or tissue damage. A loose dressing will be applied on top of the wound to prevent any microbes from entering the bite.


The wound should not be stitched because this increases the chance of exposing the nerve endings to the virus therefore increasing the chances of being infected.

, The doctor will order laboratory tests to be done to the bitten person. These tests will help to determine whether the person is infected with the rabies virus. The laboratory tests will be done on the skin and saliva of the patient where a specimen is taken to the laboratory for analysis.The doctor will discuss the person’s history to determine the level of contact the person had with the infected animal. This will help in determining the chances of infection and the need for treatment.

, Depending on when he or she had her last tetanus shot, the bitten person may be given a tetanus shot. This, of course, is to prevent tetany, another issue that can occur from being bitten by an animal.


Tetanus injections are given on first contact, at 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months, 1 year and after 13-18 years.

, To keep infection from occurring, the bitten person will be given antibiotics. The most common antibiotic for the prophylaxis treatment of rabies is amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin).The augmentin is generally recommended as 1G taken twice a day for 14 days.

, The bitten person will be given an anti-rabies vaccine called human rabies immune globulin. This shot is injected into the hip and site of the bite for a rapid protection against the rabies infection. The immunoglobulin acts by producing antibodies specifically made to neutralize the virus and stop it from spreading.These injections are usually given on initial contact with the rabies virus, third day, seventh day, fourteenth day and 28th day. After the shot in the hip and bite site on the first day, the rest of the shots will be injected into the arm.
If the person has already had a rabies vaccine, the person will be given two doses. The first dose will be give on the day the person was bit and then the second dose will be given three to seven days later.

, The bitten person may experience some tenderness, swelling, pain and redness at the injection site. These symptoms usually clear on their own and will generally not last more than 24 hours.

"
"
Check to see if the bitten person has a fever.,
Look for any drooling.,
Monitor any tingling sensation that occurs.,
Look out for muscle contractions.,
Pay attention to signs of pain at the place where the person was bitten.",How to Treat a Human Suspected of Having Rabies3," This is where the bitten person will have a raised temperature above 37.6 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). When your body senses a foreign invader, it creates a fever to burn the invading bacteria or virus out. Use a thermometer to see what the person's temperature is. If it is elevated above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, it means the person has a fever.

, This is where the bitten person produces increased amounts of saliva. The saliva is caused by spasms that affect the muscles in your throat. The person will have pain when swallowing and therefore saliva will gather in his or her mouth. If you notice strings of drool (saliva) coming out of the person's mouth, you should consider this a red flag and get them to a hospital., The tingling sensation could also be described like ‘pins and needles’, particularly in the spot where the bite occurred. This happens because the virus begins affecting the person’s nerves and causing damage to them. If the bitten person complains of feeling like there are needles pricking his or her skin, consider taking him or her to the hospital.

, A muscle contraction occurs when a person’s muscle moves but you didn’t mean for it to actually move. When muscles contract, they become very tight and do not relax. This can happen to just one part of the body, or it can happen in several parts of the body at once.Muscle contractions are another red flag that means you need to get that person to a hospital.

, Injuries hurt and getting bitten is no different. The difference instead is that the nerves around the bite spot could be reacting to the virus, which is causing them pain. If the person begins to complain of pain in the area, monitor it for awhile. If the pain gets worse rather than getting better, go to the hospital.

"

Monitor any hydrophobia that appears.,
Watch for convulsions.,
Pay attention to any numbness that the person complains of.,
Monitor dysphagia as is occurs.,
Note hallucinations that occur.,
Understand that when specific symptoms of the rabies virus begin to show, there is a lower chance of survival.,
Take the bitten person to the hospital.,
Be aware that the doctor will give the person supportive therapy to make the person as comfortable as possible.,
Massage the areas where the muscle spasms occur.",How to Treat a Human Suspected of Having Rabies4," Hydrophobia is the fear of water. This condition occurs when a bitten person enters into the late stage of rabies infection. He or she will go into a panic or have spasms at the sight, touch, or sound of water.Aerophobia (fear of breezes) and photophobia (fear of bright lights) have also been known to occur in people who have been infected with rabies., Convulsions start when the virus enters the bloodstream and gains access to the brain. Once in the brain, it starts to disrupt the brain’s functioning. This causes the bitten person to have uncontrolled jerky movements of the whole body or parts of the body.The person may develop aggression that can also lead to aggressive, jerky movements. If this happens, take measures to keep yourself clear of their saliva and rush them to a hospital.

, When the virus begins affecting the nerves, it will make some parts of the body begin to lose sensation. This loss makes the bitten person feel numb in some parts of the body. The feeling is like if you had had anesthesia injected into a part of your body—you know that part of the body is there but you can't feel it.

, Dysphagia means the person is having difficulty swallowing. The bitten person will have difficulty swallowing because the virus will cause the muscles in the throat to begin spasming. This can also lead to an increased amount of saliva, as described in the previous step.The person may also begin foaming at the mouth.

, The virus can make the bitten person have sensory impressions of things that are not present. This includes smelling things that are not there or seeing things that are not there. This is caused by the effect virus affecting the normal functioning of the brain.


The person might begin talking to people that you can't see, or reacting to things that you aren't experiencing.

, Unfortunately, when the symptoms of this condition are apparent, treatment will not help, and there is pretty much nothing that can be done to alter the course of the illness. These late stage symptoms will generally last for two to ten days, and will almost always result in death.There have been only two reported cases of survival after administering antiviral therapy in this late stage., If you think a person may have been bitten and then not treated right away, or if the person is exhibiting the symptoms listed in this section, you must get him or her to the hospital immediately.

, When there is a delay in treatment and the patient develops the symptoms, supportive treatment is usually given. The patient will be given powerful painkillers, tranquilizers and sedatives to help them be as comfortable as they can be., The areas of the body that have muscle spasms should be massaged and stretched to help in reducing the pain. This will be done by trained nurses.

Locate an online FTE calculator.,
Locate your worker data.,
Input your data.,
Use this FTE calculation as an estimate only.",How to Calculate FTE2," These online tools allow you to simply enter in the number of full-time employees you have and the hours worked every week by part-time employees. Then the online tool will do the calculating for you to give you an estimated FTE value. Reputable calculators can be found at https://www.healthcare.gov/shop-calculators-fte/ and http://www.healthlawguideforbusiness.org/fte-calculator.

, You will need both your total number of full-time employees and the hours worked by your part-time employees. This information should be readily available in your accounting records. Remember that full-time employees are those who work more than 30 hours per week., Enter your employee data into the calculator in the relevant fields. Be sure to check whether the hours worked are entered on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis and edit your data appropriately. Double-check your information before pressing ""calculate"" to make sure that it is correct.

, Keep in mind that the calculation you get from the FTE calculator tool is just an estimate. You can use this number for roughly estimating FTE values for yourself for guidance or educational purposes. But these calculations should never be used as a replacement for legal or tax advice from a professional in the field. And when you need a 100% accurate calculation for business reasons, you’ll need to use a different method."

Pay a tax professional to calculate your company’s FTE for you.,
Request help from a legal professional.,
Use FTE to calculate business metrics.,
Calculate FTE for health insurance.,
Use FTE to calculate student enrollment.",How to Calculate FTE3," Calculating FTE is an important thing that you need to make sure gets done correctly. If you make a mistake in your calculations, it can negatively impact many aspects of your business including anticipating profits, taxes, and other issues. So if you don’t feel confident in your ability to calculate your business’s FTE perfectly, pay an accountant with experience in this field to do it for you.


You will need to provide this person with important information about your business so that they can gather all the information they’ll need to calculate your FTE.
They will need access to your employee files, previous tax documents, and other similar types of documents.

, Certain types of lawyers will have experience in this area and will be able to help you with your calculations to ensure they are done correctly. Seek out advice from corporate or tax lawyers for help calculating your FTE.

, FTE analysis can be a useful tool for assessing how many employees are needed in a certain part of a business or in total. Business owners can also track how overall employee growth has trended over the years in a clearer way by analyzing FTE changes. FTEs can be compared to other metrics to assess how much additional employees contribute to the business's profitability or revenues.If your business uses part-time employees, you might want to convert their hours worked into full-time equivalents.
You can also use FTE to compare headcount to revenues or square footage, which may be useful for making decisions about budgeting and hiring/laying off.

, One use of FTE is in calculating the size of a small business for health insurance purposes. Specifically, the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) marketplace requires that business have fewer than 50 FTEs to qualify. This program offers affordable and high-quality employee insurance policies to business owners. Businesses also have to meet other standards to qualify., FTE is also used to mean ""full time equivalent enrollment"" and is used by universities and other educational institutions in a similar fashion to track enrollment of full and part-time students. Rather than work hours, class hours are used, with full-time students being those with a full credit load (often 12 hours per week) and part-time students being those taking fewer than 12. However, other schools may use different credit hour calculations for FTE."

Write a compelling job description.,
Draw up a recruitment plan—and stick to it.,
Put together a team.,
Along with your team, create an objective way to score each applicant.",How to Make Good Hiring Decisions1," You want the best applicants. The best applicants are the people who don’t just need the job, they’re the people who have always wanted to do that job. Therefore, you need to write a job description that’s going to draw the applicant who thinks your opening is a dream job.Think of it like an ode to your organization and a love letter to the open position. An employee is selling you their labor, so sell them on your company. You need to go beyond qualifications and responsibilities in the job posting. That information tells an applicant if they're qualified for the job. You want the posting to tell an applicant that working with your company is a unique and worthwhile opportunity.;
, A recruitment plan is a plan on how to find and interview the best candidates for the opening. It entails finding sources of potential applicants, applying standard interview practices to each applicant, and giving yourself enough time to fill the position.Start by asking around your own company for possible in-house applicants and referrals. Your own employees and associates are the most likely to intuitively understand the culture and requirements you’re looking for.Next, cast a wider net. If these sources don’t bear fruit, widen your search to trade associations and publications. Then, use forums like craigslist.org, Indeed.com, and local newspapers.If no suitable candidates come forward, consider using a paid recruiter.

, Even if the ultimate authority for hiring and firing rests in your hands, you should put together a team to help you evaluate and interview the candidates. A group of evaluators will almost always notice things a single interviewer will miss.You don’t want so much input the signal outweighs the noise, so keep the size of the group manageable. You need to have a representative from HR, the prospective employee’s immediate supervisor and any co-workers they would partner with, along with a more senior supervisor if that position exists., Objective benchmarks are important. Without them, you run the risk of unconscious biases getting in the way of making good decisions and applying unequal metrics to different candidates. The particular metrics will differ for each organization, but typical measurements might be education, experience, and disposition. Weigh them according to your company's needs.

Get a computer science or business degree.,
Brush up on web design.,
Develop and manage databases.,
Master the art of e-mail and social media.,
Optimize traffic.",How to Become an E Commerce Project Manager1," Getting a degree is often the best way to expose yourself to important aspects of both business and technology. While a bachelor of science in computer science will introduce you to many of the skills needed to work in E-commerce, other degrees can also be helpful. For instance, a business degree that incorporates classes on web-based business may be even more beneficial.Marketing and finance programs can also prepare you to be an E-commerce professional, though you will need to supplement these programs with classes more specific to web development and other technical skills.
In order to succeed as an E-commerce project manager, you’ll need to be familiar with best practices and products relevant to web design, data management, online transactions, online communication, and search engine optimization.;
, As an E-commerce professional, you’ll do much more than simply help businesses sell stuff online. In particular, you will be asked to help design the website that allows them to do so. Since you will be hired for your expertise in online business, knowledge about electronic showrooms, payment processing portals, and transaction fulfillment systems is of greatest importance.At the most basic level, the more programming languages you’re proficient in, the more capable you will be as an E-commerce professional. In particular, proficiency in Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby will each immediately make you a more capable developer.
If you do not already know how to design and built these online environments, take a web development course focusing on online business.

, As an e-commerce professional, you’ll be helping companies deal with large amounts of data. You’ll likely be tasked with organizing, storing, and protecting this data. Further, you’ll need to provide your clients with the ability to search this data, and otherwise learn from the data generated by your databases.Take courses that will train you to work with large amounts of data and identify information that can lead to actionable business moves.

, Electronic mailing lists provide your clients with a quick, effective way of reaching a massive targeted audience. You’ll need to know how to design e-mail communications that make utilizing this valuable resource easy. Further, you need to be prepared to consult clients on any social media platform that can help generate sales. In fact, you will often be asked to help plan an online company’s marketing strategy generally.For starters, make a personal account on any social media platform with relevance to the types of companies you're working for. This is the quickest way to get exposure to platforms that are brand new, and may not even be addressed in formal education courses.

, The Holy Grail of e-commerce marketing is knowing how to generate increased traffic to your clients’ websites. One of the best ways to do this is by helping their website show up earlier in search engine results. This often involves advertising with search engines, and can provide opportunities for you to develop pay-per-click promotions that increase your own and your client’s profit.If search engine optimization and advertising appeal to you, consider specializing in this area specifically, as it is of particular importance to many E-commerce positions.

Pick a job title.,
Introduce your company.,
Write a general position summary.,
Include “hard” candidate requirements.,
Determine preferred candidate qualifications.,
Provide application procedures.,
Decide what additional information you’d like to include.,
Select a market appropriate to your field.,
Keep your ad design simple.,
Advertise within the company.,
Post your ad online.,
Take out a classified ad in a newspaper.,
Publish in a trade journal.,
Analyze your results.",How to Make a Job Advertisement," The job title in the ad doesn’t have to be the exact same as the job title that candidate will actually possess. Choose a title that includes key terms that qualified candidates may include in their job search.Additionally, make sure the job title describes the job being performed as well as the level of work.For example, instead of labeling the job “Sales Position,” try “Entry-level Pharmaceutical Sales Representative.”
Avoid acronyms or abbreviations with which all candidates may not be familiar.;
, This should include key words and phrases that clearly summarize your company and explain your business’ industry, your company’s culture, your company’s mission and why this is a great place to work.For example, “The mission of Company XYZ is to offer customers high quality technical engineering services at an affordable price. Founded in 1970, the company is headed by John Smith and located in Sacramento, California. Our goal is to target small companies and government organizations , to seek major contracts and strategic alliances.”, This is used to clearly explain the obligations of the position so that the candidates have a clear picture of performance expectations. The functions should include level of importance, level of complexity, and all essential tasks should be listed.List about eight to ten key responsibilities of the position.For instance, you could write, “The essential duties of the catering manager include many responsibilities such as securing a venue; interviewing merchants and executing contracts; overseeing food delivery and preparation; and managing all event staff.

, These should be basic qualifications that candidates must possess in order to be considered for the position. They must be closely related to the duties of the position, and must be necessary to successfully fulfill the essential functions of the position.Requirements must be objective. For instance, instead of saying, “Seeking a candidate that went to a ‘good’ school,” try saying, “Seeking a candidate with a Bachelor’s degree.”
Prerequisites must also be non-comparative. For example, instead of asking for a candidate who “is within the top five candidates in years of experience,” seek instead a candidate with simply, “five years of experience.”
Requirements listed must be business related. For instance you cannot ask for a candidate to have volunteer experience unless it is relevant to the position.
Avoid discrimination by selecting words and phrases that do not adversely limit a protected class or group of people.
Avoid listing too many skills as it can greatly limit your potential candidates. List no more than 5 “hard” qualifications (degree, years of experience, etc.).

, Preferred qualifications are traits that are desired, but not necessarily a prerequisite for employment. These are often identified as “soft skills.” These skills and abilities are used to determine whether a candidate possesses a higher aptitude level with which to complete the duties listed in the job description.


For example, you can request prior experience with Oracle, but it may not be a requirement for all candidates.
Preferred qualifications are listed with the hopes that someone who has greater skills will be more adept at reaching the full potential of their position.

, Tell candidates how they should go about applying for the position. Will the application be on-line? Should they email a resume or cover letter? Provide all instructions and also provide contact information such as email, phone number, and company website.For example, you may say, “All interested candidates who meet the necessary qualifications should email their resume and cover letter to example@example.com.”

, Some employers choose to include base salary information (per hour/per annum), commission, bonus opportunities, benefits, etc.You can also choose to designate the employment type and length such as permanent employee, a temporary hire, a contractor, or whether employees will be full-time, or part-time.You can also include the location of the position and whether travel is involved.


Attract the best candidates by highlighting the benefits that help your company stand apart from competitors, such as a high pay scale, bonus programs, flexible working hours, career development opportunities, or any other “perks” that may appeal to potential candidates.Templates and checklists can be used to determine what information to include, and in what order.A large number of example job posting can be found at http://blog.proven.com/job-descriptions.

, It’s important to do a few searches in order to determine the best market for your ad. These searches can be performed online, in the local paper, in the classifieds, or in any other markets in which you are considering advertising. By acting as a job-hunter, you’ll be able to determine the most popular markets for your advertisement, whether it be an online job board, a newspaper ad, or a job fair.


For example, if you search for open teaching positions online, you will see advertisements on popular employment sites, newspaper sites, and sites dedicated specifically to teachers.

, Whether posting an ad online or in print, you are often given design options such as background color, font, font size, etc. Keep the design of your ad clean and simple so the most important information can be conveyed quickly.Make sure your ad is easily readable by ensuring the print isn’t too large or too small, and that the words are in an easily visible color such as black or dark blue.
Avoid fancy or scripted fonts that are often difficult to read, and avoid capitalizing all letters.Don’t use over-designed graphics, lots of italics, or patterned/pictured backgrounds. While this is often used to grab the reader’s attention, it typically just distracts the reader and slows them down.
Different designs with the same content on different media can be effective.

, Try posting your job advertisement on intra-company bulletin boards. This will allows employees to recruit friends and acquaintances who might be interested. This advertising channel is free and can provide high-quality applicants, as each one is already referred by an employee.

, Online postings have grown in popularity because they offer employers many ways to advertise to a large group of candidates, as well as faster response and hiring times. Online postings include job boards such as Indeed or Monster.com, classified sites like Craigslist, your business’s website, or any online site your candidate is likely to visit.For instance, if you’re searching for an intern for a position, a college’s job board would be a great place to find an ideal candidate.
Most online job postings run for 30 days at a time and cost anywhere from $25 to $500, depending on the site.Visit the company’s website for more information on costs and postings.
Beware of the drawbacks of sites like Craigslist, where you are likely to receive a lot of applications from unqualified candidates, and your ad may get buried among other ads over time., Classified ads in newspapers and circulars are still very popular because they are both a low-cost and traditional method to find suitable candidates. You can choose a block of space that allows you to write a clear and specific ad which will discourage unqualified candidates, or you can choose a smaller block of space and post a “blind ad” which doesn’t include business information.Instead of including business contact information, a blind ad will set up a P.O. Box where candidates can send resumes. Blind ads typically save money and time because employers no longer have to reply to all candidates.
Because blind ads don’t contain a lot of company information, candidates may be reluctant to apply.
A full page ad typically ranges from $80 to $130. Contact your local paper for more information on costs and other pertinent information.

, Trade journals are a great place to advertise when you are looking for a professional or technical employee with a specific set of skills or training. This is a great way to reach a very specific, and therefore more qualified audience. Search for the most popular trade or professional journals within your field and contact them for advertising information.One of the major drawbacks is that these advertisements tend to have a slow turnaround time as these journals are often only published monthly or quarterly. However, many journals can also be found online which can quicken the process.

, Save your applicant data from different channels to assess which one is the most effective. Record the number of applicants and the quality of those applicants. For example, you can ask in the interview or during the application process which channel the applicant heard about the position through. Analyze this data and refine your advertising channel choices for your next job advertisement based on those that were most successful.

Start slow.,
Test your applicants.,
Move locations.,
Ask the right questions.,
Don’t be afraid to do it over again.",How to Make Good Hiring Decisions2," Don’t bombard your interviewee with questions right after they arrive. They’re probably nervous; unless they’re a performer or a salesperson, stage fright is probably irrelevant to job performance. You should want to put them at ease just as you would like to be put at ease.Introduce yourself, try to find some common ground with the interviewee, tell them a little about your own experiences with the company and its history.

, Interviewing in and of itself—asking each applicant a series of resume-related questions—isn’t a terribly effective strategy for hiring the best talent. It typically finds the person who is most talented at interviewing, rather than the person with the skill-set for the job. Although it is a necessary step in the process, endeavor to test your applicants on a job-related task.For example, if you’re hiring an attorney, instead of only interviewing, pass along a mock case file and ask your applicant to follow up in a couple of days with a memo about the strategy and theory of the case.

, The idea behind changing locations is that you minimize the rehearsed aspect of any interview. Without being an explicitly high-pressure tactic, it forces the candidate to think on their feet.For example, start the interview in your office and continue it over lunch or in a coffee shop. It can give you ideas about how the applicant interacts with people he’s not trying to get something from.

, Don’t just ask the same questions everyone else asks in an interview. Every applicant has rehearsed their answers to those questions over and over again, so you’re not getting the information you’re after when you ask them.For example, don’t ask: “Where do you see yourself in five years?”
Instead, ask: “If you could start any kind of business right now, what would it be?”

, Although it won’t always be necessary, it’s always a good idea to interview each candidate multiple times. That way, you get a more complete picture of their temperament and attitude.It's not a bad idea to focus on different areas during different rounds of the interview, especially if you plan on having different people take the lead on interviewing the candidate during the respective rounds of interviewing. For example, you can have the immediate supervisor administer the aptitude test.

"
"
Don’t place too much emphasis on the interview.,
Grade the objective factors, but consider subjective impressions as well.,
Consider your institutional culture.,
Check references.,
Make your offer.",How to Make Good Hiring Decisions3," Even though it’s the highlight of the process, the interview isn’t the end all, be all of the hiring process. It’s one tool among many. The experience, education, and (perhaps) test results of a candidate can be far more instructive of actual performance.

, You created your objective measurements for a reason, and they are important to take into account, but some things are difficult to measure. Don’t dismiss a subjective impression just because it doesn’t fit onto your grid.Subjective factors might include things like poise, quick-thinking, and creativity.

, The culture of your organization is another factor that can get overlooked. If your organization values outside-box-thinking and a challenging atmosphere, a career military officer might not be the best fit at your place of business.This factor is one to analyze carefully. An employee who fits with the overall institutional culture is likely to be happier and more productive. However, glossing over why or why not a candidate is a good fit can lead to unconscious discrimination.

, References go unchecked as often as not. Don’t make this mistake. While no one is going to consciously put forward a bad reference, a reference can be about more than simple pluses and minuses.


Look at the quality of the reference, not simply whether it’s positive or negative. Is it bland and vague, or vivid and specific? The answer tells you a lot about the employee’s impact at their former organization. A forgettable employee is much more likely to receive a nondescript reference.

, Once you've settled on a candidate, make them an offer. Consider two factors when you make your offer, what you can afford, and what you think it would take to get them on board.


You don't want to give away the store right off the bat, so make an offer that's within your budget but high enough that they know you're serious about trying to hire them.

Speak with program staff.,
Attend e-commerce conferences.,
Craft a strong resume.,
Consult reputable job posting websites.",How to Become an E Commerce Project Manager2," Whether you went to school or developed your skills through online training, programs that provide technical knowledge usually also have staff who can help you find a job. Since programs want to be able to show that their participants can easily be hired, they’ll work with you to identify positions you’re interested in and qualified for. Reach out to your program’s administration offices directly.

, Break out your least wrinkly collared shirt and practice your networking handshake. There are several high profile e-commerce conferences each year. These provide ample opportunity to stay up-to-date on industry knowledge, meet colleagues, and even find work opportunities.For example, 10-X E-Commerce Event (February, Florida), eTail conferences (various, global), eCommerceFuel Live (October, Tennessee), and Mivacon (March, California) are all great options.

, The most important part of your resume as an e-commerce professional is your work experience section. Use this section to draw a potential employers attention to the diversity of your skills and experience. Start sentences or bulleted points with action verbs that convey the successful execution of various tasks. In particular, use “analyze”, “consult”, “track”, “plan”, “develop”, “resolve”, and “improve” wherever possible.Use the past tense for action verbs that describe your accomplishments at previously held positions, and present tense verbs when discussing positions you still hold.
For instance, include things like, “Supervised the development of program that helped identify unapproved downloads of our products” or “Recommended various protection options and compiled cost-benefit analysis for each option.”, Given the immense demand for E-commerce project managers, many positions are frequently posted on online job posting websites. In particular, visit websites that cater to business professionals, such as LinkedIn. Don’t just look for specific positions to apply for. Get a good idea of which types of companies actively hire for the types of positions that appeal to you, and visit their websites directly."

Focus on building a portfolio instead.,
Enroll in a certification program with the CEC.,
Get certified through the CIW.,
Consider a CIW apprenticeship.",How to Become an E Commerce Project Manager3," Acquiring direct work experience following a traditional degree is preferable to any online certification program. Take web design as an example: If you already have coding skills that allow you to build websites and applications, the best way to demonstrate your talents is by using them. In fact, simply designing web content is the best way to learn more about developing the web. Whenever you’re unsure of how to accomplish a certain task, online forums are usually the best ways to learn how.If you are entirely new to web development, online certification programs can help bring you up to speed on standard industry knowledge. However, if you're able to begin putting skills into practice, do this instead of spending time pursing certification.

, There are several certification programs that teach you about the fundamentals of E-commerce. If your knowledge and skills are already specialized in web design, marketing, or information technology, get certified in other aspects of the E-commerce industry. The Institute of Certified E-Commerce Consultants (CEC) is a leading program offering certification in E-commerce project management and more specific topics, like marketing, risk assessment, and quality management.If you have 2 years of E-commerce related experience, you may be able to waive certain requirements for admission to the CEC’s certification programs.

Plan your questions ahead of time.,
Be familiar with the applicant's qualifications.,
Stay in charge of the conversation.,
Know the job description.,
Field questions appropriately.

,
Make sure your answers to the candidate's questions stay on topic.",How to Keep a Job Interview on Track,"


Go into the interview with a complete and revised list of questions for the applicant. Be sure to review this list right before the interview to make sure you are prepared for the interview. This will make referring to questions a much quicker process. Consider adding notes of follow-up questions you want to ask if the interviewee answers a particular way. Only stray away from these questions if it truly advances the interview.;
,


Don't spend your time asking questions you can find the answers to prior to the interview. You risk getting off track if you have to ask basic questions. If the applicant lists a specific qualification on their resume that is especially pertinent to the job, be sure to incorporate that into your written list of questions. This will also keep the applicant's answers on track.

,


It's easy to get caught in the trap of just talking rather than remembering that you are in the middle of screening a job applicant. Staying in charge of the conversation will, not only keep the interview on track, but will help keep the interview professional.
There is a chance that, if the candidate doesn't have a good answer to one of your questions, he or she may try to divert the conversation to another topic. It is your responsibility to bring the interviewee back to the original question.

,


Remember that the candidate will likely have questions for you about the position you are trying to fill. You can save yourself time, and any embarrassment, by knowing what the expectations are for the job. This will also allow the conversation to remain focused on how the applicant will best fit the job.

,, Don't just focus on keeping your questions and the candidate's answers on track. Make sure that, when you are answering one of the interviewee's questions, you are concise and to the point. Hopefully, the candidate will follow your lead when it is his or her turn to answer.

Study the mission, purpose and values of the interviewing company.,
Review the job description in detail.,
Inquire about the interview format ahead of time.,
Anticipate the questions you might be asked.,
Consider specific interpersonal experiences.,
Prepare answers related to project planning and logistics.",How to Answer Project Management Interview Questions," Understanding these facets of the company will allow you to highlight how your management approach aligns with the company's needs. For example, the company may take a service-centered approach to meeting client needs. Knowing this fact, you can identify past project successes that resulted from actively prioritizing the needs of clients.;
, The interviewer will expect you to be familiar with all of the details provided in the job posting. Specific job responsibilities, knowledge of relevant software and tools, and job requirements like travel or overtime may have been outlined in the job description.

, Some interviews take place one-on-one and others involve an entire team of managers and employees. Knowledge of the interview structure will allow you to prepare a different set of responses and questions for various team members.

, Based on your knowledge of the industry, the job description, the company information and your general experience with project management, create a list of possible interview questions.


Place yourself in the interviewer's shoes. A company owner will have different concerns and considerations than a team member who may be reporting to you. The company owner may be interested in effective leadership and time management skills. A subordinate may be more concerned about your communication skills and approachability.

, You may be asked to elaborate on how you addressed conflict between your team members. Be prepared to explain a particular situation, why it was problematic and how you resolved the conflict or prevented the conflict from interfering with the progress of the project.

, The interviewer may ask you to explain what thought processes and tools you generally use to plan out a project from beginning to end.


Identify your approach to project planning. You might explain that you are detail oriented and map out the entire project using white boards, Excel spreadsheets and other organizational tools. Alternatively, your approach to project planning may involve discussions with team members, delegation and a collaborative approach.
Avoid discussions of unnecessary details. Unless asked to elaborate on the details, limit your explanation of project planning and logistics to a few sentences that highlight your general approach without excessive focus on step-by-step activities.
Address your perspective on meeting deadlines. You may be given a scenario to assess how you address fast-approaching deadlines. Missed deadlines can result in excessive costs and loss of business. Reflect on how you accelerated a process in the past by working overtime, cutting out an unnecessary step in a process, motivating team members or other solutions that demonstrate your ability to manage deadlines.

Research the group or individual that is to be interviewed.,
Exchange contact information.,
Analyze your strengths.,
Set up a time and place to meet.,
Understand goals and constraints.,
Write as many as twenty open-ended questions, covering aspects including:


The Problem - why the client desires your help in designing a new device or system.,
Arrive a little earlier than the established time.,
Politely greet the client as they arrive.,
Start casually.,
Contextual questions first.,
Get into goals and constraints.,
Brainstorm, design and report.",How to Interview a Client for an Engineering Project," Understanding the client's circumstance, including the problem they face and their need for a new system is crucial in developing a suitable solution. Research can most easily be done through the company website if the client is representing a company or a resume if the client is an individual. How will your expertise benefit the collaboration? More information will be obtained at the interview, but always come prepared to an interview with at least some context of the scenario.;
, Communication is key to any successful relationship, and the relationship between you and your client is no different. Be sure to make yourself available through cell phone numbers, email addresses and even professional websites if you have one. Politely ask for contact information from the client and be ready to use whatever they offer.

, Why is the client choosing to come to you instead of someone else? What skills and experience do you have that would suggest to them that you are a good fit? Think of any reason you can, obvious or not. Additionally, make sure you know what you are capable of offering so you do not take on something that would be best done by another individual.

, Ensure that the location is convenient for both you and your client and that you will have sufficient time to comfortably discuss the project. Meeting places do not need to be out of the public's eye however; often, clients will prefer to talk at a coffee shop or similar location due to the convenience and neutrality of the location and the relaxed atmosphere. However, avoid noisy places and try to reserve about an hour for the meeting. If meeting in person is not possible, try to use a software like Skype or FaceTime to communicate face to face.

, One of the more important concepts in engineering design is the difference between goals and constraints. Both deal with how the final product addresses the problem presented, but they should be looked at individually. Constraints are the absolutely essential aspects of the design, while goals are things that the design could work without. Take the case of trying to remove an oil filter that is stuck on a car.


A constraint is that the oil filter must be removed without damage to the vehicle. A design that does not accomplish this would be considered a failed design.
A goal is that it is removed without damaging the filter itself. The old filter is going to be thrown out anyways, so it is not essential that is is removed without damage. However, it would be nice if the design did not destroy the filter so it would be less messy!

, Ask about both the problems and successes of the status quo and the specific aspects of the current method that are insufficient.
Constraints - what the design needs to accomplish.
Goals - nonessential aspects of the final device.
Concerns - what the client foresees as a problem and how to mitigate it.
Timeline - when the client would like the various parts of the project completed, including initial design, prototyping, testing and final design.
Budget - how much the client is willing to pay for the project and from where the funding will come.

, You will always want to plan on leaving early to compensate for not being able to find the meeting place, getting held up in traffic or similar obstacles. There is never a problem being someplace early to set up and get comfortable; however, arriving late will immediately damage your relationship with the client.

, The client could just as easily get another person's help with their project, so be very polite and courteous. Stand up when they arrive and shake their hand, then allow them to sit down first. Good manners are recommended everywhere, but especially when making a first impression with your client. Don't be too uptight though - after greeting them and sitting down, try to speak professionally, not aristocratically.

, Do not jump right away into your questions unless the client wants to be finished as soon as possible. If time allows, warm up a bit with whatever you would like to talk about. Hopefully your preliminary research yielded some potential conversation starters. Try to keep the topic relevant to the purpose of your meeting, but not exactly the same. If you are working on a new design for fuel tank, talk about cars! If you are going to be developing a system to clean laundry more effectively, talk about clothing! You and the client will both want a comfortable, relaxed meeting, so start things off this way and they will carry through.

, When creating your questions, there was likely some chronology that went into the list. The first things you will want to know are those that the project will be based around - the status quo and the problem with it. Therefore, ask these sort of things first. Try to get as thorough of an understanding of the situation first before discussing things that have yet to be developed.


Make sure you are taking notes of some type. Ask the client if you may jot down some notes, or use a voice recorder if they allow it. This will help you retain the information and give you something to refer to later.

, An important aspect of a design project is understanding the difference between goals and constraints. Constraints are the things that the design absolutely must accomplish, while goals are things that would make the design more ideal. Questions aimed at distinguishing these from one another are most helpful to the design process as they create the framework your ideas must be based upon.


Ask the client to clarify an aspect of the design they wish to see if it is unclear. You will need to know exactly what they want in order to create something satisfactory, so now is the time to clear up anything you are unsure about.

, After obtaining the necessary information from the client, start working on a solution! Keep the client updated frequently with your progress and ensure major design features are alright with the client before investing too much time or money in them. You will almost certainly have more in-person meetings with your client in the future, so be prepared to meet with them again whenever the project necessitates it.

Do Pre Induction preparation.,
Plan in bunches.,
Communicate about the process.,
Select the communication medium.,
Fix on sub categories.,
Check on venue’s availability and other amenities.,
Breaks and snacks.,
Be a host.,
Make it interactive.,
Training Needs.,
End the process with Q&A round.",How to Induct an Employee Into Your Organization (India)," Be clear of the end result before proceeding to plan the induction, and accordingly plan the schedule. For instance, if you want the employees to be aware only about the organizational processes and its growth plan, then 2-3 hours is good enough. You can either go for audio - visual presentation or can stick to power point presentation too. However, if you are planning for your new comers to complete few mandatory training sessions too within their induction period only, slot them accordingly and inform the trainer beforehand.;
, Club all the new joiners of a month or quarter depending on your recruitment rate. Global organizations normally prefer to implement this process monthly and club all the employees who have joined one or two months ago.

, Once you are done with the session planning, the next important milestone is to inform the participants and their supervisors well before in time. Encourage them to acknowledge and confirm their presence. This will make it easier for you to provide snacks, meals and stationery items in the right amount and numbers.

, Audio-visual medium of communication is always a preferred choice, as this makes the entire session lively and interesting. If you are opting for a power point presentation, be ensure right and professional color combination is being used (shouldn't be too dazzling).

, Plan about what your session is going to cover. Devote optimum time slots to each section. If you are going to introduce the top notch of your organization, then collect right information and place it suitably in your slide show. Provide a brief about the future growth plans/acquisitions and major achievements of the organization. Detailed information about company policies and administration support is always helpful for the new beginners.

, The venue, which you have fixed for conducting the session could be your board room or an auditorium. Book the room beforehand to avoid last minute clashes. Brief the support staff of the venue about all your requirements for the day and test the equipment beforehand.

, Depending upon the length of the process, normally snacks and other administrative arrangements are provided by the company. Make sure to communicate the schedule to the providers also.

, The role of a human resource professional in these sessions is like a host. Ask your audience individually what they expect from this session and welcome their goals. Try to meet their expectations and answer their questions.

, Try to conduct the session in a lively environment. Be sure of what your message is and accordingly plan the session. Team bonding and a culture of openness can be established by involving the employees in team games, brain teasers or storytelling sessions.

, If you are planning to cater to the employee’s learning need in this session; coordinate with the trainer and employee. Make sure the selected learning need is same for all the employees.

, Summarize the complete process at the end and ask each participant of what their take away is from the session. Encourage them to clarify their doubts, if any. Wish them luck for their professional growth with the organization.

Schedule the time and place for interview(s).,
Unless you are the only one who cares who you hire - you will need other people to interview.,
Take notes during the interview.,
The body language


One of the first aspects to keep in mind is the confidence levels, eye contact and the body language that the interviewee presents.,
The body language of the interviewee will tell you as to whether he actually means what he says or whether he is just telling you the answers by rote.

,
Allow the candidate time to ask any questions of you.,
Soon after the interviews are concluded, get together with everyone that met the candidate(s) and discuss overall and specific impressions.",How to Interview Potential Employees," This is one of the most important steps, and can have a significant bearing on how successful the resulting interviews will be. Key steps in preparation include:


Make sure you and any other interviewers will have enough time to conduct the interviews.
Find an appropriate place for the interviews (your office may not be a good idea if you are likely to keep getting interrupted).
Interviews over lunch or dinner can be valuable to assess a candidate in a more social setting, but the discussions tend to be less formal. Unless you know a really discrete restaurant, it can be much harder to discuss sensitive or confidential matters (such as compensation or reasons for leaving a previous position).
Prepare yourself for the interview. If you are busy and likely to have other meetings right before the interview, make sure you have all the documents you need (including a blank pad to write on) before the interview time.;
, Some ways to optimize the interview process include:


Make sure all interviewers know as much about the candidates as possible. Ensure each interviewer has a copy of the candidate's resume and any notes that may be appropriate to share. It is best not to color other people's thinking, so facts should be shared objectively rather than selectively.
Agree on unique questions for each interviewer to ask - candidates can get really tired of the same old questions over and over.
If possible, let the various interviewers cover different topics - this also gives the candidate a broader sense of the team he or she will be joining.
Develop a list of specific questions to ask the candidate based on their resume and any other information you may have (such as the results of a telephone screening interview). Be sure all interviewers are aware of the questions you are legally not allowed to ask in an interview (see Warnings below). Typical questions include:
Why are you looking to change positions?
Why did you leave your last employer?
How much travel would you be comfortable with?
What did you like best/least about your last position?
What do you think you are best/worst at?
What is the biggest mistake you ever made?
What did you learn from the biggest mistake you ever made?
What kind of working environment suits you best ?



, It is very useful to have records that you can refer to later. Don't be afraid to let the conversation go quiet as you write your notes. Take this opportunity to observe the candidate. Are they anxious and saying anything just to keep the conversation going, or are they relaxed and confident, ready to respond to your next question? Useful things to note include:


Initial impressions (as they relate to the candidates' suitability for the position)
Specific questions that you may want to ask later in the interview
Note observations of specific strengths or challenges for the candidate (it sounds obvious but you may not remember these later, especially if you have a lot of interviews on the same day)
Note anything you may want to check on later (dates, times, mutual connections, etc)

,
To be very frank, you would have to connect the answers that he or she provides along with the body language that you can see.

,, You can learn a lot by the questions they ask:


Are they truly interested in the position?
What are their expectations of the position, employer, supervisor?
Did they do their homework and research your company and position?
Do their questions demonstrate an ability to assess and be compatible with your company's culture?

, An agenda for this discussion should include:


Potential red flags as to why you may not want to hire this person (if one or more significant ones, the discussion can stop right there)
Specific strengths and weaknesses of the candidate relating to the position.

Achieving consensus, if possible, as to whether the group feels this candidate should be hired or not. This may not be the final decision, but it does give all interviewers a sense that their part of the process is important and has been completed.

It should clearly outline the duties and responsibilities of the position, which include general position information, the purpose of the position, essential job functions, minimum candidate requirements, and preferred candidate qualifications., This includes position titles, pay grades, department information, supervisor name, and other special requirements such as background checks or valid driver’s license. , Your position purpose should state the fundamental functions of the position, especially in relation to supporting, directing, or managing activities of the department or organization. It should also include the number of openings (if more than one) and the duration of the position (if a non-career position).For example, in a financial position you could say, “the purpose of the financial position is to help the department assess the financial health of the organization as a whole”., This is used to clearly articulate the tasks and obligations required of a position so that job seekers have a clear idea of performance expectations. The essential functions should be arranged by importance, level of complexity should be discussed, and essential tasks should be listed.For instance, you could write, “The essential functions of event planning include many tasks such as: securing a venue, interviewing merchants and executing contracts, managing food delivery and setup, and overseeing all event staff"".

, These should be basic qualifications that candidates must possess in order to be considered for the position. They must be closely related to the duties of the position, and must be necessary requirements needed to complete the essential functions of the position.""Soft skills” such as communication skills or teamwork abilities, can be included but they are better ascertained through interviews versus resumes.
Requirements must be objective, non-comparative, and business related. For instance, instead of saying, “Seeking a candidate that went to a ‘good’ school, is within the top five candidates in years of experience, and has volunteer experience,” try saying, “Seeking a candidate with a Bachelor’s degree, five years of experience, and one year of experience in accounting”.
Avoid listing too many skills as it can greatly limit your potential candidates. List no more than five “hard” qualifications (degree, years of experience, etc.), and list “soft” skills based on the level of the position.

, Preferred qualifications are skills that are desired, but not necessarily a requirement for employment. These skills and abilities are used to define a higher aptitude level with which to complete essential functions.


For example, you can request prior experience with Microsoft Excel, but not require it.
Preferred qualifications are used with the hopes that someone who has greater aptitudes will be quicker to reach the full potential of their position.

, When determining your method of posting your job ad, you have to figure out what medium is likely to reach the best and brightest employees for the position. Consider the essential functions, as well as skills and qualifications needed in order to determine which mediums are best for recruitment.Various means for posting jobs include online career websites, college career boards, newspapers, social media, recruiting cards, job fairs, and employee referrals.Ads should be posted for a minimum of ten days for support staff positions, and a minimum of fifteen days for management positions. “Open until filled” is the recommended option, which keeps the posting viewable until the position is filled.
Utilize as many mediums as necessary to ensure a qualified pool of candidates.

, The human resources manager or search committee should view all applications and supplemental materials, such as cover letters, resumes, transcripts, etc. When assessing a candidate, you should keep in mind what you are seeking in a candidate, such as experience, education, and skills that were listed in the job description., A short list is a list of applicants who have been determined to possess the skills and qualifications necessary to effectively function in the position. Short lists can also be used to determine if the candidate pool is sufficiently diverse. The shortlist usually contains three to five potential candidates for interview.It is common practice to screen candidates by phone to help narrow the field of applicants. Be prepared by having a list of potential screening questions to help determine if the applicant has potential.
Telephone questions should be open-ended such as ""Why are you interested in this position?"" and ""What specific skills would you bring to our team?""

, The interview is considered to be the most important step in the recruitment process because it gives both parties a chance to learn more about one another. Before the interview, employers should prepare by determining the format of the interview, questions to be posed to the candidate, and the preferred start date for the position.Determine what format you will use for your interview, and who will be present. Interviews can be conducted in many ways including a face-to-face interview, a panel interview, or a virtual interview. In addition, the interview may be conducted by one person or a committee of persons.
Behavioral questions and competency questions should seek to learn more information about a candidate’s on-the-job abilities and characteristics. For example, try a question such as, “describe your previous experiences working with grant writing”.Use a set of ten to twelve consistent questions so that you are better able to compare candidate responses.Always notify candidates about when you will finalize your decision, and how you will notify them.

, After all interviews are complete, your search committee or hiring manager will assess how closely each candidate met the selection criteria outlined in the job description. Be sure to document your decision and ensure that the candidate was chosen based on qualifications alone in order to avoid breaking federal laws employed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity commission.


The EOCC states that it is illegal to discriminate against an applicant based on their race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, nation of origin, age, disability, or genetic information., You can run a background check to reveal any potential issues including criminal records, state licensing records, military records, and more.In addition, employment checks can be performed to determine how an employee performed and behaved at their previous places of employment.Candidates are required to sign consent forms to authorize a potential employer to complete employment and background checks.
For employment verification, describe the position and then ask the former employer, “Given the requirements discussed, what is your assessment of the individual’s qualifications for this position?” Ask follow-up questions to obtain more specific responses about job performance and abilities.
Background and reference checks should be conducted before an official offer is made to the candidate. This will help to guarantee that there will be no issues that hinder completion of the hiring process., Determine important information such as starting salary, benefits, start date, and training needed.In larger companies, this process is typically managed by the HR department and requires final approval. In smaller companies, this may be done by an HR manager, a supervisor, or even directly by the owner.


Be sure to make a fair and reasonable offer first. Not only does it demonstrate equity and good faith to the candidate, but it also leaves room for negotiation.

, Once the offer has been finalized, call the candidate to notify them that you are extending an offer of employment, and to determine if they are still interested. Fully discuss the offer package including salary, benefits, and paid time off, and demonstrate your enthusiasm to have the candidate join your team.A contractual relationship is created once there has been a verbal offer of employment, and a verbal acceptance by the candidate. Therefore, it’s important to make sure that you truly intend to hire the candidate for the position. Otherwise, the candidate may have a claim for breach of contract.If the candidate declines the position, you can always choose another candidate from the short list. Just make sure they are still interested, and you still follow all required personnel checks before offering a position.

, Occasionally, an applicant may decline the position based on the salary offered. Discuss the applicant’s needs and their reasons for declining the offer. Some companies may allow counteroffers, so discuss the issue with your HR department or hiring manager. For larger companies, counteroffers must be within the guidelines set forth for that particular role, and must be reviewed by HR.Counter offers do occur, but companies usually carefully restrict what the offer includes.Negotiating effectively means finding more terms to negotiate about, such as paid time off, start date, and fringe benefits. It’s important to remain flexible and consider what is important to both parties in order to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

, Acceptance of an offer can be both formal and informal based on the company. For some businesses, a verbal acceptance and start date is enough. More formal finalizations include sending an offer letter (or email), obtaining written acceptance of the offer, retaining recruitment documents, and closing the job posting.Once an offer is finalized, be sure to contact the candidates that were interviewed (and not selected) by either phone or letter.

Identify when you’ll need the intern to work and plan accordingly.If you are planning on hiring current college students to intern, then you should be aware of summer vacation schedules. You may want to time your internship to the summer vacation. You can certainly have a student intern during the school year, though you may get fewer applicants.
Also look at your business needs. There may be a particular time of the year when you need extra help.;
, Before hiring anyone, you should understand your legal obligations regarding the intern. In some states, you need to include the intern on your workers’ compensation insurance.You may also need to pay benefits, depending on your company’s policies and your state and local laws.
If you are a for-profit company and want to create an unpaid internship, you should also get some legal advice before setting up the program.

, You need to post a job description which contains a list of duties. This is a great exercise because it will make you think about exactly what you need your intern to do. Ask the person who will immediately supervise the intern to help out on the job description.Remember to include a rate of pay. Currently, interns earn about $16 an hour for internships at the bachelor’s degree level. If you can’t afford to pay, you can develop an unpaid internship, but you must follow specific steps.Think carefully about the hours the intern will work. If they work less than 30 hours a week, you can classify them as part-time employees., As you draft your job description, also think about what credentials or skills you want your interns to have. For example, consider the following:Particular academic major. For example, an accounting firm might want a student majoring in accounting.
Academic performance. Think about whether you want an academic all-star at the top of their class, or if you are fine with any level of performance.
Demonstrated writing ability. If your internship is writing intensive, you might want to see a writing sample. For example, a newspaper might ask interns for sample clips.
Demonstrated math skills. You could possibly give a math test or require that an intern have taken specific math courses.
Computer skills. Many jobs are web-based and require students to navigate the Internet, email, etc.
Specialized skills. For example, if your company does business internationally, you might want an intern who can speak a foreign language.

, Interns are not regular employees, and you shouldn’t view them as cheap labor. Spend some time thinking about how your intern will benefit educationally from the internship.In particular, internships are opportunities for students to learn. Identify who will mentor the student and what form that mentoring will take.You may want to talk to other businesses about their programs. Find out how other businesses structure their internship programs. They may have literature on the internship you can read.Also ask any questions you might have.

, Make projects specific. However, look for projects an intern can handle from beginning to end. Don’t dump an intern on a huge project where they’ll start somewhere in the middle and leave before it is completed. You want the intern to gain a sense of accomplishment by completing entire projects, so pick things that are small.


Avoid giving an intern only busy work, such as filing or typing up basic documents. This type of work doesn’t help the intern, and you can’t properly assess the intern’s capabilities to perform other tasks.
Ideally, your paid interns will work as members of a team. If there are multiple teams, you should think about rotating them so they can see how each team connects with the larger organization., Interns know very little about your industry and even less about the niceties of the modern workplace. Accordingly, the supervisor may have to spend a lot of time coaching the intern and teaching them basic skills like how to write a professional email.Choose a direct supervisor with care.


Some companies like hiring interns because it gives junior employees a chance to act as managers. However, you should think carefully before assigning this task to a relatively inexperienced employee.
The direct supervisor does not need to be the mentor. In fact, it might be easier to split the roles.
Talk with any supervisor before assigning them an intern. Ask if they are willing to serve.

, Send the job description to nearby universities. Look online to find the contact information for their career centers. You may have to go through a registration process.Call ahead of time and ask.

, If the primary benefit is that your company gets an extra set of hands for a month, then think about paying the intern—or hiring part-time staff.


Your benefit as a company should be incidental.Try to identify why you are agreeing to an unpaid internship as a for-profit business. For example, you may be doing a favor to an employee by giving their child the internship. Or you may consider it a professional obligation to help train the next generation in your field.

, The training you offer must be similar to the training someone would receive in an educational environment. In particular, it will be helpful if a university or college oversees the internship and the student earns educational credit.Focus on teaching the intern skills they can be used in a variety of workplaces—not simply your own.
For example, ABC Company wants to hire an intern for its marketing department. ABC should teach Jane the basics of effective marketing instead of having her work on a current marketing campaign ABC is doing for a client.

, You can’t hire an unpaid intern when what you really need to do is hire staff. Your intern should not replace or augment your current staff. Instead, the intern must work closely under their supervision.For example, Smith Accountants wants to hire someone to help during tax season, when things get crazy around the office. Smith Accountants should hire a part-time employee, not an unpaid intern.
If Smith Accounting hires an unpaid intern, they should expect the intern to mostly job shadow an employee. In fact, unpaid interns should not do any task that contributes to the company’s operations, such as answering the phone, responding to emails, or documenting inventory., A key test is whether you benefit from the internship. In order to offer an unpaid internship, you must not gain any financial advantage. In fact, your business operations should probably be interrupted on occasion.For example, ABC marketing hires Jane as an intern. She mostly job shadows the staff but also completes individual projects for her own educational benefit. ABC Marketing doesn’t use her projects for clients. This is a valid unpaid internship.
ABC Marketing may also have to dial back some of the business they take on because of the time spent training Jane. This is perfectly normal when you have an unpaid intern.

, Finally, you can’t trick an intern into thinking they’ll be paid. Instead, make it crystal clear that they are not entitled to any wages for their experience in the internship.The intern shouldn’t feel that the internship is an unpaid “trial period” where you get to feel out the student before making a full time offer.
The internship should also be for a set period of time. The longer an internship lasts, the more the relationship looks like an employment relationship.

, You must satisfy each of the factors in this section for an unpaid intern not to qualify as an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act.If you can’t meet all of them, pay the intern at least the prevailing minimum wage.


The law on unpaid internships is also changing. Some courts have adopted their own tests, which are not identical to the factors discussed in this section.Consult with an attorney if you are considering hiring an unpaid intern.

, Someone should review applications and work with the university’s career center (if you are partnering with a university). This can be a time-consuming job, so don’t drop it on the lap of someone who is already overburdened.If you’re hiring an unpaid intern, then create a unique intern screening process. The way you assess and hire applicants should not be identical to how you hire regular employees. If they are the same, then it looks like you are hiring an employee and not an intern.For example, you shouldn’t give any weight to analyzing how long an employee is likely to stay with you, since internships are short-term.
You also shouldn’t fly the intern in to visit you if you pay regular employees to do that.

, Hiring decisions are covered by state, federal, and some local antidiscrimination laws. You should still follow them in your hiring process.Meet with a lawyer who can explain antidiscrimination law to you. Generally, the laws will limit you in the following ways:


You can’t make a hiring decisions based on stereotypes involving a person’s disability, race, color, national origin, gender, religion, or age.You can’t employ any test to weed out applicants that may have a disparate impact on protected groups. For example, don’t ask applicants whether they can lift 50 pounds unless that is a necessary, job-related requirement.

, You can interview possible interns in the same way you interview potential employees—ask about strengths, weaknesses, why they want to intern with you, etc. However, you may also want to get creative.


For example, you can ask oddball questions, such as what’s the last clean joke they have heard or which state they would eject from the Union. It’s important to focus more on the applicant’s response to the question than the answer.For example, does the intern relish the challenge? Laugh? Try to answer in good faith? These responses show that the intern is flexible.
If you partner with a college or university, you should ask whether you can interview candidates on campus.This might be convenient. Students will find it easy to get to the interview and they may feel more comfortable interviewing in familiar surroundings.

, Call up the candidate you select and make an offer. You should also write an intern offer letter. There are sample letters online you can use as a model when drafting your own.Your offer letter should identify that the job is short-term. Also explain whether the intern will qualify for company benefits.You probably also must notify the student’s school if the intern is getting college credit.

, If possible, set them up with their own work station, including phone, email account, and mailbox.You may have them share a secretary with other employees.


You may need to answer questions about housing if your interns are coming from out of town. Although you don’t need to provide housing, you should have resources to share with the intern about finding a place to stay.

, If you’re paying the intern, you need to add them to your payroll.Have the student complete a W4 form and any other payroll form. Ideally, they should complete this paperwork on their first day.


It’s easiest to classify interns as regular employees. They rarely qualify as independent contractors.
You may need interns, including unpaid interns, to fill out other forms. Check with Human Resources.

If you are being inspected, then you’ll need a valuation expert to help you analyze and document the fair value measurements contained in your audits.However, if the PCAOB has decided to seek a formal investigation or disciplinary proceedings, you’ll need an attorney who specializes in professional malpractice, preferably accounting malpractice.;
, You can find valuation experts online by performing a basic Internet search. Type “business valuation expert” or “business valuation research” in your favorite search engine and look at the results. Add your location to your search string to find someone near you.


Don’t type “PCAOB consultant,” since very few search results come up for that combination.

, The PCAOB inspects auditing firms regularly, so another firm might have used a valuation expert recently. Ask them if they would recommend their consultant.


If you already have a lawyer, you can ask them for advice on who to hire as well.

, Your corporate counsel should be able to find an experienced attorney for your company. However, if you’re a smaller auditing firm without counsel, you can find an experienced attorney in the following ways:


Look on Martindale website or another online database.Search for professional malpractice or professional negligence attorneys.
Search big law firms in your area. Look at firms in the closest city and see if they have professional malpractice attorneys.
Obtain a referral from your local or state bar association. You can find the nearest bar association here: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/abagroups/divisionforbarservices/barassociationdirectories/statelocalbarassociations.aspx. Type in your zip code.

, Make sure the consultant has experience representing auditing firms before the PCAOB. Some Sarbanes-Oxley consultants primarily help businesses, not auditing firms. If you can’t identify someone’s experience from their website, call up and ask for a brochure or other information that explains their experience.


Remember that Sarbanes-Oxley was passed only in 2002, so no one will have extensive experience with PCAOB investigations or sanctions hearings.Nevertheless, make sure the consultant or lawyer has demonstrated experience in a PCAOB investigation like yours.

, A lawyer should have a law degree and be a member of the bar of the state where they practice. Lawyers who specialize in accounting malpractice may also have accounting degrees or CPA credentials. They aren’t required to, but you might find it helpful.


For a business valuation expert, you can check if they are accredited by any of the five standard accrediting agencies.For example, they may be Accredited in Business Valuation (ABV) by the American Institute of CPAs. To qualify, candidates must hold a CPA and pass an exam.There are other certifications a business valuation expert could have, such as the ASA certification from the American Society of Appraisers or the CVA certification by the National Association of Valuation Analysts.

, You should meet with the valuation expert or attorney ahead of time to discuss your situation generally. This will also give you a chance to judge their personality. You’ll want to hire someone you can work closely with.


A lawyer might offer a free or reduced-fee consultation. However, think about paying full price, especially if you are meeting with a big firm lawyer.
Ask what you should bring to your consultation. For example, the lawyer might want to review any communication from the PCAOB.

, Lawyers generally charge by the hour. Before you hire them, they should provide you with a “fee agreement” or “engagement letter” that spells out in detail what they will do and how you will be charged., The PCAOB can perform two types of inspections of auditing firms: regular and special. You should identify the differences between the two:Regular. These are schedule periodically depending on how many audit reports your firm issues. The regular inspection examines and tests your firm’s audit and quality control procedures.
Special. These inspections focus on limited issues as determined by the PCAOB. Your firm is required to work closely with the PCAOB, answering any questions they have and allowing full access to your papers.

, If the PCAOB finds problems, they may report them to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and/or state regulatory offices. Any violation may also warrant a full-blown PCAOB investigation. Investigations may begin as informal ones.


However, if the informal investigation uncovers enough information, the PCAOB can begin a formal investigation by issuing an “Order of Formal Investigation.”The PCAOB may review any document or interview anyone necessary.

, Based on the results of an investigation, the PCAOB may decide to discipline firms or individual employees. The PCAOB can bring disciplinary hearings for violations of any of the following:Sarbanes-Oxley
any PCAOB rule
securities laws relating to preparing and issuing audit reports
any professional accounting standard

, The PCAOB can also require your firm to employ an independent monitor. The monitor’s job is to observe your firm and report violations, which might lead to additional sanctions and proceedings.The PCAOB’s sanctions can be severe. For example, an Ernst & Young partner was banned from practicing with any registered firm for three years and fined $50,000 for faking audit documents.Other fines have reached a million dollars.

, CEOs, vice presidents and research and development talent are usually already employed. Paying a headhunter a fee for finding someone may result in a more experienced and ideal candidate.

, If you want to hire someone who does their research and stays on top of current trends, then a trade newsletter, magazine or website is the best place to go.

, Pay a small fee and post your job to a site like journalismjobs.com or ihireaccounting.com to ensure you are targeting people who already work in your industry.

, Keep your application submission window to one week or less so that you don’t get overwhelmed.

, Unless you don’t have anyone who can review applications, narrowing down 100 applicants to 10 candidates is a good rule of thumb. You should have the ability to narrow that down to three good matches before you hire someone., Ask them to think about an issue or phantom project in advance so that they can bring their creativity and project management skills to the interview.

, Then, ask plenty of follow up questions about this specific incident to learn how the employee conducts business. For example, the following questions are preferable to general questions:


Explain a time when you handled a personnel issue at work.
Tell me about times when you disagreed with co-workers or bosses about a project.
Review the most difficult problem you solved at work.

, Choose three to five essential skills that the person must have and ask questions about these core values. Remember that relevant experience is in the eye of the beholder, so consider people who have the skills but experience in different industries.

, If you are stuck between two candidates and you have completed a pro and con list, you may just need to go with your instinct. Your subconscious may be feeding your important information about their trustworthiness and poise., Alternatively, you should keep in mind that some people do great work but give bad interviews. Dig deeper into their work, their personal references and professional references if they didn’t perform well in the interview, but your gut tells you they are a good candidate., Call them in for another interview if you don’t have an adequate view of how they work and whether they could do the job.

, Professional references tell you about past work, while personal references tell you about lifelong behaviors.

, Both the employer and employee should have a chance to feel out whether it is a good fit. Schedule a review after the employee has been hired for three months.

Such a reputation has a dual element. Not only do you want economic success, you also want people outside your company to know that your company has a positive and healthy culture. Ultimately, potential employees will want to work at a company that has a good reputation.Strive to be included on a list of the best places to work. The most widely read of these lists are maintained by organizations like Forbes, Fortune, and Glassdoor.com.
Treat your employees well and provide generous benefits if you can afford to do so.

Lead from the top down and promote an environment of respect and collaboration. Develop a culture of inclusion, not ""us and them."" This means managers focus on helping employees to do excellent work, rather than a ""my way or the highway"" approach.
Hiring staff with higher standards will be easier if your business appeals to those standards. Be sure to list any industry awards your company has received or accomplishments of note in the description you post to attract job applicants.
Eliminate management and other workers who have negative can’t-do attitudes and promote management and workers who have positive can-do attitudes.;
, Make sure go out of your way to recruit candidates from the best possible places. This means you need to go above and beyond just posting an ad for a position in a newspaper or contacting a professional search firm. Consider:List job postings on industry job search sites and your company website. Steer clear of general job boards and social networking job search pages, as these will attract lots of applicants you'll have to weed through to find the ones with higher standards.
Attend job fairs at universities or at conventions, where you’ll have the opportunity to meet prospective employees for your industry. You’ll be able to talk to many candidates at one time.
Network with other executives in your industry to get an idea if there are any potential top candidates who are looking for employment.

, One of the best ways to locate top candidates is to hire a professional search firm. Professional search firms are companies or individuals who specialize in finding highly qualified candidates for specific industries. Once you contact a professional search firm, they will ask you exactly what you are looking for in a candidate, and then they will search through a list of candidates or actively recruit someone that matches your qualifications.Professional search firms charge a fee. Typically their fee is from 10% to 30% of a year’s salary of the new employee — if you hire one.
Professional search firms focus on specific industries. Make sure to contact one that is known for finding top candidates in your industry.
Feel free to shop around for a firm. If you don’t like one, there are many more that might work for you.

, Before doing anything else, make a list of the competencies, abilities, and characteristics required to perform the role you are hiring for. Be as specific as possible and ask yourself if each part is really important to performing the required tasks. Hiring the right employees means hiring people who can do the job well, rather than hiring someone based on how they look, sound, or move.


For example, while a person in a wheelchair might not be suitable for a position that requires active mobility, most positions would be suitable. Don't exclude someone until you are sure that they cannot perform the job to company standards.
There needs to be a thorough understanding of the company’s culture and management style before defining the proper recruitment and evaluation process. This includes a definition of the employee’s style and goals.
For example, a corporate culture that focuses on the bottom-line exclusively with an autocratic management style is looking for one kind of employee while a company that balances all stakeholders might prefer those who work comfortably in teams.

, Very often, the first exposure you have to a candidate will be their resume and other application materials. In order to make sure that you get the best candidate possible, you need to study and pay attention to the details of the candidate’s application materials. There are a number of things you can glean from their application.Look for typos, spelling mistakes, formatting issues, and more. These problems can be indicative of a lazy or unqualified candidate; however, don’t eliminate a candidate for a typo or two. Use this information to evaluate the candidate on the whole.
Has the candidate put together a personalized application that is tailor fit to your company? Look for specific mentions of your company and anything that suggests the candidate has read up on your company. These may be evidence of a candidate who is very engaged and interested in the position.
Has the candidate included all relevant information, such as dates of employment and dates of education? If they have not, they might be trying to gloss over something that could hurt their candidacy.

, Once you have the applicant's resume, look through it to figure out their level of education and/or training. This is particularly important for entry-level workers without much or any work experience. Make sure that their education or training is up to the standard required for the position. This may be a degree, grade point average, or professional certification. Once you've assessed their education, look for other indications of leadership, relevant activities outside of schoolwork, and awards that could otherwise speak to their character.

, If the applicant has relevant work experience, you should focus particular attention on the candidate’s job history. This is extremely important as it will provide you with a lot of information about their ability and commitment level.Note any special achievements or awards for exceeding sales goals or breaking company records. These are all signs that the prospective employee has high standards of performance and pushed him or herself to excel.
Does the candidate move from position to position very often? This could suggest they don’t get along with their coworkers, or that they have a commitment issue.
Has the candidate advanced in their career? If the candidate has moved up very quickly and has gained higher compensation and more responsibilities, this could be indicative of someone who is a go-getter and is top candidate material.
Has the candidate had a lapse in employment or have they been out of the industry for an amount of time? There are many reasons why someone might have gaps in their resume. Make sure to get the full story before holding an employment or industry gap against them. A person with a disability, for instance, may have gaps in their employment history due to employer stereotypes, but this person may still be an excellent employee given the chance.

, One of the most important steps in finding the most qualified candidate is to contact their professional references. Once you contact professional references, you will be able to gather more information about the candidate’s abilities and commitment.References may be able to tell you about general disposition and whether the employee consistently pushed to succeed, as well as any issues caused in the workplace like harassment or violence.
Make sure to call and talk to the reference in person for the best results.
Make sure to compile a list of questions for the references before you contact them.

, Recognize any biases in your interview process that may disqualify someone who doesn't interview well. Remember that you are interviewing for the ability to perform the tasks required by the position, not for the ability to conduct one's self in an interview or adhere to visual standards.


Many companies, large and small, are reforming their recruitment and hiring practices to cast a broader net to find those who may look or act differently, but can perform at or above standard on the job.
For example, an autistic person might not interview well, but might be a more precise and productive employee than a non-autistic person. Focus on what they can do, instead of how smoothly they talk.

, While it might seem a bit unforgiving, one tactic to find the best candidates is to turn away those who arrive to your interview late. An employee with high standards takes their job seriously and should treat the application process the same way. Job applicants that show up late for interviews or don't follow the rules for applying display a clear lack of high standards for themselves and their employment future. Take note of this if you still interview the applicant or just reject the candidate.

, It is very important to ask potential employees about their goals during the interview. Both short-term and long-term goals will reveal a lot about potential employees. It will give a sense of whether the candidate is thoughtful. It will also give a sense of how the employee conceptualizes their role at your company. Ask the candidate:Why they applied for the position
Where they see themselves in your enterprise in the next year
Where they see themselves in your business in the next five years
To describe their career goals and why they want to work for your company. Pay attention to answers about personal and industry goals or answers that indicate that the job applicant wants to be the best.

, An important element of the interview process is assessing an individual’s personal appearance and behavior. How a job applicant presents themselves and behaves in an interview will give you a good indication of how high their standards are for the job. That said, you should consider the circumstances and abilities of those interviewing for the job and the job itself. Don't pay too much attention to appearance while ignoring the desire and ability to perform.Consider whether the applicant uses any slang terms or profanity and whether they answer questions with complete sentences and proper grammar.
An applicant with high standards will dress professionally and appear polished and well-organized.
Watch whether the candidate has positive body language and good posture. This is especially important if the person will be in a sales position or will deal and come into contact with people outside your company on a regular basis.

, While the actual interviewing process will tell you a lot about your candidate and their abilities, one of the best ways to vet a candidate is to observe them working.If at all possible, allow the candidate to demonstrate themselves in action. While this might work for some positions, it may be impossible for others. But if it is possible, consider inviting other management or potential co-workers to observe the candidate.
Establish clear metrics for performance before you observe the candidate at work.

, Part of the process of assessing the candidate is figuring out if the person is compatible with other employees and with the culture of your business. This is because ultimately the compatibility of your team will promote cooperation. If your team is not compatible and does not cooperate, your company culture and productivity will suffer.If your business culture is inclusive, consider whether a candidate will thrive in that environment.
If your business has a very top-down, production-focused culture, consider whether a candidate will thrive in that environment.
Think about if the candidate gets along with other employees, including their immediate managers.

, An important thing to consider is whether your candidate is truly committed to the job and your company for the long-run. This is an important thing to assess, as employees who are not committed to the job may not put as much effort into the job as others. They can also undermine your company’s culture and potentially cause other problems. Think about whether:The candidate is using the position as a stepping stone to another position. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as they may be looking to move up within your company and want to make a good impression in the position for which you first hire them.
The candidate is committed to the type of work your company does and that they will be engaging in.
The candidate is committed to staying in the location that your company is located. If the candidate says negative things about the community in which your business is located, they might not have long-term commitment to the position.

, After you’ve found a candidate, interviewed them, and provided opportunity for assessment, you should gather management and others vested in the job search to discuss top candidates. This can be very helpful because others who have been involved in the job search process might have insights into certain candidates that others don’t have. As a result, you should be very inclusive and open to feedback when making the final decision.

Know that orienting employees helps to reduce anxiety.,
Understand that orientation can trim employee turnover.,
Be aware that proper orientation saves time in the long run.,
Understand that orientation allows the employee to develop realistic expectations.",How to Help Orient a New Employee1," If a new employee is left on his or her own, the new place and strange situation will may cause them anxiety. This will impede the employee’s ability to learn their job and do it well.


With proper orientation and communication, the employee receives guidelines regarding the job's expectations and it no longer seems guesswork.;
, If adequate attention is not given to the new employee on their very first day, they may start feeling as if they are not valued by the organization. This is a major cause of employee turnover.


Therefore, orientation is a key engagement tool that helps employees work at their best from the very outset.

, The better the initial orientation, the more likely it is that the employee will learn what they need to learn. This tends to save time for both coworkers and supervisors as they don’t have to educate employee on how to basic tasks on a daily basis.


Through a comprehensive orientation program, the new employee receives answers to questions that he or she otherwise would have to ask at a later date, which could slow their productivity and waste time.

, When a new employee knows what is expected from him or her early on, it becomes easier for them to avoid damaging mistakes and unnecessary blunders. Their attitude and communication methods are steered in the right direction from the very beginning.

Comply with laws regarding harassment, discrimination, and workplace safety.",How to Hire Temporary Workers," Some staffing firms may appear to cost you a bit more money when hiring a temporary employee. However, in the long run a staffing firm may handle a number of tasks and legal requirements that allow an employer to streamline the hiring process and not overburden your human resources person. Some of the benefits of a staffing agency include:


Help you quickly fill a position.
Prescreen applicants to ensure that they meet your basic requirements.
Test applicants to ensure that they have computer or other necessary skills.
Provide training for potential employees.
Pay the employee and manage tax obligations.;
, If you prefer to hire without the aid of a staffing agency, consider looking for employees through mutual connections on your social networks. Websites, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, may allow you to locate potential employees that are recommended from known colleagues or friends., Some social networking websites, such as Facebook, allow you to advertise your position and target the position towards certain demographics. For example, if you are looking for summer help, you can target your advertisements towards college-aged students. This may help you quickly find people who are interested in seasonal or temporary work., If you are looking for seasonal work, consider reaching out to the career services departments of local colleges. These schools may be have job boards for students looking for summer work or work over the winter break. This may allow you to more easily target seasonal job applicant pools, while also creating employment relationships for future full-time positions., Your current employees may be a good recruiting source for temporary workers. They may be able to make a personal recommendation or they may be able to use their own social networks to advertise for the position. This extends your recruiting reach without having to hire a staffing agency., While it may seem obvious that you would interview potential temporary employees, some employers when using a staffing agency may think that this step is unnecessary. However, even with temporary employees it is important to personally judge whether the person would be a good fit for the workplace. When interviewing a potential employee, consider asking the following:


What interested you in this temporary position?
What would you like to learn in this job?
Are you hoping to transition to a full-time position?
Describe a time that you made a mistake at your job and what you learned from the situation.
Describe your ideal work environment., Before hiring a temporary employee, you should consider running a criminal history check that should include additional background information. This helps you ensure that you are hiring someone who has not committed crimes that call into question his or her integrity or honesty. If you are using a staffing agency, ask the agency whether it has already run a background check. Many agencies provide this service for their clients., If you regularly hire seasonal workers, consider reaching out to people you have hired in the past for seasonal work to see whether they are interested in returning. By hiring known workers, you cut down on the hiring process and you also know the type of person who will be joining your company. Many college students who are home on break may want to return to seasonal work. By hiring previous employees, you also cut down on job training., When choosing between candidates, you may want to choose a candidate with fewer skills but who exhibits a “can do” attitude. Often with temporary work, you need workers who are willing to throw themselves into the work in order to get up to speed quickly. A person who is excited for the opportunity and who appears to be able to think quickly on his or her feet may be a better temporary hire than someone who has slightly more training or experience., It is important that you can distinguish between the categories of temporary employees before you hire someone. Depending on the type of employee, you may have different legal requirements. Temporary employees are not independent contractors and therefore you need to comply with a variety of employment and tax regulations.


Part-time employees are generally paid an hourly wage and are required to comply with all company rules and regulations. Typically, part-time workers are not entitled to company benefits such as health benefits, vacation or sick time.
Temporary employees, also called temps, are generally hired to fill a gap in employment needs because of a worker on leave or to cover a position until a full-time hire can be made. Temporary employees may work full time or part time and although they are not necessarily entitled to company benefits, some staffing agencies provide these benefits to their workers.
Seasonal workers are hired on a part-time basis when employers need extra help at a particular time of year. For example retail-clothing stores may hire seasonal workers during the holiday shopping season. As with other temporary employees, employers must comply with federal and state laws., All employers are required to verify their new employees identity and eligibility to work in the U.S. Prospective employees must complete a federal form I-9 and the employer must certify that employee has provided sufficient documentation of his or her right to work. The form must be completed no later that 3 days after an employee is hired., All employees must complete state tax forms and a federal form W-4. This document sets forth the amount of taxes that an employee will have withheld from each paycheck. Employers must withhold taxes even if an employee fails to complete a W-4 or state income tax return.If an employee is being paid through a staffing agency, the agency should have the employee fill out these forms and then would be required to withhold income taxes.

, Even though an employee may be temporary, employers must still provide training so that the worker can perform his or her work duties in a safe manner. Aside from safety, it is important for companies to provide temporary employees with enough training so that the employees can work efficiently and provide the level of work that the company requires of its full time employees.


Even if an employee is hired through a staffing agency, the employer as well as the staffing agency are required to comply with all workplace safety regulations., Each state has different laws that specify whether an employer needs to offer unemployment benefits for temporary workers. Generally, employers are required to offer unemployment benefits to temporary workers but may not be required to offer the benefits to seasonal workers. It is important that you check with your state’s department of labor to ensure that you are following the law., Regardless of whether the employee is part time, seasonal or temporary, all employers must withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from employee’s income. If you hire through a staffing agency and the agency pays the employee’s wages, an employer may not be responsible for withholding taxes. If the employee is technically employed by the agency, the agency should withhold the required taxes., Federal laws that prohibit harassment, discrimination and workplace health and safety are equally applicable to seasonal and full time employees. Employers must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires that part-time and full-time employees be paid minimum wage and overtime pay. Employers are also required to comply with all record-keeping rules and regulations."

First provide the new employee with an overview of the company.,
Then provide a job-specific orientation.",How to Help Orient a New Employee2," This broader form of orientation enables the new employee to understand how the company or organization works in a general sense. This helps the new employee to get familiar with their new workplace. Usually conducted by human resources, this type of overview orientation covers:


The structure of the organization, business units, departments and branches.
Information on general policies and procedures.
Information regarding compensation and benefits.
Information on the physical facilities, and any safety and accident prevention details.
Information on employee and union issues etc.

, Usually it’s the immediate supervisor who helps orient an employee with regards to their specific job responsibilities. This should follow the overview orientation by human resources. This orientation covers:


The particular department’s function and how the new employee fits in.
Introduction to team members and key resources at their disposal.
Information on the specific job responsibilities, expectations and work-related duties.
Information on the department’s particular rules, regulations, policies and procedures.

Contact the new employee.,
Involve the senior management in welcoming the employee.,
Provide a job description, set performance goals and give them an employee handbook.,
Show them around the office.,
Assign the new employee a buddy or mentor.,
Schedule any necessary training sessions.,
Plan an outing for the employee.,
Meet the employee at the end of their first day.,
Schedule a weekly one-on-one meeting for the first 4 to 6 weeks.",How to Help Orient a New Employee3," Soon after the new hire signs and returns their job offer letter, the employer should call the new employee to express their enthusiasm for having a new addition to their existing team. This is best done by hiring manager to whom the new employee will ultimately report.

, The human resource department should encourage the senior management such as the CEO, the company director or the department heads (depending on the level of the new hire) to take the time to send a welcome email or even meet the new employee. This signals that employee is valued by everyone in the organization.


You could also consider asking the new employee's co-workers to decorate their new office or cube as a sign of welcome for the new employee.

, Provide all these details to the new employee early on, so that he or she may review it and have his questions answered. If all of this information can be provided online via the company’s intranet, arrange for an early access.


You may also want to give the new employee access to the company's online staff directory with employee photos, as this will help the new employee to familiarize themselves with the names and faces of their co-workers.

, Take the new employee on a tour to show them the office layout, kitchen, copy and fax systems. Also inform them about telephone usage, the location of the restrooms and any other relevant aspects of the daily work routine.


This also includes includes introducing the new employee to administrative or support staff that can assist them on a day to day basis.

, A buddy or mentor is one of the most important individuals in helping a new employee to get settled, besides their immediate supervisor.


The employer should assign a person with whom the new employee can get comfortable and ask questions more frequently.
The mentor can also be asked to call the new employee and introduce themselves prior to their first day.

, In addition to job-related training, the new employee may require assistance in other area. For example, if the company has computer applications installed for managing day-to-day transactions, the new employee will require training on how to use them.


This initial training session should be followed up with further training on an ongoing basis to help the new employee do his or her job effectively.

, On the employee’s very first day, the supervisor or assigned mentor should take the employee out to lunch or dinner with the entire team. Their spouses may also be invited to this team building activity. This will give the employee a chance to learn more about the company and their new team in a more informal manner.


The employer may also use this as an opportunity to provide a little extra welcome by offering corporate products or cards to make the employee feel special. This will help to build support for the management and strengthen team bonding.

, It’s important that you meet the new employee at the end of their first day to find out how it went for them. You can take a few minutes out and ask if they have any questions or anything they’d like to talk about.


Remind the person that you as an immediate supervisor or mentor are always there if they have any further questions, issues or require support with in something particular.

, During these meeting, you can remind him or her to review the employee handbook, job description and any other company-supplied documentation to ensure their understanding of the organization in general and their own job in particular.


You should also make them aware of the the company's performance review procedure and any relevant documents. Once they are familiar with these, you can go over their personal performance goals.
If you don’t meet with the new employee regularly and only show up when they have a problem; this signals to them that their immediate supervisor is only available when they have a problem. Instead, you should be the first to seek their status on work activities, and hear about their pending issues and working relationship challenges.
Remember that the goal of orientation is to make transitioning to the organization a smooth and enriching process for the new employee.

Know when to switch.,
Decide what to tell your former doctor, if anything.,
Ask your former doctor for a referral.,
Ask around.,
Search online.,
Schedule your first appointment.,
Evaluate your experience.,
Make sure the new doctor will take your insurance.,
Have your medical records forwarded.,
Get organized.",How to Change Doctors," Changing doctors is a serious decision. Sometimes, the decision to switch is out of necessity. For example, if you or your doctor is moving out of the area, then it may be necessary to find a new doctor. Unfortunately, sometimes negligence or poor performance on behalf of your current doctor may prompt the desire to switch. You should consider finding a new doctor if any of the following occur:


The doctor dismisses your complaints, especially if you're older. Elderly patients frequently have doctors who overlook or ignore ailments by simply blaming age.The doctor orders tests or lab work without explaining their reasons.Your doctor interrupts you frequently and does not interact with you for very long during office visits.Your doctor prescribes medication or orders surgeries and procedures without knowing your medical history or with little prior discussionIf your doctor has been involved in any medical malpractice allegations, it might be a good idea to switch.
If you have a specific condition, and your doctor is not a specialist in that area, you need to find a new doctor.;
, When switching doctors, you need to decide whether your reasons for leaving are worth explaining.


If you're leaving your doctor because you were unhappy with his or her services, it's okay to express this. Doctors do like to keep patients happy and their reputation intact, so feedback may help their performance in the future. However, many people are not comfortable with face-to-face confrontation. You could consider writing a letter and mailing it to your doctor's office.If you feel uncomfortable with your current doctor for any reason, it is acceptable to leave without explanation. Doctors are generally busy and may not notice a missing patient, especially if your visits are infrequent., Sometimes, switching doctors is not a result of a bad relationship between doctor and patient. If you and your doctor are on good terms, there's no better source to ask for a referral to a new physician than your former doctor.


Chances are your doctor has a colleague in the area that will make a good replacement. Medical schools are wide-reaching communities and physicians often end up with a nation-wide list of references. Even if you are switching due to a big move, your doctor could still help.
As your doctor already knows your medical history, he or she can help you search for a new physician who can cater to your specific needs. In fact, your doctor may actually suggest you transfer to a specialist if they're having trouble with your particular condition., Seek out the advice of people you trust, like friends and family members, as you begin your search for a new physician.


Ask friends and family members a variety of questions. Ask if they know a good doctor, whether they'd recommend their current doctor, how long it takes to get an appointment, what the waiting time is like, and how long their doctor generally spends with patients.If you're seeing any health care specialists, like an allergy doctor or dermatologist, you could also ask one of them for suggestions. A specialist doctor might be able to refer you to a friend or a colleague., There are a variety of ways to find a doctor through online searches. This can be especially helpful if you're new to the area and do not know anyone who you could ask.


The American Medical Association has a doctor finder tool. Not only can you find doctors in your area who specialize in certain fields, you can also get a sense of a doctor's reputation. Information on medical malpractice records and overall patient satisfaction is available.You can also search online using your insurance provider. They generally have a list of doctors that take your insurance, and you can search by field and location.The Affordable Healthcare Act has a list of providers online. Other websites like healthfinder.gov, also have databases of physicians.Physician rating sites, such as Healthgrades, can be a hit and miss tool for gauging a doctor's competence. People often only post if they loved or hated a doctor, so opinions are often biased or given in response to temporary frustrations., Once you have found a doctor you think might be right for you, you should schedule an appointment as soon as possible. There, you can discuss your medical history and specific needs with your new physician.


When you call to schedule an appointment, have a variety of questions ready. Ask how long an appointment typically takes, how long lab work and x-rays take to process, whether your doctor is board certified, and who sees patients if your doctor is out of town.You will probably be asked to come in 15 to 20 minutes early to fill out forms. Make sure you know your medical history thoroughly before going in and have a list of all your current medications and their dosages. You will also be asked about any drug allergies, or serious reactions to drugs, so make sure you have this information as well.The doctor will ask you about your family's medical history. Do a mental recap before going in of any major illnesses or ailments, like cancer and heart attacks, in your family's history., After your first appointment, you need to consider whether this doctor is right for you. If not, then you can continue to look elsewhere.


Be honest with yourself. Were you comfortable at the doctor's office? Did your new doctor repeat any mistakes your old doctor made? You don't want to switch over and end up with the same set of problems. If you weren't happy with your experience, keep looking.
Was your new doctor able to help you with your specific medical issues? If the new doctor's area of expertise does not apply to your situation, you might want to keep looking.
Was the doctor courteous and respectful during your visit? Poor bedside manner is a reason many people give for switching doctors. Go over the conversation you had with your new doctor and determine whether anything said made you uncomfortable or hurt your feelings. Yet again, you don't want a repeat of past issues.

, Healthcare can get very costly without insurance. Make sure your doctor accepts your insurance plan.


You can call the office and ask or you can check online. Oftentimes, you can even find doctors through working with your insurance company. This is a great way to assure your coverage is accepted.
If you have any questions about coverage and co-pays, clear these up with your insurance company before going in. You don't want to get a big bill you were not anticipating a month after your first visit.

, You'll need your medical records forwarded to your new doctor. This can be done in a variety of ways.


You can request a copy of your medical records over the phone, and some offices even have a Patient Portal that allows you to access your records online. You can have the records sent directly to you and then bring them to your new doctor. Make sure to request items like lab results, x-rays, and any CAT or MRI scans.If you're being referred to a specialist, consultation notes can help your new doctor understand your condition. While these legally belong to your doctor, you're entitled to a copy. You can request these when requesting your records.You can request your records face-to-face at the front desk of your doctor's office. You may be required to pay for the cost of print outs, but the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act means you can only be charge cost-based fees. In general, if there is a fee it's around $20. If you have a lengthy medical record, you may have to pay more., Preparing your own patient history can help smooth the transition. You should also make sure there's no gaps in coverage. You don't want to be left without a doctor during an emergency or run out of a prescription and have no one to refill it.


Make sure that you get a supply of refills for any prescriptions you have with your old doctor before searching for a new one. This way, you won't be left without your meds if the search is lengthy and your prescription expires.Make a running list of your medical history, including medications, allergies, and diseases that run in your family, and give a copy to your new doctor. New patient forms are often brief and it's difficult to include all the necessary information. The more your doctor knows about you, the better."

Define the job duties and qualifications.,
Determine the type of manager the team needs.,
Know your culture and who will fit in.,
Set specified qualifications in the job posting.,
Ask for examples of experience and track record of success.,
Evaluate leadership abilities.,
Throughout the interview, evaluate the candidate's strengths.,
Assess the candidate's communication skills.,
Ask them to describe their management style.,
Gauge the candidate's personality.,
Be patient - do not rush the decision.",How to Hire a Good Boss," The first step to becoming a good boss in a particular role is having an excellent understanding of the job and what is needed to be successful.


Without significant experience, obvious mistakes will be made and the boss's judgment will be questioned by subordinates. Therefore, it is important to define what qualifications your ideal candidate needs to have in order to understand and do the job successfully.
For example, a sales manager should have several years of experience in sales and a strong understanding of the sales cycle and selling techniques. A sales team will not follow a sales manager if the sales manager has significantly less experience than other members.;
, All teams run slightly different, even within the same company. In order to determine what type of manager the team needs, you should evaluate team’s role, how long the team has been doing the same job, how members interact and how they are motivated.


Understanding how the team operates and what works best for them will allow you to find a boss with a management style that suits the team. When a team and their boss work well together, the team will be more successful as a whole.
For example, if the team has been working together for 3 years, maintains good communication and its members can make decisions independently, you will be best hiring a boss that can be more democratic and work with the team to devise the best course of action in a given situation. A strict micro-manager in this circumstance will demotivate the team and should not be hired.

, It is important to understand your company culture so you can evaluate if a potential hire will fit in. Company culture includes, amongst other things, values, beliefs, norms and habits. It is the potential boss’s personality and characteristics that will determine if they are a good fit for the company culture. For example, determine what type of personality will thrive in your company by asking the following questions:


Is the company laid back or fast paced?
Is the company fun or serious?
Does the company encourage new ideas from all employees?
Does your company encourage professional development?

, Once you understand the type of boss you are looking for, place these qualifications and characteristics into the job posting. #*Be as specific as possible in the job posting writing, as this makes it more likely that the right candidates will apply for the job. Most importantly, you will have less of the wrong type of candidate apply for the job.


For example, a sample job posting could be ""sales manager with over three years of sales management experience, with proven ability to motivate sales professionals in a very fast paced environment.""

, Asking for specific examples of the candidate’s experience will probe deeper into a person’s capabilities. It will also give you the opportunity to judge if this person is telling the truth about the extent of their experience.


The best way to do this is to ask open ended questions such as, “Can you tell me about a time when you led your team to exceed sales goals?”

, When speaking to a candidate, ask them questions to determine if they would be a strong leader such as:


Can you provide examples of your leadership abilities and successes with your previous team?
Explain your experience coaching and mentoring others?
Have you conducted training in the past? If so, what kind and how?
How do you motivate others to be successful?

, Throughout the interview, ask yourself a number of questions in order to evaluate whether this candidate is right for the position:


Does this person have necessary skills to be a leader?
Can they grab my attention?
Are they confident?
Can they communicate clearly?
If the combined answers lead you to believe this person is a strong candidate, you may have found yourself a good boss.

, A good leader should have excellent communications skills. This means that person will be able to express themselves clearly and provide direction to others, with little room for interpretation.


A great communicator must be able to communicate well across all mediums so it is important to assess their communication skills during every interaction - including over the phone, in person or by email.

, Try to determine if the candidate's management style will fit the team’s needs. Management style can be difficult to assess in an interview scenario, so the best thing to do is just ask the candidate directly.


For example, “How would you describe your management style?” and “Can you provide examples of how you utilized this management style to meet or exceed your team’s goals?”

, During all communications with the candidate, try to develop an understanding of their personality traits. Examples of positive personality traits include optimistic, trusting, humorous, understanding and encouraging. Then, ask yourself the following questions:


Will this person fit in well with the team and the company?
Does their personality match well with company culture?
Can you see yourself working with this person?
Do you feel team members will be able to take direction from someone with this personality?

, Hiring a boss can take some time, and the higher the level of employment, the longer it can take to find the right person. Good bosses or managers can be hard to find because you are looking for a unique set of skills and abilities to do the job and lead a team to success.


One person may be able to do the job successfully but cannot lead their team to be successful. Another person may be an exceptional leader but lack the subject knowledge necessary to do the job.
Always take your time in finding the right candidate. Making the decision too quickly might result in hiring the wrong person, and this could have a negative effect on your team. The perfect boss for your team is worth waiting for.

Check your state law.,
Advertise the job as “at will.” In your job advertisement, you can state that the job is “at will.” If you think applicants won’t understand what that means, you can say that there is “no guarantee of continued employment.”


You could also state that the job is “month to month” or “week to week.” Use whatever language you think conveys that applicants will not be guaranteed employment.

,
Avoid making promises during interviews.,
Review your offer of employment letter.,
Get new hires to sign an “at will” agreement.,
Remind employees that they are “at will.” You should periodically remind employees that they are not guaranteed employment but are “at will” employees.,
Train managers in what not to say.,
Review your employee manuals.,
Notify the employee of performance problems.,
Document your reasons for the firing.,
Tell the employee the reason for the termination.,
Offer severance.,
Hire a lawyer.","How to Hire ""at Will"" Employees"," In the United States, 49 out of 50 states presume that an employee is an “at will” employee. The one exception is Montana.If you work in any state but Montana, then you can assume that a court would consider all employees “at will” unless you modify the “at will” status with a contract.
Typically, employment contracts are express, written contracts. But you can also create what is called an “implied contract” through your words and actions.
Accordingly, hiring an “at will” employee will require that you don’t do anything that a reasonable person would believe creates an implied contract.;
,, Any statement you make during the hiring process could be interpreted as creating a promise of guaranteed employment. Accordingly, you shouldn’t say anything in the interview that sounds like a promise of guaranteed employment:


Don’t tell the applicant that he has a full year to learn the job and won’t be fired during that period.That’s a promise of continued employment.
Avoid saying that employees get pay raises every year.This also can create an implied contract.
Also remind the applicant that you are hiring an “at will” employee. You can rely on this statement later on if the worker tries to claim that he or she had an employment contract., It is common practice to send a new hire an offer of employment. The letter typically includes information about the start date and the starting pay rate. You should look at your offer of employment letter closely so that you don’t create an implied contract:Make sure that the letter says employment is “at will.”
Include only the job’s starting date, not any end date. If you include an end date, then the employee might think that he or she is guaranteed employment during the term.
Don’t list an annual salary. Instead, state pay in payroll increments. For example, you can state how much the person will be paid in a week.
Don’t ask the employee to sign the letter.

, You should draft an “at will” agreement and make sure that new employees sign it. The agreement should contain the following:Title the document “‘At Will’ Employment Agreement.”
In the opening paragraph, repeat that you are creating an “at will” agreement. Sample language could be, “This is an ‘At Will’ employment agreement between and . In consideration of the mutual promises set forth in this agreement, the parties agree as follows….”
Repeat that employment is “at will.” You could write, “This is an ‘At Will’ employment agreement. Nothing in the Employer’s actions, policies, or in this document shall alter the ‘At Will’ nature of Employee’s status. Employee further understands that Employer may terminate employment at any time for any reason (or no reason), provided that the termination does not violate federal or state law.”

,


You don’t need to go around reminding your employees every week that they are an “at will” employee. That could be awkward.
However, you can remind the employees in other ways. For example, if you perform annual reviews, then you can put the employee’s name on the top of the review form. Include a notation beside the name: “Employment type: ‘at will.’” This is a reminder that the employee is an “at will” employee.

, You can create an implied contract by making oral promises. For example, if a manager says, “You’re such a great employee, we’ll never fire you!” then the manager could be creating an implied contract.You need to train managers in what not to say:


Don’t make promises of pay raises. You can’t say, “Wages always go up here, about 3% a year.” A statement like that could create a reasonable expectation of a pay raise.
Don’t say, “Taking time off is no problem around here. You unofficially get three weeks of vacation.” That sounds like a promise that the employee will get vacation time.
Avoid saying, “We never fire someone unless they get a chance to improve their work effort.” That sounds like a promise that an employee can’t be let go for any reason. With a statement like this, a manager is altering the “at will” relationship.

, Your employee manuals and handbooks can create an implied contract.Accordingly, you should go through the manuals and remove anything that looks like a promise. Instead, you should replace that language with the following:


A reminder that employees can be fired at any time.
A statement that you don’t need “good cause” to fire someone. Be sure to state this explicitly. Also avoid including a list of actions which warrant firing. If you include a list, then it looks like you are defining “good cause” for firing someone.
Another reminder that the employee is “at will.” Use this particular language and mention that the employee is “at will” in several places throughout the manual or handbook.

, You should begin creating a paper trail to support your firing of the employee. Technically, the law allows you to fire an “at will” employee for any reason. However, an angry employee could still turn around and sue you for discrimination or claim that you had an implied contract. For this reason, you should follow your normal discipline and termination procedures. Generally, you should do the following:Tell the employee the specific problems you have with his or her performance.
Then establish goals and a reasonable timetable for meeting those performance goals. For example, if an employee is always late, then state that you want the employee to arrive to work on time for the next 20 business days.
Monitor the employee’s progress. If the employee fails to meet performance goals, then document it.

, Before laying off an “at will” employee, you should have sufficient documentation of the employee’s poor work performance. You should gather all of the following that apply:written reprimands
employee evaluations which note the poor performance
customer complaints
email communications with the employee
attendance records

, Although you are not legally required to give a reason, you should do so nonetheless.Make sure your reason is precise and accurate.


Don’t give a meandering explanation of the problem. Also don’t apologize.
To help craft a precise reason, sit down and write in two sentences why you are firing the employee. Work on your written explanation until it is as concise as possible.
When terminating the employee, you should have the employee’s direct supervisor present. Also have a member of management. The presence of two people suggests that firing the employee was a joint decision., You can reduce the risks of a lawsuit if you offer the employee severance.In exchange for the severance, have the employee sign a waiver and release form. By signing the release, the employee agrees to waive any future wrongful termination lawsuit., You will probably need a lawyer’s assistance at many times in the life of your business. For example, the lawyer can review your employee manuals and handbooks and draft a waiver and release.


To find a qualified employment lawyer, ask other businesses in your industry. See if they would recommend their lawyer. You can then schedule a consultation with the lawyer to discuss your problem.

Decide if your circumstances are such that you will need coverage for long term care.,
Ask the following questions:


What is the commission the agent is going to charge you?,
Analyze the policy to learn how long it will last.,
Understand whether this policy will cover you at any institution you may need to use.",How to Choose a Long Term Care Insurance Specialist," If you have sufficient assets, you may not need it. However, those who do not expect to have substantial and ongoing income in their senior years will want to investigate long term care insurance and find a policy which will be very flexible and long lasting, and which includes the smallest commission possible.;
, This is usually a hidden fee, rolled right into your premium, so be sure to ask.
What insurance products do you offer besides LTC insurance? The aim of this question is to find out if the person's a specialist, selling only or mainly long term care insurance. You don't want someone who divides their attention between LTC, auto and life.
What insurance carriers do you represent? You want someone who offers a choice of A-rated companies that offer a range of solid, affordable policies.
About how many LTC clients do you have? A seasoned specialist will have dozens to hundreds of satisfied clients.
I understand there are tax breaks and other financial ramifications to long term care insurance. Can you advise me on such things? A yes is the best answer here. Well-informed agents know about the relevant regulations, but don't stray into tax law or estate planning details. Instead, they work with knowledgeable financial advisors, accountants, estate planners, and attorneys.
How can I learn more about you? The aim of this question is to find evidence of recognized authority. Do they have any professional designations? Can they name local professionals who recommend them? Are they scheduled to speak at an upcoming event? Do they give talks to groups or companies on request? Can they be found on the Internet?""

, Many policies will cover you only for four years, after which you will need to start blowing through your assets if you are still alive.

, Many facilities are very limiting in who they will accept. If you have a policy which allows you to go only to certain facilities, and those facilities won't accept you because you are diabetic, you will have a problem.

Ask about non-medical therapies for your mental health condition.,
Ask about covered therapies on your insurance plan.,
Ask about alternative therapies for mental health conditions.",How to Choose a Mental Health Therapeutic Method1," Although some mental health conditions require medication for adequate management of symptoms or chemical imbalances, many mental health problems are amenable to non-medical treatments. Even more conditions improve the most with a combination of medical and non-medical mental health therapies.;
, Some health insurance plans offer reimbursement only for specific types of mental health therapies, such as talk therapy sessions, institutionalization, substance abuse rehabilitation treatment, and group therapy.


Your mental health professional may be able to examine your health insurance coverage to find other potentially helpful mental health therapies that are also covered under your insurance, such as massage or acupuncture, or phone-based therapies.







, Some research indicates significant improvements in symptoms for certain mental health conditions with therapies such as art or music therapy, exercise-based therapy, hydrotherapy (water-based therapy or massage), acupuncture or aromatherapy, and herbal remedies.


Work with your mental health professional to build and tailor a mental health therapy plan specific to your wants and needs.

Look for many providers.,
Inquire about their expertise.,
Obtain a recommendation.,
Research who is covered by insurance.,
Find a licensed therapist.,
Call potential therapists.,
Understand the kind of therapy they perform.,
Ask about parental involvement.,
Discuss medication.,
Talk about religious preferences.,
Ensure that you and your child are comfortable.,
Create goals together.,
Notice clear differences in mood and behavior.",How to Choose a Child Therapist," Do an online search or call your insurance provider to find some therapists near you. Depending on where you live, you may need to travel to see a child therapist. Compile a list of providers that meet your criteria, like those who live close to you, work with children, have expertise in your child’s problem, etc. Don’t consider therapists that make you feel uncomfortable for any reason.There are lots of people who can provide mental health therapy, so don’t let the titles scare you. You may see a psychologist, social worker, mental health counselor, or marriage and family therapist. While psychologists tend to have the most training and education, all therapists can provide effective therapy.;
, Find a therapist who specializes in children and families. Don’t see someone who typically does not work with children. If you’re looking for a certain type of therapy, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), see if the therapist specializes in this type of treatment. Ask about their experience treating children similar to your child.For example, if your child is struggling with anxiety, go to someone who specializes in childhood anxiety disorders.
Many therapists have online profiles which outline whether they work with children and what areas they specialize in.

, Many school counselors will have recommendations for child therapists in the local community whom they trust. The school counselor may have some insight as to who would help your child best given their needs. Make a phone call to the school and ask to speak with the psychologist for their recommendations and opinions.Ask your physician for a recommendation. You can also call your local psychological association, universities or colleges, or a local mental health clinic. If you know other parents who have brought their child to a therapist, ask for their contact information.

, If you’re getting therapy through your insurance provider, make sure any potential therapists you are interested in are covered by your insurance. Figure out what your co-pay for each session will cost, and ask about any other additional expenses on top of your co-pay. Call the therapist or the mental health clinic to be sure they take your insurance.Some therapists are private pay only, which means they do not accept insurance and payment is expected in full for each session.

, Make sure your child’s therapist is licensed to practice therapy. Even if the person has a Master’s or Doctorate degree, they may not be licensed. If you look at someone’s website or call a local mental health clinic, there should be indications of a valid license to practice mental health therapy.A simple, “Are you licensed in this state as a therapist?” is all it takes to find out.
Coaches (such as life coaches or mental health coaches) are not licensed or regulated and often do not have backgrounds in mental health. While they may help motivate your child, they may not be able to help with any underlying issues that your child has.

, Once you’ve compiled a list of prospective therapists, find out more information about them. One of the best ways to do this is to call or send an email with your questions or concerns. While you should give them an general idea of the problems your child is having, the most important thing to do now is to talk about the therapist themselves.Some questions you can ask include:

What types of mental health issues do you treat in your practice?
How much experience do you have in treating children with similar issues or symptoms as my child has?
Have you received training in particular treatments that may help my child? If so, which ones? What type of training did you receive?
Will I be allowed to participate in my child’s treatment? If so, to what extent can I be present?

, There are different kinds of therapists and therapy offered. For example, some child therapists practice play therapy, others focus on behavior modification, and still others seek to improve parent-child interactions. Each therapist may approach your child’s problems in a different way. The most important things are that the therapy is effective and that you’re on board.The therapist may offer different approaches depending on what’s going on with your child.
Ask the therapist, “Is this treatment empirically validated for my child?” This means that research has confirmed that the treatment is effective.

, Ask the therapist what the roles of the parents are in therapy. For example, some therapists want children and parents to interact during therapy. Others spend part of the session with the child and the other part with the parents. Still others want parental and/or family involvement throughout therapy. Ask what your role during therapy will be.

Ask if there will be tasks or “homework” for you or your child between sessions to work on skills.

, Most therapists do not prescribe medication. However, they may recommend a consult with a child psychiatrist, who can prescribe medication. If you have strong feelings about medication, talk this over with your child’s therapist and see where they stand.For example, if you are opposed to medications and your child’s therapist encourages you to give them to your child, this can cause conflicts in the therapeutic relationship.

, If you want a therapist with a religious lean, make this clear from the start. If you do not want religion as part of therapy and you are taking your child to a religious therapist, make it clear that you do not want any religious doctrine included in therapy., Your child’s therapist should make you feel comfortable and at ease. You should feel a sense of hope when working with your child’s therapist. If you feel uncomfortable with the therapist or don’t feel like your child is benefitting from their care, consider switching to a different therapist.The therapist should be someone your child feels comfortable talking to, yet you should also feel comfortable speaking and sharing with them.

, When starting therapy, co-create some goals for your child with the therapist. Say what you’d like to improve or change and seek the therapist’s feedback. This most often occurs during the first session and gives the course of therapy a direction in which both you and the therapist can agree upon.Periodically check in with the therapist about your child’s progress and they are working toward the goals.

, Most parents want to know if therapy is ‘working.’ You should begin to notice changes in your child as a result of therapy. You may start approaching parenting through a different model or responding to your child differently. Communicate regularly with your child’s therapist to check in about their progress and goals.Your child’s therapist may give your child some tools to help them cope with difficulties, talk about their feelings, or learn to respond differently to hard situations.

Check with your Better Business Bureau or Chamber of Commerce.,
Ask about their experience with your specific procedure or illness.,
Evaluate your potential physicians' communication styles.",How to Choose a Gastroenterologist2," Make sure your potential gastroenterologists are board certified and formally trained. In addition to a three year residency, a gastroenterologist must complete a two to three year residency for specialized training.Look for one with an active license and no known charges against them.

Look up the website for your state's medical board. Click the link for ""licensee search,"" and type in the gastroenterologist's name, city, and address. This will tell you when the doctor was licensed, what year their license expires, and if they have any complaints or disciplines registered against them.

, Many physician private practices and hospitals have profiles on review websites, such as Yelp. Search for your prospective gastroenterologist on specific review sites, and run a general search on a search engine. You can also contact the office or hospital and ask if they can provide patient satisfaction surveys or testimonials.Remember that online reviews aren't always objective or authoritative, so take them with a grain of salt.

, Contact your local business boards or view their websites. Look for your prospective gastroenterologists’ private practices or for their hospital and check their rating.A Better Business Bureau or Chamber of Commerce rating will give you information about your prospective physicians’ business practices.
You can also get a referral to a gastroenterologist from a Better Business Bureau or Chamber of Commerce.

, A good gastroenterologist should have years of training and plenty of experience performing procedures like colonoscopies. If you have a specific disorder, you should contact your prospective physicians to ensure they specialize in your illness.For example, if you’re having a colonoscopy, you should choose a gastroenterologist who performs more than 100 procedures per year. They should routinely remove any polyps they find during the colonoscopies they perform.
If you have a specific disorder, your best option is to get a referral from your primary doctor.

, Have a conversation with a prospective gastroenterologist to get a feel for their personality and bedside manner. Choose one who makes time for you, communicates clearly, and thoughtfully engages your questions.Ask their office if the physician can spare a minute or two for a quick phone or in-person conversation. If not, you may need to make an appointment to visit them.
Ask the gastroenterologist questions about your required procedure: ""Will I need to be sedated? Do I need to fast before the procedure? Are there any potential complications?""
If you feel that they're rushing you or using unfamiliar, unapproachable jargon, try to find another specialist.

"

Get a list of covered specialists from your insurer.,
Contact your insurer to verify that your gastroenterologist is covered.,
Ask your insurer if any procedures require prior approval.",How to Choose a Gastroenterologist3," In some nations, such as the United States, insurance coverage should be a primary concern when you build and evaluate a list of potential gastroenterologists. You won’t want to choose a caregiver who’s out of your insurance network. If you’re concerned about coverage, you can start your search by asking your insurer for a list of gastroenterologists who accept your insurance plan., If you’ve found a gastroenterologist that you like, ask them if they accept your insurance plan. You should also get in touch with your insurer to confirm you’re covered.When you call your insurer, ask for the name and position of the representative with whom you speak. Keep these and your phone call’s other details in your records in case you have any problems getting your services covered., To avoid a surprise medical bill, look over your insurance policy or call your insurer to find out if a colonoscopy or other procedure requires prior approval. For any procedure, you should also ensure any other specialist or technician, like an anesthesiologist, is in your network.To be completely sure, it’s best to ask the hospital to provide you a list of everyone who could take any part in your procedure, then ask your insurer if those individuals are in-network. Tell the hospital you only want to be seen by in-network medical professionals.

Find a local or Internet support group.,
Exercise regularly as mental health therapy.,
Get involved with loved ones in activities.",How to Choose a Mental Health Therapeutic Method2," Even if you receive individualized therapy or medical treatment, many people suffering from mental health problems find group therapy very beneficial.


If you are uncomfortable or unable to locate local support groups, the Internet has a wide range of chat rooms for individuals experiencing the same type of mental health concerns as you.






Try checking church bulletins, community center lists, and local newspapers for support groups such as Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, depression or postpartum depression support groups, and other helpful group therapy opportunities.







, Mounting research demonstrates a strong link between exercise and higher levels of feel-good chemicals in the brain.


Because many common mental health problems are caused or influenced by chemical imbalances in the brain, exercise may help increase and maintain levels of beneficial hormones or chemicals.






Exercise, especially when combined with a varied and healthful diet, can help stabilize and improve mood, reduce impulsivity, relieve anxiety and irritability, aid in sleep, boost energy, and promote feelings of calm and contentment.







, Spending time doing regular activities and interacting with friends and family has a twofold benefit as a portion of mental health therapy: it reduces feelings of isolation or disconnection and helps maintain an engaged lifestyle.


Spending time with others can help repair damaged relationships caused by symptoms of your condition and provide you with support that may be very helpful during your treatment.






Staying involved with everyday activities and events also encourages you to focus on recovery and a sense of normalcy instead of illness and negative thoughts.

Receive professional therapy through online chat rooms.,
Consider video or voice therapy online.,
Try telephone therapy.,
Use the Internet or phone book as resources.",How to Choose a Mental Health Therapeutic Method3," Crisis websites and professional psychologists or psychiatrists often have online chat options.


Some may be free, but others charge a membership fee, a per-session fee, or can be billable with certain insurance plans.
If you are trying to receive chat therapy with a professional mental health therapist, check their references, qualifications, and experience prior to paying anything for therapy.

, Although typed conversations may be sufficient for some therapeutic impact, it is not likely ideal for many individuals. You may benefit much more through voice chat or video chat with a trained mental health professional.


Online video and voice treatment options often carry a per-session fee or per-minute charge and require you to have certain multimedia tools such as microphones or video cameras.







, Many therapists and mental health professionals offer phone consultations and therapy sessions.


Telephone mental health professionals often charge flat session fees or per-minute fees. Check their credentials or get a referral from a trusted mental health professional before paying for phone-based therapy to avoid scams.







, Many mental health professionals and alternative treatment professionals have websites, phone-book listings, and advertisements to help you find their services.


Search for local practitioners to find professional therapists of many types in your area.

"
Consider your comfort level with other people.,
Decide whether you can appreciate alternative therapies.,
Evaluate your health status.",How to Choose a Mental Health Therapeutic Method4," Group therapies and busy treatment centers may be challenging for you if you struggle with anxiety, fear of crowds, or if you have limited interpersonal skills.


In such cases, it may be better to work individually with a therapist (even on the Internet or phone if necessary) before transitioning to group options.







, Acupuncture, hydrotherapy, and other alternative mental health therapies are unlikely to be as effective if you carry significant skepticism or doubt about them.


If you prefer more Western treatments, opt for them over alternative therapies.

, If you suffer from other health problems or if your mental health condition is highly variable, individual therapies may be most beneficial.


Consult a health professional before beginning exercise regimens, using herbal therapies, trying hydrotherapy, or selecting other mental health therapeutic methods to make sure you are healthy enough to participate.






If your condition causes violent outbursts, unpredictable behavior, or lapses in awareness of behavior, you may need intensive individualized therapy supervised by a mental health professional or institutional staff.

Ask people you know for a recommendation.,
Look online.,

Make sure they take your health care plan.,
Check their qualifications.,
Decide if you require a particular specialization.,
Check with the state dental board.,
Look for online reviews or ask for references.,
Determine their convenience for you.,
Schedule a consultation and ask about their general practices.,
Assess the professionalism of the office and all staff.,
Schedule a general exam.",How to Choose a Dentist," Friends, family, co-workers and neighbors are great resources when you need to find a service care provider. You might also ask your doctor or pharmacist. Good questions to ask include: What they like about the dentist and/or office? Is there anything they don’t like about it?
Ask how long they typically wait, and how available the dentist is for questions or emergencies.;
, Find a dentist near you who is a member of the American Dental Association by visiting their website.You can also find dentists through the online yellow pages and other advertising sites.


Be wary of any advertising that claims a dentist’s service is “superior” to others’. This is considered unethical in most states., Your health insurance provider can likely provide a list of dentists participating in their coverage. You can also call faculty members at a dental school, if there is one near you, or a local hospital to see if they have an accredited dental service.You can also call the Academy of General Dentistry’s referral line—1-877-2XA-YEAR. Call your state dental society and ask for a list of recommendations. These associations can provide a list of ADA member dentists., If you have dental insurance, be sure to ask any prospective dentists if they accept your plan. Many smaller companies have a limited number of participating dentists, and dental work can be extremely expensive.

, Dentists must either be a doctor of dental surgery (DDS) or a doctor of dental medicine (DMD). These degrees are equivalent and require the same coursework, including two years or pre-dental college classes and four years of dental school.They also must pass national and state exams to be licensed practitioners.Call and ask the office from which school this dentist earned his or her degree.Also ask how long they have been with this particular practice, and how long they have been practicing in general. A newly graduated dentist might have both advantages and disadvantages over an established dentist, particularly in terms of availability, cost, experience with difficult cases, and approachability, but it is really a personal preference. The important thing is that they can answer these questions.
Do they regularly attend conferences or take continuing education classes?You may want a dentist who stays up-to-date on the latest health information and techniques, especially if you plan to have major work done on your teeth.

, Dentists can also get certified by state boards to specialize in certain areas after completing at least two years of advanced schooling.If you know you need a certain type of work done or are looking for a dentist for your child, you might want to find a specialist in one of these areas:Endodontics (root canal therapy)
Oral Pathology (dealing with oral cancer or lesions) or Surgery (removal of teeth and tissues)
Orthodontics (braces and repositioning teeth)
Pediatric Dentistry (cares exclusively for children and teens)
Periodontics (care of gums)
Prosthodontics (full mouth rehabilitation)

, Each state has an online registry on which you can track any history of claims made against a dentist practicing in that state. Google your state’s board of dentistry to find their website.Be wary of dentists with cases brought against them for misconduct or patient dissatisfaction.

, If you found the dentist online, check for reviews on websites like Google and Yelp. If you were referred to this dentist by a friend or saw their ad somewhere, call and ask if they can provide a list of references.


Be wary of reviews on the office’s or dentist’s own webpage. Consider them in conjunction with those on other sites they are not associated with.
A bad review or two doesn’t mean the dentist is no good. Read the whole review and assess whether there was a good reason for giving a dentist a lower score.

, Are their hours flexible according to your work schedule? Is the practice located conveniently near your home or office? Do they have emergency hours or dentists on call at all times?


Not all dentists will meet all of these preferences. Decide which is/are the most important to you.
If you do not get paid time off for medical visits, you will probably prefer a dentist with a wider range of hours.
If you drive an SUV that gets ten miles to the gallon or have to take your children to multiple extracurricular activities, you may put location at the top of your list.

, Before scheduling any dental work or appointments, ask for a consultation so you can visit the office, meet the dentist, and ask him or her questions about the service they would provide you.Questions for the dentist include: what kinds of anesthesia do they use?; do they provide anything special to help you feel more comfortable during dental work, like noise cancelling headphones?; will they go over all procedures with you in detail and answer any questions you have?
Questions for the office staff include: what is the policy regarding missed appointments?; how long in advance must you cancel for no fee?; does the office have dentists on call at all times, and if so, how do patients reach them?
You might also want to ask for price estimates on common procedures, so you can compare their costs with other dentists you are considering.To perform pricing research for your procedure, you may access a credible source to obtain surveys directed to dental pricing per geographic region and dentist specialty.

, Make sure the office is clean and examination rooms are sterilized properly. Determine how friendly and helpful the office staff and dentist are in general.A rude office staff will make all of your visits frustrating, and might make you feel taken advantage of since you are paying for services you could get elsewhere. If the staff isn’t respectful, walk out and find another office to visit.
If the dentists and staff are rude to each other, this could indicate a bad working environment. You want to visit an office where everybody gets along and is able to work together in your best interest.

, This exam includes a cleaning and x-rays. Evaluate how well you get along with the dentist, how comfortable you feel with them and their office and whether they do a complete job. Do they show interest in your health? Do they ask you questions about your medical history? If not, then at most they are “putting out fires” instead of addressing underlying problems. Move on to your second choice.
Are they personable? Do they exhibit patience and explain anything you don’t understand completely? If they cannot explain why you have to have a treatment or procedure, then maybe you don’t really need it. And if they aren’t concerned with making you as comfortable as possible, you aren’t getting the best treatment money can buy.
Do they demonstrate professionalism, including valuing your time and money?

Deal with depression.,
Recognize signs of bipolar disorder.,
Know about schizophrenia.,
Deal with anxiety.,
Get help processing trauma.,
Help your relationship.",How to Know when to Get Mental Health Counseling1," Everyone gets down sometimes, but persistent feelings of hopelessness, despair, loss of interest or anxiety lasting more than two weeks can be indicative of clinical depression. If the symptoms become severe enough that they are disrupting daily activities or your quality of life, a counselor or health professional might be able to get you feeling more like your old self.;
, Although no one knows what causes bipolar disorder, it seems to run in families and is a mood disorder that can severely affect your life. Bipolar disorder can be tricky to diagnose and its symptoms vary. But the main signs to look for are dramatic and unpredictable mood swings. A person with bipolar can have bouts of mania where they become excessively happy, a swell in energy and grand, racing thoughts. This mania is often followed by bouts of depression that can bring anxiety, sadness and even suicidal thoughts.

, Contrary to public opinions on schizophrenia, it rarely comes with multiple personalities and is almost always a non-violent mental illness. If you’re dealing with any of the symptoms of schizophrenia, see your doctor quickly to manage the illness. Schizophrenia is a serious disease and can cause difficulties in distinguishing between reality and the imaginary. This can mean you are seeing things that aren’t there, paranoia, extreme fixations, and other bizarre behaviors that can rapidly erode one’s ability to live a normal life.

, We all feel anxiety from time to time but for some people it can be a crippling experience. If you’re having anxiety that affects your ability to function either at work or socially, you may have a generalized disorder. Anxiety can be marked by excessive worry regularly for at least six months, irritability, sleep problems and other general negative feelings.
There are different types of anxiety that can be brought upon by certain situations or triggers. For example, if everyday social situations trigger anxiety you may have social anxiety disorder. Other types of anxiety include panic disorder, a feeling of sudden terror accompanied by physical symptoms or phobias that are triggered by events like flying or specific objects, like spiders.

, Many times, individuals have trouble coping with a recent trauma, such as a car accident, child abuse, sexual assault or loss of a loved one. Although grief and sadness are normal emotions, a mental health counselor can help make the process easier. If you are experiencing debilitating and persistent difficulties, seeking out help might make your coping easier. Some of these symptoms may include: anger, fear, anxiety, racing heartbeat and difficulty sleeping. It is normal to feel these after a trauma but if they are disrupting your life and months pass with no alleviation, you may need an expert to help.

, Sometimes it’s not just an individual that needs help but partners in an unhealthy relationship. If your relationship with your significant other is increasingly a point of stress and contention, you might benefit from professional counseling. It’s always difficult to recognize and admit problems in your relationship. If you notice you and your significant other having trouble communicating, arguing with increased regularity, and find one another a source of stress, it might be time to seek outside help. Every relationship has issues, but remaining vigilant about early problems could save you and your partner down the road.

Research alternative ways to get your therapy.,
Interview prospective therapists before you commit.,
Visit your therapist.,
Gauge your therapist’s perspective and their intentions.,
Commit to the process of therapy.,
Educate yourself on the current views of LGBT issues in the psychological community.,
Looks for a therapist who shares your values.,
Identify the terminology and techniques used by illegitimate, gay-conversion therapists.,
Look for signs that a therapist might not be sympathetic.","How to Find a Supportive Therapist if You Are Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Transgender"," Make sure to specifically seek out therapists that list themselves as ""LGBT-affirming."" After all, you want a therapist who will affirm your LGBT identity and help you reach a better place mentally while being who you are.


Consider referrals from friends in your community.
Look at the Yellow Pages.
See if there is a LGBT community center or support groups that might point you in the right direction.;
, There are many places on the internet to find a list of mental health professionals that can help you, including professional association websites, forums, support group websites and more. Consider the following:


Search for mental health professionals at https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms

Consider a referral from the Association of LGBT Psychiatrists at http://www.aglp.org/index.php

Use the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association’s Provider Directory athttp://www.glma.org/ to look through a list of inclusive medical providers.
Check out the Healthcare Equality Index at http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/healthcare-equality-index to find the LGBT inclusive policies of organization leaders in healthcare.
If you are Transgender, consider the following resource at http://www.drbecky.com/therapists.html., LGBT sympathetic therapists are not available everywhere. However, distance therapy is a possible way to get the therapy you desire. Some therapists offer different forms of distance therapy in an effort to reach a wider range of people in various locations and across distances. Phone therapy and online therapy are effective means to engage a LGBT-affirming therapist from outside of your community., Don’t limit yourself to just “therapists.” There are a wide range of mental, health, and social welfare professionals who might be able to provide the guidance and support you need. Consider the following:


Licensed Clinical Social Workers: These social workers have clinical experience. You'll often find them working in group settings.
Licensed Addiction Counselors: Addiction counselors are not therapists, but work in a similar capacity.
Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists: These therapists specialize in family and marriage issues., Now that you’ve located a few therapists, it’s time to contact and interview them. You can do this through an initial consultation, but it might be better and more cost effective to vet your therapist through a very short phone call in which you ask a few questions.


Ask them if they have any LGBT friends or family.
Ask them if they are up to date on the latest scholarly work in their field on LGBT issues.
Ask them if they've worked with other LGBT people.
Ask them if they are comfortable talking about LGBT issues and if their personal or religious feelings might get in the way.
Above all, ask them to be as open an honest with you, as you will be with them.

, After you’ve interviewed your therapist, you need to schedule an appointment in order to have more time to evaluate them and your comfort level with them. If you don’t feel comfortable, and the therapist did not address all of your concerns and seem sympathetic, then you should go else where. After your initial visit, consider the following:


Did this person seem at ease with you?
Did he or she talk openly about your sexuality or gender identity?
Did you feel comfortable?, Your therapist should not reinforce negative messages prevalent in society about LGBT people. They should suggest positive coping strategies to deal with the discrimination you experience. Positive coping strategies can include:


Setting boundaries with harmful people in your life.
Joining an LGBT group.
Finding volunteer work in the community.

, Now that you’ve researched, interviewed, and chosen your therapist and decided you are comfortable with that person, you should commit to a course of therapy. Working through your issues, whatever they might be, will probably not be a quick or easy process. Therapy is often an on-going process and it might take months or even years to begin to work through your problems. As long as you are in a positive and affirming relationship with your therapist and you feel it is helping you heal and grow, you should stick with the process!

, There have been many positive changes since the days when not being heterosexual was viewed as a disease. However, other areas like gender identity are unfortunately sometimes still viewed through a pathological lens. Some of the main points to remember are:


Being LGBT is not an illness, and those who say it is are in disagreement with the findings of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Medical Association.
No science has backed up theories that being LGBT results from having parent problems during childhood. Therapists who still advocate that view are not only on dubious scientific footing, but are reinforcing the negative messages about being LGBT.
Attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity are ineffective and harmful.
Being LGBT in and of itself has not been found to be a source of mental illness or to result in rates of mental illness higher than the general population. Instead, stresses an individual faces from homophobia cause a great deal of mental anguish for LGBT people. Therapies that ignore this can increase rates of suicide, anxiety, and depression in the those being treated., Counselors who advertise as working within a certain religious structure are outwardly advertising that they will be using this as their value scaffolding in their therapy. This is not to say you cannot find a therapist who is both religious and LBGT-affirming, nor is it to say you can't be of a certain religion and also be LGBT. Talk to a potential therapist about his beliefs and values, and whether or not he has a moral stance on LBGT issues. If he is not supportive, then this is not the counselor for you. Fo not allow anyone to try to change you to conform to his own religious morality.

, There are many therapists, religious and non-religious, who specialize in making you “normal” and turning you heterosexual. Be aware of their tactics and their terminologies so you can identify them. If your therapist does use any of these tactics or terminologies, you should probably go elsewhere. To help identify gay-conversion therapists, consider these questions:


Does the therapist insist you're a ""confused heterosexual"" and not respect your gender or sexual identity?
Does the therapist spend a lot of time talking about how your parents treated you when you were very young?
Does the therapist ignore your mental health concerns and insist you engage in gender “appropriate” activities?
Does the therapist reject the idea that it's okay to be LGBT?

, When looking for a therapist, you need to be aware that not all therapists will be open and sympathetic to LGBT issues. If they are not sympathetic, your experience will probably not be a positive healing experience. There are a number of things you should consider and be aware of when you choose a therapist:


It's not safe to automatically assume potential therapists will be knowledgeable or sympathetic to LGBT issues.
There are still many therapists and psychiatrists who may view LGBT people as inherently mentally ill, or troublesome, or in need of a 'cure' for their identity.
Therapists might not openly lead with their biases, but if you ask them directly you should be able to get a sense of where they stand on LGBT issues or the issues closest to your needs.
You might also want to ask a potential therapist whether or not they themselves are comfortable sharing what their orientation is, and whether or not they are out of the closet. Some therapists will adhere to a professional standard of never disclosing their own orientation to their clients, and you may have to decide whether you would be OK with this.

Watch for dramatic mood swings.,
Seek help immediately if you have suicidal thoughts.,
See if you're prone to self-harming.,
Get help if you struggle with substance abuse.",How to Know when to Get Mental Health Counseling2," Dramatic mood swings may be an indication that counseling is useful for your mental health or the presence of a mental illness. Beyond normal moodiness during puberty, pregnancy, menopause or other stressful life events, serious mood swings can be an indication of a larger problem.


Mood swings are excessive or abrupt changes in your frame of mind or emotional status. For example, you may shift from euphoria to extreme sadness abruptly and often with no environmental trigger. These can indicative of mental health issues like bi-polar or a personality disorder. If you notice yourself or a friend experiencing persistent, worsening, mood swings, you should seek out mental health help. , If you or anyone you know is thinking about suicide, you should seek professional help immediately. Whether you’re thinking about taking your own life, or suspect a friend, it’s important to recognize this and seek help. Suicidal behavior and tendencies can vary from individual to individual. Some telltale signs include: talking about suicide, seeking out means of self-harm (such as pills or a gun), withdrawing from all social contact, rapid personality changes or engaging in risky, self-destructive behavior.
There’s help. Suicidal thoughts can be scary and even embarrassing but no one needs to face it alone. You should reach out to a close friend or loved one and make an appointment with a counselor. If these aren’t options, call a suicide prevention hotline like 800-273-TALK.

, Although suicide is an extreme version of self-harm, other forms can be an indication of emotional pain and distress that could benefit from a professional.


Self-harm can include cutting one’s skin, burning one’s self or even sticking objects in your skin. If you notice a friend who may be doing these, or if you are yourself, there are safer long-term ways to deal with stresses that cause self-harm.

, Addiction and mental health have strong links and individuals often self-medicate. If you or a friend increasingly find drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with emotional issues like stress or anger, it might be time to seek out help in order to find safer alternatives. Although it’s fine for legal aged adults to have a drink to unwind, there are early warning signs that an over reliance on substances may be problematic. These include a family history of addiction, neglecting responsibilities because of substance use, dangerous and reckless behavior while intoxicated, needing more of a substance for the desired effect and spending increased time thinking and using the substance. If you notice these characteristics in yourself or someone you know, a mental health counselor may be able to find other more healthy coping mechanisms.

Talk to your primary care physician.,
Determine what type of counseling you require.,
Locate a mental health professional.,
Know what to expect.,
Be open and honest about your feelings.",How to Know when to Get Mental Health Counseling3," It can be overwhelming to navigate all of the options for mental health counseling. Your primary care physician will have experience dealing with medical conditions like depression and can recommend your next step.


Let your doctor give you a mental health evaluation. Your doctor will be able to assess whether your struggles will benefit from counseling or whether medical treatment is necessary. Many mental illnesses like depression or bipolar disorder can be helped with medication.

, Using your doctor and other resources, you’ll need to decide what sort of counselor to seek out. This can vary depending on for what you’re seeking help.


If you think talk-based therapy will help you, there are licensed therapists and social workers. These can range from those with Master’s degrees to doctorates in psychology. With the help of your doctor you may decide that a psychiatrist and biological approach using medicine will be most helpful. If your relationship needs help, licensed marriage or relationship counselors may be best.

, Once you know what type of counseling may work best for you, you’ll have to start narrowing down concrete options.


Use your doctor. Your doctor likely has experience dealing with mental health as well as knowledge of your medical history. They may be able to recommend a colleague they think will be a good fit.
Look online. You have to be careful about this but a simple search can bring you options in your area as well as reviews. You can always contact the professional before meeting to assess whether they can help you and the experience they have in treating similar problems.
Check with your health insurance provider. If you have insurance, this will not only help from a cost standpoint but they may also be able to help facilitate you finding the specific help you need.

, Once you decide it’s time to get help, you’ll have a lot of different options open to you. Based on your physician's advice, the nature of your problem, and your own research you can find the type of therapy that's best for you. Individual therapy. Individual psychotherapy usually entails sitting down one on one with a mental health professional, talking about your problems and taking steps to address your issues in a healthy way. This could be through talk therapy or more traditional methods like psychoanalysis that try to uncover subconscious issues.
Group therapy. You may do better in a group setting where a support group is guided by the expertise of a mental health professional.
Interpersonal therapy. This is a type of therapy that focuses on how you interact with friends and family. It seeks to improve communication and build up self esteem and can address a number of issues like depression and anxiety.
Cognitive behavioral therapy. This is a particular type of therapy that attempts identify and change behavioral and perceptual problems causing distress. This can be helpful in creating new ways of thinking and new ways of acting that reinforce positive emotional well being.

, It can be really hard and even scary to admit that you’re struggling. If you experience any of the above signs, seeking out help as soon as possible.


Sometimes it can be hard to talk to a doctor or stranger about your deep feelings. If you have a trusted friend, family member or someone like a pastor, they may be a more comfortable place to start. It is always easier to share your burden with someone you trust and care about.
Make sure you're comfortable with your therapist. It can be hard to discuss such personal, often painful feelings if you are not comfortable and trusting with your choice. If you find you don't click with your first choice, don't be afraid to explore other options. As you get further into the process you will start to gain a clearer understanding of what makes you comfortable and what works best for you.

Volunteer.",How to Become a Cardiologist," You may already know exactly where you want to go to medical school, but if you don’t, you should start looking at the possibilities as soon as possible. This will be very similar to your experience searching for an undergraduate program. Don’t just pick the top medical school in the country for that reason. Instead, search for a school that will be a good fit for your long-term goals, financial limitations, and personality.There are many factors to consider. For example, some medical schools focus mostly on research while others focus on patient care. Some focus on a specific specialty and many don’t. Medical schools even vary on levels of competitiveness. For example, Johns Hopkins is famous for being cutthroat, but other universities might offer a more collaborative atmosphere.
Don’t forget to consider things like location, weather, and student life. Though these may not be the top things to consider, they are still important. For example, if you cannot stand long, cold winters, a school in the Northeastern United States may not be the optimal experience for you.;
, The MCAT is a written, multiple-choice examination. It looks at your ability to think critically and problem-solve, and tests your knowledge of the natural, behavioral, and social sciences. The exam usually takes about eight hours to complete. Most undergraduate students take this exam during their sophomore or junior year of college.


There is a nearly limitless amount of study material available for the MCAT. See what materials and courses are available through your university, or visit the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) website to view and purchase study materials: https://www.aamc.org/.

, Once you’ve made a list of all of the medical schools you believe to be a good fit, you’ll need to start the application process. If you are applying to a lot of medical schools it is important to stay organized. Take note of applications deadlines and any applications fees that must be paid.You could consider creating a folder for each medical school you want to apply to. On the front of each folder, write down the name of the school, the date the application is due, and a checklist of each document that is to be submitted as part of the application, as well as the address or website where you must submit the application.
You will need letters of recommendation as part of each application. Don’t put off asking for these. Be sure to take note of whether the medical school has a template for the recommendation letters and how they are to be submitted. Make this clear to the people you will be asking.
Many medical schools use American Medical School Application Service (AMCAS) and others use the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). This is nice because these application services do some of the work for you, but they do require a $160 fee that includes one medical school. Each additional medical school you wish to apply for costs $38.

, Your professors will play an important role in your medical school experience, and will also be important for landing a position in a good residency program. This is because they are often the ones responsible for writing letters of recommendation. Put your best foot forward in medical school so that your letters of recommendation will be favorable.These professors will also act as mentors, and the relationship you have with them largely depends on how you use that relationship. If you don’t take an interest in building a professional relationship with your professors, then they won’t either.
You will be continually challenged in medical school. This is because professors want to see who is cut out to become a doctor and who isn’t. You will need to study the information you are learning very hard so that you can put that knowledge to use without supervision.

, During your first two years of medical school, you will be required to take the first of three steps towards becoming licensed. There are two different types of licensure examinations offered in the United States: the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX). The USMLE is required for licensure for medical students attending medical schools that confer a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree but may also be taken by medical students attending medical schools that offer a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. The COMLEX is required for licensure of DO medical students. Both examinations are taken in three stages (known as levels or steps). The first stage of each series of exams is very rigorous and includes 8-9 hours of testing on about 300 questions. This test examines your basic understanding of science and how it is applied to practicing medicine.It is important that you study extensively for this examination. Be sure to take full advantage of any study materials available to you. You can find practice materials for each step of the examination process on the USMLE and COMLEX websites: http://www.usmle.org/. http://www.nbome.org/comlex-cbt.asp

You must pass these exams in order to move on in medical school and eventually to receive a license to practice medicine.

, In your third and fourth year of medical school, you will likely move your education to the hospital. In the third year, you probably won’t get much say in the rotations as all medical students are required to spend time working in each of the fundamental specialties; however, in your final year, you may get to speak up about what you’re interested in. This is when you should try to focus on cardiology as much as possible.Don’t forget that you will be required to write an essay for your residency application. During your rotations, try to keep a journal of your experiences and interactions with patients. You can then use this journal to write a great essay about why you would make a good resident in their program.

, In your final year of medical school, you will complete the second of the three steps for licensure. The second step of the USMLE and COMLEX examinations are separated into two parts. The first of which tests your clinical skills (Step 2 CK for USMLE and Level 2 CE for COMLEX) through a written examination.The second part (Step 2 CS for USMLE and Level 2 PE for COMLEX) is an exam that looks at your ability to work with patients.Step two of the examination is administered over a two-day period.
As with step one, you will need to prepare yourself for this examination extensively. Visit the USMLE and COMLEX websites for practice materials.

, Medical school is a very challenging time in the life of a student, and you may think that you should spend all of your time studying; however, getting involved in extracurricular activities and continuing to volunteer in the limited spare time you have will continue to build your CV, and will also provide a network of mentors, friends, and peers that can provide academic and emotional support during this time.Don’t underestimate the importance of social support during medical school. Your friends, family, mentors, and peers will be vital for this. This also means that you should do your best to find the time to be something other than a medical student. For example, don’t feel bad going out to have coffee with friends sometimes.

, In order to become a cardiologist, you’ll need to complete a three-year residency in internal medicine. Interviews for residency positions usually occur during December to February of your final year of medical school. The day when residency positions are announced is commonly known as “Match Day” and occurs in March of your final year of medical school.You will need to apply to residency programs around the country/world, much like you did for your undergraduate and medical programs.

, The final test for licensure is usually taken at some point during the residency. The final step is a two-day exam. The first day involves a written, multiple-choice exam consisting of ~250-300 questions that test your knowledge of basic medicine. The second day involves observing your assessment skills.The first day of examination usually takes about seven hours.
The second day of examination usually takes around nine hours.
COMLEX Level 3 is taken in a single day

, Like the residency, the fellowship is typically also three years. During this time, you’ll likely split your work between seeing patients and learning from experienced cardiologists, and doing research.Once you have completed your cardiology fellowship, you will be able to become certified by the American Board of Medical Specialities (ABMS) and/or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) as a cardiologist.

, During your cardiology fellowship, you’ll have the chance to choose your specialty. There are several specialties that you can choose from, including: non-invasive cardiology, invasive, non-interventional cardiology, interventional cardiology, and electrophysiology.Be sure to understand that a cardiologist is not a surgical field. If you want to become a cardiac surgeon you will need to pursue a surgical specialty instead of a cardiac specialty.
Pediatric cardiology is also a tract separate from cardiology, requiring three years pediatrics residency and three years pediatric cardiology fellowship.If you wish to be a pediatric cardiologist, you must pursue a pediatric specialty.

, A cardiologist has a wide variety of choices when it comes to employment settings. For example, you could be employed by a government agency, a hospital, or a research lab. You could also be employed by a private practice, or you could even open up your own if you wanted to.Opening up your own medical practice is a big commitment, and may be especially challenging if you don’t have a lot of experience working as a cardiologist. Many cardiologists work in a hospital or a practice owned by another doctor to gain some experience before venturing out on their own.

, Cardiologists are typically very well-paid, but it is important to understand that the amount you are paid for your work depends on a range of factors. If you work in a big city, you will probably get paid significantly more than if you live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Keep in mind, though, that this is also due to cost-of-living factors. It will probably be tremendously expensive to buy a nice home in the middle of a big city (or even in the suburbs), but you will probably be able to afford your dream home in a smaller town on your salary.There may also be significantly more competition in a cosmopolitan city that everyone wants to live in. It’s all about comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different job opportunities.
The median salary in 2014 for the lowest paying cardiology specialty was over $245,000 and the median salaries only increased from there.

, Because of the prominence of heart disease in developed countries, a job in cardiology can be a busy one. On a day-to-day basis you can expect to: diagnosing heart problems, prescribing medication, conducting medical procedures related to the heart, and giving health advice to patients.Day-to-day duties can vary widely depending on the type of job you hold. For example, if you take a job that focuses on research you might not see patients at all.

, Becoming a member of this association is a good idea because it helps you network with other professionals in the field, gives you access to continuing education, and will help you stay informed about new developments in the field of cardiology.You can even join the AHA while you are still a student. Memberships range in price from $78.00 up to $455.00 per year depending on the level of membership and the benefits included., The ACC is another respected organization that you might want to consider becoming a part of. As a member, you will be connected with thousands of other professionals in the field, and you will be given access to relevant medical journals, which can be very valuable.The initial cost to join the ACC is a little over $900, but the cost to maintain your membership is only around $150 per year.Note that to become a member of the ACC you will need to prove your qualifications and provide letters of recommendation.

, In high school, you may not have much choice in what classes you take, but where you do have a choice, try to aim high. If your class offers AP or Honors courses, take them, especially if they are in science courses such as biology and chemistry.If your high school doesn’t offer advanced science courses, look for any advanced courses they may have. For example, courses in literature, history, or economics. AP/Honors courses may help you earn college credit, which looks great to prospective universities.
Take as many courses in math and sciences as you can. You want to have a strong foundation in these subjects before entering university, if possible.

, You may think your grades aren’t that big of a deal in high school, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. If you want to become a cardiologist, you will need to think about long-term consequences of your decisions, which starts with earning good grades in high school. Developing discipline when it comes to studying and doing well in academics will help prepare you for what is to come in your undergraduate classes and medical schoolIf you are struggling in a course, take steps to find a tutor, or go to the teacher after class to ask questions and get help. Most teachers will be happy to spend extra time helping you if they can see that you are taking the work seriously.

, It is never too early to start thinking about where you would like to complete your education after high school. You’re going to need to complete an undergraduate degree and go to medical school. Start thinking about your long-term plans. If there is a particular medical school you’ve always dreamed of going to, look into their undergraduate programs. Make a list of things that are important to you in a university, and go from there.If you’re not sure where you’d like to go to university, then you can take a more practical approach. Think about how far you’re willing to travel for your education. In the United States, it is more affordable for most students to stay in the same state that they hold residency.
Most of the Ivy League schools have great pre-medical programs, but these universities are extremely competitive (not to mention extremely expensive). You can certainly apply to these programs but consider other universities as well.
While a huge university might have more resources and prestige, consider the fact that professors won’t be as accessible. You may spend four years with a professor without ever getting a chance to speak with them one-on-one. On the other hand, a smaller university may not have access to the latest educational technology, or access to top internships, but you will get to know your professors much more easily.

, Once you have a list of schools you are interested in applying to, you can look into the entrance requirements for these universities. Almost all universities will require you to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and many others will require that you take the ACT as well. Doing well on these exams can make the difference between getting into your top choice or not getting into any of your top schools so it is important to take these very seriously.There are many options when it comes to preparing for these tests. You can attend preparation courses for both the SAT and the ACT, but these tend to be expensive. You can also study on your own using one of the many study guides available. Be sure to check your high school library for these study guides before purchasing.

, If you are still in high school, you should do this well before you graduate. If you have already finished high school, you can apply as soon as you have all of your application materials ready and the application period is open for your prospective universities.If you are planning to apply to several universities it is a good idea to begin preparing your materials well in advance. Make a list of required application materials for each university you want to apply to. Make note of deadlines and application fees as well.
Remember that universities are looking for more than grades. Think of everything you have done that will be impressive to a university. This includes volunteer experiences as well as extracurricular activities.
If you are still in high school, start work on your applications in the summer before your senior year begins.

, Many students believe that, in order to get into a good medical school, you must be a pre-med major or a biology major. This is not true. More and more, medical schools are looking for students with well-rounded liberal arts education. This means that, in some cases, you could actually major in English and still get into a good medical school.If you do major in pre-medicine or biology, consider rounding out your education by taking classes in a variety of subjects. This will give you the best of both worlds by preparing you for what is to come in medical school, while also demonstrating that you’ve gained knowledge in a variety of subjects.

, Volunteering is a good idea for many reasons. It gives you a chance to see what it’s really like to be a cardiologist, which can help you figure out if this is really what you want. Volunteering looks great on a CV, and it will give you experience in the field, which is valuable for many reasons. Try volunteering at a local cardiologist’s office, or any kind of medical clinic where you can gain experience.Even if you can’t find a volunteer opportunity in something related to medicine or cardiology, you can still volunteer. Look for volunteer opportunities that help people in need. For example, you can volunteer with Habitat for Humanity or at a local soup kitchen.
If a university or medical school must choose between two academically impressive students, they will likely choose the student with volunteer experience.
Some programs, such as Gap Medics, offer pre-medical students an opportunity to shadow doctors abroad, but you must be at least 16 years old."
"
Understand the financial arrangement.,
Check the therapist’s qualifications.,
Prepare any relevant documents.,
Gather a list of medications you are taking or have taken recently.If you are already taking any medications for mental or physical health, or if you have recently stopped a medication, you will want to come prepared with the following information:


Name of the drug(s)
Your dosage
Side effects you are experiencing
Contact information of the providing doctor(s)

,
Write reminder notes.When meeting for the first time, you may have lots of different questions and concerns.,
Keep track of your appointment schedule.Because therapy is meant to provide you with a safe space to work on yourself, time must be managed wisely.,
Journal about your recent feelings and experiences.Before arriving, spend time really thinking about the things you want to talk about and your reasons for wanting to begin therapy in the first place.,
Rehearse expressing your uncensored thoughts and feelings.,
Tap into your inner curiosity.,
Remind yourself that this therapist is not the only therapist.",How to Prepare for a Session With a Therapist," Knowing what sort of coverage your insurance plan offers for psychotherapy or how you plan to pay for therapy is very important.Check your description of plan benefits for information on behavioral health services or coverage for mental health. When in doubt, ask the human resources representative of your insurance company directly.And, ask the therapist if they accept your insurance before making your first appointment. Otherwise you may have to pay out of pocket when you could be seeing a therapist in your insurer's network.


When you meet, remember to take care of payment, scheduling, and insurance questions at the start of the session. This way you will be able to end the session sharing, without the disturbance of logistical issues like calendar checking and payment.Know that if you see a therapist in a private practice, they may provide you with a receipt that you will submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You might be responsible for the entire cost of the visit up front, and then be reimbursed through your insurance company.;
, Therapists come from many different backgrounds, and have different forms of education, specialization, certification, and licensing. ""Psychotherapist"" is a general term, rather than a specific job title or indication of education, training or licensure. The following are red flags, indicating that the therapist may not be properly qualified:


No information provided about your rights as a client, confidentiality, office policies, and fees (all of which would allow you to fairly consent to your therapy)
No license issued by the state or jurisdiction in which they practice.
A degree from a non-accredited institution.
Unresolved complaints filed with their licensing board.

, The more information your therapist has about you, the better they will be able to do their job. Helpful documents might include reports from previous psychological tests or recent hospital discharge summaries. If you are a student, you may also want to bring recent grades or other recent markers of progress.


This will be helpful during your intake interview, when the therapist may ask you to fill out forms about your current and past physical and emotional health. By streamlining this part of your visit, you and your therapist will have more opportunity to get to know each other on a person-to-person level.

,, In order to address everything you want to know, write some notes reminding you to gather all the information you need. Bringing these to your first session will help you feel less confused and more at ease.


Notes might include the following questions for your therapist:

What therapeutic approach do you use?
How will we define our goals?
Will you expect me to complete assignments to do between sessions?
How frequently will we meet?
Will our work together be short-term or long-term?
Are you willing to collaborate with my other health care providers to treat me more effectively?



, Once you are in the session it’s the therapist’s job to keep track of time, allowing you to focus on answering questions and adjusting to the feel of therapy. But, it’s up to you to get yourself to that point. Be aware that some private therapists charge for missed appointments, and these fees are not covered by insurance.

, Write down specific things you want someone helping you to know about you, like what makes you feel upset or threatened. Your therapist will be prepared to ask you questions to stimulate discussion, but it's more useful for both of you to spend time thinking beforehand. If you're stuck and don't know what to do, ask yourself the following questions before the session:


Why am I here?
Am I angry, unhappy, distressed, afraid....?
How do other people in my life impact the situation I'm in now?
How do I normally feel on a typical day of my life? Sad, frustrated, afraid, trapped....?
What changes do I want see in my future?

, As a client, the best way to ensure effective therapy is to break your own rules about what is appropriate to say and what should be kept secret In privacy, speak out loud to yourself the strange thoughts that you would not normally allow yourself to voice. The freedom to explore your impulses, your thoughts and feelings as they arise, is one of the key sources of change in psychotherapy. Just getting used to voicing these thoughts will make it much easier to access this part of yourself in a session.


Your uncensored thoughts can also include questions. You may be interested in the therapist's professional opinion about your situation or about how your therapy will operate. Your therapist will be responsible for providing this information, to the extent possible.

, You can practice the expressing your deepest thoughts, feelings, and concerns by asking ""why"" questions. As you move through daily life leading up to your session, try asking yourself why you are feeling a certain way or thinking certain thoughts.


For example, if a friend or co-worker asks a favor of you that you feel resistant toward, ask yourself why you are resisting helping them. Even if the answer is a straightforward ""I don't have time"", go further, asking yourself why you feel you can't or shouldn't make time. The goal is not to come to a conclusion about the situation, but to practice pausing and trying to understand yourself more deeply.

, A good personal match between client and therapist is crucial to the success of the therapy. If you put too much stock into your first meeting without this consideration, you may feel compelled to carry on with a therapist who is not completely well-suited to help you.


Did you leave the first session feeling misunderstood? Does your therapist's personality make you a little uncomfortable? Maybe your therapist reminds you of someone you have negative feelings toward? If the answer is ""yes"" to any of these questions, you may want to consider finding a new therapist.Know that it is normal to feel nervous during your first session; you will become more comfortable with the process.

Many families make an effort to say they will help you, but if you need 24-hour care, this may not work.;
, Select three to five centers. You can get personal advice from friends, find recommendations or run an internet search.


Call them first to be sure they take your insurance.
Ask a few questions over the phone, but be sure to ask about visiting on your own or on a tour. There's only so much you can find out over the phone.

, For example, how far are they willing to drive to visit you?  It’s likely they may have a preference of less than 15 minutes away, but you may want to be out in the country, for example.

,  The better (RCs) have separate designated areas for rehabilitation.  Be honest with your limitations, medical needs, even concerns about any mental anxiety or depression.  Ask to tour the entire complex with or with or without a representative.  See the rooms, the dining hall, the activity center, common areas, and especially the rehab space.


Make sure to ask questions at these centers. When can family visit? Can your pet visit?  Can you bring you own food, activities, table, pillows, blankets, or whatever will make you more comfortable? How often can you have a shower?
If the center seems inflexible at first, that is a sign of possible trouble ahead. If they won’t let you go down a certain hall unsupervised, (within reason) they will probably limit where you can go on your own once in their care.
Note cleanliness, alarms going off un-answered, lack of staff, the expressions of staff and patients, friendliness, and if administrators seem less than honest. Ask about any language barriers, how often doctors make their rounds, if there is always someone on call. Ask about the daily schedule.  
Security is important. Many centers now have push-buttons to enter codes to enter certain areas.  This is to secure patients with dementia, and to keep out those who do not belong.  Ask about the doors now, if you know you don’t like being confined.
Amenities, such as large windows, birds in cages, patios, gardens, gazebos, a TV, will all make your stay nicer. They will have books, magazines, board games, and puzzles, but if you are an active person, don’t rely on them. 
If you knit, crochet, or sew, bring them with you along with a task light. Bring a drawing pad and color pencils, DVD’s, your cell, a laptop, journals, cameras, batteries, letter paper and stamps, a foot massager, photos, music, different size containers or zip-bags for supplies, and your favorite snacks. Bring special lotions, your personal hair brush, hair dryer, warm socks, or anything that will make the stay feel more like home. A potted plant or beta fish may be allowed.  You will need a laundry bag and a sharpie to write your name on your clothes if the (RC) does your laundry. Let your friends know where you will be.

, They will need to determine when you get out of the hospital, and a social worker will set up where you are going to stay. Tell them your first-third pick and they will call to see who has beds.

Get plenty of sleep.",How to Stay Upbeat As You Age," Social connection is vital as you age. Make an effort to stay in contact with family and friends. Arrange times for family to visit you, and engage in activities with friends. Find other upbeat individuals and spend time with them. Make an effort to meet new people and build friendships through classes, activities, and hobbies.Make social events a priority by having regular meetups with friends and family. For example, have karaoke, bowling, or movie nights. Have rotating dinner parties with friends each week.
If you are not able to see people in person, then arrange to talk to them via phone, Skype, or FaceTime.;
, Especially if you fear feeling isolated, volunteering can be a great way to meet people and converse with others. Volunteering can also be fulfilling and add depth and meaning to your life. Meet other volunteers and contribute to something that feels meaningful to you.Find an opportunity to give back that feels meaningful to you, such as volunteering at the library, an after-school program, animal sanctuary, or spiritual center.
Look online for volunteer opportunities, check out bulletins at local community spaces (like the library), and ask your friends to see if they know of places that are looking for volunteers.

, As you reach older age, you may experience more and more loss. Yet, loss can help you see what is important and precious to you. Through loss, you learn to enjoy what you have for however long you have it.Find the things, experiences, and people you feel grateful for and express that gratitude. Savor meaningful moments when you have them and say “thank you” often.


Start a gratitude journal or write three good things that happened during your day. By focusing on things that went well in your day, you can stay more upbeat and positive toward your daily experiences.Try writing a couple of “thank you” notes to people who have helped you out or lifted your spirits.

, Being optimistic about the future can help you stay upbeat as you age. While some people feel like old age means losing your abilities, think about gaining opportunities to do and see things you’ve never done before. See the positives in other people and your own experiences by not dwelling on negative experiences.Having a positive outlook can affect more positive outcomes during aging and mental function.Try to see the silver lining in situations and events. For example, if you need to start a new medication, be grateful that you have medications to help you stay healthy.
Ask friends and family to hold you accountable with maintaining a positive attitude. For example, if they notice you express displeasure about something, then they could prompt you to find something positive to say.

, Pick up an old hobby or try something new. Find enjoyment in your activities to have something to look forward to every day and as a way to create something. Finding meaning in enjoyable activities can keep you upbeat and looking forward to each day. For example, if you used to play bridge every day, start up a bridge group to keep playing and enjoying your time with other friends. Pick up a hobby such as pottery, glass blowing, or learn a new language.
Start traveling or going to museums or spend time in nature by going on walks.
Be sure to schedule in enjoyable activities and don’t just leave them up to chance. Scheduling them in will help to ensure that you actually get a chance to do them.

, Set some goals for yourself and aim to achieve them. Having something to work toward and complete can create a feeling of mastery and accomplishment. Think about something you want to accomplish or experience, and figure out how to go after it. For example, if you’ve always dreamed of attending live theater, find a show, invite some friends, and have a night of fun. Having goals and pursuing them can contribute to feeling fulfilled and prideful in your life.Your goals can be big or small. Perhaps you have a goal to travel the world or complete a painting. Whatever you choose, take steps to achieve your goals and find satisfaction in the steps along the way.
After you complete a goal, be sure to take time to commemorate it in some way.

, Keep your spirits up by laughing regularly. Find humor in difficult times and situations, laugh at life’s absurdities, and maintain a light heart.Even when things are looking down, find something to lift your spirits or make you laugh. Try calling up a friend and watching a funny movie, going to see a play, or watching a stand-up comedy routine.


When things start to feel difficult, look for a way to lighten the mood. For example, if you lose your glasses, laugh at the irony of looking for the very thing that helps you see.
Keep a collection of items or written memories to help you reflect on things that make you laugh or smile.

, If you tend to worry often, give it up. While it’s normal to be cautious as you age, excessive fears can keep you from living and enjoying life. Worries can keep you from living in the moment and enjoying yourself.Take a deep breath and say to yourself, “I can’t control everything, but I can choose to enjoy each moment.”

, Retiring without having a plan for how you will fill your time often leads to cognitive decline, depression, and deterioration of health. Find activities that stimulate you and challenge you. Keeping your brain active can help you to stay sharp and alert. Maintain a part-time job, read books, do crossword puzzles, or practice sudoku puzzles. Engage in debates or learn one new thing each day. Continue to learn new things and have new experiences.Doing something novel can help you engage your brain in different ways and keep you sharp.

, Being fit can help your body stay healthy and can help you continue moving with ease. Exercise can help maintain your mind, body, and vitality. Go for walks, join an exercise class, lift weights, or do water aerobics.Walking is a great, low-impact way of exercising. Grab a pair of comfortable shoes and take a walk around your neighborhood or local nature preserve.

, One way to stay upbeat is to fuel your body in order to function optimally. Eat nutritious foods, limit alcohol, and cut out smoking.Get adequate rest and take naps during the day if necessary. Staying physically healthy can help keep you feeling good.


Schedule regular medical check-ups to stay on top of your health.

, Find some healthy outlets for stress, such as relaxation. Practicing relaxation for 30 minutes each day can help keep depression away and help to stabilize your moods.Find relaxation methods that feel good and that you want to do every day. Try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation.

, Getting enough sleep is crucial for all around good health, but it is one of the things that may become disturbed as you age. Be sure to maintain a regular sleep schedule as you age and aim for between seven and nine hours of sleep every night. Some things you can do to improve your sleep include:Going to sleep and waking at the same time every day.
Keeping your bedroom dark, cool, and inviting.
Avoiding caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime. These substances can both disrupt your sleep.
Using your bed for sleep and sex only. Do not eat, work, or watch TV in your bed.
Shutting off electronics at least one to two hours before bedtime. The light from your smart phone, tablet, TV, and computer can keep you up at night.

Exploitation may include illegally taking or hiding the financial assets of the elderly person for someone else’s benefits.
Emotional abuse includes purposefully inflicting mental pain or anguish on the elderly person through verbal or nonverbal acts. These acts may include humiliation, intimidation or threatening the elder.
Abandonment means that the person responsible for the care of an elderly person fails to take care of the person by not showing up at their home or other place care where care was to be provided.
Self-neglect refers to the failure of an elder to take care of him or herself to the point that their physical health and well-being may be compromised.;
, Depending on they types of abuse inflicted on the elderly person, there are a variety of signs that indicate elder abuse. These signs may include:


Bruises, broken bones, cuts, scrapes, or burns.
Changes in behavior, such as withdrawing from normal activities, a change in cognitive abilities or alertness and depression.
Signs of assault around the breasts or genital area.
Loud fights or arguments between the caregiver and elder.
Tension between elder and caregiver or elder acting timidly.
Poor hygiene, rapid weight loss or other unattended medical needs., If you suspect elder abuse or you are generally concerned about changes in the behavior, hygiene or personality of an elderly person you should speak with them. While many elderly people may feel embarrassed or fear retaliation from a caregiver, some elders may also be looking for support or someone to speak to about what is happening to them.


Some elders will deny abuse is occurring even when it is obvious that they are being abused. This is particularly true when the abuser is a family member.
Even is an elder denies the abuse, you should still report suspected abuse to the proper authorities who can investigate the matter., If the elder is someone you know and you suspect abuse, you can contact the elder’s family and discuss the abuse with them. They may be able to intervene more quickly by firing a caregiver and making the report to the police.

, If you suspect that an elderly person is being abused, you should report the abuse to the appropriate governmental authority that can intervene. Depending on the circumstances, there are a number of resources for reporting elder abuse.


If you suspect that the elder is in immediate and potentially life-threatening danger then you should call the police or 911.If you suspect elder abuse but do not believe that it is life threatening, you can call the Eldercare Locator by phone at 1-800-677-1116. Trained operators on the hotline can provide you information on local resources and other assistance. The hotline is open Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Time.You can find state-by-state resources on where to report elder abuse at: http://www.ncea.aoa.gov/stop_abuse/get_help/state/index.aspx

If you are living outside of the U.S., some elder abuse help lines in non-U.S. countries include: UK: 0808 808 8141 or Ireland: 1800 940 010 (Action on Elder Abuse); Australia: 1300 651 192 (Elder Abuse Prevention Unit); South Africa: 080 111 2131 (Age In Action); and for resources in Canada visit http://www.albertaelderabuse.ca., It is not your responsibility to prove that elder abuse is occurring but rather to provide the authorities with a detailed report about your suspicions of elder abuse. When making a report, consider including the following types of information:


The name, address and contact information for the elder you suspect is being abused.
Provide information about the elder’s family supports, if any.
The identity of the person you suspect is abusing the elder.
Your contact information.
Any of the elder’s known medical conditions
Specific information about the abuse, such as incidents of bruising, yelling or the failure of the elder to care for himself or herself.
Continue to report additional incidents of abuse., After you make a report, Adult Protective Services (APS) in the area screens all help line calls and makes a decision about whether a report rises to the level of elder abuse in violation of state laws. APS may assign a caseworker to conduct an investigation into the alleged elder abuse.


In emergency cases, a caseworker may conduct an investigation within 24 hours of the report.
If APS does not believe that elder abuse is occurring, they will try to coordinate with social and health services to provide assistance to the elder in need.
It is important to note that an elder can refuse assistance from APS. Unless the elder is incapacitated, APS has to respect the elder’s wishes.
In addition to APS, local police or district attorneys may also investigate claims of elder abuse especially if the report mentions physical or sexual abuse.
In the case of abuse in a nursing home, state’s have long-term care ombudsman programs that are specifically responsible for investigating and resolving nursing home complaints., If an elder is being cared for in his or her home, you should be aware of potential risk factors for elder abuse. These risk factors may include:


A caregiver’s substance abuse habit, which may place an elder at increased risk of financial abuse.
A history of domestic abuse may place the elder at higher risk for abuse later in life., By calling the elder and visiting often, you will have a better sense of what is occurring in the home or nursing facility. Try to establish a trusting friendship so that the elder may come to you if he or she is feeling abused or concerned about his or her physical welfare. Additionally, try to provide the caregiver, particularly family member caregivers, with a regular break. This may help an increasingly overburdened or frustrated caregiver from lashing out at the elder., If you are an elder, there are steps that you can take to protect yourself against elder abuse. These steps include:


Getting your legal and financial affairs in order so it is more difficult for someone to steal from you.
Maintain regular contact wit friends and family members so that you do not become isolated and more vulnerable to abuse.
If you are unhappy about a caregiver tell someone that you need a change.
If you are being abused, tell someone so that they can help you or provide you with the phone number to report the abuse yourself., Acting as a full time caregiver can be emotionally and physically draining. If you are feeling overwhelmed, angry or frustrated by the caregiving demands, you may need help.


Ask for help from friends and family or local respite care agencies. Even a short break may help you feel better.
Use an adult day care program for the elder to provide you with assistance in your caregiving responsibilities.
Take care of your physical and mental health needs. If you are feeling depressed, you should speak to a counselor or therapist since depression may lead to elder abuse.
Join a support group with other caregivers of elders., One reason that an abused elder may refuse to report abuse is because he or she believes there are no other caregiving alternatives. If an elder expresses this concern, consider the following:


Take the elder on tours of assisted living facilities to demonstrate that there are alternatives to home care.
Offer the elder assistance services on a trial basis such as house cleaners or a weekly home health aide to assist the elder with discrete tasks.
Inform them of support services and other outside programs that can help held reduce the demands on the caregiver and the elder."
"
Visit your elderly loved ones often.,
Provide breaks for caregivers.,
Look for physical changes.,
Pay attention to emotional changes.,
Have money automatically deposited into a bank account.,
Research caregivers and living facilities.,
Encourage your loved ones to stay social.,
Help them keep their personal information safe.",How to Prevent Elder Abuse1," Visiting your elderly loved ones will keep them from being lonely and strengthen your relationship. Plus, the more often you visit an elderly loved one, the more aware of his situation you will be. This will help you keep track of his health, financial situation, and well being.


Be sure to look for risk factors of elder abuse, which are outlined later in the article.;
, Whether the main caregiver for your elderly loved one is a family member or hired help, she may need a break from time to time. It can be hard to be the one solely responsible for an elderly person, and these breaks will help give the caregiver time to regroup and destress.


This will help lower the chances that the caregiver will, intentionally or unintentionally, commit elderly abuse.

, When you visit your elderly loved one, pay attention to physical changes. Look for bruising, scrapes, and other physical injuries. Also pay attention to his hygiene, the state of his clothing, and general physical well being.


If you notice something off, ask him what is going on to see if there is an explanation for the change or injury.

, When you interact with your loved one, notice any changes in his emotional state. Note if he is more irritable, confused, unhappy, removed, anxious, or depressed. If you see changes, ask him if there is anything going on that you can help with or that may explain his change of temperament., If you are worried about your elderly loved one's finances, especially if you cannot be around him as often as you like, think about streamlining his finances. Instead of having checks sent to him in the mail, have all of his money deposited into his bank account each month.


Also look into having his bills, such as utilities, house payments, or other recurring bills, taking out of his account every month instead of needing to pay them month to month. This avoid needing to have others in charge of paying his bills and will keep him covered.

, If you hire an outside caregiver to take care of your loved one, so plenty of research into their company and history before you hire anyone. This will ensure that you hire the best person possible for your loved one. Do the same if you are looking into an assisted living arrangement or retirement home.


If you aren't sure, ask for recommendations from your doctor., In order to keep your loved one happy and healthy, encourage him to be active. Get him involved with a senior group, a church group, or other social grouping that will get him out of the house.


The happier your loved one is, the less likely he will be to put up with or be a victim of elder abuse., If you are worried about your loved one's personal and financial information, encourage him to take measures to keep it safe. Put financial documents in safe places and have him discuss any changes he wants to make with you.


Have him draw up living wills, power of attorney documents, and other legal documents that will allow you or other family members to take over his affairs if anything should happen."

Recognize physical abuse.,
Look for sexual assault.,
Watch for psychological abuse.,
Recognize financial abuse.,
Watch for neglect.",How to Prevent Elder Abuse2," Elder physical abuse is when physical force or violence is inflicted on elders that results in pain, bodily injury, or physical impairment. A sub division of physical abuse is domestic abuse, which is when a spouse is responsible for physical abuse. Signs of physical abuse include:


Bruises and injuries
Broken bones
Dislocations, sprains, or fractures
Scrapes on any part of the body
Burns from cigarettes, hot water, or appliances
Unexplained or suspicious injuries
A change in behavior towards others
Differing explanations of how injuries occured, Since elders can be weaker than others, they may be the target of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is when any elderly person is subjected to unwanted sexual contact of any kind, from groping to intercourse, especially when he or she does not have the mental capacity to consent. Although the majority of sexually abused elders are women, it can happen to men as well.


Signs include physical pain, tenderness, or bleeding from the genital or anal region, bruises on the inner thighs or genitalia, clothing that is torn, bloody, or stained, and difficulty walking or sitting when there was no previous issue., The elderly may be subjected to psychological abuse. This type of abuse is the intentional and willful infliction of mental or emotional duress or anguish through humiliation, threats, or other verbal means. Common indicators of psychological abuse include:


Depression
Uncharacteristic confusion
Problems sleeping
Being emotionally withdrawn, upset, irritable, or non responsive
Signs that can be attributed to dementia, such as rocking or biting
Unexplained weight loss or weight gain
Unexplained stress symptoms, such as high blood pressure, Financial elder abuse covers any activity that takes the money or resources from an elder under questionable circumstances. This includes taking money or property, forging a signature to gain resources, using property or possessions without permission, taking money for services not given, and scams or cons of any nature. Signs include:


Unpaid bills
Withdrawals from accounts that can't be explained, which may be frequent
New legal documents
Missing property
Suspicious signatures on legal or bank documents
Implausible explanations of elderly finances by the caregiver or family, Neglect is when caregivers neglect to fulfill their responsibilities to provide adequate care. This can be active neglect, which is when they purposefully withhold care from the elderly person and may be motivated by financial gain or personal conflicts. It can also be passive neglect, which is when the caregiver does not have adequate knowledge, resources, ability, health, or maturity to be the proper caregiver anymore. Signs of this include:


Lack of necessities such as food, water, and heat
Inadequate living arrangements, such as poor ventilation, lack of utilities, unsafe wiring, and improper ventilation
Infestations of animals or insects
Medical mismanagement, including out of date, empty, or unmarked prescriptions
Presence of bedsores, skin rashes, or other preventable skin ailments
Improper hygiene
Dehydration
Absence of necessary aids, such as glasses, walkers, dentures, hearing aids, or braces
Untreated medical conditions, such as infections, soiled bandages, and unattended sprains or fractures"
"
Recognize the risk factors.,
Discover who can commit elder abuse.,
Consider common locations of elder abuse.,
Report elder abuse.",How to Prevent Elder Abuse3," There are certain factors that make an elderly person more at risk for elder abuse. These include being over 80 years old, having advanced illness or dementia, being in social isolation, or a history of domestic abuse or physical and verbal aggression., Anyone who comes into contact with the elderly can instigate abuse, including sons, daughters, acquaintances, children, grandchildren, or in home nurses. This means that anyone who takes on a caregiver role as well as anyone who has continued access to your elderly loved one., Elder abuse can take place in any setting. This means you should be aware of the current living situation of your elderly loved ones whether they live in their own home, in a nursing home, in an assisted living facility, or with another loved one.


Always be vigilant of your loved one's surroundings to ensure you notice any changes that might suggest elder abuse., If you suspect someone you love is being abused, you should report it. Take down as much information as you can about the situation as well as the name, address, and contact information for the elder being abused. Also provide contact information of their loved ones if possible, as much of the elder's health that you know, and your own contact information.


There are online databases where you can find someone to contact about elder abuse in your area, which should be done by state or country.

Be honest with yourself.,
Separate your self-worth from societal expectations and images.,
Realize you are still developing.,
Appreciate what you have.,
Enjoy sharing your hard-earned maturity.,
Remember what joys you've already had.,
Re-assess your own priorities, goals, and strengths.,
Get ready for the next stages.,
Fight depression or mental crises.,
Find new things to do.,
Use your age to do what you couldn't do before.",How to Stop Feeling Over the Hill," Whether you admit it to anyone else or not, at least know inside yourself your true status in life. We all grow old and die, we all slow down. The evidence is all around us. Be realistic.;
, You can only live as yourself, not an expected image or model. You might not be the rocking or running boomer you see around you (an image). You might not get the face-lift or other means to try to arrest your development. You might not need to do or be them. Nor are you the kid you may still feel inside yourself. Look in the mirror. The kids think you are old for sure! That doesn't degrade your self-worth and dignity.

, Yes, even now you are growing, maturing, learning new depths, gaining insights, becoming a better person. You can do many more things, study more, go more places, have more experiences.

, You may have family, hobbies, a career, enough health to do what you like, friends, interests, thinking power. Use all you have to keep exploring the world and yourself. Don't compare yourself to your kids, but to who you were before, and how you will continue to be a useful person in our world.

, You now get to be the senior, the expert, the one younger people can look up, emulate. You are the role model, the leader, the exemplar. You are the Wise Woman or Eminence Grise. Since you are this already, you should enjoy it and fulfill the role well.

, Don't pout over losing the past, but remember what good times you've had and be happy for them. Realize that you've done wonderful things with the life you've been given, and if you are cut down tomorrow, you've had a good time already.

, These may be different from before, given your increased maturity. You aren't a kid anymore, and you must act and think like that. You can't pretend to have the energy or physical presence to pull off what you could before. Instead, you have a future to plan for, a family to deal with, perhaps elderly parents yourself to take care of.

, You've heard it before, but now that you're half-way there, you'd better think of how to ensure your own future. This shouldn't depress you, but energize you to prepare yourself for what you can see is coming.

, With your new-found perspective, you can better judge and evaluate who you are, how to appear to others, and how to handle a mature life. Men especially seem to fight this process (hence ""mid-life crisis""), and the ability to maintain a psychological balance is critical to not jumping off the deep end (read: young girl, big Harley, or sudden divorce).


For women facing menopause, remember that life is not only about sex. It may have been when you were young, but now you become the Wise Woman of many cultural tales. You can be graceful, well-dressed, nicely scented and made-up, and hold yourself with poise and easy confidence. Encourage your male acquaintances to talk about their appreciation of their female peers, without feeling like you are competing with your daughter. You can't. You're past that.

, You never stop learning or experiencing. Life is not over or a dead-end. Be useful to society around you, or even just do things for yourself. Pursuing social, spiritual, or personal activities won't put you in a position where people are disapproving of you, but instead will show you in a positive light. If you must seek the approval of others to not feel ""old"", then find places where your efforts are wanted and needed. Younger people always need mentors, models, a steady and mature hand and eye.

, They say ""eccentric old people"": you're not quite old yet, but now is as good a time as any to begin to be who you really are, or wanted to be. While being mature, you can now indulge some harmless fancies; you always wanted to do your bathroom in purple, or take up the clarinet, or put up beaded curtains in the kids' old room. Yes, you can weave baskets or take up wood-carving.

Get a notebook.,
Take your time.,
Consider different areas of your life, so that you can look at different aspects separately.,
List the different ""categories"" of achievements you hope to attempt in your life.,
Write down some goals for each category.,
Write down some big goals and some small goals.,
Consider the first list your ""rough draft"".,
Get inspired.,
Talk with other people about your list.,
Ask yourself more specific questions.,
Actively look for new things to add to your list.,
Refine your list, choose the goals that are most important to you, and pursue them.","How to Write Your Own ""100 Things to Do Before I Die"" List"," This may sound like an obvious step, but many people create their list of things to do before they die mentally. While there is nothing wrong with thinking about the things you want to do, writing them down is an important part of remembering, and finally actually achieving your goals.


Consider getting a small notebook that you can carry around with you. Then you can work on your list whenever you are.Spend a little extra money and get a durable notebook, if you can afford to. This can help the list last over the long term.;
, Writing a long list of things you want to do before your die can take a while. You do not need to try to finish it in one sitting. Add to your list over over months, maybe even years. It never has to be “finished.” Eventually you’ll build a very long list.


If you think of something new, take a moment to add it to the list. Your list will grow over time, and you will think of things to add even when you are not deliberately sitting down to add things.This approach will help prevent you from getting frustrated.

, Maybe you're someone how spends twelve hours a day at work, but make sure you don't only think about work or business goals.


Varying your goals across different areas of your life will help you develop a list that can improve all aspects of your life. , A few examples might be these:



Relationships. Finding your soulmate, having children, seeing your children grown and having children of their own is one train of thought.

Sporting achievements. This may include shooting a 70 on a golf course with no handicap, or a hole in one, or it might mean catching a blue marlin, driving a stock car, or pitching a no-hitter. One consideration on this category is being realistic about your ability, and present age.

Success in business or work. Many people happily live full lives at a 9 to 5 job shuffling papers, owning a house in the suburbs, and taking the family to the local diner on Friday nights, but this may not be your idea of a goal in life. Look at possibilities, list them, and find out what it will require to achieve them.

Philosophical goals. These are a little more difficult to describe, but they may include being a good neighbor, sharing your beliefs, or finding the meaning of life. Your list does not, and probably should not, reflect only material goals.

Making a difference. Here, you can really challenge yourself, be it finding a great scientific discovery that ends suffering from a tragic disease, or establishing a foundation to help underprivileged children.

Artistic achievements. There are a number of possible goals here, from writing a novel destined to become a classic, to painting a masterpiece.

Travels. You may long to take a trip to Europe, Alaska, or the North Pole. You may even want to travel to space, and even though you may never make it there, put it on the list, and see what opportunities arise to make the dream a reality.
Do not limit yourself to these categories. They are just meant to give you some suggestions. Instead, let your imagination run wild. Be as creative as you can be. , Keep a notepad handy, and use your imagination to list anything that comes to mind.


Be open ended, you do not need to know exactly how you will achieve every goal right now Just get them down on paper. If you limit yourself at this stage, you might miss out on things you genuinely wanted to try to accomplish.
Don’t be afraid to keep items in some goals private. Do not limit yourself based on what you assume other people will think about your goals. Write them down now, and keep the list private if you want., You should think big, but also small. A mix of big and small goals will give you things that you can accomplish regularly. Not every goal has to be something for the far future.


Create small goals that can lead you to your bigger goals. For example, dance at home, then take a dance lesson, then go dancing in public. When your small goals lead to your bigger goals, you will lead yourself to long term success.
Write something on your list that you can do today, tomorrow, and this week. If you include items you can accomplish in the short term, you will feel like you have created a list you can actually accomplish., Add to it, or take things away. After all, it is just a personal list. It is yours to expand, change, or reduce.


Keep this original list and continue to work with it. The list itself is important, because it serves as a reminder of all the things you want to do.
Be willing to change your list, but also think carefully before making changes. If you take adding and subtracting from the list seriously, you are more likely to take the items on the list seriously.

, Find inspiration outside of your usual routine. Keep a notebook with you when you are doing things like hobbies that you enjoy. You never know when a new and unique thought will cross your mind, and from a thought, a whole universe of possibilities emerge.


Try some new activities, go hiking, or just get away from your usual daily life. This can inspire you to think of goals that would not have occurred to you while sitting at home. , You should to consider talking to people who are older than you. Especially if you are young, you may not appreciate what many people later in life consider important.


Seek out people who have worked on their own bucket list and find out about their experience. Use their experience to help inform your own list.
Likewise, seek out people who are currently working on their own list. Talking with people who are working on a similar project as yourself can give you new ideas, and extra motivations.Again, do not be afraid to keep some or all of your list private, even as you talk with other people.

, Having developed a working list, it can help to ask more specific questions as a way of generating more ideas that are personally meaningful to you. These questions should take a personal tone. Examples of such questions include:


Who would I like to meet in my lifetime?
Is there anything I like to consume that I would like to make? (for example, if you enjoy watching films, would you like to make your own film?)
When do I find myself at my most content and happy? What other things could I do to replicate those circumstances?, Don’t contain your list writing to sitting at home and thinking. Pay attention to things you see and hear and think about how they might inspire you to add something to your list. Read books, magazines, journals, etc. on topics that have always interested you, but that you do not know much about.
Ask people about what inspires them and try to replicate those things for yourself.

, This may be easier for a young person, but with realistic ambitions, almost anyone can accomplish their dream. Making a list and then putting it aside to gather dust is what many will do, and therein lies the cause of so much regret when a person reaches the end of his or her life.


Set aside some time each weekend to look over your list and add an item or two. This will help prevent the list from stagnating, or worse, you from forgetting about it.Don’t be afraid to take something off your list. After a few weeks, one of your items may no longer seem desirable. Remember, it is your life and you are not beholden to everything you write down on the list. "

Exercise to make your body strong enough to live for 100 years.,
Get an annual check-up.,
Don’t gamble with your life by using illegal drugs.,
Go easy on alcohol consumption.,
Don’t smoke, and if you do, quit.,
Wear appropriate safety gear.,
Limit your exposure to toxic substances.,
Avoid exhaustion by getting enough sleep.",How to Live to Be 100 Years Old1," Doing a small amount of exercise will keep your body strong and fit as you age. Develop an exercise routine while you are young and then maintain it over the decades to come. This will make you healthier now by managing your weight, building muscle, and reducing stress. It will also benefit your future health by strengthening your bones, improving your balance, and boosting your immune system.


An ideal exercise program includes 15 – 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five times per week and strength training twice per week.
You can do both without having to purchase expensive gym memberships. Many people enjoy jogging, walking, or biking.
Strength training is particularly important for postmenopausal women, who become more vulnerable to osteoporosis. Doing weight training will not only make you stronger, but it will also build bone density. This will make you less likely to break a bone if you fall as you get older. You can purchase weights at your local athletics shop.;
, Don’t skip the annual check-ups just because you feel healthy. The best time to catch health problems is right at the beginning. Then they can be quickly and easily dealt with.Be aware of your family history. If you have a genetic predisposition to some diseases, get screened regularly. In addition, you can ask your doctor if there are any preventative measures you should do to minimize your chances of developing the disease.
These days, having a well-managed chronic health problem is not likely to prevent you from living to be at least 100.

, Illegal drugs can cause sudden and severe health conditions. Because they are unregulated, there is no quality control for illegal drugs. This means that dosages are inconsistent and they may contain other substances that are dangerous for your health. Overdoses are frequently fatal, but even less than fatal effects can cause severe health risks such as:Coma
Brain damage
Seizures
Psychosis
Confusion
Memory loss

, The Mayo Clinic recommends no more than one drink per day for women and one to two drinks per day for men. Binge drinking is extremely unhealthy.High levels of alcohol intake raise your risk for cancers of the digestive tract, heart problems, pancreatitis, strokes, high blood pressure and liver disease.If you enjoy a glass of wine or a beer in the evenings, ask your doctor about whether it could interact with any medications you may be taking. Even over-the-counter medications or herbal remedies and supplements may interact with alcohol.
If you do drink, do not drive. Alcohol consumption impairs your ability to drive safely and puts your life at risk and the lives of others who are on the road. Plan ahead and either take a taxi or appoint a friend as a designated driver who will stay sober.

, Even people who smoked for decades can increase their lifespan and quality of life by quitting. Quitting will improve your health and reduce your risks of:Heart attacks
Strokes
Lung diseases, including cancer
Cancer of the esophagus, larynx, throat, mouth, bladder, pancreas, kidney, and cervix
Respiratory infections
Diabetes
Eye disorders like cataracts
Gum disease

, Safety gear can prevent fatal injuries during accidents. This includes common activities like riding in a car or sports activities.


Always wear your seatbelt when driving or riding in a car. If you are driving, do not speed, especially during bad weather conditions such as ice, rain, snow, or fog. Car accidents are a frequent cause of death.Research what safety gear is necessary for risky or full contact sports. You may need protective padding and helmets when skiing, snowboarding, riding a horse, or playing football. If you are doing sports like skydiving, rock climbing, or bungee jumping make sure that all the gear you are using is in perfect working order.

, In high doses, some substances can put you at risk for developing severe health problems which could lead to an early death. For example:


Asbestos can cause lung disease.Pesticides in high doses are not healthy. Though both organic and non-organic farmers’ produce is monitored and regulated to ensure that pesticide residues do not exceed the legal limits, some people prefer organic produce.Pollution and chemical fumes are damaging when you are exposed over a long period of time. If you live in a high pollution area, such as near a highway, you may want to avoid being outside during times when pollution is highest. Many communities provide pollution alerts when the air quality has reached an unsafe level., Sleep deprivation adds physical stress on your body and lowers your immune system. It also makes you more vulnerable to stress.Most people need at least eight hours of sleep each night. If you have trouble staying awake during the day, you are probably not getting enough sleep.
If you have insomnia, talk to your doctor about ways to treat it. This may include implementing lifestyle changes like always going to sleep at the same time, keeping the room dark and free of distracting noises, and using relaxation techniques before bed.

Pair scrambled eggs with a piece of fruit or a green smoothie.

, No matter what you choose to prepare as an anti-aging breakfast, nuts are always a great addition and healthy source of nutrients. Nuts are rich in healthy fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They also come in a handy variety of choices.


Nuts are great by the handful. Sprinkle a handful of nuts on top of a bowl of fruit and yogurt. For a light, on-the-go anti-aging breakfast, you might also grab a single-serving package of unsalted almonds, walnuts, pistachios, cashews, or pecans on your way out the door.
Nut butters are another good choice. While raw nuts often have more benefits than typical store- bought peanut butter (especially with added sugar and salt), consider spreading natural almond, peanut, or cashew butter on some whole grain toast or on some fruit. Nut butter is also good for older adults who find it hard to chew.

, Oats are rich in soluble fiber, which can help reduce “bad” cholesterol. Oats also contain antioxidants, which may help prevent cell damage, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and make your skin appear plumper. Oats are also low-glycemic, which means they won’t cause a spike in blood sugar.Add a handful of your favorite fruit to a bowl of oatmeal for a quick, anti-aging breakfast.

Stay young and vibrant by enjoying a diet with diverse fruits and vegetables.,
Stay resilient by eating sufficient protein.,
Maintain youthful energy levels by eating healthy carbohydrates.,
Stay hydrated by drinking sufficient water.,
Eat fats sparingly.,
Protect your heart with a low-sodium diet.",How to Live to Be 100 Years Old2," Fruits and vegetables are great sources of the vitamins and minerals that your body needs. Vitamins and minerals are important when you are young for growing a strong and healthy body, but they are also important when you are older for staying healthy.Eat at least four servings of fruits and five servings of vegetables per day. Fruits include berries, apples, pears, plums, bananas, pumpkin, squash, beans, olives, peppers, corn, peas, cucumber and tomatoes. Vegetables include beets, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, lettuce, broccoli, celery, and others. Fresh fruits and vegetables are the healthiest, but in the winter months, when they are not available, purchasing frozen fruits and vegetables is a good solution. Avoid fried and breaded fruits and vegetables because they also contain a lot of fat.
A healthy diet rich in fresh produce lowers your risk of cancers, heart disease, high blood pressure, strokes, and diabetes.

, Protein is necessary for your body to repair and rebuilt cells after sustaining damage. Cell turnover is a natural part of life and maintaining a healthy body.People who eat meat often get much of their protein from meat and animal products such as beef, pork, poultry, and eggs.
Vegetarians (people who do not eat meat) and vegans (people who do not eat animal products) get protein from soy, beans, legumes, and nuts. Vegetarians may also supplement this with milk and cheeses.
The average adult requires two to three servings of protein per day. Talk to your child’s doctor to determine what your child may need. Children’s requirements change as they age and grow.

, Sugars, starches, and fiber are all types of carbohydrates. When they are digested, your body obtains energy. Simple sugars are digested more quickly than complex carbohydrates. Because it takes complex carbohydrates longer to break down, your body will be getting that energy at a steady pace instead of all at once. This means it will provide you with energy for longer and it will also keep your blood sugar stable.Supply your body with complex carbohydrates by eating beans, parsnips, corn, peas, lentils, peanuts, and whole-grain breads. Many breads will say on the packaging if they are whole-grain.
Substitute complex carbohydrates for simple sugars like cakes, candy, cookies, and processed sweets. In order to have enough energy to maintain an active lifestyle, you should be getting about half of your calories from complex carbohydrates.

, Drinking enough water will dilute and help you pass toxins and keep your kidneys and urinary tract healthy.While drinking eight glasses of water a day is a good start, there is new science suggesting you may need more fluids than that. Taking into account the water contained in drinks like milk and tea and in foods like watermelon, your daily intake of fluids can be determined by dividing your weight in half. The resulting number is the number of ounces of fluids you need each day. So if you weigh 180lbs., you need 90oz of fluids each day.If you are an athlete, you should be drinking about two-thirds of your body weight in ounces.
How much you need to drink to stay well hydrated will depend on how physically active you are, how warm and dry the weather is, and your body size. You may need four or more liters of water per day.
If you are urinating less than usual or have dark or cloudy urine, this is a symptom of dehydration.
Carry a reusable water bottle with you during the day to help remind you to stay hydrated.

, A small amount of fat is necessary so you can absorb fat soluble vitamins, control inflammation, clot blood, and maintain proper brain function, but many people eat too much. A diet that is high in fat increases your chances of obesity, high cholesterol, heart disease, and strokes.Foods that have a high fat content include butter, cheese, whole milk, cream, meats, and vegetable oils. You can reduce your fat intake by trimming fat off of meats, eating lean meat like poultry and fish, drinking low-fat milk, and eating low-fat yogurt.Choose healthier fats by cooking with monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, and fats that are high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Healthy sources of fat include olive oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, corn oil, flaxseed oil, canola oil, and soybean oil., Too much sodium may lead to high blood pressure which raises your risks for heart disease and stroke. While some salt is necessary to maintain proper nerve and muscle functions, most people acquire plenty of salt naturally through their diet without adding it to their food.Adults should consume no more than about a teaspoon of salt per day. If you have a health condition, you may need to eat much less.
Avoid fast food. Not only is it high in fat, but it is also usually very high in salt.

Many people enjoy doing handiwork, reading, listening to music, art or photography.Find people with similar interests and do your hobbies together. This will help you maintain a social network and enable you to share your enjoyment. Possibilities include joining a sports club, volunteering, or joining clubs for traveling.

, Maintaining your social network of friends and family will protect your psychological health. Friends and family will help buffer you against loneliness, depression, stress, and anxiety, all of which frequently occur as people age.If you have difficulty getting out or your loved ones are far away, consider keeping in touch by phone, through writing letters, writing emails, video chat, or using social media.
If you feel isolated, consider locating a support group or counselor to help you. Your doctor will likely be able to recommend support groups in your area. You can also call the health department or your local senior center to determine what resources may be available to you.

Encourage independence.,
Use technology to your advantage.,
Give sponge baths instead of full baths.,
Play music.,
Hire a meal delivery service.",How to Make Caregiving Easier1," Allow the care recipient to complete certain daily tasks on their own. Think carefully about what they are capable of handling. This will help them feel as though they have more control over their life, and it will help reduce your own stress. While they may be slow at some tasks, you should avoid stepping in unless they need your help.For example, if they can dress themselves, you should let them take care of it. You might check in on them to see if they are doing all right.
Assess the situation carefully. If you are worried they might fall in the shower, you might sit outside the bathroom while they wash, just in case.
Look into getting some durable medical equipment, such as a grab bar. This may help your loved one do things like balancing to put on socks.;
, Certain tools and gadgets can help the recipient take care of tasks on their own. Consider the condition of the recipient, and find tools that can benefit them while simplifying caregiving for you.


For those with vision problems, talking clocks, illuminated magnifying glasses, and computer voice recognition software can help them manage their daily lives.
If the recipient has memory problems, you can find electronic pill boxes that sound an alarm when it is time to take medication.
If hearing is an issue, there are vibrating clocks, headphones for television, or phones and alarms that flash instead of ring.For those with mobility issues, you might want to consider investing in an electric scooter or wheelchair. Standing chairs can also help them get on their feet from a sitting position. Some companies sell alarms that the recipient can press if they fall when you are not around., If the care recipient needs help with bathing, you can reduce the strain on both of you by giving them daily sponge baths. Full baths or showers in the bathroom only need to be done once or twice a week.To give a sponge bath, make sure that the recipient is lying down on one or two towels. Fill two bowls with warm water. You will use one to wash the recipient with soap and the other to rinse away the soap. Gently use the sponge to wash every part of their body, and pat them dry with towels.Medical supply stores may sell special basins meant to help make sponge bathing in bed easier.

, Music can be used for a variety of therapeutic purposes with care recipients. If they are becoming agitated or angry, music can help soothe them. If they are confined to their bed, music can prevent them from feeling lonely. Place a speaker in their room, and set up a playlist that can shuffle on repeat., If you do not live with the care recipient but are responsible for their meals, you can hire a delivery service, such as Meals on Wheels, to send prepared meals to the recipient. By doing this, you will not need to be present at every meal, and you can ensure that they receive hot, nutritious meals often.Some charities and social services offer this as a free or reduced price service. See what is available in your area.

Keep a schedule.,
Consider moving your loved one in with you.,
Talk to your employer.,
Put their legal documents in order.",How to Make Caregiving Easier2," Keep a calendar or notebook where you write out your daily schedule. This schedule should include when the care recipient needs medication, food, baths, doctor visits, exercise, or other care. By writing out this schedule, you can maintain a consistent routine that makes things easier for both you and the care recipient.


You may want to encourage the care recipient to go to bed at the same time every night. To do this, set up a ritual at night, such as giving them warm milk or turning on soothing music, that lets them know it is time to go to bed.Schedule doctor visits for a time that is convenient to you. Make appointments early so that you can choose a time that is easy for you., If the care recipient is a close family member who lives separately from you, you may want to suggest that they move in with you so that you can more easily provide care.You should start the conversation. You can say, “Mom, I think it is time that we discuss your living situation. I think it would be easier for you if you would move in with me.”
Some older adults may be hesitant to move in with someone, as they may feel like they will be losing their independence. You can tell them, “You will still be independent around the house, but if there is an emergency, I will be there to help you.”

, To help balance your work schedule with your caregiving duties, you should speak to your boss to let them know about your situation. They may be willing to offer you a more flexible schedule, or they may be more forgiving when you come late or leave early at work due to an emergency.You might say, ""As you may know, I have recently become a caregiver for my adult son. This is a big responsibility. I was wondering if there are any resources available here for caregivers. I want to make sure that I satisfy both my work obligations and my duties at home.""
You might ask, ""Is there any way I could work at home for a few days a week?"" or ""Can I leave early on Thursdays to take my husband to physical therapy?""
In some states, you can be protected from job discrimination if you are a caregiver., As a caregiver, you may have to make important medical decisions for the recipient. In order to do this, you may need to establish a legal relationship between you and the recipient. Contact a lawyer who can help the recipient and you prepare the proper legal documents.


If the care recipient is still capable of making their own decisions, they may want to establish an advanced health care directive. This will inform their doctor what type of health care they want, in case they become incapacitated.
If your family member is no longer capable of making their own decisions, you may want to establish power of attorney for health care over them. You might also want to establish power of attorney over their finances so that you can use their money to assist with the cost of healthcare.
You should remind the care recipient to set up a will, so that their property can be divided as they wish after their death."
"
Ask family for help.,
Take the care recipient to adult day care.,
Hire in-home caregivers.,
Contact your local assisted living facility or skilled nursing facility.,
Find a friend for the care recipient.,
Look for financial help.",How to Make Caregiving Easier3," If you are caring for a loved one, you should not have to shoulder the burden alone. Ask other family members if they would be willing to assist you in caregiving duties. Perhaps one family member can sit with them during the day and another can take them to their appointments.You might send out an email to your family that says, ""As Mom becomes more and more dependent on us, I was wondering if we could all have a frank discussion about how best to care for her. While I am her primary caregiver, it is very difficult for me to do everything on my own. I was wondering if we could arrange a schedule for us all to help care for her.""
Older children can help out with caregiving duties. Consider what type of care the recipient needs, and decide if your children would be able to help them. They may be able to feed them lunch or help them stand up from a chair., If you are taking care of an adult, you can take them to an adult day care while you work. They can help feed and give medication to the recipient on time. They will also provide social interaction and activities for them., Certain healthcare organizations and hospice care providers offer visiting nurses and doctors. You can hire these caretakers to visit your house and help the care recipient dress, eat, bathe, and exercise.If you cannot afford to hire nurses to come to your house, you may be able to afford a cleaning service that can help you manage your other household tasks while you care for the recipient.

, Many of these types of facilities offer respite care for families. Call to find out what they offer and ask if you can visit the facility for a tour. However, keep in mind that this type of care may be expensive depending on the type of facility., Even if you cannot find or afford extra care for the recipient, you may be able to find someone who will sit and socialize with them for a little bit each day. Consider whether or not the care recipient may enjoy this company. You can ask one of their friends to visit, or you can ask your own family and friends to see if someone would be willing to come over., Respite care can be expensive. While some non-profits offer these services at reduced cost, you may have difficulty locating one in your area. Try to find different forms of financial assistance to help you afford this care. Depending on the recipient’s condition and age, they may qualify for assistance from:


Social Security.
Medicaid waivers.
Veteran’s benefits.
State agencies.
Non-profit grants."

Take of your own needs.,
Join a support group.,
Consider adopting a pet.,
Relax.",How to Make Caregiving Easier4," It is important to take care of yourself. Although caregiving can be a big responsibility, make sure that you are getting enough sleep and rest. Maintain your social life, and make sure that you still participate in your favorite activities. This will reduce stress, depression, and fatigue.While you may feel guilty for going out and socializing as a caregiver, it is important not to isolate yourself. Taking short breaks will benefit both you and the care recipient.
Exercise can help you manage stress while improving your health. Even short walks can help clear your mind from your duties as a caregiver.

, There are dozens of support groups for caregivers. These can connect you with other caregivers in your area. Not only can they help provide emotional support, but they may be able to assist you with your caregiving duties. You can trade tips, frustrations, or successes.You might consider joining a local chapter of National Network of Caregiving Coalitions, which are advocacy and support groups hosted by the National Alliance for Caregiving.
If you can’t find a group in your area, The Family Caregiver Alliance has online support groups.

, Caregivers who adopt a dog have been shown to have reduced stress and improved health. Depending on the condition of the care recipient, a therapy pet may even be able to provide comfort and relief to the recipient as well.Research the benefits of owning a pet carefully, and consider your position to care for an animal. You may even want to adopt a trained guide animal to provide support to both you and the recipient.

, Take at least fifteen or twenty minutes a day to yourself. Do something to pamper yourself so that you can relax. You may be handling a lot of stress, and while it may be difficult to find time to yourself, consider this part of your self-care routine. During this time, you can:


Write in a journal.
Meditate.
Take a bubble bath.
Stretch.
Read.

Treat the urinary incontinence medicinally.,
Try to treat incontinence physically by utilizing vaginal weights.,
Perform Kegel exercises.,
Pace yourself.,
Devote anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks to a regimen of physical treatments for incontinence before expecting to see a change in urine leakage.,
Seek immediate medical specialist attention in severe cases of incontinence.",How to Improve Incontinence," One medication, Duloxetin, is cleared for use in Europe. There are concerns about this medication's affect on certain individuals, so it's important to discuss usage of it with a doctor. Other medicines in this vein include Ditropan and Estrogen.;
, Position these items inside the vagina, then contract and release in order to strengthen the vaginal muscles. This allows you to gain more control over urination flow. The suggested duration of such a physical therapy is for 15 minutes, 2 times per day.

, These exercises develop the pelvic muscles, making urinary incontinence less severe, and in some cases end it.


Contract the pelvic muscle during Kegels, and count to 4. Then release the muscle, and count to 4. Performing these 30 to 80 times per day during an 8-week period is a recommended, practical regimen.

, You should only hold the tightening and relaxation periods during these vaginal exercises for as long as physical possible. After a period of practice, the time that you can endure the tightening period should increase, which strengthens the muscles.

, A consistent schedule of performing the incontinence exercise can yield results in a shorter period of time.

, Incontinence can occur due to pelvic organ prolapse, a condition wherein the bladder actually drops or sags. This condition may require a physician's attention, as well as physical therapy and/or exercises to follow such medical treatment.

Know the general symptoms.,
Know the symptoms of specific kinds of dementia.,
Talk to a doctor.",How to Identify Signs of Dementia,"


Memory loss is the first and earliest sign of dementia. It is, however, more than just forgetting where you put your keys. The memory loss must be widespread; forgetting names, places, and recent events are common. The person may also have difficulty recalling words or performing routine tasks such as following a recipe or using an appliance. Early dementia symptoms also include the inability to react to situations or they no longer care about personal hygiene. Aggressiveness and depression are also common.;
,


One type of dementia is called dementia with Lewy bodies. This is a brain disease that causes memory loss and the ability to plan and think. Early symptoms are swift changes between alertness and confusion, the inability to navigate familiar places, vivid visual hallucinations and long term memory loss.
Frontotemporal dementia is another form of dementia with its own symptoms and early behavior changes. People with this condition may have unusual behavior or personality changes. They may no longer care for those they ought to still care about, and they may make comments that are rude, sexually explicit or intentionally hurtful. Exposing themselves is not uncommon behavior.

,


If you feel like you might be losing your memory or if you have severe trouble remembering things, then talk to your doctor. Your doctor has the knowledge and skill to not only diagnose you properly, but to help you deal with your dementia.
If you think that somebody near to you is suffering from dementia, encourage them to seek medical help as soon as possible. Convincing them that they need help may be difficult but it is crucial.

Introduce yourself.,
Ask.,
Offer to run errands if you're going to the shops.,
Help with benefit forms.,
Provide some company.,
Read the signs.,
Follow up if you are concerned.,
If they have children or grandchildren play with them too!",How to Look Out for an Older Neighbour," If you are new to the area, make a point of getting to know the people who live near you. Knock on the door and introduce yourself. After an initial introduction, or if you've lived in the area for a while but don't yet know your neighbours, say hello when you see them in the street. Do your best to be friendly and approachable from the outset.;
, If your neighbour is elderly, there may be relatively simple tasks that they are no longer able to do on their own. Don't be shy. Approach them and ask if there's anything they need help with. Many older people are fit, healthy and independent, so be careful not to be patronising, but mention that you are available to help out should they need it. Jobs like changing a light bulb, mowing the lawn or some basic DIY may be things that you can help with.

, When you are next going shopping or into town, mention it to your neighbour and ask if there's anything they'd like you to fetch while you're there. If you know they find it difficult to leave the house, you might offer to run a few errands for them. Having someone to help with the weekly grocery run may be highly appreciated.

, There are a number of benefits specifically available to older people, such as the pension credits, tax rebates or benefits and various other allowances. Check with your local authorities and national government for more details. Some of the forms for these can be long, in fine print and involved, and your neighbour may appreciate help with the process of filling these in.

, Notice whether or not your neighbour has any regular visitors. If their family lives far away and they don't leave the house much, they may appreciate someone popping round once every so often for some company. You might offer to cook them dinner once a week, or simply pop in for a cup of tea.

, If you have not seen your neighbour for a while, pay particular attention to some simple signs. Do the lights come on at night? Do the curtains get drawn? Is the garden tended? There may be an accumulation of mail under their door, or more milk bottles than normal on their doorstep. If you have any reason to suspect that your neighbour might be in need of help, knock on the door to check that they are all right.

, If you are seriously concerned for your neighbour's well-being, or suspect that they may not be able to look after themselves, ask them if they are all right. If you suspect that they need help but they are unresponsive to your offers, then seek advice from your local council. They may be able to send round a non-threatening visitor like a community warden to make sure that everything is all right. Find the number for your local council online or in the phone book.

, It really makes them happy.

Inquire with your parents doctors as to what level of training your caretaker needs in order to care for your parents.",How to Hire a Caretaker for an Elderly Parent," These should be done frequently and randomly and should be included as part of an extensive hiring process, as well as once they have been hired.;
, Bonded is a term that means it protects the hiring agency from property loss. Bonded does not give any notion of a person's integrity, level of ability or honesty.

, This will tell you if they have ever been convicted of any crimes in other states or at the federal level.

, It's simple for people to claim they have a degree or training. But when it's your parents' lives on the line, you need to know for sure. Call the institutions they claim to have degrees in and verify the degrees. Likewise, if they are licensed call the licensing agencies and confirm their certifications are up to date and are real.

, Requiring and checking up on references can help you find someone who is kind, patient and well trained. Making certain the references are non-relatives and non-friends. Call and verify the references and ask them very specific questions you need to know about.

, Keeping cameras is perfectly fine in your parents' home. It is a measure of protection to ensure that the home care nurses are doing their job and are not neglectful or abusive. Time and time again you see this type of abuse on the news. It does happen and should be watched for. Your parents' lives are depending on this person and they should be treating them well.

, It needs to include an employment application, social security information and license information.

,, Still, you want to take all the precautions you can and never fully give your trust over. Continue drug testing and using cameras to ensure your parents' are being well cared for.

, Don't over work or ask from them what is beyond their skill set.

Create a “care notebook.” Regardless of whether you are more comfortable with a file stored in the cloud or a folder on your nightstand, the need is the same.,
Identify local contacts.,
Organize and help with paperwork.,
Coordinate local assistance.,
Ask leading questions.,
Assess and address living conditions.,
Go to appointments with your parent(s).,
Discuss healthcare and end-of-life preferences.,
Share the load with other family members.,
Consider options for moving.,
Take care of yourself too.",How to Help Aging Parents Living Far Away," You should create a place where you can collect, store, and easily locate important information regarding care for your parent(s).By establishing a “one-stop” repository for important information and resources, you will make it not only easier to find what you need but also to share it with siblings, family members, or other caregivers. Distribute copies and provide updates as needed.;
, When you live far away, you simply cannot respond immediately (in person) to emergency or time-sensitive situations. By maintaining a list of local contacts who can provide assistance, you can help to ensure an immediate helping presence for your parent(s) when needed.Get names, numbers, emails, etc., for trusted neighbors, physicians, pharmacists, local caregivers, social workers, and so on, as well as detailed contact info for your parent(s) and other close family members. Keep them in the care notebook and distribute copies.

, When you live far away from a parent, you can’t personally help much with tasks like picking up groceries, tidying up the house, and so on. You can, however, provide a wide range of important “administrative” roles, like organizing and dealing with medical, legal, and financial papers and information.Thanks to the internet, you can pay bills for your parent(s), keep tabs on healthcare issues and financial investments, and provide help in a range of other important areas that can sometimes overwhelm older adults.
Don’t just “take over” without having a substantive discussion first, though. Make sure independence and privacy are respected. If you need to take a more active role, talk about getting “durable power of attorney” so you can make important decisions for your parent(s). For healthcare matters, you should be designated as a “healthcare proxy” and sign the required papers so you can discuss medical matters with doctors, insurers, etc.

, For all the help and support you can provide from afar and during occasional visits, often the time will come when your parent(s) need daily assistance. This may mean calling the local “agency on aging” to arrange for meal deliveries or visits from a home health aide, or it may mean hiring a “geriatric care manager” to help with ongoing care and decisions.Geriatric care managers are usually licensed nurses or social workers with experience in assessing the needs of and coordinating resources for seniors. Research and interview prospective candidates, and ask about their licensing, experience, pay rate, etc.
To identify information on local resources and especially the availability of financial assistance, contact the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the U.S., or the comparable entity in other nations.Some areas of the U.S. also have programs in which trained USPS mail carriers can provide wellness checks on seniors (the Carrier Alert Program)., It can be difficult to tell how a parent is doing over the phone, as you are likely to get a lot of “I’m fine” and “We’re doing OK” responses. You don’t want to turn your calls into interrogations — they should hopefully be calming and enjoyable for everyone involved — but do try to add in some basic detective work by way of questions that may draw out more detailed answers.For instance, instead of asking “Have you been eating?”, try “What’s on the lunch menu for today?” Or bring up the weather and see if you can lead your parent to talk about the last time he or she left the house.
Even when you are visiting in person, come up with some questions that require more than a yes-or-no response about health, caring for the house, paying bills, etc.

, When you live far away, you probably only get to visit occasionally and usually with advance notice. This can make it easier for your parent(s) to mask problems going on at home. Before each visit, prepare a checklist of potential concerns (house maintenance, medication adherence, etc) you want to investigate while there.Make the most of each visit by planning ahead. See if you can align your visit with existing appointments so you can go along. Carve out some time to fix the leaky faucet or deal with the stack of bills you know has been piling up. Of course, also make sure you leave enough time to make the visit enjoyable for everyone.

, Especially if you’ve planned ahead with your visits, you should be able to tag along on medical, financial, legal, or other important appointments. Discuss the matter beforehand so you aren’t springing the idea on your parent(s) at the last minute, and be clear that you are there to be supportive and helpful, not to take over.Make sure you have obtained legal authorization to discuss a parent’s personal matters with a doctor, attorney, or financial advisor. Prepare a list of questions for yourself, and help your parent with questions he or she may have.
If you are already actively involved in the organization and management of important matters while away from your parent(s), you can accomplish more during your visits.

, Whether or not you are the recognized “healthcare proxy” for a parent, you should engage in a thorough discussion regarding preferences for when a serious illness or the end of life arrives. It can require some tact and sensitivity to bring up such matters when your parents are healthy, but it is still preferable to waiting too long and missing the chance to clearly identify their wishes.Ideally, if you have siblings or other involved family members, you should try to hold a group meeting to discuss these important matters. Doing so before a serious situation arises can help keep everyone calm and focused, and more able to make rational decisions. Make sure your parents are as involved as possible, and in fact taking the lead if conditions allow it. They should be in charge of these important decisions whenever possible.

, In many situations, the child who lives closest to an aging parent is left to shoulder most (or sometimes all) of the care responsibilities. If you live far away and have siblings (or other involved family members), try to work together to coordinate care so that everyone is contributing in a fair and sensible manner.Proximity will dictate how many responsibilities are divided, of course; the closest sibling is likely to be the one running to the store, while one who lives far away might pay bills online. Also consider your relative strengths and available time, though — a famously disorganized brother may not be the best choice for handling all the important paperwork, for example.

, Especially if you don’t have other family members sharing the burden, you may want to consider shrinking the distance component of your long-distance care. This might involve moving your parent(s) into your home or to a residence closer to you. You might also think that it is a good idea for your parent(s) to move from home (and into a retirement community or assisted living facility, for instance) regardless of distance.Take time to consider the pros and cons of moving, though, because it is a significant decision to make. Moving your parent(s) into your home will probably save money and make daily care much easier, but it is also a major upheaval for all parties involved. Make sure you consult and consider the preferences of your parent(s). Will this be a welcome opportunity for closer bonding, or will the loss of independence and abandonment of a longtime home cause problems?
Moving far away also means finding new doctors, new caregivers and helpers, new friends, and so on. Sometimes it is a necessary change, especially if your parent(s) are simply not safe or sufficiently cared for at home, but it shouldn’t be taken lightly.

, Even if you aren’t providing direct care on a daily basis like a local caregiver, being a long-distance caregiver is physically and emotionally taxing. It can sometimes be even more stressful, because it is more difficult to perceive the difference you are making. In order to effectively care for your parent(s), though, you need to take care of yourself physically and emotionally.Long-distance caregivers may discount or ignore the amount of work they do to help loved ones, often because they don’t feel like they are doing the daily “hard work.” Even though most long-distance caregivers spend the equivalent of one day per week providing care, they tend to feel less satisfied and more guilty (for not doing enough) than close caregivers.Remember that there are seven million other people in the U.S. alone providing long-distance care. Wherever you live, you are not alone as a long-distance caregiver. Support networks are available, and talking to others going through the same challenges can provide significant emotional and even physical benefits."

Pay attention to any missing items of value.,
Call the police.,
Get in touch with the family of the elderly person.,
Reach out to an elder abuse hotline.",How to Identify Elder Abuse," An elderly person who is being abused might have visible bruising, welts, or other injuries. Physical abuse is when someone uses physical force to inflict bodily harm, injury, or impairment. If an elder is being physically abused, she may experience hitting, beating, pushing, shoving, shaking, slapping, kicking, punching, and burning. You may notice signs of injury anywhere, such as on the elderly person's face, arms, legs, abdominal area, or back.Bruises may be from being hit with someone's bare hands or fists, or from being hit with an item such as an electrical cord or belt. Bruises can also be caused by restraints that were applied to the wrists and ankles.
Look for cuts and scrapes as well. Cuts may be small or large, and can appear in groups or clusters. Cuts and scrapes can be from someone's fingernails or from a sharp item such as a knife, razor blade, or scissors.;
, Look at the person’s clothing for any rips, tears, or burns, as this could be a sign the person has been mistreated or mishandled.You should also note if the person’s personal items are damaged, such as the person’s glasses, jewellery, or other items that have significant value to the person. This could be a sign someone is abusing or bullying them by damaging their possessions.

, If the elderly person is being taken care of by someone else, such as a family member or a caretaker, you should note if the person starts to display signs of poor care. Poor care can result in unclean or soiled clothing, poor hygiene, bed sores, or sudden weight loss, which are all forms of physical abuse.


You should also note if the person’s nails and hair appear overgrown or unkempt, and if she develops dental issues due to poor dental care. These are considered symptoms of physical abuse due to neglect by a caretaker.

, Physical abuse of elders can also occur through improper dosage of medication or over medicating. If the person’s medication is administered by someone besides you, such as a caretaker, you may want to confirm the proper dosage is being given to the person and they are not being over-medicated., Sexual abuse of elders can and does happen, leaving the elder physically and emotionally scarred. Notice if the person complains of genital irritation or develops a genital infection, such as an STI. Have the person’s doctor confirm the genital infection or STI so it can be treated right away.You should also check if the person’s inner thighs or genital area is bruised or damaged, as this can indicate sexual abuse.

, Maybe the person is suddenly unwilling to get out of bed or has difficulty walking around, when previously she was fine and mobile. This immobility may be a sign that she has experienced sexual abuse, leaving her body bruised or injured, especially in the pelvis area., It can be challenging to identify emotional and mental abuse, as there may be no physical marks or indications that abuse is happening. Though it can be difficult for the elderly to discuss their abuse, you can try to ask the person if she feels threatened or scared by a caretaker or a person she is in contact with. Do this one on one, out of the vicinity of anyone else, so the elder feels safe and able to discuss any emotional and mental abuse she may be experiencing.


Start by asking, “Are you being treated well?” or “How do you like your caretaker?” You can also let the person know you are available to talk about any issues she may be having, noting: “Please know you can reach out to me if there are any issues with your care.”

, Sometimes the elderly person cannot verbally express their experience of abuse and may instead withdraw from others out of fear or anxiety. She may also appear depressed and refuse to leave her room or go outside to socialize with others., Any negative changes to the person’s demeanor should be taken as a sign that something is wrong and you should consider if the person is being neglected or mistreated. This could be a refusal to go for daily walks, a change in appetite, or turning down visits and contact with others. These disruptions in routine could be a sign that the person is suffering from emotional and mental abuse and is too afraid to let anyone know what is going on., Note if the person appears frightened around certain individuals, with wide eyes, nervous ticks, or a lack of eye contact. These signs could indicate that the person is fearful around someone due to abuse.The person may also express other signs of agitation, such as biting her nails, pulling at her hair, fidgeting with her clothing, or stuttering on her words when she speaks to you in front of her abuser.

, This could be withdraws in large amounts from her bank accounts or consistently large amounts being withdrawn from her bank accounts. You may also notice ATM withdraws from her account which could not have been authorized by the person, especially if she is bedridden.You should also be wary of large payments made to charity organizations that appear suspicious or dubious, as well as payments for items the person would have no use for or do not appear to have in their possession. These actions could indicate that the person is being scammed by a fake charity organization or giving a donation to a charity under false pretenses. Someone may also be using the person’s credit cards or debit card to pay for items for themselves, a clear indication of financial abuse.

, Sudden changes to the person’s will or to her power of attorney should be regarded with suspicion, especially if the change benefits someone who is not known to her family or who appears to be taking advantage of her.


You should consult the person’s lawyer to determine why the person decided to adjust her will and confirm that it was done when the person was of sound mind and body.

, If the person has stacks of unpaid or overdue bills and expenses that are usually paid on time every month, this may be a sign that someone is diverting their money for their own benefit. This could then cause the person to miss payments and perhaps be unaware she is missing payments, especially if she is bedridden or on medication.You should compare the person’s bank statements to the overdue bills or expenses to confirm that money came out of the person’s bank account, but it did not go to pay the bills. It likely instead went right into the pocket of the person who is financially abusing the elderly person.

, Neglectful caretakers may steal valuable items for their clients and sell them for money to pay off debt or to support an alcohol or drug habit. Note if the elderly person is missing jewellery, art, or silverware, as well as any other items of high value. This could be a gradual issue, where items disappear over time, or a sudden theft, where all the items are taken at once., If you have witnessed outright forms of abuse, you should call the police and report the perpetrator. Describe in detail what you have witnessed and be prepared to answer follow-up questions.

, If you have witnessed abuse and know the family of the elderly person, consider contacting them to inform them of the situation. While this is not a direct way to help the elderly person, it will allow the family to decide how to handle the situation of abuse.

, If you suspect that an elderly person is being abused, consider calling an elder abuse hotline and reporting the abuse anonymously. There are many different hotlines to call. You can also contact some agencies online. Some elder abuse hotlines include:


Aging and Disability Resource Centers: 1-866-286-3636 (toll free)

",How to Help Elderly Parents With Finances,"

Discuss where their sources of income are coming from (e.g. pension checks, annuities and/or Social Security), and ask them to keep an up-to-date document with this information.



 


Find out what institutions are holding the money.






Ask them to sign power of attorney documents.






Make sure to have this discussion early enough, if you are unable to catch them at retirement age, that their memory capabilities are still intact. Otherwise a large amount of time will probably be spent piecing together the parts of your parents' financial puzzle.





;
,

Set up their Social Security and other income checks to be direct deposited into their bank.






Sign up elderly parents to have utility payments debited from their account.






Reconcile their lists against past tax forms to confirm that you are accounting for all of the income.






Review the bank statement every month to ensure that you understand and are tracking how much money goes into and comes out of the account.







, As parents age and their mental capacities diminish, if you do not intercept their mail, important documents may be thrown away before you have opportunity to see them.

,

Meet with your parents' insurance provider, and with your parents' permission, discuss their policies and make sure that payment of those policies is being covered. It is a shame for a policy that has been paid on for decades to lapse, and the children lose all death benefits, because the parents mismanaged the paperwork.






Look into Medicare and/or supplemental benefits that may have been offered by former employers and/or look for long-term care policies that may be buried in the paperwork. Policies like these will help ease your and their financial burden in the event of having to put a parent in a nursing home.






With your parents' permission, seek copies of all policies for your records.

Take calcium supplements.,
Have Vitamin D supplements.,
Make sure the supplement is high quality.",How to Keep Your Bones Strong As You Age," Adults need about 700 mg of calcium a day to maintain good bone health. In general, you should try to get calcium from food rather than from supplements, as this means you will also get other nutrients from food that you need to maintain overall good health. Your diet should consist of at least one high calcium food per meal, including dairy products.Milk, cheese, and yogurt are all good sources of calcium. Look for Vitamin D fortified yogurt, as Vitamin D is an essential mineral for bone health. Keep in mind milk has about the same calcium content regardless of whether it is skim or whole milk.Grains contain some calcium, but not as much as other foods. Adding milk or yogurt to a grain-rich cereal or having oatmeal will amp up the calcium content.
Soy products like tofu and soy milk still contain calcium and are a good alternative if you are dairy sensitive. You can also have soy yogurt as it is high in calcium and contains probiotics, which are good for overall health.;
, Dark green, leafy vegetables have high calcium content and are a great addition to your diet. They also contain other essential vitamins and minerals that will help you stay healthy.Go for greens like broccoli, cabbage, spinach, watercress, Swiss chard, collard greens, mustard greens. Vegetables like turnips and beets as also high in calcium.

, You should also integrate protein in your diet that is high in calcium, such as eggs, beef, and chicken. Prepare these foods in healthy ways by boiling or poaching your eggs, and boiling or baking your chicken.Egg yolks are also high in Vitamin D, which is another essential mineral for healthy bones.
Fish is also a good source of protein and Vitamin D. Go for fish with soft bones you can eat, like sardines and anchovies. Seafood like shrimp is also high in calcium, as well as seaweed, and sea vegetables like wakame.

, Beans are a good source of calcium, especially white beans, red beans, and chickpeas. You can also consume lentils by cooking them in dishes or by having lentil products like hummus.When you are preparing beans for cooking, you should first soak them for two to three hours. Then, cook them in fresh water. Beans contain phytates, which can reduce calcium absorption. Soaking the beans before cooking helps to remove the phytates.

, If you tend to get hungry between your three meals a day, you may want to pack healthy snacks high in calcium, like nuts and fruit. Try to consume nuts that are raw or roasted, with no added salt or seasoning. You should also go for fresh fruit, as this will ensure you are getting the most nutrients out of your snacks.Go for nuts like hazelnuts and almonds, as they are high in calcium. You can also snack on figs and raisins.
Fruits like bananas, oranges, and grapes have a high calcium content and taste delicious when fresh.

, You don’t need to a lot of intense activity or run marathons to maintain strong bones. Doing any kind of weight-bearing exercise, as well as cardio exercises, can help to increase your bone mass and your bone health. Try to follow a workout routine where you do at least 30 minutes of physical activity five times a week.If you have known health issues, you should talk to your doctor and discuss any exercises you should avoid or be cautious when doing. Make sure you get a clean bill of health before you embark on an intense strength exercising journey, as you do not want to injure yourself along the way.

, You should try to do some form of cardio exercise several times a week to ensure your heart rate is healthy and your bones are strong. You may take up jogging or running and commit to going for a run three to four times a week. Or, you may take up walking or hiking outdoors in your favorite areas several times a week.Try to integrate exercise in your daily routine, especially if you find it difficult to set aside time for working out. This may mean parking your car at the far end of the lot and walking into work every day or taking the stairs instead of the elevator. You may also opt to bike or walk to work to squeeze in some cardio exercise into your daily routine.

, Weight-bearing exercises like free weights and weight training can be great for building up bone strength. You may want to add weight training to an existing workout routine or start a workout routine that includes cardio and weight training.If you are new to weight training, you should make a consultation at your local gym with a trainer and get pointers on your form. The trainer may also be able to suggest specific exercises to help strengthen certain muscle groups.
If you are not able to do weight-bearing exercises, you can do non-weight bearing exercises like swimming, biking, and using the rowing machine or elliptical machine at the gym. Keep in mind that though these exercises are good for heart health, they may not improve your bone health.

, You should also include activities that are physical but also relaxing and calming, such as tai chi, yoga, or even dancing. You may take a weekly class in this activity or do it on your own at home. Relaxing activities are good for your physical and mental health., One of the easiest ways to get Vitamin D, an essential vitamin for bone health, is to spend time in the sun. You may choose to take your walk or run on sunny days so you can soak up some Vitamin D.Try to stay in the sun for 10–15 minutes at least three times a week with no sunscreen on. Make sure you get sun on the skin of your arms, face, chest, back, and legs. Individuals with darker skin may need to spend 20–25 minutes in the sun without sunscreen.
If your skin starts to get too hot, turns read, or feels like it is burning, get out of the sun. After 10–15 minutes in the sun, you should put on sunscreen to prevent sun damage to your skin.

, Look for a calcium supplement that comes in the form of calcium orotate or calcium citrate malate. Your body can better absorb these two forms of calcium. You can find calcium supplements at your local health food store or online.Women 50 and younger should have 1,000 mg of calcium a day, and women over 50 should have 1,200 mg of calcium a day.
Men 70 and younger should have 1,000 mg of calcium a day and men 71 and older should have 1,200 mg of calcium a day.
You should break up your calcium supplement consumption and have 500 mg of calcium at a time, two to three times a day. This will allow your body to better absorb the calcium and reap the benefits of the supplement.

, It can be difficult to get your required daily intake of Vitamin D from diet alone. If you do not have access to the sun or spend much time outdoors, Vitamin D supplements might be necessary to maintain good bone health. Look for high-quality Vitamin D supplements at your local health food store or online.If you are younger than 70, you should be having 700 IU of Vitamin D a day.
If you are over 70, you should have 800 IU per day. Do not take more than 4,000 IU of Vitamin D a day, as it can be toxic to your health.

, Natural supplements are not regulated by the Federal Drug Administration, so you should be careful when purchasing supplements in stores and online. You want to make sure the supplement contains enough of the vitamin or mineral and is not detrimental at all to your health.Read the ingredients listed on the label of the supplement. The supplement should contain only natural ingredients and has no more than four ingredients listed. Supplements that have a long list of ingredients, or lots of ingredients that are not natural, may not be effective.
Check that the supplement has been independently tested and has seals of approval from Consumer Labs, the Natural Products Association (NPA), LabDoor, and/or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).

Apply your brakes.,
Select your crash point.,
Stay on the bike.,
Slide well.,
Prepare your body to roll.,
Manage the accident.",How to Survive a Motorbike Crash1," When you encounter an obstruction, you should react quickly, applying both brakes. Naturally, the front brake is the most powerful brake, so you should always lead with that one. Use the rear brake to even out the distribution of your weight. Rather than slamming on your front brake, apply pressure progressively. This will prevent you from locking your front brake., Many times, you will have no choice in the matter. However, if you know that you are about to crash, it is worth considering the best place for impact, and aiming toward it. This is best done without your brake applied. For example, you never want to head into on-coming traffic.
You also want to avoid hitting anything head on.
So if you are going to make impact, try to steer so that you collide sideways instead.

, The truth is, you should almost never bail. You should likewise avoid laying the bike down. You will do best at surviving an accident if you stay connected to your machine. If you exit the vehicle, you may slide for a long distance, possibly in the direction of oncoming cars. You could even end up hurting an innocent bystander., In the event of a slide, you need to stay relaxed. Although it will be difficult, you’ve got to loosen your muscles and let it happen. If you can stay loose and calm, you will sustain fewer injuries. Simply concentrate on keeping your face off the pavement., If an impact is not avoidable, then you will need to do what you can to protect your body from serious injury. One way of minimizing injury is to use the tuck and roll method.Or, you can also use a controlled roll.A tuck and roll might be helpful if you see crash coming while you are still on your bike. To get into a tucked position, pull your knees into your chest, cross your arms over your chest, and tuck your head down towards your chest. Then, try to relax and roll as you crash.
A controlled roll is best after a slide or if you come off of your bike close to the ground. For a controlled roll, place your arms above your head and keep your legs straight. Then, allow your body to roll until it stops on its own.Keep in mind that you should not use the tuck and roll or controlled roll unless you have no other options. If you have no other choice but to crash, then getting into this position should not be to difficult.

, Once the dust settles, hopefully you will be able to stand up and brush yourself off. Now you must call the police and exchange information with the other driver. Use your phone to take a photograph of the other driver’s insurance card (both sides), and allow them to do the same with yours. Call the local police and wait for them to arrive. They will have questions for you and may issue one or both of you a ticket.


If you are seriously injured, ask someone to call 9-1-1 and get into an ambulance.
If you do not have the ability to take a photograph, simply write down the info from their insurance card.
Stay calm, even if it was the other driver’s fault. Yelling and getting upset will not help anything.

Wear a helmet.,
Choose the right gear.,
Wear your gear.,
Stay sober.,
Obtain health insurance.",How to Survive a Motorbike Crash2," Wearing a high-quality motorcycle helmet is the number one way to protect yourself and ultimately survive a motorbike crash. Be sure that your helmet is in good condition, without cracks. Additionally, many states have helmet laws making it illegal to ride without one., Not all motorcycle gear is created equal. Maximize your safety during a collision by wearing the best gear. For example, gloves with built-in palm sliders are the most effective way to keep your wrists safe during a collision. Leather jackets with elbow armor can further protect your arms. Do some research and find the best gear for your terrain. , Any gear is better than no gear. At a bare minimum, wear heavy-duty pants, boots, gloves, and a jacket. Wear some form of eyewear, like sunglasses. No matter what, you should always wear a helmet., Even below the legal limit, studies have shown that any amount of alcohol in your system can impair your reaction time. When riding a motorcycle, this risk is far too great. A fraction of a second can mean the difference between life and death. If you have plans to mount your machine, refrain from drinking even one beer., Surviving a motorbike crash involves economic survival, as well. If you get into a serious collision, your medical bills could be considerable. If you are going to ride a motorcycle, it is responsible and smart to obtain high-quality medical insurance. This way, if you should get hurt, you will be able to receive the best medical treatment without bankrupting the rest of your life."

Slow down.,
Stay focused.,
Stay defensive.,
Take corners correctly.,
Stay visible.",How to Survive a Motorbike Crash3," Many accidents would be prevented in the cyclist was riding a bit slower. A good rule of thumb is to only ride as fast as you can see. Meaning, you should always be able to bring the bike to a safe and complete stop in the unobstructed distance you can see ahead. If you suspect you may be going too fast, you’re going too fast., When you’re on your bike, this is not the best time to be worrying about your marriage troubles, you workplace woes, or your health problems. Instead, take in the experience, stay present, and relax. Remain alert and aware of your surroundings.Avoid texting while riding your motorcycle as well. Texting while operating a vehicle makes you 23 times more likely to get into an accident!, It is a sad (but true) reality that many automobile drivers will not see you on your bike. Cars will pull out in front of you, cut you off, and worst of all, make left turns in front of you. Be a defensive driver on your bike! Be both wary and aware of those around you, and try to be prepared for the worst., Many accidents are the result of riders failing to negotiate a curve properly. Often this occurs when a rider enters a corner too quickly. The best method is to slow to a safe speed as you enter a turn, and then gradually accelerate when you are positive it is safe to do so., You are less likely to collide with another vehicle, if you are certain they can see you. Wearing bright colors, maintaining an appropriate lane position, and being aware of shadows can all help to prevent a nasty wreck.Use effective lane positioning.
Loud pipes save lives.
When the sun is behind you, you may be driving in your own shadow. This can be a particularly dangerous time for visibility.

Keep existing social bonds in place.,
Go to familiar places.,
Interact with others experiencing the same things.,
Accept limitations and waning interest.",How to Help Alzheimer's Patients Stay Active," There is some evidence that 20-30 minutes of mild to moderate physical activity (like aerobic exercise) every day may help slow mental decline in Alzheimer’s patients, possibly due to the increased blood flow to the brain. At the very least, keeping a healthy body will enable the person to maintain and increase muscle strength and therefore enable them to participate in other activities and promote self-care.The exercise does not need to be completed in a single half-hour block, which may be too much of a challenge for an Alzheimer’s patient. A series of ten minute “mini workouts” will provide the same benefits.As a caregiver, you should try to exercise with the patient. It adds a greater social element and will be more enjoyable for the patient, and it is good for your health too.If the patient's condition permits him or her to attend a regular exercise class (or one dedicated to seniors or even just people with memory impairments), consider attending together. The socialization element will be beneficial alongside the physical benefits of exercise.;
, Regular, predictable routines can make daily life more manageable for Alzheimer’s sufferers as mental decline progresses. Making exercise sessions a regularly-scheduled daily activity — after breakfast but before enjoying some music, for instance — can make it more comforting and pleasurable for the patient.Alzheimer’s patients tend to be more active and responsive earlier in the day, so it is probably best to schedule the exercise period(s) during the morning hours.Try to incorporate self-care routines into daily routines. Allowing patients to care for themselves helps them promote mental and physical wellbeing. The activities, however, should be safe and appropriate for the person to undertake in their current condition without supervision. Try something like washing dishes, taking out the trash, or sweeping the floor.
While developing and employing exercise routines for Alzheimer’s patients, watch closely for changes in abilities and skills, as these can decline rapidly and unevenly and make some activities unsafe to perform., While a daily walk is far better than nothing, the best results may come from employing a variety of different (but simple and enjoyable) exercises. Dancing, gardening, stretching, using resistance bands or lifting small weights (or even soup cans), following a chair-based exercise video, and numerous other activities can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s sufferers.



This U.S. government website, for instance, offers a range of exercise options for older adults in four key areas, including:

Endurance. Try exercises like tennis, water aerobics, mall walking, or raking leaves.
Balance. Activities might include balance walking (extending the arms to the sides and lifting the knees with each step); heel-to-toe walking; or tai chi exercises.
Flexibility. Consider trying buddy stretching (pulling back and forth on a resistance band while seated face-to-face); calf stretching (while standing with both hands against a wall); or thigh stretching (behind the back while lying on the side).
Strength. Exercises can include elbow extensions (extending a supported arm with a wrist weight overhead); wrist curls (with the forearm resting on an armchair); or back leg raises (using ankle weights and holding the back of a chair for a support).



, Depending upon the patient’s physical condition and the progression of the disease, traditional exercises may not be a viable option. By watching the patient’s habits and employing some creativity, however, you can still help ensure a sufficient amount of daily physical activity.


Build an exercise out of a routine or habit displayed by the patient. If the patient shuffles his or her feet a lot, put on some music and dance together. If the patient tends to rub his or her hand on the tabletop, provide a cloth and do some cleaning together.Pay attention to the patient's work history when you're deciding which exercises they should do. You can tailor a certain patient's exercises to things that you think they might be good at given their work history. For example, a former cashier may be familiar with sorting or counting coins, and a farmer may be familiar with caring for plants.In the end, your goal should be using exercise to maintain remaining skills. So make the most out of what you have to work with., Nothing gets easier for a caregiver as Alzheimer’s disease progresses. Even simple exercise routines may be out of the question. However, even the most basic types of movement or physical exertion may provide some amount of health benefit and — perhaps more importantly at this stage — comfort for the patient.In later stages of the disease, walking from one room to another, switching chairs, or even just shifting positions in bed may have to suffice for physical activity. It still counts, and is still worthwhile — for the patient and for you — to keep moving and keep trying.

, Despite the increasing popularity of “brain games” and “brain training” apps, there is no legitimate evidence that mental decline can be slowed by such activities. That said, regular mental stimulation offers a range of social, emotional, and even physical benefits to Alzheimer’s sufferers.Don’t focus so much on concrete accomplishments — finishing the puzzle in the same amount of time as last week, for instance. Instead, make mental exercises for the patient be about having a good time and creating a sense of accomplishment, regardless of results.Pay special attention to highlighting enjoyment when a patient might notice that their abilities are declining. For example, a musician might feel dejected when their skills are not as sharp as they once were, or a painter might feel upset when their paintings have less quality than they once did. At these times, you should take special care to encourage the patient and help them identify new goals and sources of accomplishment for their favorite activities.

, Asking an Alzheimer’s patient to do the same word puzzle over and over again or fold the same towel repeatedly for no reason will not provide mental stimulation or emotional benefits. Alternatively, giving small, common tasks like setting the table or helping with the laundry can offer not only a mental (and physical) workout but a sense of involvement in the household — as opposed to the isolation an Alzheimer’s sufferer often feels.Avoid meaningless time-fillers, and look for activities that will be meaningful to the patient. These could include playing music, organizing or light cleaning, gardening, reading or looking at newspapers or books, helping with cooking or baking, or going through family photos or videos, to name some examples. Build the activities around the patient’s interests and abilities.If you can build the activities around the patient’s former work — putting coins in display pouches for a former bank clerk, for instance — you may get a particularly positive response., Depending upon the progression of the illness, an Alzheimer’s patient may need regular or practically constant supervision and assistance. However, no one wants to feel helpless, and an Alzheimer’s sufferer can derive pleasure from a sense of accomplishment or usefulness just like anyone else. The trick for a caregiver is to provide the necessary help without making the person feel helpless.For example, if you are baking a cake together, offer to measure the ingredients, but ask for a hand with mixing them with a wooden spoon.
Let the person be an active participant and helper. So what if it results in a few spills or imperfectly folded dinner napkins?
People with Alzheimer's often have information and knowledge that they are willing to share with other people. Ask them to teach you something or to tell you a story. If the person is an avid knitter, ask them to teach you a stitch. If the person used to play football, ask them to tell a story about a memorable game. This will encourage physical exercise in some cases and also help to build their self-esteem.

, People with dementia and Alzheimer's frequently find it easier to remember things from longer ago than from recent history, because the disease takes longer to affect longterm memories. Sharing life memories and experiences can help an Alzheimer's patient improve their mood, communicate better with their family, and build confidence.

Bring (or encourage family members to bring) pictures and mementos from the person's past. Physical items are great for triggering memories and encouraging storytelling.
Consider visiting an important place in the patient's life, such as a park they loved to walk in or a place they volunteered or worked. These visits will also help with memories and encourage the person to get outside.
Create a memory book or display, such as a poster or photo album. Fill this display with important, meaningful events in the person's life, such as the birth of a child or a formative travel experience. Creating this item should help the person reminisce more and also encourage reminiscing in the future.
Avoid asking questions that require detailed, factual responses. Instead, you should focus more on the flow of the conversation. People with Alzheimer's often do not remember specific details, such as names and dates, so you should instead pat more attention to the person's enjoyment of the conversation. Ask them to share more about their life story and show a genuine interest in the conversation., One of the most frustrating aspects of Alzheimer’s is that it can rob some sufferers of their communication skills more quickly than other aspects of cognitive impairment take place. It can become very challenging to communicate verbally with some patients, but resist the temptation to speak “at” them, as if they are inanimate objects.Strive to communicate with the person, even when it becomes difficult. Learn to recognize and utilize nonverbal cues, including facial responses and hand motions. It may be difficult to tell how much of what you are communicating is “getting through,” but assume the person still understands more than may seem immediately apparent. Be patient and persistent in your efforts.

, It is common after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis for the patient to want to withdraw from social interactions, out of fear, embarrassment, or even anger. Remind the person that “you are still you,” and that those who care about him or her want to remain a part of his or her life.Ample evidence shows that strong social bonds and interpersonal connections are good for our physical and emotional health, while isolation and loneliness are the opposite. Alzheimer’s patients are no different in this regard.
Shared activities, like family gatherings, social club gatherings, or just an evening out can provide a continued sense of belonging., There is no avoiding the truth — things will be different, and increasingly difficult, when living with Alzheimer’s. The comforts of familiar people and places can be essential to sustaining some measure of health and happiness along the rough road ahead.


If the person enjoys going to worship services, or museums, or the local coffee shop, continue taking the person there as long as it is feasible to do so. Remind the person that there is no reason to be ashamed, and emphasize the enjoyable aspects of the experience.Familiar locations may also serve as reference points that spur memories that may otherwise appear to be lost.

, Unfortunately, Alzheimer’s is becoming increasingly prevalent as the average lifespan increases. If there is any silver lining to this, however, it does mean that there are more resources and opportunities for interaction with others going through the same kinds of experiences.As a patient or a caregiver (or together), seek out support groups dedicated to Alzheimer’s. It is always comforting to know that you are not alone in your struggle, especially one that can seem so isolating and lonely.
Encourage Alzheimer’s patients — especially those early in the disease — to speak about their feelings and fears with someone they trust. This might be a minister, a therapist, or a close friend. Anyone can benefit from having access to a sympathetic ear.

, Over time, an Alzheimer’s sufferer’s interest in and ability to interact socially with others will wane. This does not mean the person should be isolated or “locked away,” but it does mean accepting the reality of the situation and adjusting activities and expectations accordingly. Continue to encourage and facilitate social interaction, but don’t force it.As with most diseases, Alzheimer’s patients have good days and bad days. Just because a patient vigorously resists attending a family birthday party or having a friend over one day does not mean those doors will continue to be closed forever after. Keep on trying.

Perform Kegel exercises.,
Try timed voiding.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Avoid constipation.",How to Improve Bladder Health in Old Age1," Kegel exercises are exercises that strengthen the muscles of the bladder that control urination. Both men and women can do Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.For women, start by identifying the muscles used in emptying your bladder by stopping the flow of your urine midstream. Once you identify those muscles, with an empty bladder, lie down, squeeze, and hold these muscles for a count of three. Relax for another count of three. Repeat this 10 times. Your goal is to do at least three sets of 10 cycles every day.
For men, start by identifying the muscles used in emptying your bladder by stopping the flow of your urine midstream. Once you identify those muscles, with an empty bladder, lie down with your knees bent and spread apart. Squeeze and hold these muscles for a count of three. Relax for another count of three. Repeat this 10 times. Your goal is to do at least three sets of 10 cycles every day.;
, In timed voiding, you urinate on a set schedule. You empty your bladder on a schedule instead of only going to the bathroom when you feel you have to go. This helps you from overfilling your bladder and having urges you can't control due to incontinence. This helps you control your bladder and when you urinate.You usually start this by going to the bathroom every hour. Slowly, you can increase the time between trips to the bathroom.
You can also by watches specially designed to help you with timed voiding.
The idea is to re-train your bladder to hold more and more urine.

, Some foods may make your bladder problems worse. Certain foods may lead to increased incontinence. Try to reduce the amount of these foods to help.Spicy foods, such as spicy curries or foods that use hot peppers, are believed to cause bladder problems.
Some acidic foods can worsen bladder problems. This includes tomatoes, tomato sauces, and acidic fruit like oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes.Other foods that may cause bladder problems include coffee, tea, chocolate, and other foods with caffeine, along with artificial sweeteners.
This is most likely because components of these foods are excreted in the urine and can irritate the bladder.

, Maintaining a healthy weight can help improve some forms of bladder incontinence. Being overweight can cause problems by placing pressure on the pelvic floor muscles.If you are overweight, consider losing weight to help reduce your bladder problems.

, Constipation can contribute to bladder problems. Since the bladder and colon are close together, having stool in the colon can place pressure on the bladder. This can either keep the bladder from filling like it should, not empty completely, or contract irregularly.Eat at least 25-30 grams of fiber each day to avoid constipation. That, along with drinking enough water, is enough for most people to prevent constipation.Occasionally, if you need to, consider senna or psyllium as a gentle laxative.

Visit your doctor.,
Take medication.,
Consider electrical stimulation.,
Try inserts.,
Consider herbal supplements.,
Consider other medical treatments.",How to Improve Bladder Health in Old Age2," If you believe you had bladder problems, you should go see your doctor. Your doctor can help you decide on the proper treatment and offer you various medical options if you need them.


Symptoms of bladder trouble include urine leakage, sudden urges to urinate, involuntary leaking of urine, burning when you urinate, urine leakage when you cough or sneeze, or dark or strange smelling urine., There are medications that can help control incontinence. These medications include:Anticholinergic medications. This is a class of drugs that can be used to calm an overactive bladder and reduce incontinence. Examples of these drugs are oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), tolterodine (Dettol), darifenacin (Enablex), fesoterodine (Toviaz), solifenacin (Vesi-care), and trospium (Sanctura).
Muscle relaxants. These can be used to increase the amount of urine that the bladder can hold. These medications include mirabegron (Myrbetriq).
Alpha blockers. These help men with prostate problems.They include tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), silodosin (Rapaflo), terazosin (Hytrin) and doxazosin (Cardura).
Estrogen. At a low dose, estrogen can be applied around a woman’s urethra to improve symptoms.
Antibiotics. This can help with urinary tract infections., Electrical stimulation can be used to strengthen bladder muscles. This can help reduce the urge to urinate and help reduce incontinence. Electrodes are inserted and used to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.This usually requires a number of treatments that can last for several months.

, Inserts may be a treatment option for women. Devices such as urethral inserts or pessaries can be used to support the pelvic area and reduce incontinence. They can also help reduce leakage. The insert is a plug-like device that you can use before activities that may lead to incontinence. Pessaries are rings that can be worn all day., There are some herbs and herb combinations that may be useful for incontinence and overactive bladders. Though considered a ""natural"" treatment, these can still interact adversely with other medications and prescriptions, so it's important you speak with your doctor and/or pharmacist about whether or not it is safe to take supplements. Many of these herbs have been shown to decreases urges and help decrease pressure on the bladder. These include:Gosha-jinki-gan
HorsetailSaw palmetto
Corn-silk
Capsaicin
Hachi-mi-jio-gan
Buchu
You should know that many herbs traditionally used for kidney and bladder health often promote urination. If you have a problem with urinary incontinence, discuss the herbs with your doctor or research them to decide if they will help lessen your incontinence or not.

, There are a few other alternative medical treatments you can try to help. Interventional therapy is one method, which includes injecting bulking materials into the tissue around the urethra and botox injections. These injections help reduce leakage and lessen incontinence.You may also want to try working with a physical therapist who can help you with Kegel-like exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor and may also help you manage pain.Surgery is generally the last option considered, but can be performed to reduce bladder problems.

Watch your fluid intake.,
Empty your bladder as much as possible.,
Urinate before and after sex.,
Wipe correctly.,
Take care with feminine hygiene products.",How to Improve Bladder Health in Old Age3," One way to help your bladder healthy is to make sure you drink the proper liquids in the right amounts. You need to stay hydrated and keep drinking enough water to reduce the chances of a bladder infection or a urinary tract infection.You can also drink cranberry juice to reduce the risk of UTIs.The usual recommendation is to drink at least six to eight eight ounce glasses of water every day.Some beverages which contain caffeine, such as coffee, tea and chocolate drinks, can increase the frequency and the urgency of urination. Other beverages, like alcohol drinks, carbonated drinks, and acidic fruit juices (orange and grapefruit juice, lemonade and limeade), can also increase the frequency and the urgency of urination., Making sure you urinate when you need to and making sure you empty your bladder every time you use the bathroom can help you reduce chances of a UTI. This is most easily done by making sure that you go when you need to go and relax as much as possible, taking as much time as you need to empty out your bladder completely.Urinating often and emptying your bladder helps flush out bacteria.

, Urinating before sex can help flush out bacteria that might get spread during sex, and urinating after sex can help flush out bacteria that was introduced during sex.Make sure to use water-based lubricant during sex.
You can also clean your genital and anal areas before and after sex.

, After going to the bathroom, especially after having a bowel movement, women need to wipe from the front to the back. This helps prevent bacteria from the feces from spreading to the urethra., Using some feminine hygiene products, such as douches or feminine deodorants, may cause UTIs. They can irritate the urethra as well as remove natural flora that helps maintain the healthy environment, leading to a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis.Douching can also lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, complications during pregnancy, STIs, and vaginal dryness. If you feel there is something ""off"" about the smell of your vagina or there is unusual discharge, this means there is something wrong and you should be checked by your doctor. Douching will not solve the problem and, if anything, could make it worse.
When using tampons or pads, you should change them often.

An injury in these areas limit the use of a specific part of the body, but your personality and mental abilities remain unchanged. Most often, these body structures heal and regain their previous function.


Brain injuries do not heal like other injuries. Recovery is a functional recovery, based on mechanisms that remain uncertain. No two brain injuries are alike and the consequence of two similar injuries may be very different.
Symptoms of brain injury may appear right away or in contrast to other injuries, may not be present for days or weeks after the injury.;
, The top three causes of TBI are:


Car accidents
Firearms
Falls

,


Open head injury:

Results from bullet wounds, etc.
Usually causes focal damage
Results from penetration of the skull
Effects can be just as serious as closed brain injury


Closed head injury:

Occurs from a slip and fall, motor vehicle crashes, etc.
Results in focal damage and diffuse damage to axons
Effects tend to be broad (diffuse)
There's no penetration to the skull


Deceleration Injuries:

The skull is hard and inflexible while the brain is soft with the consistency of gelatin. The brain is encased inside the skull. When the skull moves through space, it's in a phase of acceleration. The rapid discontinuation of this action when the skull meets a stationary object (deceleration) causes the brain to move inside the skull. The brain moves at a different rate than the skull because it is soft. Different parts of the brain move at different speeds because of their relative lightness or heaviness. The differential movement of the skull and the brain when the head is struck results in direct brain injury, due to diffuse axonal shearing, contusion and brain swelling.



, Most people are unaware of the scope of TBI or its overwhelming nature. TBI is a common injury and may be missed initially when the medical team is focused on saving the individual’s life. The effects of TBI can be mild, moderate or severe.



Mild - A brain injury can be classified as mild if loss of consciousness and/or confusion and disorientation is shorter than 30 minutes.

While MRI and CAT scans are often normal, the individual has cognitive problems such as headache, difficulty thinking, memory problems, attention deficits, mood swings and frustration.
These injuries are commonly overlooked. Even though this type of TBI is called mild, the effect on the family and the injured person can be devastating.
Mild TBI is also known as Concussion, Minor head trauma, Minor TBI, Minor brain injury or Minor head injury.
Mild TBI is the most prevalent type of TBI, and is often missed at time of initial injury.



Moderate - Here, the loss of consciousness is greater than 30 minutes

Physical or cognitive impairments are present midway between the mild and the severe variety which may or may not resolve
Benefit from Rehabilitation more often than not



Severe - Severe brain injury is associated with loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes and memory loss after the injury or penetrating skull injury for more than 24 hours.

The deficits range from impairment of higher level cognitive functions to comatose states. Survivors may have limited function of arms or legs, abnormal speech or language, loss of thinking ability or emotional problems.
Individuals with severe TBI can be left in long-term unresponsive states.
For many people with severe TBI, long-term rehabilitation is often necessary to maximize function and independence.
The range of injuries and degree of recovery can be very variable and differs on an individual basis.



,


Possible symptoms for mild TBI include:

Fatigue
Headache
Nausea
Loss of smell
Sensitivity to light and sounds
Getting lost or confused
Slowness in thinking
Visual disturbance
Memory loss
Poor attention/concentration
Sleep disturbance
Dizziness/loss of balance
Irritability and emotional disturbances including feeling of sadness
Seizures


Possible symptoms of severe TBI include:

Cognitive deficits like confusion and impulsiveness including difficulties with attention, concentration, memory, speed of processing, language processing, and executive functions.
Speech and language problem including failure to understanding the spoken word (receptive aphasia), difficulty speaking and being understood (expressive aphasia), slurring of speech, speaking very fast or very slow, problems reading, and problems writing.
Sensory problems like difficulties with interpretation of touch, temperature, movement, limb position and fine discrimination.
Perceptual problem like the integration or patterning of sensory impressions into psychologically meaningful data.
Problems related to vision, like partial or total loss of vision, weakness of eye muscles and double vision (diplopia), blurred vision, problems judging distance, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and intolerance of light (photophobia).
Problems related to hearing, like decreased (or loss) of hearing, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and increased sensitivity to sounds (hyperacusis).
Problems related to smell, like loss or diminished sense of smell (anosmia).
Problems related to taste, like loss or diminished sense of taste.
Seizures - the convulsions associated with epilepsy that can be of several types and can involve disruption in consciousness, sensory perception, or motor movements.
Possible physical changes like paralysis, or spasticity, chronic pain, disturbed control of bowel and bladder, sleep disorders, loss of stamina, changes in appetite, disturbed regulation of body temperature, and problems with menstruation.
Possible disturbances in the social and/or emotional areas including dependent behaviors, emotional liability, lack of motivation, irritability, aggression, depression, disinhibition, and denial of the problem/lack of awareness.



, A detailed clinical and neurological examination is important and will bring out evidence of brain injury.


Brain imaging with CAT scan, MRI, SPECT and PET scan may be useful.

, Cognitive evaluation by a neuropsychologist with formal neuropsychological testing is required.


Evaluations by physical, occupational and speech therapists can help clarify the specific deficits of an individual.

, This is the gold standard in diagnosing the condition and its stages. This test is based on a 15 point scale for estimating and categorizing the outcomes of brain injury on the basis of overall social capability or dependence on others. The test measures the motor response, verbal response and eye opening response with these values:


I. Motor Response

Obeys commands fully
Localizes to noxious stimuli
Withdraws from noxious stimuli
Abnormal flexion, i.e. decorticate posturing
Extensor response, i.e. decerebrate posturing
No response


II. Verbal Response

Alert and Oriented
Confused, yet coherent, speech
Inappropriate words and jumbled phrases consisting of words
Incomprehensible sounds
No sounds


III. Eye Opening

Spontaneous eye opening
Eyes open to speech
Eyes open to pain
No eye opening


The final score is determined by adding the values of I+II+III. This number helps medical practitioners categorize the four possible levels for survival, with a lower number indicating a more severe injury and a poorer prognosis:

Mild disability (13-15)
Moderate disability (9-12)
Severe Disability (3-8)

Coma: unconscious state. No meaningful response, no voluntary activities


Vegetative State (Less Than 3)

Disturbed Sleep wake cycles
Arousal, but no interaction with environment
No localized response to pain


Persistent Vegetative State:

Vegetative state lasting longer than one month


Brain Death

No brain function (Specific criteria needed for making this diagnosis).





, There are many different kinds of treatments available for patients of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)


Initial Treatment stabilizes the individual immediately following a traumatic brain injury
Rehabilitative Care Center Treatment helps restore the patient to daily life
Acute treatment of a Traumatic Brain Injury is aimed at minimizing secondary injury and life support
Surgical Treatment may be used to prevent secondary injury by helping to maintain blood flow and oxygen to the brain and minimize swelling and pressure

, The medical staff providing supportive care for the unconscious individual is highly trained and understands how to care for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.


TBI patients are monitored with equipment for breathing, heart rhythm, blood pressure, pulse and intracranial pressure
Sometimes the unconscious individual cannot breathe without assistance. The airway is maintained and breathing occurs through special tubes that help maintain oxygen in the blood. It may be necessary to suction, as to remove thick secretions and keep the air tube clean.
The tube may be located in the mouth or in the neck. If it is in the neck, it is called a tracheostomy tube. Either tube will need to be cleaned daily. A pulse oximeter measures the amount of oxygen the patient is receiving through a device that resembles a finger splint
After head trauma, seizures can occur. Dilantin is the usual medication administered through the IV to prevent seizures. A tetanus shot should also be given.
Fluid is administered through the IV for nutrition and liquid. The unconscious person cannot eat or drink safely. The need for nutritional support using parenteral (IV) or enteral solutions (a tube placed in the stomach) is determined by a registered dietician and the doctor
A urinary catheter is put in the bladder for urine collection. The individual is not aware of the need to use the bathroom. The catheter attaches to a bag hanging from the side of the bed
It is important to maintain the unconscious patient’s blood pressure through IV fluid and medication. Ideally, the blood pressure should range close to 90/70 mm of Hg
The patient is turned and positioned in bed to prevent bedsores because most unconscious people cannot move independently
The unconscious person may have a compression device wrapped around the legs that resembles a plastic tub mat. This device prevents blood clots. Daily injections are also given to prevent blood clots
In moderate to severe TBI patients, the intracranial pressure is constantly monitored and kept under check.

, Recovery from a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) varies based on the individual and the brain injury. Attempts at predicting the degree of TBI recovery remain mostly unsuccessful, and crude. Recovery can be seen months, and even years, after the initial injury. Devastating and fatal injuries can be easier to ascertain than other injuries.


The following are the indicators the medical team uses for prognosis:

Duration of Coma. The shorter the coma, the better the prognosis
Post-traumatic amnesia. The shorter the amnesia, the better the prognosis
Age. Patients over 60 or under age 2 have the worst prognosis, even if they suffer the same injury as someone not in those age groups


Recovery of brain function is thought to occur by several mechanisms. Some common theories:

Diaschisis. Depressed areas of the brain that are not injured but linked to injured areas begin functioning again
The function is taken over by a part of the brain that does not usually perform that task
Redundancy in the function performed so another area of the brain takes over
Behavioral substitution. The individual learns new strategies to compensate for deficits.

Determine whether the person is drowning.,
Shout for help.,
Decide which rescue method to use.,
Proceed with the rescue.",How to Save an Active Drowning Victim1," Active drowning victims are conscious but are struggling and unable to call for help. They also may be thrashing their arms. It is very important for you to recognize these signs early as people will become submerged in 20 to 60 seconds.An active drowning victim will bob in and out of the water with his or her mouth being just above the surface of the water. The person is not making forward progress either.Someone who looks as though they're having trouble, but isn't yelling for help, may not have enough oxygen to call out.;
, No matter your experience or training, having others assist you is a good idea.Yell to others that someone is drowning. Call emergency services immediately, especially if the person is floating face-down., Remain calm and figure out how you can best rescue the person based on the location and type of body of water the person is in. Find a flotation device if you can. If the person is close, use a reach method. If the person is further away, use an ocean rescue method.It may take a few seconds to get the person's attention. Stay calm and continue to talk to them.
If you have one available, a shepherd's crook can reach someone beyond the range of a reaching assist in a pool or lake.
Use a ring buoy or other easy to throw rescue device to reach a victim further away from the shore; this is also used in an ocean rescue.

Dive into the water and swim to the victim as a last resort, when the victim is out of reach.

, Stay calm and focused. People who panic are more likely to make mistakes and may also stress out the victim. Call to the victim that you're coming to his or her aid.

"
"
Lie face down on the edge of the pool or dock.,
Locate the shepherd's crook.,
Stand slightly away from the edge of the deck.,
Pull the person to safety.",How to Save an Active Drowning Victim2," Spread your legs to make sure that you are in a stable position. Never extend yourself to the point where you lose your balance. Reach out to the person and yell, ""Grab my hand/arm/paddle!"" You may have to yell multiple times before the person hears or sees you. Speak in a voice that is loud,clear and confident.This type of rescue is only helpful if the drowning victim is within reach of the side of the pool, pier, or close to the shore.Do not attempt to perform a reaching assist while standing. This puts you in a precarious position, and you are more likely to fall into the water.
Reach out your dominant hand, since you'll be using your strength to pull the victim to safety.
Grab an object you can use to extend your reach if the person is a little too far for your arm to reach. Almost anything that can add a few feet to your reach can help; a boat paddle or a rope are also effective if the person is able to grab them.
Pull the person safely out of the water and gently help him or her get onto dry ground., This is a long metal pole with a hook on the end that can be used either as a handle for the victim to grab, or as a device to wrap around the victim in the event that the victim is unable to hold onto it himself. Many pools and outdoor swimming areas are stocked with this tool. Warn other people on the deck to stand away from the end of the stick in case it hits them. You don't want them to interfere with the rescue.

, Brace your feet in case the victim pulls on the pole. Be sure you're far enough back that you don't risk getting pulled into the water. Hold the hook where the drowning person can reach it, and call to the victim to grab the hook. If the person is unable to grab it, dip the hooked part further into the water and wrap it around the person's torso, just below his or her armpits.Make sure the hook is not near the person's neck, since this could lead to injury.
Aim carefully, as it is often difficult to see.
You will feel a sharp tug when the person finds the crook.

, Verify that the person has grasped the object before you begin to pull him or her in.Slowly and carefully pull the victim to the side until he or she is close enough for you to use a reaching assist to pull him to the wall. Lie down and make sure you are stable before performing the reaching assist."
"
Find a floating aid.,
Throw the floating aid.,
Try throwing a line.",How to Save an Active Drowning Victim3," A floating aid with a line attached is ideal because the line can help you pull the victim in. A ring buoy, life jacket, and floating cushions are often found at lifeguard stations at pools and outdoor swimming areas. Boats are also equipped with ring buoys, so use this rescue if the incident occurs while you're out in the middle of a body of water., Toss the float so that it lands within reach of the victim, but do not strike the victim directly. Take the wind and the current of the water into consideration before you throw. Let the victim know that you are about to throw the aid, and that he or she needs to grab the aid.A good goal is to throw the ring just past the victim, then pull it to him or her with the rope.
If you miss the victim or he or she is unable to grab the aid, pull the line back or try throwing another device.
If repeated attempts are unsuccessful, you may need to try another method or swim to push the device closer to the victim., An unweighted rope can also be used to rescue a victim. Loosely coil the rope or line in your non-throwing hand by tying a small loop on one end and placing your wrist in the loop. Use an underhand motion to throw the ring, and allow the rope to uncoil freely from your non-throwing hand. Step on the end of the rope so that you do not accidentally throw the ring away.Aim for the victim's shoulder when throwing a line.
Once the victim grabs the line, drop the coil, and begin to slowly pull the line until the victim has reached the side or is able to stand in shallow water.

"
"
Be sure of your swimming abilities.,
Dive in with an aid.,
Swim to the victim.,
Swim back to shore.",How to Save an Active Drowning Victim4," Swim rescues should be used as a last resort. They require training and very good swimming skills. Victims are often thrashing and panicking which can make it hazardous to perform a swimming rescue., Do not attempt a swimming rescue without a buoy on hand; a drowning victim's first reaction will be to climb on top of you, so you'll need a flotation device to keep both of you safe and perform the rescue effectively. If you don't have a buoy, go in with a t-shirt or towel that the victim can grab onto., Use the freestyle stroke to quickly get to the drowning person. If you are in a large body of water, use ocean swimming techniques to avoid getting tossed back in a wave.Toss the buoy or rope for the person to grab.Instruct the victim to grab the object. Remember not to swim right up to the victim, since he or she is likely to push you under the water.

, Move in a straight line back to shore, towing the person behind you. Check back every few paces to make sure he or she is still holding the buoy or rope. Continue swimming until you make it safely back to shore, then exit the water.


Keep a safe distance between you and the victim.

"
"
Assess the person's ABCs - airway, breathing and circulation.,
Start CPR.,
Give breaths if the person is still not breathing.",How to Save an Active Drowning Victim5," Make sure someone has called 911 and check the ABCs. Determine if the person is breathing in and out, and if anything is obstructing his or her airway. If the person is not breathing, feel for a pulse on the wrist or the side of the neck. The pulse should be checked for 10 seconds., If the person has no pulse, begin performing CPR. For adults and children, place the heel of one hand hand on the center of the chest or place one hand on top of the other. Perform 30 chest compressions at the rate of 100 per minute. Press down about 2 inches. Allow the chest to rise completely between pushes. Check to see if the person has started breathing.Do not press on the victim's ribs.
If the victim is an infant, 2 fingers should be placed on the breastbone. Press down about 1.5 inches.

, Only give breaths if you are trained in CPR. Begin by tilting the head back and lifting the person's chin. Pinch the nose, cover the victim's mouth with yours, and give 2, one second breaths. Watch to make sure the chest is rising. Follow the 2 breaths with 30 chest compressions.Continue this cycle until the person begins breathing or professional emergency help arrives.

Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen.The fastest way to deal with the pain is to take a painkiller such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.,
Ice your bruise.,
Try parsley.",How to Stop a Bruise from Hurting1," Neither one of these is a blood thinner, which is why they are a good choice with a bruise,and in fact, ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation.A blood thinner, such as aspirin, can increase blood flow, making a bruise worse.However, don't stop taking aspirin if you're on an aspirin regimen. Ask your doctor first.;
, Wrap an ice pack or ice cubes (in a zip-top bag) in a towel. Hold it on the bruise for at least 10 minutes. The ice helps reduce the inflammation and swelling, which can lessen pain, but it will also have a numbing effect.You can use this treatment three to four times a day,though some professionals note that you can employ this technique once every hour.Instead of an ice pack, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables such as peas to ice your bruise. You can refreeze it when you're done, but only use it as an icepack from that point on., Some people claim that parsley can help ease the pain and inflammation of a bruise.To use this technique, start with fresh parsley. Crush the leaves with something heavy, such as a pot or a mortar and pestle. Rub the leaves on the bruised area, and use an elastic bandage to hold it in place."
"
Keep it elevated.,
Get some rest.,
Try St. John's wort.,
Avoid massaging your bruise.,
Try vitamin K. Like St. John's wort, some people have luck gently applying vitamin K to the bruise because vitamin K helps with clotting.,
Apply arnica.",How to Stop a Bruise from Hurting2," Elevating the bruised area forces your blood to pump uphill, which reduces the blood flow to the area. Reducing the blood flow helps keep the swelling down.For the best results, try to elevate the area so that it is above your heart., Try not to overuse the area where you got the bruise. Your tissue needs time to repair itself, and resting can help it do that. Using the muscles too much can cause further damage., You may have heard that St. John's wort is sometimes used as a natural antidepressant. However, some people also use it to help with bruises because they believe it helps shrink tissues and slow down bleeding.To use, apply the oil version of this supplement to your bruise three times a day., Though it may be tempting to rub your bruise to help it feel better, doing so can actually cause more damage., Find the cream version to use on your bruise, and use it twice a day., This is often recommended by plastic surgeons to reduce bruising. Try rubbing an arnica cream, ointment, or salve onto the bruised area to reduce inflammation and and soothe any aching."
"
Check for the cause.,
Look for signs of infection.,
Feel for pressure.,
Watch for lumps.",How to Stop a Bruise from Hurting3," If you are badly bruised or have many bruises but you didn't fall or injure yourself, you should call your doctor. That can be an indication of a more serious problem. It could mean you have a problem with blood clotting or another blood disease.If the bruise doesn't improve after two weeks, reach out to your doctor.

, One sign of infection is red streaking, where fingers of redness on the skin jut out away from the bruised area. Another symptom is if the bruise is draining something other than blood, such as pus. Also, check to see if you have a fever, as that can be an indicator as well. Call your doctor if you have these symptoms.Other signs of infection are if the bruised area gets more swollen, painful, or warm

, If you feel a great deal of pressure where you are bruised, that is also a reason to call your doctor. It can be a sign of compartment syndrome, a serious condition that slows down circulation in that area.The area may feel very firm or hard and be very painful. See your doctor immediately if the area below the bruise is numb, cold, very pale, or blue.

, If a lump forms over the bruise, called a hematoma, that is also a cause for concern.Hematomas are very similar to bruises. That is, they form when blood escapes from a blood vessel. However, they create larger bumps and can be more dangerous."

Check your diet.,
Move obstacles in your house.,
Protect your skin with cloth.,
Work on your balance.,
Wear protective gear when playing sports.,
Talk to your doctor about medications you are taking.,
Avoid supplements that increase bruising.",How to Stop a Bruise from Hurting4," If you aren't getting the right nutrients, you may end up bruising more easily. Make sure you are eating your fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, lean protein, and dairy.The main deficiencies that can lead to excessive bruising are vitamins C, K, and B12. Lack of folic acid can also be a problem. These nutrients help your blood clot., If your house is especially cluttered, it can lead to you having more injuries. For instance, maybe you always trip over one particular table. Consider moving the table to another area to prevent the problem., Just by wearing long sleeves and pants, you can help protect your skin from minor bruises., Bruises often result from falling or klutziness, so by improving your balance, you can decrease your chances of getting a bruise.


Try weight shifts. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Shift your weight to your right foot. Lift up your left foot. Balance in this position for 30 seconds. Shift to other foot, and hold it for 30 seconds.Get physical. That is, even exercises such as walking can help you improve your balance. Try taking a walk everyday to help you increase your balance., Take measures to protect yourself when playing sports by wearing the appropriate gear. This may include a helmet, shin or wrist guards, padding, etc., Bruising easily is a side effect of some medications, especially blood thinners or heart medicines. Talk to your doctor about switching medicines or what you can do to prevent bruises if you are concerned. However, don't stop any of these medications without talking to your doctor.

, Fish oil, vitamin E, garlic, ginger, and ginkgo biloba are all supplements that may cause you to bruise easily, especially if you take a blood-thinning medication.Talk to your doctor about alternatives.

Collect on your judgment.",How to Sue a Homeowner for Injuries As a Trespasser," If the police were called to the scene, then a police report was probably filed. You should see what was included in it. For example, you should look for the identifying information of any witnesses.Also, the police might describe the hazard you encountered on the property. This information could be helpful in negotiations, since it serves as proof that the homeowner created a hazard.
To find a police report, see Obtain a Police Report.;
, If you win your lawsuit, you can be compensated for any money spent to treat your injury. Accordingly, hold onto all medical bills and pharmacy receipts which show how much money you spent.


Also get copies of your medical records. These will help establish the extent of your injuries., As soon as possible, you should document your injuries with color photographs.Photographs can be graphic evidence of the injury. Your trial might not take place until a year after you were injured. By that time, cuts and broken bones will have healed and bruising will have disappeared.


Take pictures of your injuries from several different angles. Remember not to smile in the photographs.
If your camera shows a date on the front of the picture, make sure the correct date shows up.

, If possible, you should get photographs of where you were injured, though you shouldn’t trespass again to get them. However, if you can see where you were injured from the road, then take photographs. Use a long-distance lens to get close-up photographs.


Take pictures from many different angles.In particular, you want to be sure to establish that there were no signs warning you of a hazard.
For example, you might have been shot because the homeowner practices skeet shooting in his backyard. If the homeowner knows that people trespass in his backyard, then he needs to warn people that people fire guns in the vicinity.

, You should also write down what you remember of the incident.There is no getting around the fact that you trespassed, so don’t try to make up an excuse for why you went on someone’s property. Instead, stick to the facts.


Specifically mention whether you ever received a warning—an oral warning to stay off the property or a written warning in the form of a sign.

, A homeowner has a duty to warn trespassers of dangers if the homeowner has reason to know that people regularly trespass on the property.Accordingly, you should try to get witness statements from other people who trespass. These statements can help prove that the homeowner should have known that people routinely trespassed on the property and that warnings were therefore necessary.


For example, the public might routinely cut across someone’s lawn to get to the train station. Talk with people who take that route. Ask them if the homeowner has ever spoken to them as they were cutting across the lawn. If the homeowner had, then you can establish the homeowner knew that people regularly trespassed.

, You should meet with a lawyer before filing your lawsuit. The lawyer can listen to the facts of the lawsuit and advise you about your next steps. You can find a personal injury lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association, which should run a referral program.


Once you have the name of a lawyer, you can call for a half hour consultation. Most lawyers offer consultations for free or for a reduced price.
You should also think about hiring the lawyer. Lawsuits can be tricky and you would benefit from an experienced lawyer. Many lawyers will bring personal injury lawsuits on “contingency.” This means that they don’t charge a fee; instead, they take a cut of whatever amount you get in a settlement or at trial.
Usually, personal injury lawyers take 33-40% of the amount. You still have to pay for the costs of the lawsuit (such as filing fees, service fees, and court reporters)., You start a lawsuit by filing a complaint. In this document, you identify yourself as the “plaintiff” who is bringing the lawsuit and the homeowner as the “defendant” who is being sued. You also describe the circumstances surrounding the lawsuit and make a demand for money compensation.If you have an attorney, he or she can draft the complaint. However, if you are representing yourself, then you should stop into court and ask the court clerk if there is a printed “fill in the blank” form you can use. Often, courts have these forms.

, In your complaint, specifically allege that you are entitled to compensation. As a general rule, you cannot get compensation because you were a trespasser. Accordingly, you need to allege that you fit into one of the two standard exceptions to this rule:The homeowner willfully and wantonly tried to harm you. For example, if the homeowner shot at you as you picked an apple from his tree, then he has tried to willfully harm you. A homeowner cannot willfully harm someone simply for trespassing (unless you were breaking into the homeowner’s house). Explain how the homeowner tried to willfully hurt you.
The homeowner knew people were trespassing but didn’t warn of a hazard. With this exception, make sure you explain why the homeowner would know people were regularly trespassing. Also explain the hazard that the homeowner created and state that he or she was careless in not warning you of the danger.

, Once you have completed the complaint, make several copies. Take the copies and the original to the court clerk and ask to file. The clerk can stamp your copies with the filing date.


You will probably have to pay a filing fee, which should vary by court. If you can’t afford it, then ask for a fee waiver form and complete it., You need to give the homeowner notice that you have filed a lawsuit. You can serve this notice by delivering a copy of your complaint and a summons.You can get the summons from the court clerk.


Each state has different rules about acceptable methods of service. Ask the court clerk.
Generally, you can hire a private process server to make hand delivery. Usually, they charge about $45-75 per service.You also might be able to have the sheriff make service for a small fee.

, Whoever makes service should fill out a “proof of service” or “affidavit of service” form. You can get this from the court clerk. After the server fills it out, the form will be returned to you.


Keep a copy of the form for your records and file the original with the court.

, The defendant should respond to the lawsuit by filing an “answer.” In this document, the homeowner will admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each allegation.Your lawyer will receive the answer. If you don’t have a lawyer, it should be delivered to you.


Read the answer closely. It contains the homeowner’s version of events. The answer won’t go into great detail, but the answer will contain the first clues about what the defendant’s version of events will be.
Look to see if the defendant is making any factual allegations you disagree with. For example, the defendant might claim that he posted signs around his property warning people of dangers. Quickly return to the property and check to see if signs were recently installed after the accident. Take photographs and document the date the signs appeared on the property.

, Lawsuits are long and expensive. For this reason, you might want to settle your lawsuit. If the homeowner has homeowner’s insurance, then you can expect a call from the claims adjuster. Insurance companies often want to settle lawsuits rather than go to trial. To see if settlement is a good option for you, analyze the strength of your case.


Look at your evidence. Do you have proof that the defendant acted to harm you willfully? Do you have proof that the defendant knew that people were trespassing?
If you do, then you might have a strong case and can be aggressive during negotiations. If you don’t, then you might have to settle for less than you want.

, Before you can negotiate, you need to figure out the absolute minimum you are willing to settle for. Because negotiation is voluntary, you can walk away at any point. The minimum amount you are willing to settle for is your “walkaway point.”Your walkaway point can be higher depending on the strength of your case. For example, if you have a strong case, then you might walk away if the defendant can’t give you 90% of what you asked for in your complaint.

, Your lawyer will handle most of the negotiations with the defendant or the claims adjuster. Nevertheless, you should continue to give your input. Your attorney cannot accept a settlement offer without your permission.To negotiate effectively, remember the following:


Don’t cave too quickly.The other side expects you to negotiate, so you should continue to press even if the other side offers you a good deal right off the bat.
Stay calm. You will be more effective in negotiation if you come across as someone who is really listening to the other side and does not get upset.
Ask the other side to justify their offers. If you think an initial offer is too low, ask why you aren’t being offered a higher number.

, A settlement agreement is a contract between you and the homeowner (or you and the insurance company).As part of the agreement, you will agree to dismiss any lawsuit that you have filed and agree not to file any lawsuit against the homeowner based on your injury in the future.


Your lawyer should draft or look over the settlement agreement. If you negotiated without a lawyer, then you should at least schedule a meeting with a lawyer to look over the settlement agreement. You must understand everything in the agreement before signing it, and only an experienced lawyer can answer your questions properly.

, You should file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit once you sign a settlement agreement. You can also file the settlement agreement with the court if you want.


If the homeowner does not fulfill their promises under the agreement, then you can bring a lawsuit.

, After the defendant files an answer, the lawsuit enters “discovery.” During this phase of the lawsuit, each side tries to uncover helpful evidence from the other. One discovery technique is to request documents from the homeowner. You can get any document even slightly related to the case., Witnesses can also answer questions under oath during discovery. You can answer questions face-to-face with a lawyer in a “deposition.” Depositions take place in a lawyer’s office with a court reporter present. The defendant will want you to sit for a deposition, so remember the following tips:Don’t answer until you fully understand the question. Ask the lawyer to clarify questions.
Never guess and be careful when giving estimates. If you need to provide an estimate, then make sure the lawyer understands you are providing only a rough estimate.
Request a break to speak to your lawyer. You can confer at any time.
Always stay calm and don’t get rattled. Depositions can become long fishing expeditions. People’s nerves tend to fray after several hours. Always stay polite and smile.
Tell the truth. You commit perjury if you lie. Also, your lie could be introduced later at trial where it will undermine your credibility.

, After discovery ends, either side can bring a “motion for summary judgment.” You should expect the homeowner to file one. In the motion, the homeowner argues that there are no facts in dispute and that judgment is appropriate as a matter of law.Your lawyer will counter by arguing that there are meaningful facts in dispute. For example, whether the homeowner knew people regularly trespassed would be a factual issue for the jury to decide unless there is absolutely no evidence that anyone else has ever trespassed on the property.

, If you hired a lawyer to represent you, then he or she will be responsible for preparing for trial. If you are representing yourself, then make sure to do the following:


Get your witnesses lined up. You should only have people testify if they have personal knowledge of what they are testifying about. For example, someone cannot testify about gossip.However, someone could testify that they regularly trespass across the homeowner’s property and that the homeowner saw them many times.
Serve subpoenas on witnesses. A subpoena is a legal command to come into court and testify. You can get blank subpoena forms from the court clerk. Fill them out with the day, time and location of the trial. Then serve them on your witnesses.

, Go through your paperwork and find helpful documents. For example, you will probably want to introduce hospital records and bills, which help establish your damages. You can turn a document into an exhibit by affixing an exhibit sticker to a corner. You can get the stickers from the court clerk or an office supply store.Make several copies of your exhibits. You will need to give one copy of all exhibits to the defendant. Also the court will get a copy and the witness will need to look at a copy. Accordingly, make at least four copies of everything.

, You will probably be nervous representing yourself. To calm your nerves and give you confidence, you can sit in on a trial. Courtrooms are generally open to the public.Ask the court clerk if there is a trial you can watch.


Pay attention to where the parties sit and how they speak to the judge. Do they stand when speaking? Where do they stand when asking witnesses questions?
Also listen to how they ask questions.
Finally, pay attention to how they are dressed. You want to look as professional during your own trial.

, As the person bringing the lawsuit, you will go first. You can call your witnesses and possibly even testify yourself. If you have a lawyer, then he or she will ask the witnesses questions. If you don’t have a lawyer, then you need to ask them questions. Remember not to ask “leading questions.”


For example, “You regularly walked across the defendant’s lawn, right?” is a leading question. It contains its own answer and can be answered with a “yes” or “no.”Instead, ask a series of general questions:
“Where do you live?”
“Where do you catch the train?”
“How do you walk to the train station?”
“Did you have permission to walk across the defendant’s lawn?”
“How many times a week would you cross the defendant’s lawn?”

, The defendant goes second. The defendant will probably testify in his or her defense. Your lawyer will be able to cross-examine all defense witnesses.


If you are handling cross-examination yourself, then see Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for tips.

, After all evidence has been submitted, the judge will read the instructions to the jury, who will retire to deliberate.If you don’t have a jury, then the judge will deliver the verdict from the bench. Usually, the judge will deliver the verdict immediately though, if the case is complicated, the judge might take the case under consideration and issue a verdict later.

, You should discuss with a lawyer whether an appeal is worthwhile. You will definitely need a lawyer for your appeal, so if you represented yourself during trial you should factor in the cost of hiring a lawyer for the appeal. Appeals are technical and require that the lawyer draft a legal argument, called a brief.


You might want to appeal if the judge made an error letting in evidence. For example, the judge might have let defense witnesses testify as to gossip that they heard about you. This is an error which you could argue influenced the verdict.
If you want to appeal, then don’t wait too long. Courts generally give you only 30 days or less to file your Notice of Appeal. The clock usually starts running from the date final judgment is entered.

, If you win your lawsuit, you must collect the money from the defendant. The court will not collect it for you. With luck, the defendant will pay up with no hassles. If not, then you need to take other steps.


You might garnish the defendant’s wages. If you know where the defendant works, then you can file a garnishment action.You could also put liens on the defendant’s property. After foreclosing and selling the property, you get to keep some of the proceeds from the sale.

Depression and despair are common co-morbid symptoms accompanying brain injury survivors. Remember that being a survivor means being alive, and while there is life, there is hope.;
, Healing can be a long journey, and it takes time. It's not measured in days, or weeks, or months. It is a journey measured in milestones. It is not uncommon for brain injury survivors to take years, or even spend the rest of their lives healing. Having unrealistic expectations may lead to feeling one's progress is too slow or hopeless. It's not a sprint, it's an endurance race.

, Maintaining a positive mental attitude is far more difficult than it sounds. While the internet has all sorts of lists with things to try, they can seem vague or too broad and general. Lists are easier said than done. Find what works for you. Something still makes you laugh, or smile. Find it!


The only real control we have is control over ourselves. If you find yourself being argumentative or angry, it's okay. Just take a moment to stop and breathe. Let it out, and refocus yourself on adopting a better attitude. Resentment isn't a path to happiness...for you, or anyone around you.

, They include friends, family or therapists. Isolation will only hinder rebuilding a life. Starting over is an enormous task, don't insist on trying it alone. It's your road to recovery, how you choose to travel is up to you.

, It can be difficult to accept that life has changed. Clinging to elements of the past may only impede discovering a path forward. Don't allow pride to be a difficult obstacle all it's own.

, There is a wealth of resources for brain injury survivors waiting to be discovered, not just the internet. Look in your local area for support groups, therapists, government agencies, or non-profit organizations. There are doctors that specialize in cognitive therapy which may help address specific symptoms and difficulties. There are experts that can help you, but you need to find them. If you need help reaching out to them, ask a trusted friend, family member, social worker or medical professional. The Society for Cognitive Rehabilitation website has a large list with links to resources, including some available internationally. Here is a brief list of possible resources to start you off.

, A daily routine may include performing self care tasks, participating in therapy, visiting with friends or family, etc. Not only will this help accomplish necessary goals, it induces feelings of being productive.

, Every daily routine should include activities that will elevate one's mood and are worth looking forward to. Life can still be fun!

, Here is a short list to get you started. Consistency is important. Stick faithfully to your routine, but don't be afraid to modify it to changing circumstances. Think of a day's routine as a brick, and each brick is a building block in a new life.


Preparing meals, can be very rewarding. If you're having trouble with this consider making it a group activity with some help.
Meditation can be very relaxing, but it takes practice.
Write a journal. This will help you recall a day's activities. Record your thoughts, and feelings and even what you ate that day if you want.
Socialize. Talk to someone, text, use the phone, whatever it takes. Isolation feeds depression.
Read a book, do a puzzle, sudoku, crosswords, anything to engage your mind. It won't expand itself if you don't make the effort to stretch it.
Watch a movie, TV or take a nap. It's okay to indulge a bit in moderation.

, Quality medical care may be a relevant concern. Depending upon one's nationality, the cause of the injury, employment status or socioeconomic group available medical care may not be adequate. Solutions are rarely easy, and circumstances may be tremendously frustrating. It is most important to not give up. Asking someone trusted for help, and being patient may be crucial to obtaining quality health care.

, Financial circumstances are likely to change. Maybe employment in a previous career is no longer possible. Maybe a set of job skills no longer operate as they did before. Maybe bank statements appear indecipherable and confusing now. There is no simple answer to this.

, Losing one's independence can seem crippling. Maybe it's very difficult to take care of yourself now, and someone has to assist. Maybe you cannot operate an automobile or spend time with your children like before. Again, there are no easy solutions. Making the most with what you can manage is the key. The silver lining is in every cloud, sometimes it's better hidden than others. Sometimes it's just the little things.

, The person staring back in the mirror might not recognize you. Friends and family might not understand why behaviors or personalities change. It can place a strain on everyone that is best managed with love and patience. Remember that the people in your life are trying to adjust, too.

, A brain injury isn't like other injuries. It's not obvious to casual observers. Friends or family members might seem like strangers. Distant memories might simply not match with current circumstances. The past might feel foreign, or altogether alien. What still lies before you is what matters most. It's not about who you were anymore. It's all about who you are now.

, It can be very hard to endure the profound changes thrust upon a brain injury survivor. Find those things that make you smile. Take all the time necessary to discover the new life before you.

Participate in mediation.",How to Seek Punitive Damages," A good place to start your search is to visit the website of your state or local bar association. Typically you can use their directories to find personal injury attorneys in your area, and you also can confirm that any attorney you consider is licensed and in good standing.Since personal injury attorneys typically work under contingency fee agreements, you shouldn't have to worry about money to pay attorney's fees up front.
If you know anyone who's recently been involved in a personal injury case, you might ask them for a recommendation – but keep in mind that a lawsuit for punitive damages is quite a bit different than a simple negligence case that resulted in a settlement.
When you get a few names, check their websites and pay particular attention to any discussion of past cases the attorney has won. Look for attorneys who have experience and a proven track record of success in winning significant verdicts of punitive damages at jury trials.
At the same time, if you're seeking punitive damages you probably want to avoid attorneys who focus on settlements. While it's true that the vast majority of civil cases settle out of court, punitive damages almost always are awarded as a result of a jury verdict after a trial.;
, If you intend to seek punitive damages, any attorney with whom you speak will need as much information about the incident as you have so they can evaluate the possibility of such an award and estimate your odds of success at trial.The attorneys you interview will not only need to consider whether punitive damages are even legally available for injuries or losses such as yours, but also to calculate possible amounts that could be awarded.
Keep in mind that punitive damage awards are highly fact-dependent and can vary widely on a case-by-case basis.
Before any attorney can paint you a reliable picture of possible outcomes for you at trial, he or she will need to have all the information you have about your case and the incident that led to your claim. From this, a strong attorney can determine what information is missing that is necessary to make a claim for punitive damages.

, Before you make your final choice, you should try to schedule initial consultations with at least three attorneys so you can compare and contrast to make an informed decision about who would best represent you.Since most personal injury attorneys offer free consultations, this shouldn't require much out-of-pocket investment – but it will take you some time to interview and evaluate several attorneys.
Prepare for your interviews by making a list of questions you want to ask each attorney. The list can help you to focus if you get distracted in the attorney's office or are intimidated by your surroundings.
Find out how many jury trials the attorney has handled, and ask for some examples of awards of punitive damages they've won for past clients.
You also want to ask questions about the attorney's work style. Understanding the best ways to communicate with your attorney and how quickly they respond to phone calls or emails can give you an idea of what it would be like to be their client.
When you evaluate each attorney, pay attention to your comfort level and how they interact with you and the other people working in an office.
Don't be afraid to go with your gut and pass on an attorney who's perfect on paper but makes you feel uncomfortable or intimidated in person. You're going to be working intensely with this person for a year or more during the litigation of your case – how the attorney makes you feel can be just as important as their track record and level of expertise.

, Even though you probably will hire your attorney under a contingency fee arrangement, it's important to get the details of your representation in writing so there is no confusion later on.Your attorney should go through the agreement with you and make sure you understand all aspects of it before you sign it. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask. Your attorney would rather you understand the agreement than have a dispute later.
The agreement should outline how the attorney will account for costs, what costs will come out of your award or settlement separately, and what percentage of your award or settlement the attorney will take as a fee.
There also will be information in the agreement regarding the scope of the attorney's representation and the types of tasks he or she is being hired to complete on your behalf.

, Once you've hired your attorney, you'll work with him or her to draft the complaint, which is the document you must file with the court to initiate your lawsuit. Your complaint identifies yourself and the person or company you're suing and lists your factual allegations against them.The bulk of the complaint consists of numbered paragraphs, each of which contains a single factual statement.
These paragraphs together outline the incident that occurred, the ways in which the defendant was responsible for your losses or injuries, and your legal theory as to why you are entitled to monetary damages as a result.
You will make a demand in your complaint for both compensatory and punitive damages. Your attorney will need information about the expenses or losses you incurred so he or she can calculate your compensatory damages.
The calculation of punitive damages will be based on a number of factors, including how reprehensible the defendant's conduct was and the amounts awarded to similar plaintiffs under similar circumstances.

, After your complaint has been finalized, it must be filed with the clerk of the court in which you want your lawsuit to be heard. Although this is something your attorney typically will take care of, it can help for you to understand the process.Your attorney likely will take your complaint to the courthouse and give it to a clerk along with the filing fees – typically several hundred dollars – the court charges to initiate a lawsuit.
The clerk will stamp the original documents and several copies ""filed"" with the date. One set of copies likely will be for your own records. Keep them in a safe place with the other documents you have related to the lawsuit or the incident that gave rise to it.

, Since both parties in a lawsuit must have the opportunity to be heard, you must have a summons and your complaint officially delivered to the defendant so they know they're being sued and what they need to do to defend themselves.You typically only have a limited period of time after the documents are filed to have them served on the defendant. If your attorney is having difficulty serving the defendant, there are other steps that can be taken.
One common method of service is to have the documents hand-delivered to the defendant by a sheriff's deputy. Private process-serving companies also may be used for defendants who are difficult to find or attempt to evade service.
Some courts also allow service by sending the documents using certified mail with returned receipt requested.
Once service is completed, there are proof of service documents that must be filed with the court to prove the defendant had notice of the lawsuit.

, Once served with your lawsuit, the defendant has a limited period of time – typically less than 30 days – to file an answer or other motion in response to your complaint.If the defendant does not respond to your lawsuit by the deadline, you typically can file a motion for a default judgment. However, default judgments typically do not include awards of punitive damages.
In any event, you shouldn't expect the defendant not to respond. On the contrary, you should expect to receive an answer that denies most, if not all, of your allegations and asserts a number of defenses.
The defendant also may file a motion to dismiss your lawsuit. When this happens, you'll have to appear in court to prove to the judge that you have a legitimate claim under the law before you'll be allowed to proceed.

, If the defendant filed a motion in response to your complaint, such as a motion to dismiss, the court typically will hold a hearing on that motion before the pretrial litigation can properly begin.Keep in mind that judges typically refuse to entertain any additional pleadings or requests from a plaintiff until a motion to dismiss is decided – even though it may be months before a hearing can be scheduled.
Apart from a motion to dismiss, pretrial litigation typically involves a number of procedural motions and scheduling conferences to keep litigation moving and get the judge's opinion on relatively minor issues that relate to the exchange and production of evidence and information.
Typically your presence won't be required in court for hearings on technical or procedural matters. If you don't attend, your attorney will send you a letter summarizing the event, its outcome, and what it means in terms of your litigation strategy going forward.

, Through written discovery, you and the defendant will exchange information and documents related to the incident that gave rise to your lawsuit. This process can continue for months if not years, and will help you and your attorney flesh out your arguments and build your case against the defendant.Interrogatories are one aspect of written discovery. Both you and the defendant will create written questions for each other that must be answered in writing and under oath.
When you're seeking punitive damages, your attorney likely will use interrogatories to learn about the defendant's state of mind and get the names and information of witnesses or other individuals who are likely to know something about the defendant's intent in behaving the way they did or committing the acts that led to your losses or injuries.
Requests for production are another valuable discovery tool. You can ask the defendant to produce any documents or other evidence that is related to the incident that serves as the basis of your lawsuit, as well as any related policies or procedures.

, Depositions are another aspect of the pretrial discovery process, through which you have the opportunity to interview people under oath in the presence of a court reporter.During a deposition, the parties and their attorneys – along with whoever is being interviewed, if they are not a party to the case – meet with a court reporter, typically in a conference room at the law firm of the attorney holding the deposition.
The attorney asks questions and the party or witness answers, and both the questions and answers are recorded by the court reporter, who produces a transcript for later use.
Depositions are good for preserving testimony of witnesses, particularly since litigation can last months or even years, and memories can fade in the meantime.
When you're seeking punitive damages, you want to use depositions to try to nail the defendant on their thoughts or motivation in acting in a way that caused your loss or injury.

, Throughout litigation, expect the defendant to present several settlement offers. While your attorney is required to present these offers and offer advice, the decision of whether to accept a settlement offer ultimately is yours alone.The prospect of a jury trial likely will encourage the defendant to seek settlement, particularly if they aren't a very sympathetic individual or if you're suing a large corporation.
Fault is a key part of an award of punitive damages – a jury is saying that the defendant behaved badly and should be punished for it. Particularly if you're suing a business, this sort of verdict can be especially damaging for the company's reputation as well as inspiring suits from others who were similarly injured.
For these reasons, the defendant is going to do everything in their power to entice you to settle the lawsuit before trial.
However, keep in mind that settlements typically are confidential, and may not include any admission of fault or wrongdoing. If you're seeking punitive damages for the principle of the thing, you may decide that it's worth it to stick to your guns, even if you don't ultimately win your lawsuit.
At each stage of the process, your attorney should keep you well advised of your prospects at trial and the strengths and weaknesses of your case.

, Many courts require litigants to at least attempt the mediation process before a trial can be scheduled. Through mediation, a neutral third party works with you and the defendant in an attempt to reach a settlement of the dispute.Just like a private settlement, the defendant will prefer reaching a settlement through negotiation because the outcome will be confidential.
Likewise, don't expect punitive damages to be a part of any settlement reached through mediation.
However, you may have more flexibility with mediation than you did with private negotiations to convince the defendant to take other actions that help eliminate the problems that caused your injury or loss – even if punitive damages aren't included.
Keep in mind that even if the mediation process is mandated by the courts, reaching settlement is voluntary and never required. It's perfectly acceptable to bargain to an impasse – in which case you'll have to start preparing for trial.

See your doctor to evaluate your ankle injury.,
Take over-the-counter pain medication.,
Use assistive devices.,
Ice and elevate your ankle.,
Work with a physical therapist.",How to Rehab a Sprained Ankle1," Sprained ankles can often be treated at home. However, see your doctor to have your ankle injury evaluated to make sure there are no severe problems like broken bones. Your doctor will also advise you on how to take care of your ankle at home.Ask your doctor, “When can I start to rehabilitate my ankle?” and “When can I go back to my normal activities?” It’s important not to rush this to avoid long-term injury.;
, Your sprained ankle will probably be weak and painful for a little while. Before you can rehab your ankle to strengthen it, you have to let it rest and heal a bit. Alleviate pain with OTC pain medicine from your local pharmacy or drug store, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), naproxen (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).Ask your doctor or pharmacist which medicine is right for you, especially if you have any liver or kidney problems.

, Allow your healing ankle to rest. Relax as much as possible. When moving around, use crutches to keep weight off of your ankle. Or, if your doctor recommends it, use a removable plastic splint to stabilize your ankle while walking.Your doctor will suggest the best device to rest your ankle, and will probably provide the device to you.

, The swelling and inflammation in your injured ankle have to subside before you can start to rehab it. Whenever possible, sit with your injured ankle propped up on pillows and elevated to a level above your heart. Put an ice pack on your injury for 20 minutes, several times per day. These actions will improve pain, swelling, and inflammation and let you get to rehab sooner.Wrap an ice pack in a towel, don’t put it directly on your skin.

, Once the swelling goes down and your doctor recommends it, start working with a physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to improve the strength, stability, balance, and flexibility of your ankle. Ask your doctor for a referral.A physical therapist will evaluate your injury to determine the most beneficial exercises for you. They will then teach you how to do these exercises so that you can do them at home.
Physical therapy can reduce your chance of injuring your ankle again.

Try using tweezers.,
Use nail clippers for thick splinters.,
Use a needle to pry the splinter loose.,
Consider using a drawing salve.,
Try adding some baking soda to the wound.",How to Remove a Deep Splinter1," If any part of the splinter is visible above the surface of your skin, try removing it with tweezers. Choose tweezers with a serrated inner edge. Grab the tip of the splinter with a firm hold, and slowly pull it out.


Sterilize the tweezers before using them. Wipe them with rubbing alcohol or vinegar, boil them in water for several minutes, or hold them over a flame for about a minute.
Wash your hands before you try to remove your splinter.;
, If the splinter is thick and unlikely to break, a good alternative to tweezers is a sturdy pair of sterilized nail clippers. If the splinter is stuck into thick skin at an extreme angle, clip some overlaying skin to improve visibility and access to the splinter – it shouldn't hurt in thick-skinned areas that aren’t sensitive, like your heel.


Cut your skin in a parallel direction to that of the splinter.
Don't clip deeply enough to cause bleeding. A deeper wound will increase the risk of infection.When using nail clippers or tweezers, use your dominant hand if you can (this won't work if the splinter is in your dominant hand), so you have better dexterity and control.

, For a deeper splinter that's below the surface of your skin, use a sterilized needle or pin to try and dig a portion of it up above the surface. Make a small hole in your skin over the end of the splinter closest to the surface. Try to lift the splinter up with the tip of the needle so you can grab it with tweezers or nail clippers.


Don't try to completely dig the deep splinter out with the needle – you'll cause more damage and risk breaking the splinter.

, A drawing salve is a type of disinfectant that helps to dislodge deeper splinters by lubricating them and allowing them to ""slip out"" of your skin.Apply the drawing salve to the wound, and wait a day or so for it to dislodge the splinter. Cover the wound with a bandage in the meantime. Waiting for it to work may require some patience.


One of the more common brands is Ichthammol (black drawing salve), which is found over-the-counter at most pharmacies.
Drawing salves are greasy and may smell unpleasant.
In most cases, the salve will only bring the splinter to the skin's surface – you'll still need to pluck it out with tweezers.

, Baking soda is not only a good disinfectant, but it can slow down bleeding and help draw a deep splinter closer to the skin's surface.If the splinter is made of glass, metal, or plastic, then soak the area for up to an hour in a basin of warm water with a few teaspoons of baking soda added. If the splinter is wood, make a thick baking soda paste with some water and apply it over your wound. Cover it with a bandage overnight.


You will need to use tweezers or nail clippers to remove the splinter from your skin’s surface.

Ask your doctor or physical therapist first.,
Do ankle flexing to improve ROM.,
Improve ROM with the alphabet exercise.,
Work on ROM with the foot press activity.,
Stretch your calf.,
Stretch your heel.",How to Rehab a Sprained Ankle2," Some exercises may be better for your particular injury than others. It is important that you get the approval of your doctor or physical therapist before attempting any exercises at home.

You can say something like, ""I found these exercises online that might help ankle injuries. Do you think that these will help me?""

, Start ROM exercises within 3 days of your injury.Sit flat on the floor with your injured leg stretched out in front of you. Keep your knee straight. Flex your foot back towards your body, pointing your toes to the sky. Hold the position as long as possible.Do this as often as possible for the first 3-10 days after your injury.

, Sit in a chair and trace the alphabet with the toes of your injured foot. Do this 1-3 times.This encourages ankle movement in all directions., Sit in a chair with your injured foot flat on the floor. Move your knee slowly side to side. Keep your foot stationary and pressed into the floor. Do this for 2-3 minutes., Do a basic calf stretch by sitting with your knee straight and looping a towel around the ball of your foot. Slowly pull the towel back towards your body until you feel a gentle stretch in your upper calf. Hold this for 20 seconds. Do NOT bounce your stretch – keep it held steady.Repeat this 6-10 times, 5-7 day per week.

Try a more advanced calf stretch once you can comfortably stand. Face a wall and place your hands on the wall. Place your injured foot behind the other, pointing your toes forward. Keep your heels down. Slowly bend your front knee while keeping your back leg straight. Hold this for 20 seconds, repeating 6-7 times.
Start stretching once the swelling and pain subside enough so you can do it comfortably – start with very gentle stretches and gradually increase the stretch as you recover.

, This is similar to the basic calf stretch. Sit with your injured leg out in front of you and loop a towel around the ball of your foot. This time, bend your knee slightly. Pull the towel back until you feel a stretch in your heel and lower calf.Hold this for 20 seconds, and repeat 6-7 times; do this 5-7 days per week.
Try an advanced stretch once you can stand. Repeat the process for the advanced calf stretch, but bend your back knee instead of your front knee to get a stretch in your back leg.

Use outward resistance to strengthen the front of your shin.,
Use inward resistance to strengthen your inner shin.,
Strengthen the front of your shin with resisted flexing.",How to Rehab a Sprained Ankle3," Sit in a chair. Loop an exercise band over the outside of your injured foot, and tie the ends to a sturdy desk or chair. Keep your foot and knee in line. Push your foot outward against the band. Hold the position for 3 seconds, and release. Do three sets of 20 repetitions, 5-7 days a week.If you don’t have an exercise band, simply sit with your foot flat on the floor and push outwards against a wall, cabinet, or other sturdy object. Hold for 3 seconds and release.

, Switch your position from the previous exercise so that the resistance band is looped over the inside of your injured foot. Keep your foot and knee in line and pull your foot inward (toward the midline of your body). Hold for 3 seconds and release. Do 3 sets of 20 repetitions, 5-7 days a week.Alternately, sit with your feet together flat on the floor. Push your injured foot inward against your other foot. Hold for 3 seconds.

, Sit on the floor and loop a resistance band over the top of your foot. Tie the ends to a sturdy object. Keep your leg straight and slowly pull your foot back against the band (into flexion). Do 3 sets of 20 repetitions, 5-7 days a week.If you don’t have a band, sit in a chair and place the heel of your uninjured foot on top of your injured foot. Push down with your top heel to provide resistance, and try to push up with your injured foot. Hold for 3 seconds.

Do the balance test.,
Stand on a pillow.,
Use a resistance band on your uninjured leg.",How to Rehab a Sprained Ankle4," Because sprains are injuries to ligaments, your ability to balance on your injured ankle may be decreased. This can make it easier to roll the ankle and re-injure it. Do an increasingly difficult balance test, starting at level one. Try to hold your balance by standing on your injured foot for 60 seconds, doing 6 repetitions a day. Once you can accomplish this, move to the next level. If you lose your balance, keep practicing at that level until you can do it.The levels are:

Level one: keep your arms out to your sides with your eyes open
Level two: fold your arms across your chest, and keep your eyes open
Level three: keep your arms out to your sides and close your eyes
Level four: fold your arms across your chest, and close your eyes

, Place a pillow on the floor. Stand on the pillow on your injured leg. Hold this for 10 seconds, rest, and repeat it 10 times. Be careful that you do not fall as you do this activity., Stand on your injured leg. Loop a resistance band around your uninjured leg, with the ends tied to a stable object. Pull your uninjured leg forward and back while balancing on your injured leg. Do this 10 times. Start slowly and get gradually faster as you get more comfortable.For a challenge, swing your uninjured leg behind you and then back.

Get medical clearance to participate in physical activities.,
Wear a brace or wrap during activities.,
Continue your exercises indefinitely.",How to Rehab a Sprained Ankle5," Ask your doctor or physical therapist when it’s safe to go back to being physical, especially to the activity during which you injured your ankle. Going back to activities too soon is very risky – you can easily hurt your ankle again and cause lifelong issues., If you injured your ankle during a sport or activity, protect yourself from injuring it again. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about this. They may suggest that you wear a brace or a wrap to protect your ankle joint., Your ankle may never be quite as strong as it was before your injury. To prevent re-injury, continue to do your calf and heel stretching and your strengthening exercises 3-4 days a week indefinitely."

Stop any bleeding.,
Disinfect the punctured area.,
Apply antibiotic ointment.,
Cover the wound.",How to Remove a Deep Splinter2," If the wound bleeds after the splinter is removed, apply pressure to it with a clean cotton ball. Hold it in place for several minutes or until bleeding stops., After you remove the splinter, focus on cleaning the small puncture wound. Wash it with warm water and soap, then dry it with a clean towel and wipe it with an alcohol wipe. Alcohol is an excellent disinfectant, but white vinegar, iodine, and hydrogen peroxide work well also.If you don't have alcohol wipes, use a clean cotton ball or Q-tip and dip it into some rubbing alcohol.
These might sting when you apply them, but it only lasts a moment.

, Antibiotic ointment like Neosporin can help prevent an infection. Apply a small amount to the clean wound. You can get antibiotic cream or ointment at nearly any drug store or pharmacy., After the wound is cleaned and disinfected, let it completely air-dry. Apply a small bandage to protect it from dirt and irritation. You can remove this after a day or two."
"
Avoid squeezing the splinter.,
Keep wood splinters dry.,
Remove splinters with clean hands.,
Remove the splinter in its entirety.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Remove a Deep Splinter3," It may be your first instinct, but don’t squeeze around the edges of the wound with your fingers in efforts to push the splinter out. It rarely works and you risk breaking the splinter and causing more damage., If your splinter is made of wood, don’t get it wet. It might disintegrate when you pull on it, leaving smaller pieces deep in your skin., Avoid infecting the small wound. Just like you should sterilize any instrument you use, wash your hands with soap and water before touching your wounded area. Lather your hands well for at least 30 seconds with antibacterial soap, and rinse them thoroughly., Make sure not to break the splinter off or leave any material within your skin, as you'll increase the risk of an infection.Make sure to pull the splinter out at the same angle it went in to reduce the risk of it breaking. Splinters rarely enter the skin at a 90° angle.

, An infection can develop from any type of splinter, in any area, and at any depth, so be watchful for a couple of days after your splinter is removed. Common signs of an infection include swelling, redness, tenderness, pus, and numbness and tingling around the wound.More serious signs that the infection is spreading around your body include fever, nausea, night sweats, body aches, headaches and delirium. Seek medical help right away.

Seek medical attention if DIY methods fail.,
Get professional help for deep wounds or heavy bleeding.,
See your healthcare provider for splinters beneath your nails.,
Get emergency medical help for splinters in or near your eye.",How to Remove a Deep Splinter4," If you've tried methods at home and can't get the splinter out of your skin, go see your doctor within a few days to get it removed. Don’t leave splinters in your skin.If a deep splinter breaks or shatters beneath your skin, see your doctor to get the pieces removed.

, If the splinter has caused a significant wound that will not stop bleeding after you apply pressure for 5 minutes, go to the doctor. They may need to remove the splinter with special instruments.If the doctor needs to cut the splinter out of your skin with a scalpel, they will use a topical anesthetic to numb the area first.
Large wounds may need stitches to close after the splinter has been removed.

, If you get a deep splinter underneath your finger or toenail, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to remove it on your own. Trying to do so can cause damage. You doctor can safely remove part of your nail and extract the splinter.Your nail will likely grow back normally afterwards.

, If anything penetrates your eye, cover your injured eye and call emergency medical services right away. Do not try to remove it – you can damage your eye and affect your vision. Try to keep both eyes closed until help arrives so that you move your injured eye as little as possible."
"
Take appropriate precautions.,
Use proper shoulder positioning.",How to Recover from an Injured Shoulder1," Do not perform any unnecessary movement of the affected shoulder for at least two weeks after reduction (putting the shoulder back into the socket). During this time, the joint is at its most unstable and is highly susceptible to further dislocation.


Keep the arm in a sling whenever possible and apply ice to help with the swelling. A doctor may prescribe medication for pain, as well as anti-inflammatory drugs; use these as directed.
It is important to keep your injured shoulder within a 90-degree movement plane from your body (90 degrees in front and to the sides). Moving beyond this point increases the likelihood of further injuring your shoulder.

, While your shoulder is healing, it is important to learn proper positioning for maximum stabilization and health. The position recommended is called the “packed” position.


This involves the shoulders being pulled down and backward, as well as rotated outward. A good way to think about this is to pretend you have a tennis ball between your shoulders that you are trying to hold in place.
Another way to get into this position is to hold your arms at your sides and bend your elbows into a 90-degree angle. Once in this position and without moving your elbows, move your hands away from each other until you feel your shoulder and back muscles lightly contract. This will be called the standard position and is how each of the following exercises begins.

"
"
Perform isometric exercises.",How to Recover from an Injured Shoulder2," Begin your active rehabilitation with three isometric exercises (contractions that don't cause any motion).


The first exercise is done while facing a wall with your injured shoulder in-line with your upper body and your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle. Move up to the wall until your fist is in contact and then slowly apply pressure by pushing your first into the wall.
The second exercise starts with you in the same body alignment as the first exercise, but instead, contact the wall with your elbow through to your hand. Slowly try to raise your arm to the side while maintaining proper posture.
The third exercise begins the same position, but place your body so that the wall is in contact with the back of your shoulder. Pull your arms backwards while keeping them in-line with your body.
Perform each exercise with 10 to 15 second intervals and 2 sets of each. Perform each workout 1-2 times daily.;
"
"
Do resistance exercises.,
Build up your rotator cuffs and stability muscles of the shoulder with the following two exercises:


The internal shoulder rotation (right): Begin by standing upright in the standard exercise position with your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle.,
Use the next three exercises to further serve to help you in recovery:


The first exercise: Lie on your stomach (on the edge of a bed or equivalent) with your arms straight in front of you.",How to Recover from an Injured Shoulder3," After you have developed enough strength and stability in the joint to raise your arms parallel to the ground with experiencing little to no pain, you may consider moving on to more demanding exercises. The next three exercises are similar to the first three, but add movement. For these exercises, use resistance from either resistance bands or weights. Be sure not to push yourself too hard, and stop if you feel unusual pain.


The front shoulder raise: (above) Begin in the standard position with either a weight or resistance band in your hand. Palms facing down, raise your arm until your forearm is parallel to the ground, pause for one second and then lower to the starting position. Keep the range of motion limited to parallel with the ground or below. Going any higher may put unnecessary strain on your joint.
The side shoulder raise: (above) involves having your palms down, facing your side and raising your shoulder until it is parallel to the ground. Pause and then lower.
The standing row: (right) involves holding a resistance band that is tethered directly in front of your body, in a straight path from your forearm. From the starting position, allow your arm to move forward until almost fully extended. At this position, pause and then return to the starting position by pulling the band.

, Grab a resistance band that is tethered in a way that when your arm is rotated away from your body, the band is slack. Rotate your arm inwards towards your body and hold for one second. Slowly return your arm to the starting position.
The external shoulder rotation (right): utilizes the same movement pattern as the internal shoulder rotation, except that the starting position begins with your arm already internally rotated. From here, rotate your arm out and hold for one second before returning to the starting position.

, Either with or without free weights, move your arms down towards your feet until they are parallel with your body. Pause for one second and then slowly return to the starting position.
The second exercise: Begin by laying on your stomach and move your hands, palms down, away from each other while keeping them perpendicular to the plane of your body. Once your arms are parallel to the ground, pause, and then slowly lower to starting position.
The third exercise (shoulder flexion): Stand with your arms to your sides. Raise your arms while keeping them at a 45-degree angle directly in front of you. Pause for one second at the top and then lower them back to starting position.

"
"
Do stability exercises.",How to Recover from an Injured Shoulder4," Building back the stability of the joint and your ability to control its movement is imperative. Implement the following exercises into your regimen 4 and 6 weeks after the initial injury.


The first exercise is similar to the one arm plank. Begin on your hands and knees and place your weight on the injured arm (up to 10 seconds at a time). Switch to the uninjured arm for the same time and repeat. If at any point you feel the joint is unstable or is in unusual pain stop the exercise immediately.
The second exercise is a wall push up. Start by standing with your arms out in front of you touching a wall and parallel to the ground. Bend your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body, and allow them to travel to a position that makes your upper arm in-line with your body. Hold this position for one second and then push away from your body until arms are extended but not locked.

"
"
Do advanced exercises.",How to Recover from an Injured Shoulder5," The following exercises are more advanced and will demand more from your shoulders than the previous ones. Only attempt these after your strength has increased greatly, and you no longer feel any pain while completing them.


The push up is done in a similar fashion to the wall push up, except it starts on the ground opposed to standing upright. Stretch out until your legs and upper body are extended. With your hands at shoulder width and in-line with each other, lower your upper body while allowing your elbows to travel at a 90-degree angle to your body. Stop yourself when your elbow is at a 90-degree angle or when your upper arm is in-line with your body. Extend your arms back to the starting position.
The dumbbell thruster/press (above) begins in a standing position with dumbbells in both hands (this position is essentially a modification of the first exercise given in step three). Bring the dumbbells to a starting position even with your chest. Raise the dumbbells straight up while keeping your forearms perpendicular to the ground. After fully extending your arms, pause for one second and then slowly lower the weight to the starting position.
The one arm row begins by having your right arm and right leg resting on a bench while your left leg and left arm (holding a dumbbell) is down in a full extension of the arm. Pull the weight towards you and let your upper arm follow closely to your side. After your arm has reached 90-degrees with your body, pause for one second and lower the weight back to the starting position. Be sure to keep your back as straight as possible and in a neutral spine position.

"
"
Get proper nutrition and adequate sleep.,
Eat a balanced meal of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and whole grains is important, but by far the most important macro-nutrient is protein.,
Sleep sufficiently.,
Continue with your rehabilitation.",How to Recover from an Injured Shoulder6," While healing from this injury, it is important to give your body enough nutrients. This is not the time to go on a diet as your caloric needs are higher due to the increased demands your body needs while healing.

, An average of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is sufficient.

, Along with a healthy diet, it is recommended that after suffering a traumatic injury you should get plenty of sleep. Eight hours or more per night is recommended for most people.

, Continue your rehabilitation by increasing weight and repetitions of each exercise until your full shoulder function has returned. Do not be discouraged if the healing process takes longer than you anticipate. Shoulder injuries can take up to a year to fully heal. Progress may seem slow but if rushed and done improperly, there is a high likelihood of re-injuring yourself and having to undergo surgery.

Give your fracture time to heal.,
Take any prescribed medications regularly.,
Keep the fracture immobile as much as possible.,
Ask about the need for surgery.,
Attend or do therapy consistently.,
Watch out for possible signs of infection and other complications.,
Don’t be afraid to ask for help.,
Eat foods that are filled with calcium and vitamin D. Both calcium and vitamin D promote bone healing, so it is advisable to drink milk and consume other dairy products.These foods will strengthen your bones and speed up the healing process.,
Avoid taking ibuprofen and aspirin.,
Exercise more.,
Avoid behaviors or habits that can slow down bone healing.,
Return to regular activities.",How to Recover from a Bone Fracture," Your body needs time to mend itself and create new bone; a fracture generally takes between 6 and 12 weeks to heal substantially.When healing, your bone will go through three stages:


Inflammation: This process lasts for the first few days after a fracture. Local, internal bleeding and blood clotting provides bone stability and structure to allow bone regrowth.Bone Production: Your body will start to replace the clotted blood with soft cartilage tissue and, later with hard bone tissue.Bone Remodeling: This phase lasts several months to several years.Bone continues to form and solidify, and blood circulation returns to the formerly fractured area .;
, If you've been prescribed home medication, follow all of the directions that were given to you by your doctor or your pharmacy. Also, be aware of the drugs’ side effects and possible interaction with other drugs. Inform your physician immediately if you experience severe side-effects.

, Immobilization is a key step of allowing your fracture to heal; avoid lifting much weight with your fractured limb during the early stages of healing.Excessive movement and a lack of mobility will slow down the healing process, and can result in a bone that has healed incorrectly or without much structural strength.

, Some fractures will heal with immobilization and other therapies alone.However, surgery may be necessary to fully recover from a bone fracture in some cases. Talk to your doctor about your options if he or she has recommended a surgical procedure to mend your bone or to correct other problems. Surgery may be required to:remove bone fragments.
stabilize the bone.
stop blood loss.
improve range of motion.

, Physical therapy can be inconvenient or even painful, but it is essential in preventing muscle wasting. Therapy will increase the strength of the muscles which surround and encase your fractured bone; this process will speed up your recovery. In addition, follow-up medical appointments with an orthopedic specialist may be needed. Start physical therapy after you have been given permission by your orthopedist. Your orthopedist will usually do a followup x-ray to make sure that the fracture has healed and ensure that it is safe to begin therapy.

, There are multiple medical abnormalities that can result from a fractured bone, depending on the severity of the break and the age and general health of the individual.If you have any concerns about these problems, ask your doctor. These complications can include:


Nonunion or malunion of the bone. Nonunion is when the bone cannot grow back together. Malunion is when the bone grows together improperly and requires surgical correction.Severe pain.
Swelling or discoloration of the casted limb.
Smelly discharges, and bleeding require you to seek medical help immediately.Blot clots. Symptoms of a blood clot may include a warm, red, painful swollen spot under your skin.Seek medical help right away if you think you might have a blood clot.

, Waiting for a fracture to heal can be a slow, frustrating, and at times painful process. You may need to ask friends, family, coworkers, and/or your partner to help you perform tasks that you could normally do on your own without a problem. In these instances, don’t hesitate to ask for help with issues such as:


Walking up and down stairs.
Typing on a computer or using your phone.
Driving a vehicle.
Brushing your teeth and other hygiene tasks.

, If for some reason you do not eat dairy products, then increase your consumption of food products such as:


Calcium-enriched orange juice
Tofu
Almonds.

, Although these drugs decrease pain and inflammation, less inflammation is not always better. Inflammation is a natural part of the fracture-healing process; healing bones need the extra blood circulation brought by inflamed tissues. Taking large amounts of aspirin and ibuprofen can lengthen the healing process by decreasing the amount of inflamed tissue around your fracture.To deal with the pain, try taking Tylenol (which doesn’t decrease inflammation) instead.

, Although your fractured bone needs time to heal, and requires substantial immobility, this does not mean that you should not continue to exercise regularly.Exercise will increase circulation throughout your body—especially to the area of your bone fracture. Moderate exercise can also increase the strength of your healing bone, and allow it to heal more quickly than if you cut out exercise altogether. Your healing fracture is still delicate; before it fully heals, you should only exercise in ways and controlled environments that will not further damage your fracture.


Talk with your your physician about when you can begin an exercise regimen and what exercises you can do.

, Avoiding physical therapy, not following your doctor’s orders, and mistreating your cast can all have negative effects on the speed of your fracture’s recovery.Also avoid activities like:


Smoking (which decreases circulation)
Placing weight on the fractured bone too soon.
Poor nutrition.
Excessive alcohol intake.

, Once your fracture has fully healed, it’s time to start easing back into normal physical activity, including running, going to the gym, playing sports, etc. Make sure that you’ve consulted with your doctor and your physical therapist; fractures can take more or less time to heal based on factors like age, health, and diet.As you regain activities:


Start slow and ease back into things, especially if your fracture left you relatively immobile for weeks or months.
Through the recovery process, stay fit and keep a good mental attitude; wait for your fracture to fully heal before you engage in strenuous activity, and you’ll lower your chances of re-injury and have a successful recovery! "

Exercise daily.,
Get some sunlight.,
Sleep at least 7-8 hours each night.,
Avoid cigarette smoke.,
Cut back on caffeine and alcohol.",How to Develop a Strong Immune System1," Establishing a moderate exercise routine can help you be healthier overall.That increased health both boosts your natural immunities and can help you get over illness more quickly.


Try going for a brisk walk for at least 30 minutes most days.Find a walking buddy to keep you motivated and accountable. Even an enthusiastic dog can be a great walking companion.
If you don’t like exercising, try getting involved in a recreational sport or finding an active hobby that will “trick” you into exercising while you are having fun. Some examples could be racquetball, rock climbing, roller skating, kayaking, hiking, or even bird watching in the wilderness.;
, Many Americans have a vitamin D deficiency,which has long-ranging effects on human health. The best way to boost vitamin D levels is to have moderate exposure to direct sunlight. The fresh air won’t hurt either!

, Sleep deprivation can leave your more susceptible to pick up illness.Getting an adequate amount of sleep at night can help your body become refreshed and build its natural defenses. Additionally, getting extra sleep at the first sign of illness can help you bounce back more quickly.

, You should certainly avoid smoking yourself for many health reasons, but even being around other people who are smoking can decrease your immune function.If you are a smoker, you should quit.
If your friends or family members are smokers, try encouraging them to quit. If that doesn’t work, avoid the smokers during times that your immune system needs to be strongest (like during cold and flu season).

, Caffeine and alcoholmay be fine in moderation, but excessive consumption of either can compromise your immunity.Remember that water is the best source of healthy hydration, and if you follow other immune-boosting steps like reducing your stress levels and getting more sleep, you may find that you don’t feel like you need caffeine and alcohol as much.

"
"
Avoid stress.,
Laugh more.,
Spend time with other people.,
Bond with a pet.",How to Develop a Strong Immune System2," Stress, particularly chronic stress, can be one of your immune system’s worst enemies. Studies have consistently shown that there is a direct relation between people who self-identify as stressed and reduced immunity/increased illness.Meditate or do yoga to encourage a more peaceful outlook on life.
When possible, address the source of the stress. If there is an individual person or an aspect of your job that causes you great stress, try reducing your contact with the person or activity if possible.
Try going to therapy if you feel like you need help addressing and dealing with deep-seated or long-term stress.

, People who feel happier and spend more time laughing and smiling have healthier immune systems.Finding a source of humor for yourself—and allowing yourself to have a sense of humor, even if you are a generally sensitive person—can help your emotional health and your immunity.


Find a funny TV show or movie that makes you laugh and relax.
Watch online videos of animals or babies doing funny things.
Find a comedian/comedienne who you particularly like and download podcasts of his/her standup routine.
Read comic strips or humorous print materials.
Spend more time with a friend who you find particularly funny. You could even tell her why you want to spend more time with her, which could make her proud of her sense of humor.

, Socializing can help boost your mental health and thus your immunity. While this may seem like it is higher-risk because being around other people (and their germs) exposes you to potential illnesses, the benefit of feeling socially content far outweighs any potential germ exposure.


Spending time with people whom you consider friends is preferable, but talking to coworkers or casual acquaintances also helps., If you have social anxiety or live or work in a situation in which you have limited access to other people, bonding with a special pet can be a reasonably effective substitute for human contact.Be sure you find a pet with a great personality, who interacts with you and makes you laugh for maximum immune-boosting benefits.

Drink plenty of water.,
Avoid simple sugars.,
Eat better quality versions of your junk food.,
Avoid eating highly processed foods.,
Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.,
Increase your garlic consumption.,
Eat protein.",How to Develop a Strong Immune System3," Staying hydrated with plain, clean water is one of the most important boosters to your health and immunity.You should try to drink 8 cups of water each day, but drinking more at the first sign of illness may help you ward off impending sickness.

, Sugar can make you gain weight, feel sluggish due to sugar crashes after consumption, and it can also reduce the efficacy of your immune system.Remember that many people drink more sugar than they realize in beverages. Check nutrition labels on sodas and other drinks carefully for sugar content and serving size to ensure that you know how much sugar you are drinking.
Even foods that do not seem sweet may contain corn syrup or sugar. Read the labels of processed foods carefully to be sure that you know what you are putting in your body.

, The cinnamon rolls in the corner store are not at all as satisfying as those in a bakery. More expensive or higher quality sweets can be so delicious and expensive you don't feel cravings for them anymore or as often.


Consider substitutions you make yourself. Making a jelly sandwich will contain less sugar and fat than store bought pastries and not include other added additives.

, Look for simple products with the least numbers of ingredients and easy to read or explained ingredient names. Those frozen entries and pre-made food go through processes unknown to the average consumer and contain many additional ingredients that can either harm or help your immune system. Gain control of what and how much of what ingredients go into your food by cooking your own and being selective.


Avoid eating bleached flours, cereals and baked goods.There's no real measurable amount of fiber in them and have gluten which turns to dough in one's digestive system causing strain on this critical part of the body's immune system.

, The best way to maintain a comprehensive array of immune-boosting vitamins and minerals is to consume a variety of healthy, fresh vegetables and fruits.


Brightly colored fruits often contain more nutrients than their paler counterparts.For example, kale or spinach is more nutrient-dense than iceberg lettuce.
Your body absorbs nutrients from real food better than from supplements, so it is important to get vitamins from food even if you take a vitamin pill.
Citrus fruits in particular contain vitamin C, which can boost immunity when consumed daily.

, Many sources tout garlic’s antibacterial, antiviral, and even anti-cancer properties. While these claims have not been fully proven by science, there has been research that supports the idea that garlic can help fight disease.


Fresh garlic is usually best. Try using a garlic press or mincing it very small and adding it to foods after cooking the foods.

, Foods that are high in protein are often also high in zinc. Protein can help your body function well and give you energy to get through your day. Absorption of zinc on a regular basis can help super-power your immune system, and the body absorbs zinc from protein sources better than it does from supplements or plant-based zinc."

Consume probiotics.,
Take a multivitamin daily.,
Try herbal supplements.,
Maintain vitamin C levels.",How to Develop a Strong Immune System4," Probiotics are “good bacteria” that help your stomach digest and absorb food effectively.The concept of probiotics is relatively new, and the full effects of this good bacteria on the human body are still somewhat unknown. However, it seems clear that reintroducing the good bacteria of a probiotic can help your body fight off bad bacteria.Be sure to research the effectiveness of a probiotic before choosing one. There is a lot of variance in the quality of different products.Ask your pharmacist or herbalist for a recommendation about a quality probiotic.

, While foods are the best source of vitamins generally, supplementing your diet with a multivitamin can help you ensure that you are not missing one or more important nutrients.


You may want to find a multivitamin that specifically supports your gender, age, and activity level.
Ask your pharmacist or herbalist for a recommendation about a quality multivitamin.

, The effectiveness of herbal supplements has not been fully established by the medical community,but studies have suggested that some or all of the following supplements are effective immune boosters:Echinacea
Ginseng
Astragalus
Certain mushrooms (shiitake, reishi, and maitake)

, Many people think that taking vitamin C when you have a cold can help you fight the cold faster. However, there appears to be a greater health benefit if a level of vitamin C is established and maintained throughout cold season.Eat foods that are high in vitamin C like citrus fruits daily.
Take a vitamin C supplement.
Drink orange juice, but be wary of the high sugar content in juices.

Drink bottled water, not tap.,
Sterilize your tap water.,
Say no to fountain drinks and street vendors.,
Ask for no ice in your drinks.,
Peel your own fruits and veggies.,
Avoid unpasteurized dairy.,
Control flies.",How to Prevent Amebiasis1," If you live in a developing country or are just visiting, be aware of what food and drinks may harbor parasites and germs like E. histolytica. Don’t drink the tap water in areas where amebiasis is prevalent. Instead, drink bottled water that has an unbroken seal., If bottled water isn’t an option, take measures to make your tap water safer to drink. Use one of these methods:Boil your water above 50ºC/122ºF for at least a minute before drinking it, OR,
Filter it through an “absolute 1 micron or less” filter, which you can find at a camping or outdoors supply store, AND,
Dissolve chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or iodine tablets in the filtered water (use them as directed on the label)

, It’s safe to get soda and other beverages from an unopened can or bottle. Do not, however, drink beverages from fountain soda machines or get drinks (or food) from street vendors.Avoid watered down fruit juice., It can be tempting to purchase a bottled water or soda and want ice, but don’t do it. The ice is made from the same potentially-unsanitary water that comes from the tap. Drink straight from the bottle with no ice., Washing fresh fruits and vegetables in contaminated water can contaminate your food. Only eat produce that you can peel, and don’t eat any fresh fruits or vegetables that you did not peel yourself.This ensures that the food didn’t touch unclean water, and that you can remove the outer layer to get to the clean produce within.


You may also want to avoid eating salad, eggs, and ice cream. The components may have been washed or cooked in unsanitary water., Stay away from milk, cheese, and other dairy that may not have been pasteurized. If you’re not sure whether or not it is, try asking someone who lives in the area. If they’re not sure, play it safe and stay away from dairy., Flies can carry the parasites. Protect foods against fly contamination by shielding them with a cover. Store fruits and vegetables in a clean, dry area.

Wash your hands often.,
Use your own towel.,
Clean your toilet regularly.,
Dispose of all human feces in a sanitary manner.",How to Prevent Amebiasis2," Good hygiene is a key way to prevent contacting amebiasis, whether you're at home or traveling. Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the restroom, any time you touch garbage, prior to eating or making food, before smoking, after taking care of someone who is ill, and after you change a baby's diaper.Lather up between your fingers, the backs of your hands, beneath your nails, and as high as your elbows; scrub for at least 20 seconds.
If you can't wash your hands, use hand sanitizer made of at least 60% alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol)., Don’t share towels and linens, if you can help it. It’s best to keep everyone’s bathroom towels separate to avoid spreading illness. Hang your towels away from the toilet so they don’t get contaminated.If linens are soiled, put on gloves before cleaning them. Wash them in a separate wash at the highest temperature possible.

, Make disinfecting your toilet a part of your house-cleaning routine. Use hot water and detergent or a disinfecting spray or wipes made for cleaning bathrooms. Wipe down the seat, handle, and basin of the toilet.Use disposable wipes or have a separate towel that you use to clean the toilet.
Wipe down bathroom door handles, countertops, and bathroom taps every day.

, If you have a garden near a septic tank, ensure that the tank is fully contained, not leaking, and is regularly emptied by trained personnel. If you're camping, keep all human waste activities well away from cooking and sleeping areas."

Recognize stomach symptoms as possible signs of amebiasis.,
See your doctor if you think you have amebiasis.,
Take your antibiotics correctly.",How to Prevent Amebiasis3," If you’re experiencing diarrhea (which can be bloody), stomach cramping and pain, and a fever, think about what environment you were in recently. Symptoms of amebiasis usually show up between 2-4 weeks after you get the infection. If you were in a place where you may have picked up E. histolytica within the past month, you may have amebiasis.Only 10-20% of people who get amebiasis even get symptoms, and the symptoms are usually mild.

, Amebiasis may not cause symptoms or symptoms can be very mild, but you should still see your doctor if you have symptoms of the illness. You will have to submit a stool (poop) sample to be tested for the parasite. Your doctor will help you decide if you need treatment, and will monitor the illness until you’re better.Amebiasis rarely spreads to other parts of the body to cause problems, such as the liver, lungs, or brain, but if it spreads it can be serious – so it’s important to get treated even if you only have mild symptoms. It may be in your liver if you have a fever, pain in your right upper abdomen, and the whites of your eyes turn yellowish., If you do have amebiasis from E. histolytica, your doctor can prescribe you antibiotics to treat the infection. You will probably only take one antibiotic if the infection has not made you sick, and two different antibiotics if it has made you sick.Take your medicine for as long as your doctor says, and exactly the way your doctor says."

Practice good oral hygiene.,
Avoid swallowing or inhaling foreign objects.,
Monitor facial and abdominal infections.,
Remove your intrauterine device (IUD) when recommended.",How to Prevent Actinomycosis1," Oral cervicofacial actinomycosis is the most common form of actinomycosis, constituting 50-70 percent of all cases.It is usually the result of poor dental hygiene, so it is important that you maintain your tooth and gum health. This will help prevent the development of any infections in your mouth due to gum disease and tooth decay, as well as limit the chances of infection if you are injured or have oral surgery.Brush your teeth twice a day.
Floss daily.
Regularly replace your toothbrush.
Visit your dentist on a regular basis. It is recommended that you visit your dentist twice a year for regular checkups.
Other predisposing factors include dental caries and extractions, gingivitis and gingival trauma, infection during teething, diabetes, malnutrition, immunosuppression, and neoplasia or radiation. Treating the underlying condition (i.e. Diabetes) may help in the treatment of actinomyces infection.;
, Certain cases of thoracic and abdominal actinomycosis are caused by the ingestion or inhalation of foreign objects. Infections of the chest and lungs are typically caused by breathing infected fluid, generally saliva, into the lungs. In the abdomen, it is usually the result of having swallowed a foreign object (animal bone, coin, or other small item) that then causes a wound or infection in the intestines. In order to avoid getting actinomycosis in this way, try not to inhale the bodily fluids or other people or swallow anything your body will not be able to digest.If you have a long-term drug and alcohol problem, you are at higher risk of the infection because intoxication makes it easier to ingestion or inhale foreign objects. Plus, drug and alcohol abuse weakens your immune system., If you have appendicitis and your appendix bursts, abdominal actinomycosis can often develop if the intestines are damaged by the infected bile or during surgery. Actinomycosis can also develop in the head and neck as the result of an ear infection or tonsillitis. Be sure to visit a doctor if you develop any of these infections and follow their recommendations. This will help you avoid developing a secondary infection of actinomycosis., Pelvic actinomycosis is the rarest manifestation of the infection, accounting for only 10 percent of all cases. It usually only occurs when an IUD is left in the uterine wall longer than the manufacturer recommends. In order to avoid this infection, follow your doctor’s instructions about properly maintaining your IUD and, if an infection develops, have the IUD removed.Some IUDs can only stay uterus for only a few years. Others can stay attached for almost a decade. Check with your health care provider to make sure you know when to have your IUD removed."

Look out for common symptoms:



Headaches of unusually long duration.,
See a physician as soon as possible if you notice these symptoms.,
Note that TBI symptoms vary between children and adults.",How to Recognize TBI Symptoms (Traumatic Brain Injury),", TBI symptoms may be hard to recognize and can take some time to show up. When the brain is bruised the bruise will keep spreading, thereby worsening symptoms before it starts to heal.


Someone with TBI may look OK, but not act or feel right.
Symptoms often vary between children and adults. See below for guidance regarding symptoms particular to children.

,
Persistent head pain in a specific area of the head. (Not headache)
Persistent neck pain. Sometimes whiplash accompanies brain injury.
Memory impairment / amnesia.
Disorientation, being lost, forgetting where you are, forgetting how to get home.
Issues with decision making or concentrating.
Lessening of inhibition, saying inappropriate things in inappropriate places.
Forgetting where you are and how to get home.
Forgetting how to do simple tasks such as tying shoes or buttoning buttons.

Ringing in the ears.
Dizziness.
Balance problems.
Decreased coordination.
Confusion.
Difficulty knowing directions i.e. up, down, left, right and getting your body to move in the direction you want.
Aphasia or Dysphasia; language disorders that impair language comprehension and expression. It often doesn't affect ""thinking"" and ""intelligence"", only language.
Slurred speech.
Fatigue, lack of motivation, reduced energy.
Light/noise sensitivity, sometimes to the point of triggering seizure.
Disruption of normal sleep schedule (more or less sleep than usual) and trouble falling asleep.

Nausea/vomiting.
Vision problems (blurring, double vision, eye fatigue)

, A doctor is needed to confirm the diagnosis and recommend the correct treatment. If TBI is diagnosed you may need to see a very good specialist.









, Very small children also may lack the ability to explain what they are experiencing. Take your child to the doctor if you see any of the above symptoms or the following after any blow to the head.


Child is inconsolable/continues to cry

Observe the symptoms of oral cervicofacial actinomycosis.,
Note the symptoms of thoracic actinomycosis.,
Recognize the symptoms of abdominal actinomycosis.,
Look for the symptoms of pelvic actinomycosis.",How to Prevent Actinomycosis2," If you have actinomycosis in your face and neck, you will develop reddish or bluish colored lumps, which may initially be painful but later become painless. You may also run a high fever (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius). You may also have small passages, known as sinus tracts, that open up on the surface of your skin that leak pus and contain a crusty yellow discharge.The development of facial lumps is where the disease gets its colloquial name of “lump jaw.”Facial lumps include symptoms due to abscess formation, drainage of sinus tracts, fistula formation, and fibrosis.
Do not confuse the sinus tracts that develop as a result of actinomycosis with the sinus cavities in your face and nose.

, Actinomycosis of the lungs and chest cavity will cause you to run a high fever (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius), experience some chest pain and feel fatigued. The infection will also likely cause a decrease in appetite and, subsequently, result in weight loss. You may also develop a dry cough and experience some shortness of breath.You may also develop sinus tracts on your chest.
If you develop a cough, you may produce phlegm or even blood.

, Actinomycosis of the abdomen will result in a mild fever (less than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius), fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. You will also likely experience digestive issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. These are nonspecific symptoms that may also be present in diseases such as malignancy, crohn's disease, and tuberculosis. Your doctor must have a high degree of suspicion has to make a diagnosis. You may also develop noticeable lumps and sinus tracts on your abdomen., Actinomycosis of the pelvis will result in a mild fever (less than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius), fatigue and a loss of appetite. You will also likely experience some lower abdominal pain and irregular or abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge. You will also notice the development of lumps and sinus tracts in your pelvic area.Approximately 7% of women with IUDs have actinomyces present on their Pap Smear."
"
Visit your doctor.,
Take antibiotics.,
Undergo surgery.,
Remove your IUD.",How to Prevent Actinomycosis3," If you notice any of the symptoms of actinomycosis, be sure to visit your doctor immediately. Your doctor will likely need to diagnose the infection by analyzing some infected discharge or taking an x-ray. Visiting your doctor in the infection’s early stages will prevent the illness from worsening and help you get on the road to recovery., After consulting with your doctor, they will likely recommend a long-term course of antibiotics, which is usually needed to fully treat actinomycosis. The common antibiotics used to treat the infection are penicillins (benzylpenicillin injections and phenoxymethylpenicillin tablets). You will take an initial course of antibiotic injections that last 2 to 6 weeks, followed by a course of oral antibiotics that take 6 to 12 months. After taking your course of antibiotics, your body should be free of actinomycosis.Diarrhea, nausea, rash and a vulnerability to fungal infections are all side effects of taking penicillins.
If you are allergic to penicillin, your doctor may also suggest alternative antibiotics, such as tetracycline or erythromycin
You will likely be instructed by your doctor or a nurse on how to give yourself the antibiotic injections.

, If the infection severely damaged any tissues, you may need to have surgery to repair it. For example, you may need to have damaged sections of your intestines removed and surgically closed. You may also need to have the pus removed from the abscesses that developed in your body. This will prevent them from rupturing and spread the infection further.If you develop you develop pelvic lumps, be sure to see your doctor immediately. The infection can become severe and possibly result in a hysterectomy., If the infection is the result of an IUD, your doctor will remove the device. This will eliminate the source of the infection and make it easier for the antibiotic regimen to clear up the infection.Because of the likelihood of a future infection, you may want to consider alternative contraceptive devices if you experienced an actinomycosis a result of your IUD.Keep in mind that there is no evidence for the efficacy of antibiotics in colonized women with IUDs if they are asymptomatic.

Check for memory loss.,
Look for trouble doing tasks they used to do easily.Dementia sufferers may forget to serve the meal they just cooked or forget they cooked it in the first place.,
Take note of problems in using language.It's normal for people to fumble for the right word.,
Note signs of confusion.People with dementia often suffer from confusion about spatial, time, and temporal contexts.,
Do not ignore misplaced items.,
Observe problems with abstract thinking and reasoning.,
Watch for changes in mood or personality.While people may get moody from time to time, dementia sufferers may have sharp, rapid mood swings.,
Check for signs of passivity.,
Compare the current behavior to what you know of the person.,
Familiarize yourself with some types of dementia.,
Take the person to a doctor.,
Provide the patient's medical history.,
Inform the doctor about all medications being taken.Certain combinations of drugs may mimic or add to the symptoms of dementia.,
Be prepared for a full physical examination.,
Allow the doctor to evaluate cognitive abilities.,
Submit to a neurological evaluation.This evaluation will cover balance, reflexes, sensory and other functions in the patient.,
Understand whether or not the dementia is reversible.The dementia that arises from certain causes can sometimes be treated and reversed with medical care.",How to Recognize Signs of Senile Dementia," Everyone forgets things from time to time. However, dementia sufferers may have difficulty remembering recent events or familiar routes and names.Everyone’s memory is different, and occasional forgetfulness is common among the general population. Family members and close friends typically will be the best judges of changes in behavior from what he or she was like previously.

However, be aware that denial happens. Family members sometimes try to avoid the painful truth that Grandpa is having great issues by normalizing what is not normal, or overlook what should not be overlooked.
Sometimes family members get hyper-sensitive over memory loss issues. Family members sometimes over-react to mild memory issues. For example, if Nana is not taking her pills on time, it may be she needs help from a pharmacist or nurse to organize her medications--she may not need to be in a nursing home.


Understand normal memory loss versus abnormal loss. As a person ages, it is not uncommon to have some problems with memory. An older individual often has a lot that he or she has experienced, and the brain may not work quite as efficiently as it did in younger years. However, when memory loss starts to impact daily life, that is when intervention needs to happen. Th early signs are different for different people. But common signs include:

Inability to care for self: not eating, eating too much, not bathing, dressing inappropriately, not leaving the house, ""wandering"" behavior.
Inability to maintain household chores: Dishes are chronically dirty, garbage not taken out, cooking ""accidents"", filthy house, wearing dirty clothes.
Other ""odd"" behavior: Calling loved ones at 3 a.m. and hanging up, odd behavior reported by others, emotional outbursts when nothing outward seems wrong.
There is a big difference between forgetting when a daughter graduated high school, and forgetting the name of the daughter.
Also, there is a significant difference between trying to remember what countries Spain borders, than that Spain is a country.


If memory loss reaches a point where it interferes with day-to-day activities, take the individual to see his or her doctor for more evaluation.;
, People with dementia may have difficulty with other daily tasks such as putting on clothing. Generally, look for obvious declines in daily hygiene and dressing habits. If you notice the individual is having increasing difficulty with these common daily tasks, consider seeing your doctor for further evaluation.

, But, dementia sufferers often get flustered when they can't find the right word. This may cause them to blow up at the person they're talking to, which can be frustrating to both parties.


Changes in language usually begin with difficulty remembering words, sayings, and expressions.
It will progress to a decline in ability to understand other people's language.
Eventually, the person may be unable to communicate verbally at all. At this stage, people communicate only by facial expression or gesture.

, This is more than simple memory loss or ""senior moments"" — spatial, time, and temporal confusion show an inability to understand where the person is in the moment.


Spatial confusion may cause dementia sufferers to forget directions, thinking north is south and east is west. Or that the way they just came is a different route. They may wander off, then forget how they got to a place and how to return to where they belong.
Time disorientation is marked by the performance of behaviors at inappropriate times. This might be subtle, like slight changes in eating or sleeping schedules. But it can also be more significant: an individual might eat breakfast in the middle of the night and then get ready for bed in the middle of the day.
Place disorientation may cause confusion about where sufferers are, causing them behave inappropriately. A person may think the public library is their living room and be angry about people invading their home.
They may find it hard to perform common tasks outside of their home due to spatial disorientation. This can be very dangerous, as the individual cannot navigate environments beyond the home., It is common to misplace the car keys in one's pants pockets, for instance. Sufferers of dementia often place objects in locations that do not make sense.


For example, they may put a purse in the freezer. Or the checkbook ends up in the bathroom medicine cabinet.

Be aware that a person with senile dementia may defend or deflect from this line of logical reasoning, arguing why it makes sense. Be very careful not to try to get into an argument at this point, as you will be unlikely to convince him or her, and agitate the person. He or she is in denial, and is trying to defend from the truth because it is terrifying. It is safer to focus on you as a target than face the truth.

, While a normal person may make occasional mistakes in keeping a checkbook, someone suffering from dementia may forget the concept of numbers. They may also fail to recognize that a whistling teakettle means that water is boiling on the stove and let the water evaporate away.

, They can go from giddily happy to blazing mad in minutes, or they may become generally irritable or paranoid. Dementia sufferers are often quite aware that they're having problems with common tasks, and this can be frustrating. This sometimes results in outbursts of irritability, paranoia, or the like.


Again, avoid upsetting the individual even further by getting angry, as this is counterproductive to both people.

, The person may no longer want to go to places they used to go, take part in activities they used to enjoy, or see the people they used to see. As day-to-day activities become more difficult, many individuals may become more and more withdrawn. Instead, they may settle into depression, unmotivated to do anything inside or outside of the home.


Notice if the person spends hours sitting in a chair and staring into space or watching television.
Look for declining activity, poor hygiene, and problems with common day-to-day activities.

, Dementia requires a ""constellation"" of erratic and noticeably declining behaviors. No one indicator is enough for a diagnosis. Just forgetting things doesn't necessarily mean someone has dementia. Look for a combination of all the symptoms listed above. The better you know the individual, the easier it will be to notice changes in their usual behavior.

, Dementia is a widely varying condition, and it will look different from patient to patient. In large part, you will be able to predict how the patient will progress by taking the cause of the dementia into consideration.


Alzheimer’s disease - dementia progresses gradually, usually over the course of years. The exact cause is unknown, but plaques and structures called neurofibrillary tangles have been found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.Lewy body dementia: protein deposits, called Lewy bodies, develop in nerve cells the brain and cause a decline in thinking, memory, and motor control abilities. Hallucinations may also occur, and lead unusual behavior like talking to someone who isn’t there. Multi-infarct dementia: dementia occurs when a patient suffers many strokes that block a brain artery.People suffering from this type of dementia may have symptoms that stay the same for awhile and then get worse as they have additional strokes. Frontotemporal dementia: portions of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain shrink causing personality changes or the ability to use language. This type of dementia tends to occur between the ages of 40 and 75.Normal Pressure hydrocephalus: a buildup of fluid puts pressure on the brain, causing dementia that comes gradually or abruptly, depending on how fast the pressure increases.A CT or MRI will show evidence of this type of dementia.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: this is a rare and fatal brain disorder believed to be caused by an unusual organism called a ""prion."" Though it may be present for a long time before symptoms emerge, the condition comes on very suddenly. A biopsy of the brain will reveal prion proteins believed to be cause of the condition., If you think you see a ""constellation"" of behavioral changes and symptoms, you need expert evaluation. In some cases, a primary care physician will be able to diagnose dementia. More often, the patient needs to be referred to a specialist, such as a neurologist or gerontologist.

, This should include a detailed record of how and when symptoms developed. Based on this review, a doctor may order tests like a blood count or tests for levels of blood glucose or thyroid hormone. These tests will be specific to the type of dementia that your doctor is testing for.

, Sometimes, the mixing of unrelated drugs used to treat different diseases causes dementia-like symptoms. This type of drug mixing is common with older people, so make sure you have an accurate medication listing.


Some classes of common medications that can cause issues are: benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, neuroleptics, and diphenhydramine (among others).

, A physical exam might identify a disorder that overlap with or contributes to dementia.It may rule out dementia entirely, too. Examples of related conditions include heart disease, stroke, nutritional deficiency, or kidney failure. Variations in each of these factors may give a clue to the type of dementia that needs to be treated.The doctor may also conduct a psychiatric evaluation to rule out depression as an underlying cause of a patient's symptoms., This might include tests for memory, math, and language skills, including the ability to write, draw, name objects, and follow directions. These tests assess both cognition and motor skills.

, This is done to rule out other disorders and identify treatable symptoms. The doctor may also order a brain scan to identify underlying causes like strokes or tumors. The main forms of imaging used are MRIs and CT scans., Others, however, are progressive and irreversible. It's important to know which category the patient falls into, so you can plan for the future.


Potentially reversible causes of dementia include hypothyroidism; neurosyphilis; Vitamin B12/folate deficiency/thiamine deficiency; depression; and subdural hematoma.
Irreversible causes of dementia include Alzheimer’s disease,multi-infarct dementia, and HIV dementia.

A first-degree burn is painful, and will leave a deep red color on the top layer of skin (epidermis). But despite the stinging redness, there is no blistering in a first-degree burn. The skin will remain dry and intact.First-degree burns are quite common, and very rarely require professional medical treatment.
Healing occurs in three to five days.;
, But the skin damage will go beyond the top layer (epidermis) down into the top of the second layer (dermis). And unlike a first-degree burn, you will see blistering in a second-degree burn. Pain and bleeding are both good signs, as they suggest that there is no significant damage to nerves or blood vessels.


Superficial second-degree burns usually heal without scarring within two weeks, and do not require medical attention., A superficial second-degree burn can heal on its own, but a deep second-degree burn needs to be seen by a doctor. Look for spots of pale skin interspersed between the blisters. The blisters will bleed easily and may ooze a straw-colored material. If left untreated, deep second-degree burns can become third degree burns within a few days.Always seek treatment for a second degree burn if:


You are not sure what level of burn you have
Have diabetes or a compromised immune system
Were injured by a chemical burn, especially alkaline burns like from Drano.

, A first degree burn can always heal on its own at home, but large second-degree burns should be seen by a doctor. Whether superficial or deep, a second-degree burn that affects more than 10-15% of your skin needs medical attention. The doctor will both assess the burn and treat possible dehydration. You lose a lot of fluid through your damaged skin when you have large burns. Tell the doctor if you feel thirsty, weak, dizzy, or are having trouble urinating. If he suspects dehydration, your doctor may give you IV fluids., Untreated third degree burns can become septic and cause death. They are distinguished from a second-degree burn by the presence of nerve, vein, and muscle damage.


Because of the nerve damage, the burn site will feel numb rather than painful, though the edges may still hurt.
Skin will both look and feel dry and thick/leathery. You will likely experience swelling.
Rather than redness, you may see white, yellow, brown, purple, or even black skin.
You may feel thirsty, dizzy, or weak. Dehydration may cause trouble urinating.

, However, you should consider seeing a doctor if the burn doesn’t heal within several weeks, or if new, unexplained symptoms emerge. Any increase in pain, swelling, redness, or discharge that becomes unmanageable should be examined as well. Seek immediate emergency attention if you experience the following:


Burns to the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or major joints
Chemical or electrical burns
Third-degree burns
Trouble breathing or burns to the airway

, Ocular chemical burns can be very serious, so you need to take immediate action. If a chemical gets into your eyes, flush your eyes with water for at least five full minutes. You should always see a doctor for examination after a potential chemical burn to the eyes. He may add a 1% calcium gluconate solution to your eye-flushing routine. The doctor can also prescribe anesthetic eye drops to control your pain.


If you wear contacts, remove them carefully when flushing out your eyes.

, Chemicals powerful enough to burn the skin can continue to work their way into deeper layers if left untreated. Thus, all chemical burns require medical attention. However, while waiting to see the doctor, the best thing you can do is hold the burn under cool (not cold) running water or soak it in a water bath.

, The first order of business in a first or superficial second-degree thermal burn is to lower the skin temperature at the burn site. Place the burned skin in cool (not cold) water for 10 minutes. If you don't want to waste running water, fill a sink or bathtub to submerge the skin. Either refill with cold water as the water warms up, or use ice cubes to keep the water temperature low.


Just make sure that all the burned skin is either submerged in or under the flow of running cold water.

, Note that many experts advise against applying ice to a burn, as the dramatic temperature change can cause frostbite.Always cool the skin in water for at least 20 minutes if you want to apply ice to it. Simply seal the ice into a Ziploc bag with some water and wrap a rag or paper towel around it to create a barrier between you skin and the extreme cold. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables out of your freezer if you don't have ice. Apply the ice for about ten minutes, rotating it around the burn site if it gets too cold.


Always make sure to use a cloth or paper towel barrier.

, Ointments seal the burn, and may actually prevent healing if you apply them too soon. For first-degree burns, wait 24 hours before you apply any burn care or other ointments.If you are not near a medical facility and you have a second-degree burn, apply bacitracin ointment (an antibiotic) to the burn to prevent infection as you get to treatment. This is the only situation in which you should apply bacitracin to burned skin.

, The pharmacy may have any of a variety of benzocaine brands such as Anacaine, Chiggerex, Mandelay, Medicone, Outgro, or Solarcaine. Furthermore, these products are available in a wide variety of applications: cream, spray, liquid, gel, ointment, or wax. Read the instructions on the package to learn the correct application method and dosage.


Make sure not to overuse benzocaine, as it soaks into the skin more easily than some other local anesthetics.

, You can relieve some of the pain from a minor burn by taking an over-the-counter pain reliever. An oral NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) such as ibuprofen or naproxen will help relieve pain and inflammation from the burn.Follow all dosing instructions on the packaging. Take the smallest dose that is effective at relieving your pain.

, If cold water doesn't make the pain diminish, shaving cream is a surprisingly effective solution! Shaving creams like Barbasol contain a chemical called triethanolamine. Triethanolamine is an active ingredient in Biatine, a prescription cream used to treat even severe burns in hospital settings.Just spread it over the affected skin and leave it alone until the pain goes down.


Avoid mentholated shaving creams, as they may cause further irritation.This should only be considered when you have a first-degree burn. Do not attempt this method with a burn that is any more severe than a sunburn.

, While you may prefer the idea of home or natural remedies, many of these methods are untested, relying on anecdotal and not scientific evidence. Without medical backing, these methods can be risky and are likely not recommended by your doctor. If you wish to use a natural remedy, talk to your doctor first.


If you choose to utilize these methods, you must still cool and clean the burn first. You should also seek immediate medical attention for anything more severe than a first-degree or superficial second-degree burn.

, The chemicals in the aloe plant's leaves do more than just minimize pain and inflammation. They actually encourage faster healing and the growth of fresh, healthy skin. Treat the burn with aloe lotion several times a day, as necessary.


Never apply aloe products to an open wound.
You can use pure aloe from an aloe plant. Alternatively, look for 100% pure aloe vera gel at the store.

, However, lotions with St. John's wort may be a little harder to find than aloe lotions. You can find them easily online, though, or in many health food stores.


Do not apply St. John's wort essential oil to burns, though, as it can prevent the skin from cooling.

, If you have a large burn area — from sunburn, for example — you might add a few drops of the oil to your bath and soak in it. Smaller areas may benefit from more focused treatment.


Make sure to cool the burned skin with cold water for at least ten minutes.
Soak a clean gauze or rag in ice-cold water.
To this gauze/rag, add one drop of essential oil for every square inch of burned skin.
Apply the rag to the burned area.

, Honey has antibacterial properties that promote faster healing in a wide variety of injuries.Instead of running for your pantry, though, look for medicinal grade honey for best results. It's not usually available in regular grocery stores, so look for health food stores or providers of ayurvedic medicine. You can also find medicinal grade honey easily online.


Do not apply honey to broken skin, or burns that are worse than first-degree burns.
The only exception is if you are far away from a medical care facility. If you cannot get to treatment quickly, use an antibiotic ointment or honey on the burn to help prevent infection as you wait to get treatment., Simply steep one teaspoon of calendula flowers in a cup of boiling water for 15 minutes. Once it's been strained and cooled, you can either soak the burned area in it or apply a cloth soaked in the tea to the skin. If you have calendula oil instead of leaves, dilute 1/2 to one teaspoon in 1/4 cup of water. You may be able to find calendula creams in naturopathic stores or practices. Apply calendula four times daily until the burn has healed.


Studies also suggest that green tea can be helpful for treating burns., Though the smell is unpleasant and it might make your eyes water, onions have been shown to sooth burns.Simply cut up some onion and gently rub it against the burn, working the juice into the wound without causing pain. Do this several times a day until the wound heals, making sure to use fresh onions every time.

, When you're not using these treatments, you must protect the damaged skin from infection. Pat the burned area dry, then cover it with clean gauze. Tape or wrap it into place, then change the dressing daily until the skin appears normal. Check for signs of infection every day: fever, increased redness, and pus.If you see such symptoms, notify your doctor immediately.

Remove the patient from the area of exposure.,
Take off any clothing or jewelry around the burn.,
Wash the burn thoroughly.,
Apply a clean, sterile dressing.,
Administer an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Get a tetanus shot.",How to Treat a Chemical Burn1," If the chemicals still pose a danger to the burn victim, then make sure that you remove him or her from the area of exposure. For example, if the chemicals are giving off fumes or if the victim is in danger of getting splashed with more of the chemical, then remove the victim to another room or go outside.


Always take precautions to protect yourself when tending to someone who has received a chemical burn. For example, you may need to wear long sleeves, gloves, a mask, goggles, or other protective gear to prevent yourself from receiving a similar injury.
If there are any dry chemicals left on the victim's skin, then brush these chemicals off before irrigating the area.;
, If the victim has clothing, jewelry or other items on that are contaminated with chemicals and/or obstructing your access to the burn, then make sure that you remove these items before you being treatment.Leaving these items on may cause further damage. You will also need to be able to access the burn site to brush off any leftover dry chemicals and irrigate the area with water.

, If you receive a burn from a chemical, you should first dilute the chemical compound. This is the best thing you can do to treat a chemical burn right away.To do this, flush the burn and the surrounding areas of skin with copious amounts of water. The water should be cool. Let the water run over the burn for 10 minutes or more.Don't use a high pressure stream of water to wash the skin. Too much water pressure can make the chemical burn worse by driving the chemical deeper into the skin. Just use light irrigation by holding the wound under a gentle stream of water and keep it there for a long time.
Some chemical burns should not be treated with immediate irrigation. These include dry lime, elemental metals, and phenol. This is because combining these chemicals with water causes a harmful exothermic (heat-producing) reaction and/or releases hazardous byproducts

, After the wound is clean, you may want to cover it with a clean sterile dressing, such as a piece of gauze. This will help to protect the wound.If the wound is painful, then applying a cold compress can also help. Wet a clean washcloth with cool water and then place it over the wound to help cool and soothe it.

, To alleviate some of the pain, it can help to take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.However, if the pain is severe, then you may need a prescription strength pain reliever.


Seek medical attention right away if your burn is causing severe pain.

, A tetanus shot or booster is often recommended for burn victims. If the victim’s tetanus shot is not up to date, then he or she will need to have a booster. Tetanus shots are usually administered once every 10 years."

Seek medical attention for severe burns.,
Call the poison control center.,
Get treated for an advanced burn.,
Seek emergency treatment for eye chemical burns.,
Check on yourself.",How to Treat a Chemical Burn2," If you have a chemical burn, then you should seek immediate medical attention. Call emergency services or 911 if the burn victim has any of the following serious symptoms:pale complexion
fainting
shallow breathing
a burn that covers a large area of skin, such as 3 inches (8cm) in diameter or more
a burn that is around the feet, face, eyes, hands, groin, buttocks, or a major joint

, You can also call the poison control center in your area if you do not think the burn is severe. If you know what the compound was that burned you, have that information ready. The operator can provide treatment advice that is specific to the chemical that burned you. If you don't know what chemical burned you, you should still call poison control. The operators can ask questions to determine with a reasonable certainty what the chemical might be.


If your burn is serious and you are taken to a hospital before you can call the poison control center, you should make sure that you have someone at the hospital call so you can find out how to proceed. The doctor will know the basics of how to treat your burn, but the poison control center can give you a more specific idea.
This information is invaluable as some compounds may need to be left open to air while others require an occlusive dressing., Once you arrive at the hospital, you will receive various treatments, depending on the severity of the burn. If there are any large blisters or any areas that required scrubbing, you will receive some medicine for pain and then they would clean the burn. If there are large blisters, they will perform a controlled rupture to relieve pressure. Any smaller blisters will be left alone.


Your wound will then be covered with Silvadene cream using a tongue blade. They will then cover the wound with a 4 x 4 gauze pad, which will be applied over your wound to protect the site or the burn. Another rolled gauze will be wrapped around the wound site., Chemical burns in the eye, also known as ocular chemical burns, are extremely serious and you should call 911 right away. You should also get to the nearest eye wash station as soon as possible and begin washing them out with copious amounts of water for dilution purposes. It will also help prevent irreversible scarring of the cornea and conjunctiva, which can cause possible blindness.


Eye chemical burns from acids or alkalis require emergency care and treatment. Otherwise, you risk permanent vision loss.
For an ocular burn, you may be sent to an ophthalmologist so they can do a visual acuity test, which is where she will assess the damage to your eyes.
Some studies indicated good results with copious irrigation with acidic ocular burns. The use of steroid eye drops, vitamin C eye drops, and antibiotic eye drops were used to help treat the eyes., You should continue to follow the care instructions given to you by the burn center in order to prevent infections or complications. However, they can happen, which means there are things you should look for after you suffer a burn. Watch daily for signs of infection, such as expanding redness, pus, fever, or green drainage. If any of these are present, you must seek emergency medical treatment immediately.


Follow up with your primary care provider or a toxicologist if necessary. Some toxic agents can be absorbed through the skin and can cause systemic toxicity. Inhaled vapors can cause both systemic toxicity and lung problems, such as asthma. Some inhaled substances can even be fatal.If you are a diabetic, are on steroids or chemotherapy, or have a weakened immune system for any reason, you are at risk for infection and ought to be especially careful for signs of infection.
You should recheck your wound daily as well as wash and change the dressing. Your skin should start to peel and regrow new skin within 10-14 days, depending on the kind of burn."

Consider the different types of chemical burns.,
Recognize second degree burns.,
Learn about third degree burns.",How to Treat a Chemical Burn3," There are two different types of chemical burns. Some chemical burns are primarily alkali in nature, such as those coming from fertilizer solutions, drain and pipe cleaners, ammonia, and batteries. These are particularly hazardous.


Despite the reputation of acids, acidic burns, such as those caused by hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, are less toxic., There are two types of second degree burns. The first is superficial, which is characterized by redness and damage of the entire portion of the upper layer of skin as well as partial damage to the second layer the skin. The burn will blister and you will be in pain, which is a good sign. The superficial burn will be very red and may bleed. These will likely heal without any scar within two weeks.

You may also experience a deep second degree burn. With this burn, you destroy even more of the under layer of dermis. It will no longer be red but will appear white, which shows that there has been damage to your blood vessels that is impairing circulation. It will not hurt because the nerves are also damaged so you cannot feel pain. There may or may not be blisters. Healing will occur but it will take longer than 2 weeks and will likely scar.
If you have a deep second degree chemical burn over a joint, the scar could affect your ability to move the extremity it is connected to., Third degree burns are the worst and cause the most lasting damage. Burns this deep effect the upper and lower skin layers, just like the other burns, but extend down through to the subcutaneous tissue. Damage to this layer of tissue causes it to look like leather. This burn requires surgical management for healing.

You will likely undergo a debridement or have skin grafts."
"
Stay out of the sun.,
Leave the affected area alone.,
Use aloe vera.,
Try other emollients.,
Request a prescription for 1% silver sulfadiazine cream.,
Avoid topical anesthetic creams and sprays.,
Drink water.,
Maintain good nutrition to promote healing.",How to Treat a Blistered Sunburn1," You don’t want to damage your already tender skin any further. If you must expose yourself to the sun, wear sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 30 or more and cover your skin. UV rays can still pass through clothes to a certain degree.Continue to wear sunscreen after teh blisters have healed.
Don’t be fooled by cloudy or cold weather. UV rays are still strong during cloudy weather, and snow can reflect 80% of the sun’s rays. If the sun is up, the UV is there.;
, Do not pop your blisters. They may pop on their own, but you want to protect your blisters as much as possible in order to prevent infection and damage to the lower, more delicate layers of skin. If the blister pops on its own, cover it in gauze to prevent infection. If you think your skin may already be infected, go to a dermatologist immediately. Some signs that your skin may be infected include redness, swelling, pain, and heat.Similarly, do not peel the skin. Scaling may occur on the sunburned area, but do not peel it. Remember, this area is very sensitive and susceptible to infection and further damage. Leave it alone.

, Aloe vera can be an effective natural cure for minor burns such as the blistered sunburn. Aloe vera gel are the best choice since they will cool the burn. Aloe is believed to decrease pain, rehydrate the affected skin, and aid in the healing process. Indeed, research has shown that aloe vera helps to heal burns faster (9 days faster) than without any use of aloe vera.The best products are the most natural products without any additional additives. Aloe vera gel with no preservatives can be purchased at most drugstores. If you have aloe vera plant on hand, you can apply the aloe vera inside the plant directly by breaking a leaf in half. Allow the gel to be absorbed by the skin. Repeat the process as often as possible.
Try using aloe ice cubes. They can help soothe the pain as well as treat the skin.
Aloe vera should never be applied to an open wound.

, Emollients like moisturizers are safe to apply on your blisters. They can make peeling and flaking less noticeable and help sooth the skin. Avoid using thicker moisturizers or petroleum jelly, as they will not let your skin “breathe” or release heat.Good options include soy-based moisturizers. Look for organic and natural ingredients on the label. Soy is a plant that has natural moisturizing capabilities, which helps your damaged skin maintain moisture and heal.Again, do not apply anything to open wounds or blistered that have popped.
You can place a gauze bandage over the blisters until they heal if you wish.

, Ask your doctor if he will prescribe you a 1% silver sulfadiazine, which is a strong bacteria-killing chemical that is used to treat second- and third-degree burns. Generally, this cream is applied topically twice a day. Do not stop using it until your doctor tells you to stop.This cream can have severe side effects, though they are rare. Side effects can include pain, itching, or burning of the treated skin. The skin and mucous membranes (like the gums) can also become blur or gray in color. Ask your doctor about potential side effects, and stop use immediately and call your doctor if they arise., This is because anesthetic products applied to the skin can cause infection.


In particular, avoid lotions or creams that contain benzocaine or lidocaine. While once commonly used in the past, these products can cause irritation and allergic reactions.Avoid using petroleum jelly (also known by the brand Vaseline). Petroleum can clog pores and trap heat within the skin, preventing proper healing of your skin., Sunburns draw fluid to the surface of the skin and away from other parts of the body. Make an effort to drink plenty of water (at least eight glasses (8 oz each) a day). You could also drink fruit juices or sports drinks. Be sure to watch for signs of dehydration, including dry mouth, thirst, decreased urination, headache, and lightheadedness., Burns such as a blistered sunburn can be treated and healed faster with the help of good nutrition, especially with an increased intake of protein-rich foods. The additional protein serves as building blocks for healing tissue, and are needed to heal the skin and inflammation and minimize the scarring.


Protein rich foods such as chicken, turkey, fish, dairy products, and eggs are excellent sources of protein.
The ideal daily protein intake is 0.8-1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight.

Use apple cider vinegar.,
Make a turmeric powder paste.,
Consider using tomato.,
Use potatoes to cool burned skin.,
Try applying a milk compress.",How to Treat a Blistered Sunburn2," Apple cider vinegar may help in treating blistered sunburns by absorbing the heat from the skin and relieving the burning sensation and the pain. The acetic acid and malic acid in vinegar can neutralize sunburns and re-establish pH levels in the affected area. This prevents infection by making the skin environment inhospitable to microorganisms.To apply apple cider vinegar, mix the vinegar with cold water and soak a soft cloth into the solution and apply or drape it on the affected skin. Vinegar can also be directly sprayed onto the sunburn skin.
The use of vinegar is only recommended for skin without abrasions, open cuts or ruptures because it can burn and irritate the skin.

, Turmeric contains antiseptic and antibacterial properties that may help ease the pain and inflammation caused by the sunburn and blistering. Here are some tips to apply turmeric powder:Combine turmeric powder with water or milk to make a paste. Then, apply it on your blisters for 10 minutes before rinsing it off gently.
Mix turmeric powder, barley, and yogurt to produce a thick paste and cover the affected skin. Let it sit for about half an hour, and then wash it off with cold water.

, Tomato juice can lessen the burning sensation, reduce the redness of the affected area, and improve the healing of the sunburn.


To apply, combine 1/4 cup of tomato paste or juice to 1/2 cup of buttermilk. Apply the mixture on your burned skin for about half an hour and wash it gently with cold water.
Alternatively, add two cups of tomato juice to your bathwater and bathe your body in it for 10 to 15 minutes.
For instant pain relief, apply mashed raw tomato mixed with crushed ice to the affected area.
You could even try eating more tomatoes. One study has shown that people who ate five tablespoons of lycopene-rich tomato paste for three months had 25% more protection against sunburn., Raw potatoes may help heat escape from the burned skin, leaving behind cooled skin that hurts less and heals faster.Blend rinsed, cleaned, and sliced raw potato to produce a paste. Apply it directly to the blisters. Leave it until it dries and gently rinse off with cold water.
This remedy can be repeated daily until the blisters are gone and ready to heal.

, Milk produces a protein film that helps calm the burning sensation of your skin, leaving it cool and allowing for relief and comfort.Soak a soft cloth in cool water with skim milk and drape it over the burned skin for several minutes.
Make sure the milk is cool and not cold. Take it out of the fridge about 10 minutes before you plan to use it.

Understand that the bulk of the treatment is symptomatic.,
Use a cold compress to provide cooling relief.,
Take a bath.,
Shower in lukewarm water.,
Take pain medication.,
Use cortisone cream to reduce inflammation.",How to Treat a Blistered Sunburn3," Care is given to prevent further damage and relieve pain, but not a lot can be done to speed up the healing process.

, The use of cold water or cold compress can reduce the inflammation by constricting the blood vessels and reducing the blood flow in the affected area.The cool temperature helps to numb nerve endings, providing you with instant, localized pain relief from the burning sensation of the blistered sunburn.
You can also use soaks and compresses with Burrow’s solution (a solution of aluminum acetate in water). Burrow’s solution can usually be found in drugstores.

, When taking a bath, use cool water and relax for 10 to 20 minutes; this can help relieve the pain of a sunburn. Repeat as often as you like for several days.


If you use a face towel, soak it to the cold water and apply it to the affected skin.
Warm baths and the utilization of soaps or bath oils is not advisable, because these can irritate the skin and increase discomfort.

, Make sure the temperature of the water when you shower is just below lukewarm. Pay attention to the flow of the water, making sure it is very gentle so it does not aggravate your pain.In general, if you can avoid showering, do so. The pressure of the shower could prematurely pop your sunburn blisters, leading to pain, infection, and scarring.
After showering, pat dry your skin using gentle movements. Don’t rub or wipe the skin with a towel as this can cause irritation.

, If the pain of the sunburn is bothering you, you can take anti-inflammatory analgesic oral medication such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin.Ibuprofen (Advil) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. It also reduces hormones that trigger fever.
Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)is a drug that works as an analgesic, relieving pain by inhibiting pain signals in the brain. It is also an antipyretic, a drug that reduces fever.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safer than aspirin for children who may have a sunburn. Acetaminophen has many of the same effects.
Discuss these options with your doctor if you have any doubt about their usage and whether the medications are right for you.

, Cortisone cream contains a minimal amount of steroids that help reduce the inflammation of the sunburn by suppressing the activity of the immune system.It is not advisable to use cortisone cream on children, so consult your physician for an alternative.

Understand how UV rays work.,
Understand how blisters develop.,
Go to the ER immediately if you experience certain symptoms.,
Note if you have preexisting medical conditions.,
Notice early symptoms.,
Look for itchy blisters.,
Check for fever.,
Observe for peeling skin.",How to Treat a Blistered Sunburn4," UV rays can be split into three subtypes: UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVA and UVB are the two types that can damage your skin. UVA composes 95% of all UV rays, and are responsible for sunburns and blisters. However, UVB rays cause more of the erythema, or the redness caused by the swelling of blood vessels. Examples of erythema include redness by sunburns, infections, inflammation, or even blushing., Blisters will not pop up immediately after sun exposure. Rather, they take a couple of days to develop. Burn blisters form when blood vessels are damaged and plasma and other fluids leak in between layers of skin, creating a pocket of fluid. Do not assume that the blisters are unrelated to your sunburn just because they appeared later. Harmful UV rays impact lighter skin tones more than darker ones, so you may be more or less susceptible to blistered sunburns than others, depending on your skin type.First-degree burns cause erythema, and blood vessels will widen, causing the skin to rise and become red in color. In the case of first-degree burns, only the outermost layer of skin is burned. However, damaged cells can release chemical mediators that can further irritate the skin and destroy other damaged cells.
In the case of second-degree burns, inner layers of skin are also affected, as well as blood vessels. Thus, blisters are a sign of second-degree burns. This is why burn blisters are considered to be a much more serious condition than the average sunburn.

, Your body may be suffering severely due to extended sun exposure, causing conditions such as dehydration or heat exhaustion. Watch for the following symptoms and seek emergency assistance immediately: Dizziness or faintness
Rapid pulse and rapid breathing
Nausea, chills or fever
Heavy thirst
Sensitivity to light
Blisters covering 20% or more of the body

, Consult a doctor if you have chronic actinic dermatitis, lupus erythematosus, herpes simplex, or eczema. Sun damage can worsen these conditions. Sunburns may also cause keratitis, inflammation of the cornea of the eye., If you exhibit the early symptoms of sunburn, do the best you can to get out of the sun immediately to prevent blistering. Symptoms include:Reddish skin that is tender and warm to the touch. The ultraviolet rays of the sun kills the living cells of the epidermis (outer layer if the skin). As the body senses the dead cells, the immune system starts to respond by increasing blood flow in the affected areas and opening up capillary walls so that white blood cells can come in and remove the damaged cells. The increased blood flow makes your skin warm and red.
Prickly, stinging pain in the affected area. The damaged cells in the affected area activate the pain receptors by releasing chemicals and sending signals to the brain that cause you to feel pain.

, These blisters can occur hours or days after exposure. The epidermis contains special nerve fibers that mediate the sensation of itch. When the epidermis is damaged because of prolonged exposure to the sun, these nerve fibers are activated and itchiness is felt in the affected area.Also, the body sends fluid to fill up the gaps and tears in the damaged skin in order to protect it, resulting in the formation of blisters.

, When your body’s immune system senses the dead cells and other foreign bodies, pyrogens (substances that cause fever) are released and travel to the hypothalamus, part of the brain that regulates body temperature.The pyrogens bind to the receptors in the hypothalamus and your body’s temperature starts to rise.You can take your temperate with a run-of-the-mill thermometer available at any pharmacy or drugstore.

, The dead cells in the sunburned area will be sloughed off by peeling, in order for the body to replace them with new skin cells."

Stay out of the sun.,
Wear sunscreen.,
Be careful in the water.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Avoid the sun at certain times of the day.,
Drink water.",How to Treat a Blistered Sunburn5," Prevention is always the best course of action for any ailment and, of course, avoiding sunburns in the first place is the best way to keep your skin healthy.Avoid exposing yourself to direct sun for long periods of time. Try to stay in areas that provide shade, such as under a balcony overhang, umbrella, or tree.

, The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that you use at least SPF 30 or higher of broad spectrum sunscreen that covers UVA and UVB rays. Both of these types of UV radiation can cause cancer. Many doctors will recommend these guidelines to their patients. Note that babies have particularly delicate skin, and need to have sunscreen applied all over their body (only after they are six months old). You can buy both baby and child-friendly sunscreens.It is important to apply sunscreen 30 minutes before going outside, not immediately prior. Make sure to reapply your sunscreen regularly. Generally, a good rule of thumb is to reapply 30 milliliters (1  fl oz) all over the body every three hours, or after any activity that involves the skin getting very wet (i.e. after getting out of a pool).Don't be fooled by cold weather. UV rays can still pass through clouds, and snow reflects 80% of them.
Be extra careful if you live close to the equator, or somewhere high in altitude. UV rays are much stronger in those areas due to ozone depletion.

, Not only does water affect the effectiveness of topical sunscreens, but wet skin in general is more susceptible to UV damage than dry skin. Use waterproof sunscreen when going to the beach or pool, or when exercising heavily outside.If swimming or sweating heavily, you should apply sunscreen more frequently than usual.

, Wear hats, visors, sunglasses, and anything else you can think of to shield your skin from the sun's rays. You can even purchase UV-block clothing., Try to stay out of the sun during the hours of 10a.m. to 4p.m., when sun is highest in the sky. This is when the sunlight is most direct, and the UV rays are therefore more damaging.If you can't avoid the sun entirely, seek share whenever possible.

, Drinking water is important for replenishing fluids, as well as combating dehydration, another serious and common consequence of extended sun exposure.Be sure to stay hydrated and drink water regularly when you are outdoors in heavy heat and sunlight exposure.
Do not drink water only when you are thirsty, but give your body the nutrients and resources it needs to keep you healthy prior to issues arising.

Motivate yourself every day.","How to Have a Happy, Healthy and Spiritually Fulfilled Old Age"," If you enjoy something, get out and do it. If health problems interfere, find ways to work around them and still get into the things that matter to you. Associate with groups of diverse people, not all in your age group. Don't think of your life as over, look at your future and plan for it actively. Socializing with young people who share your interests is a good way to keep in balance and avoid getting socially sidelined.;
, It might be tempting to say you've reached this point of life without worrying about your health habits but your best strategy for avoiding lengthy hospital stays, autonomy-sapping medical care, and bossy nursing home regimes is to look after yourself as much as possible. Treasure the health you have now and give it a boost by making sure that you stick to the five basic principles of health:



Eat healthy. This includes eating raw vegetables and fruit every day.
Avoid or quit unhealthy substances and habits. If you haven't already done so, now is the ideal time to give up taking drugs, excess alcohol, smoking, and over-eating.
Stay active. There are plenty of sports ideal for the older body, and many of these can also involve being around other people (and beautiful scenery if you choose your exercising location well). Try sports like walking, jogging, swimming, yoga, and aqua aerobics to maintain an optimal fitness level.

Practice positive thinking.
Take up meditation. If you're not already meditating, this is the perfect time to start. It will settle your mind and any unrest like nothing else.

, Go walking, jogging, swimming, cycling or do intensive yoga. Visit a health center or have an exercise bike in the comfort of your own place. It could be said that if you sweat once a day, the illness keeps away!

, In old age, inner happiness must be cultivated. Old age often brings energy loss, disease, a sense of meaninglessness, and worry about external problems over which you have no control. When the nerves are getting weaker, inner positivity is at great risk of declining. In old age, it's necessary to make an effort to cultivate happiness through everyday exercises that can maintain both physical health and strengthen your inner happiness. Make the choice to stay involved with your continued growth rather than giving in to socially condoned decline.

, All you need to do is choose the ones that align with your own interpretation of spirituality. Reading is the best trainer for maintaining a positive mind and for answering many of your probing questions, and is also a perfect means for controlling your negative thoughts. Being exposed to spiritual writing and passages on a daily basis is uplifting and helps you to continue to hone your sense of purpose. Look for the positive sentences and learn them by heart, or at least say them over to yourself several times. And make a deal with yourself to start every day with a positive vision.

, Awaken your enlightenment energy through meditation. A calm mind is a positive mind, and using yoga and meditation to self calm whenever you feel doubt or unhappiness is an ideal practice. If yoga doesn't work for you, keep looking to find the spiritual exercise which is helpful for you. And be sure to practice daily: You can have every positive religion or philosophy you want, but you must practice it to get the bliss.

, Life has purpose when you make choices about the things you want to do and then do them. A hobby is an excellent way to remain fulfilled and interested in what is happening around you. Inevitably, a hobby will always provide a way to reach out to others who are interested in the same hobby as you, thereby increasing your fulfillment through interaction with other people. It doesn't matter what sort of hobby you have, provided it is enjoyable, affordable, and is practiced with restraint.

, You can find friends on the internet, in collaborative projects like wikiHow, in spiritual associations, in social organizations, and through volunteer work. It's a good idea to meet up regularly with one or more people so that you connect and feel part of a greater whole. Spend good times together and speak up if you're not enjoying what you're doing. The time for putting up with things is long gone.


If people pretend to be your friends and hurt you, wish them the best and part ways. There is a time and a place for trying to mend things with people but as you grow older, there is less time and a need for faster acceptance that some relationships are simply not meant to be. Don't sweat it; find the people who fill you with joy and happiness and spend more time with them

, If you like pets, be sure to have one. The love, comfort, and connection with a pet is as important to you in old age as it was to you at any age. Animals don't judge us the way people too, and animals don't care what our age is, provided we ensure they're well fed, groomed, and loved. Choose a pet that is easy to care for and can be handled by you without a worry.

, This can be a time of life where you're more than happy to give back to others, and you also have the free time to do so. Volunteering, teaching, or guiding can be good ways to pass on your experience, knowledge, and skills to others and in return, you continue to connect with people and to receive the joy of knowing that you are helping others to learn. A part of you will always live on in every person you help and teach, so do good and live in the energy of love.


In doing good for others, you become the mother or father of the world, not just of the children you have parented. This extended family is a privilege of old age, and as your wisdom is treasured by many others, your mind will change into love.

, Your spiritual exercises are a very important means for helping you to break through the fears and worries that you may hold about death and letting go. Meditation and chanting mantras can also be a source of great comfort. Realize that after your death, you will earn the great benefit of your spiritual old age. You will move into a dimension of light, peace, and love. Even if you don't believe in a life after death, the comfort to be obtained from viewing death spiritually, as a cycle, and accepting it as what is meant to be, will be great.

, In old age, thinking can easily become negative because ways are set and change becomes something to be loathed. Yet, giving up is worse than dying; never wanting to learn another thing, never wanting to change another thing allows decay to set in and your old age will lack harmony and purpose. While it's not easy to motivate yourself to exercise each day, to practice your spiritual reading and meditations, and to find the will to cook healthily, these are important sources of re-energizing yourself and of helping you to cope with the changes of life. To help you get motivated, find a helpful phrase that will energize you and cause you to react positively.


What is your helpful phrase? Every day, find a way to re-energize the power to live a positive life. Start the day with spiritual music, a word of a spiritual master or a spiritual exercise like yoga with positive thinking.

Determine if you have a first or second degree burn.,
Cool the skin.,
Ice the burn if you still feel pain.,
Apply an antibiotic and wrap the burn if blisters develop.,
Take pain medication.,
Apply aloe vera gel.,
Apply a topical anesthetic spray, like solarcaine.,
Protect the burn from sun damage and other discomfort.,
Watch for infection.",How to Stop the Burning in First Degree Burns Temporarily," A first-degree burn is a minor burn, but a second-degree burn will have further damage to the skin's layers. Second-degree burns will also have blistering, pain, redness, and bleeding. These may require different treatment or professional care, so it's important to understand what level of burn you have. To tell if you have a first-degree burn, look for the following:Redness to just the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis)
Damage to the skin, but no blistering
Pain similar to that of a sunburn
Stinging, but no broken skin
If you develop large blisters, the burn covers a large area of your body, or if you notice infection (like oozing from the wound, severe pain, redness, and swelling), get medical attention before trying to treat the wound at home.;
, Place the burned skin under cool running water for 20 minutes. This should help to lower the temperature of your skin. If you don't want to stand next to running water for that long, fill a bowl with cool water and soak the burn in the bowl. You may want to add some ice cubes to the bowl, since the water could warm up quickly. But, make sure the water just remains cool, not cold.Avoid using ice cold water to run over or submerge your skin. It can damage the delicate and already injured tissue if you cool it down too quickly.
If you use a bowl, make sure it's big enough to completely submerge your burn in the water.

, If you're still feeling pain after cooling the burned area with water, apply ice. Be sure to wrap a washcloth or paper towels around the ice pack to create a barrier. Press the wrapped ice, ice pack, or even a bag of frozen vegetables, against the burn. Leave it on for around 10 minutes, but move the ice to different spots every few minutes if it gets too cold.Never apply ice directly to the burned area.

, By this point, you should be feeling relief from the pain. You should only need to dress the burn if it's developing a blister (making it a second-degree burn). Dress the burn by simply patting the burned area dry. Generously cover the burn with a topical antibiotic, like Neosporin, and cover it with clean gauze. Tape the pad in place or wrap the gauze around the burn for extra flexibility.Most first-degree burns won't require antibiotics and bandaging. Instead, apply a natural moisturizer, like aloe vera, throughout the day.Take care to change the dressing every day, until the skin looks normal.

, If the pain is still too distracting, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen.Follow the packaging instructions to determine the correct dose and suggested time between doses.


Do not take NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, etc.) if you have cuts or are bleeding, as they can thin the blood.
Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers without first speaking to a doctor, especially if the child has flu-like symptoms., Spread aloe vera gel directly on the burned area. You should notice a cooling sensation on your skin. Studies have shown that aloe vera may also help heal the burn faster, since it's an effective moisturizer.If you purchase a skin product containing aloe vera, look for one that contains mainly aloe vera with as few additives as possible. Aloe vera gels which contain alcohol, for example, can actually irritate and dry the skin.
Avoid spreading aloe vera gel on broken skin or open blisters. This could cause infection.

, This will temporarily take the sting out of your first-degree burn. Make sure the burned area has been cleaned and dried. Hold the can 6 to 9 inches away and spray the burned area. You should notice numbness within 1 to 2 minutes.


Don't use topical anesthetic spray for more than 7 days. If the pain is still noticeable or irritating, see your medical provider., Keep your burn covered when you go outside, especially if it is sunny or windy, as this can cause further damage. Wear loose-fitting, tightly woven clothing.You should be particularly careful to stay out of the sun between peak UV hours of 10am and 4pm.Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen of at least 30 SPF and reapply every two hours., Any damage to the skin can compromise your body's first line of defense against bacteria, causing infection. Always get medical attention if you notice the burn struggling to heal. Your medical provider can determine whether or not you have an infection. When you change your bandage every day, look for any unusual skin conditions:The area of redness getting larger
Pus-like, greenish discharge
Increasing pain
Swelling

Scratch yourself near the itch.,
Pat the bite.,
Distract yourself.,
Use meditation.,
Put socks on your hands.,
Use scotch tape.",How to Stop Scratching a Mosquito Bite1," Anyone who has ever had a broken bone and worn a cast knows, sometimes you just can’t scratch an itch. One way to get some relief is to scratch someplace else on your body. This little mind trick relieves your body’s desire to scratch without further inflaming the mosquito bite.You can try scratching near the itch, such as in a large circle around the bite. Be careful not to touch it by mistake!
Alternatively, you can scratch someplace completely different, like the top of your head or the bottom of your feet.
Repeat this any time you feel compelled to scratch.;
, Instead of scratching, you can get some relief by gently patting the mosquito bite. A few light taps may be all that you need to sooth the itch and prevent scratching. If that doesn't work, you may try a slightly more intense pat. Eventually, you may even choose to slap the bite.


Wait a few moments after patting before you increase the intensity of your pats. It may take a few moments for the pat to work.
Repeat this anytime you feel compelled to scratch.

, One of the simplest ways to stop yourself from scratching is just to get your mind off of it. Do anything that can get your mind off the itch. The best activities will be things that involve your hands. That way, you’ll be less likely to scratch absentmindedly.Play tennis.
Do a crossword puzzle.
Bake oatmeal cookies.

, Meditation has been an effective treatment for relieving itchiness caused by psoriasis. Use it to stop scratching your mosquito bites. Instead of focusing on the itch, simply close your eyes, take some deep breaths, and try not to think about anything. Set a timer and try to do this for five minutes at a time.Look for guided meditations online, if you would enjoy some guidance.
Or put on some soothing music to help you relax.

, Putting socks on your hands is an easy way to remind yourself not to scratch. Even if you do scratch while the socks are on your hands, you won’t be able to do much damage.


You can make a sock puppet playhouse, and play with socks on your hands.
This is good for children because it distracts them from their bites and focuses their attention on the game.

, Sealing the bite off from air can help reduce itchiness. Apply a piece of scotch tape onto your mosquito bite to accomplish this. Using scotch tape has the added benefit of preventing inadvertent touching, scratching, or irritation. It will be helpful for you to clean the affected area before applying the tape.Remove the scotch tape and repeat two to three times per day.
Regular scotch tape will work best, but packing tape is a good option, too. Avoid using duct tape, as it can irritate your skin.

Make a baking soda paste.,
Use a dab of honey.,
Use tea tree oil.,

Apply this paste as often as is needed.

, Another approach is to apply honey to a mosquito bite. Honey (especially honey local to your area) works like a natural antihistamine. Simply rub a small (dime-sized) dollop of the sweet stuff into any mosquito bites on your body. The best honey to use will be local to your area and raw.Be sparing with your application of honey! It is sticky and can pick up unwanted dirt.

, The antiseptic properties of tea tree oil (or melaleuca oil) are great for treating a variety of skin conditions, including mosquito bites. Place a little tea tree essential oil onto a cotton swab and apply it to the affected area. Lavender and peppermint oils are excellent choices as well.If you have very sensitive skin, you can mix a few drop of essential oil with coconut oil, and then apply.
This will dilute the oil just enough to make it gentle to your skin.

, Make yourself a nice cup of tea and retain your tea bag. Then press the warm tea bag into your mosquito bite. The natural tannins in tea have an astringent property, which can draw toxins out of the skin and lessen your discomfort.The best choice is pure black tea.
You can reuse the same tea bag a few times before it loses its potency.

Heat a spoon in hot water. It should be very hot, but not so hot that you burn yourself.
Touch the back of the spoon to the bite and slowly press down. Maintain it there for 15 seconds, to give time for the heat to break down the proteins. Doing this once should be enough to provide relief.
Be careful not to burn yourself. If the spoon feels uncomfortably hot, let it cool for a bit.;
, The cold will reduce the swelling and numb the nerves. Packages of frozen corn or peas make handy ready-to-use ice packs. But be sure to wrap the ice pack in a thin towel so the cold doesn’t directly touch your skin.

, Honey has anti-inflammatory properties and the stickiness will make it less enjoyable to scratch.


Smear a dab of honey onto the bite and then let leave it on.
Cover the bite with a band aid to prevent dirt from sticking to the honey and getting into the bite.

, This will reduce the irritation and promote healing.


Mix a stiff paste from baking soda and water. Start with a 2:1 ratio of baking soda and water and add baking soda as needed until the paste is moist, but not runny. Put a generous dollop onto the bite and let it dry. As it dries it will help draw out toxins.
Cover the bite with toothpaste, and like with the baking soda paste, let it dry completely. When it is done, it should flake off when you touch it. The astringency of the toothpaste will help draw out the fluids from under your skin.

, If the bite occurred on your arm or leg, raise the limb above your heart to help it drain.


Maintain this posture for 30 minutes to give the swelling time to go down.

, When the mosquito bit you, a small amount of its saliva was injected into your skin. The saliva contained anticoagulants to prevent your blood from clotting as the mosquito drank. The itch comes from your body’s autoimmune reaction against the anticoagulants.Rub an antihistamine cream into the bite, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The oral antihistamine Zyrtec has also been shown to prevent itchiness from mosquito bites.

, Rub it into the itchy, red, puffy skin. It may take a few minutes, but you should get relief.1% hydrocortisone creams can be purchased without a prescription.
Because this is a steroid cream, consult your doctor before applying it to children.

, This will help draw out the fluids that have collected around the bite and will reduce the swelling.Reapply the lotion as needed, but not more often than described in the manufacturer's instructions. The lotion will dry out the bite, including the chemicals in the mosquito’s saliva that are causing the itching.

, Pain relievers are generally unnecessary for mosquito bites, but if you have scratched it open it may sting and be painful.


If this is the case, a topical anesthetic on will usually be sufficient to soothe the pain. A 2% Xylocaine Gel works well.But, if it does not soothe the discomfort, you can try an over the counter oral painkiller such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. However, because pain is unusual for mosquito bites, if you are experiencing pain, you should get the bite checked by a doctor., Some mosquitoes carry serious diseases and when they bite, they transfer the virus or parasite into your body through their saliva.See a doctor if you develop any of the following symptoms:Fever
Headache
Dizziness
Joint and muscle aches
Vomiting

, This may help the doctor diagnose you if you have a mosquito-borne illness. Malaria and yellow fever occur mostly in the tropics.West Nile and encephalitis viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes in the US. Dengue Fever is uncommon, but does occur in the southern US., This is an unusual response to a mosquito bite, but it if occurs, it must be addressed quickly.Symptoms include:


Difficulty breathing or wheezing
Difficulty swallowing
Dizziness
Vomiting
Racing heart
Hives or rashes spreading beyond the site of the bite
Itching or swelling in other parts of your body besides where you were bitten
Your doctor may prescribe oral glucocorticoids to avoid a large-scale allergic reaction.

, Sometimes people develop an allergic reaction to the proteins in mosquito saliva. This reaction causes itchy, painful redness and swelling known as ""skeeter syndrome.""You're more likely to develop skeeter syndrome if you're bitten frequently, as you can become sensitized to the saliva.
There's no test for skeeter syndrome. If you see red, itchy, painful swelling, see your doctor for treatment.

, This may make you a less attractive target. Though mosquitoes do bite through clothing, it should reduce the number of bites you get.

, The most effective repellants contain DEET (N, N-diethylmeta-toluamide) and are widely available.Shield your eyes when applying it to your face.
Do not inhale mosquito sprays.
Do not apply it to open wounds. It will sting.
Consult with a doctor before using bug repellants if you are pregnant.
Consult with a doctor before applying repellants to infants.
Shower to wash the spray off your skin when you no longer need it.
Do not use DEET repellents if you have an insulin pump or any similar important plastic device, as it can damage or melt the plastic.

, This will prevent you from getting bitten while you sleep.


Check the net and repair any holes. Tuck the net under the mattress so that you leave no openings for mosquitoes to fly through.

, This protection should last through multiple washings.Consult a doctor if you are pregnant or before applying it to the clothing of young children.

, Mosquitoes breed in standing water, so emptying them will reduce the mosquito population.


Change the water in your pet’s drinking bowl frequently.

Call emergency medical help if you have severe allergic symptoms.,
Scrape across the stinger using a flat edge.,
Use tweezers to pull the stinger out.,
Apply an ice pack.,
Apply hydrocortisone cream.,
Use honey.,
Apply toothpaste.,
Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen.,
Take an antihistamine.",How to Remove a Bee Stinger," If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to bee stings and carry an epinephrine auto injector, known as EpiPen, use it immediately.If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, get emergency medical attention:


Dizziness or faintness
Difficulty breathing
Swollen tongue
Hives;
, Use the edge of a credit card, your fingernail, or a blunt knife to scrape over the stinger, which looks like a small black dot.Scraping across will actually pull the stinger out and to the side.


Scraping across the stinger prevents the venom sack from releasing more venom down into the sting., If you don't want to scrape the stinger, take sharp tweezers or use your fingernails and carefully pull the stinger directly out. Take care not to squeeze the exposed end of the stinger, or you'll release more venom into your skin.Some argue that you shouldn't use tweezers, because it can release more venom. However, the amount of venom released shouldn't matter if you remove the stinger quickly., The site of the sting will become inflamed and start to swell. Applying ice will numb any pain and keep the swelling down.If you were stung on your leg or arm, elevate the limb., Gently wash the site with mild soap and water. Then, apply a thin layer of hydrocortisone cream to minimize any reaction you might have.


For a more natural treatment, you can mix baking soda and water until it forms a thick paste. Spread this over the sting site., If you don't have hydrocortisone on hand, spread pure honey over the sting site. Place gauze or a small cloth over it and let it sit for up to an hour before rinsing off., Toothpaste is another natural alternative to neutralize the venom of a bee sting. Simply dab a little toothpaste over the sting site, place gauze or a small cloth over it, and let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Then, rinse the toothpaste off., This will help relieve some of the pain. Be sure to follow the package instructions regarding dosage.


For children, consult with your pediatrician for appropriate dosing of acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

, This may reduce the severity of a reaction. You can take something like Benadryl (diphenhydramine) or apply calamine lotion to reduce itchiness."

Make sure that your children always wear shoes and hats. You may also want to get into the habit of checking your children's clothes and hair for ticks. Also, don't wear any shade of blue, as this attracts mosquitoes and sometimes bees.;
, Make sure they know to shake them out before using them.

, You may also want to stay away from locations that are popular for insects and mosquitoes to hang out, such as water holes, streams, tall grass, and dense forest areas. Look around for bee hives and nests before pitching your tent.

, Geranoil, Linalool, and Citronella are the popular choices. Just make sure they are not accessible to the younger children.

, For example, show them areas where they cannot play because mosquitoes, insects, and spiders may live there, and show them how to freeze if a stinging insect flies near them.

, Make sure your children get into that habit too. You may also want to invest in mosquito nets if you are sleeping in a cabin in the wilderness, as well as window screens. You may also want to consider screening an area for eating and preparing food outside, and get your children into the habit of eating and drinking within that parameter.

, Keep your garbage secure and away from your camping area. The trunk of your car is a good spot.

This step only applies if you have yet to hire any employees.;
, A bookkeeper can help you follow state and federal laws regarding employee accounting, but you can also do this yourself if you have the time.


A good method of keeping employee salary and tax records is by using an online system (such as Paylocity). Using these types of systems makes the process automatic and allows you to access all employee salary and tax information if needed. In addition, it is good to keep a paper backup of all important files in case a problem arises with the service.

, This form allows you to withhold tax from the employee and submit it to the government. In addition, you will need to submit a W-2 Form for each employee. If you have a bookkeeper hired, they will handle this.


Using an online system makes this process much easier as you can submit these forms directly to the payment and tax processes.

, Be sure to have all employees fill out a I-9 Form to confirm their eligible working status regarding immigration and age laws. In addition, be sure to request all supplementary evidence listed on the form, such as an employee's driver's license, a U.S. passport, or an employee's green card.

,, All employers need this insurance before hiring employees, and some states have programs that you can join. In addition, several well known insurance companies offer worker's compensation insurance.

, This list should be ranked in terms of importance to the business.

, Be sure to make these descriptions include all responsibilities of the job as well as the business' goals and expectations from the employee.

, If someone you trust is willing to vouch for a potential employee, they should be a candidate to consider. Try not to allow your personal relationships affect who you choose to hire in the end, since that can cloud your judgement and make you choose your friend or family over a more worthy candidate.

, Posting job advertisements on job search websites, the newspaper, or anywhere else is a good step in attracting a high quantity of potential employees. Also, post job advertisements in local posting areas. This includes Craigslist as well.

, This will help your potential employee answer any questions you give them with the business' goals in mind. Also, this allows you and the potential employee to be on the same page mentally. After explaining your goals, ask the candidate how they can help the business achieve its goals.

, Ask the potential employee how they would handle the event. This will allow you to get a better feel for how the candidate will respond to common workplace problems and stresses.

, Ask them to explain a time when they handled an issue at work. Go on to ask how they handled disagreements between coworkers and even their past bosses.

, Choose a small number of specific and essential skills needed for the job position. Ask questions regarding these skills in terms of the potential employees value and competence.

, If possible, record the interview (let the potential employee know about the recording beforehand). Listen to the recording without looking at the name of the employee. Try to be as unbiased as possible.

, Professional references will tell you how the employee acts in a work setting, while personal references will tell you about the employee's personality. Also, be sure to verify that the employee did not lie during the interview. Ask to see their degree, or call a past job asking about how long they worked there.

, If you feel as if an employee is a good or bad choice based on the interview, try not to second guess yourself. Usually your gut feeling about a person is right, so if you have exhausted all other options and still can't decide between two employees, go with your gut.

Clean on and around the affected area with mild soap and water. Use a washcloth or paper towel to remove any excess moisture., Gnats can carry bacteria from things like rotten food, so you should swab the area thoroughly with a cotton ball. Tape the cotton ball to the wound to allow the antiseptic to soak into the bite.Common topical antiseptics include alcohol, iodine, and hydrogen peroxide

, Vinegar is a popular natural home remedy used to relieve swelling, pain, and redness in wasp and bee stings. It may help reduce the pain and itch of gnat bites, as well. Soak a cotton ball in the vinegar and apply it to the affected area until it feels better.

, This ointment is available over-the-counter and it has both antibacterial and pain relieving properties.

Make a sticky trap.",How to Reduce the Pain of Gnat Bites3," Gnats collect in bodies of still water. If you locate the source of your gnat problem, you can keep them from breeding and swarming and thereby reduce the chances of a painful bite.Remove gardening items that can collect rainwater, like buckets or flowerpots.
Clogged gutters and storm drains also attract gnats.
Cover swimming pools with a pool cover or large tarp when not in use.

, If the soil in your garden is attracting a lot of gnats, you may be over watering your plants. If you notice puddles, wait at least 24 hours between watering to let the soil dry completely.

, Gnats are attracted to food items in open containers, and to dirty dishes left in the sink. Wash and dry dishes and countertops, and put dishes away. This will help avoid colonies of gnats that may bite.

, Bleach kills gnats, so pour a small amount of household bleach into the water pans under your refrigerator or freezer. Check and empty the pans regularly, remove the dead gnats, and add more bleach.


Pour a quarter cup of bleach down your drains, especially garbage disposal drains, to discourage gnats from collecting there.

, Close any gaps in the insulating seals around your doors and windows, so gnats can't get in from outside. This will help prevent gnat bites.Pay special attention to the sealant around window-mounted air conditioner units, which produce moisture that attracts gnats.

, Don't leave wet towels on the floor of the bathroom, or leave damp dish cloths on the kitchen counter or bar. Eliminating damp areas in your house will keep gnats from colonizing.

, Instead of using dangerous pesticides that can harm you or your pets, create a trap for gnats instead. Empty the traps regularly and refill the traps – this will help keep you and your family from getting gnat bites.Fill a mason jar (or any jar of similar size) with apple cider vinegar. The jar doesn't need to be completely full – half full works just as well.
Close the lid and poke 5 or 6 holes in the lid. If you don't have the lid, cover the top of the jar with cling wrap and poke holes in that.
The gnats will be attracted to the vinegar and will enter the jar, but won't be able to get out of the jar.
If you don't have apple cider vinegar, use regular vinegar with a few squirts of dishwashing liquid. Gnats are especially drawn to lemon scents.

, The gnats will be drawn to the yellow color and will get stuck in the honey. This will help prevent a build-up of biting gnats.Attach a yellow index card to a popsicle stick, so it looks like a little sign. Gnats are attracted to the yellow color – plain index cards won't work as well.
Coat the index card with honey, and stick the popsicle stick into the dirt near plants where gnats tend to collect.
Replace the used cards with new ones when they fill with gnats.

, If an open cooking fire is used, it should be made on a raised mound of clay, not directly on the ground.

, a curious or energetic child can easily knock over a cooking pot. Do not leave hot dishes on the edge of tables either.

, The steam from boiling kettles or steaming pots is dangerously hot and can burn or scald easily.

, Objects made of glass and metal can become very hot sitting next to a fire source. Take care to move any objects away before cooking or lighting a fire.

, Such things to be careful with include petrol, paraffin, lamps, matches, candles, lighters, hot irons and electric cords.

, Children can be seriously injured if they put their fingers or other objects into electric sockets. Power sockets should be covered to prevent access.

, Electric wires should be kept out of children's reach. Bare electric wires are particularly dangerous.

, If you cannot be sure that your child will not stay away from a fire or heat source, consider ways to create a barrier, such as a grill around a fire or a safety gate to keep a child out of the cooking area etc.

, Don't let a child sit on your lap while you are drinking a hot drink. One bump can result in terrible scalds.

, Make sure that children understand the consequences of getting too close to flame or heat. Tell older children and encourage them to explain this to their younger siblings and other younger children.

Observe a commitment to personal and professional growth.,
Pose open-ended questions.,
Ask clear and succinct behavioral questions.,
Choose your words carefully.,
Request the input of your colleagues and supervisor.",How to Develop Behavioral Interviewing Questions," When interviewing a candidate for a management position, leadership strengths will be important. If hiring for a highly competitive research position, determination, persistence and intellectual curiosity may be important. Create a list of the required qualities.;
, For example, if you need a team leader who can address conflict quickly and constructively, ask the applicant to describe an instance in which conflict arose between 2 team members and the approach used to resolve the situation.

, To gain insights about a candidate's strengths and weaknesses, ask questions that reveal the presence or absence of necessary qualities. For example, if the position requires a commitment to meeting project deadlines, you might say, ""Describe a time when you missed a project deadline and the repercussions of the delay."" The candidate's answer may reveal a commitment to keeping deadlines, a tendency to blame delays on others or other relevant characteristics.

, Answers to behavioral interviewing questions can reveal personal qualities, such as self-awareness, humility and loyalty. Word questions to allow the interviewee to feel comfortable enough to admit mistakes and elaborate on lessons learned from life experiences. For example, you might say, ""We all have our bad days. Tell me about a work situation in which you weren't at your best and the lessons learned from the experience.""

, Questions should be worded to allow the interviewee to describe a situation, the steps taken, and the thoughts and feelings experienced before, during and after the process. For example, instead of asking, ""Have you experienced conflicts in the workplace?"" phrase the question to invite a more revealing answer: ""Tell me about a time when you experienced conflict with a work colleague and the eventual outcome.""

, Posing lengthy and complicated questions may cause confusion for an already anxious candidate. For example, if interested in how a candidate handles stress, you wouldn't discuss the impact of stress on the human body or the general prevalence of it in the workforce. A clear question would cut to the core issue: ""Describe your experience with a highly stressful situation in the workplace and how you dealt with it.""

, Write out the questions ahead of time so that you are not adding unnecessary language or omitting important words during the interview.

, Ask them to review your list of behavioral interviewing questions to ensure that your intent for asking the questions is coming across clearly.

Tuck your pants into your socks and tuck your shirt into your pants to prevent ticks from having access to your skin.You can easily detect dark or brown ticks on your clothes if they are light-colored, so always choose lighter colors like khaki or white.
Keep long hair tied back. You may also want to cover your head with a light-colored hat.;
, Before going outside, apply a generous amount of insect repellent to your ears, neck, arms, legs, and feet. Always read the instructions on the insect repellent before using it. Do not apply DEET over any cuts or wounds and do not put DEET near your mouth or your eyes, as it may act as an irritant.Choose an insect repellent with 20 to 30 percent N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). This ingredient acts as a smell irritant for insects, including ticks.
Apply a generous amount of insect repellent to your clothing for further protection from ticks.
Treat your clothing with permethrin to further protect yourself against ticks. Choose a product with 0.5 percent permethrin and follow the instructions on the label closely.
Repellent with DEET can safely be used on adults and children of any age.Pregnant women and women who are lactating should follow the same recommendations as the general population. Topically applied DEET does not pose hazards to the fetus, regardless of gestational age. In fact, it is advised that pregnant women use an insect repellant to prevent the spread of arboviral infections, such as Zika.

, Ticks cannot jump or fly. In order to feed, a tick will climb grass and shrubs in order to come into contact with potential hosts.If you come into contact with leaves, grasses, or plants, there is a chance a tick may brush onto you.


Always walk on designated trails that are far from high vegetation areas.
When hiking or walking through the woods, stay in the middle of the trail to avoid high grass and overhanging branches.Never sit directly on the ground or on stone walls, as both leave you highly susceptible to a tick bite., Ticks thrive in high grass and weeds, usually above ankle height.By trimming bushes and weeds, you can help make your home and the surrounding area tick free.


Keep your grass mowed short and remove any leaf litter, brush, and weeds from your property.
Store firewood and hang birdfeeders away from your house, as these tend to attract ticks.
Build a border around your lawn and any surrounding woods or stone walls. The border should be a flat patch of wood chips, mulch, or gravel at least three feet wide and running the length of your property.
Always wear long pants and long sleeves when trimming your lawn or doing yard work and apply insect repellent to your skin and clothes.
Ticks flourish in wet/moist areas, so always ensure the area around your home is as dry as possible., Because tick bites are painless, you should always inspect your body once you get home from spending time outdoors.A tick must first attach to you and feed on your blood for several hours before an infection occurs, so the sooner you remove them from your body, the better.Search for ticks in hard to reach areas like your back, neck, and scalp, or ask someone to inspect this area for you.
Examine the parts of your body that are usually warm and moist, like the groin area and under your armpits. Ticks tend to be drawn to these regions.
To inspect hard to reach areas on your own, use a full-length mirror and a hand mirror.
Tick bites look like small red pea-sized spots, usually raised or swollen. As tick bites are painless, they will appear as a small lump with mild irritation on your skin.

, Even if your skin is protected, ticks can still hitch a ride on your clothing. It's imperative that you treat your clothing with insect repellent before going outdoors and use heat to kill any ticks that may have made their way home on your clothes.Check your clothes for ticks before you get home.
You can treat clothing with heat to kill any ticks that might have climbed onto you.
If your clothes are soiled, use hot water to wash them. Cold and medium-temperature water won't be as effective at killing ticks on your clothes.
Regardless of whether you wash your clothes, you should always put your clothing through the dryer. Use the tumble dry setting at high heat for at least 10 minutes to kill any ticks that may be on your clothes.

, Shower within two hours of returning home. Standing in hot, running water can help wash away any ticks that were on your body but not yet attached. You can also use your time in the shower to do a more thorough check for ticks on your body., Make it a habit to examine your dog or cat for ticks as soon as they come inside. Any ticks that are not removed can potentially infect your pet, and any ticks on your pet's body can also transfer onto you.


Dogs and cats do not show a rash like humans do if they get infected with Lyme disease.Cats are thought to be more resistant to Lyme disease than dogs. Symptoms of Lyme disease in dogs include fatigue, arthritis/joint pain, and fever.
Remove and save the tick as soon as you find it. Contact your veterinarian and schedule a physical exam as soon as possible, and bring the tick to show your vet.

, If you find a tick on your body, get a pair of fine-tipped tweezers, rubbing alcohol, and cotton balls soaked in an antiseptic. If you do not have an antiseptic solution handy, you can use soap and water.Sterilize the tweezers and any other tools you'll be using. You can do this by dipping them in boiling water or soaking them in rubbing alcohol for a few minutes.
In a study that evaluated the use of forceps (tweezers) or protected fingers, the application of petroleum jelly, fingernail polish, isopropyl alcohol, or a hot match, it was demonstrated that the forceps were the best option for removal of the tick. In the absence of tweezers use a cloth or paper towel to protect the fingers and remove it that way.

, Using heat, oil, or petroleum jelly on a tick will not cause the tick to let go of you, and it may kill the tick with its mouth still in your skin.The only way to safely remove a tick is by using tweezers. If you pull the tick out and it moves around outside of your body, you know you've completely removed it. If the tick is dead when you pull it off, there's a chance the head may have broken off under your skin.Grab the tick’s mouth by positioning the tweezers as close to your skin as possible. Do not grab at the tick's abdomen, as the head can break off and lead to an infection.
Gently pull the tick straight out until you can see its mouth detach from your skin.
Never try to remove the tick by twisting it, as this greatly increases the risk of the head or mouth parts breaking off under your skin.
If the tick's head does break off under your skin, you'll need to see a doctor right away. The risk of acquiring Lyme disease increases significantly after the tick's mouth has been attached for 24 to 48 hours., Once you've completely removed the tick and ensured that the head is intact, you'll want to clean the site of the bite. Ticks are known pathogen carriers, but you can also get a bacterial infection from an open wound. For this reason, it's best to clean and/or disinfect the site as soon as you've successfully pulled the tick out.Clean the bitten area with cotton balls soaked in the antiseptic solution and let it air dry.
If you don't have any antiseptic solution, you can wash the site of the bite thoroughly with soap and clean, running water.

, If you find a tick, it's important to save it so that a doctor can identify and test it. Preserve the tick in a small, sealed sandwich bag, vial, or bottle. If possible, keep the tick alive to make testing for diseases faster and easier., If you have any issues removing the tick or if you experience any flu-like symptoms, contact your doctor immediately. Common symptoms of Lyme disease include fever, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue.Tell your doctor when the bite occurred, where on your body you found the tick, and where you believe you picked up the tick.
Most cases of infection from ticks are treated successfully using antibiotics for several weeks.

, If you find ticks on your pet, remove them right away with tweezers. You'll need many of the same tools as you would for a tick on a human: fine-tipped tweezers, a fine toothed comb, rubbing alcohol, and cotton balls soaked in an antiseptic solution. Follow the same removal procedures as you would for humans, and be sure to preserve the tick to show your vet.Comb your pet’s fur with the fine toothed comb to expose its skin.
When you locate a tick, grab the tick’s mouth using the fine-tipped tweezers.
Gently pull the tick straight out until you see its mouth detach from your pet’s skin. Preserve the tick in a sealable sandwich bag or a small bottle or vial.
Clean the bitten area with cotton balls soaked in the antiseptic solution.
If you have difficulty removing ticks from your pet, your vet can help you remove the tick. Be sure to follow up with your vet in case there's any necessary treatment.

Follow up.",How to Conduct an Informational Interview," Decide on what sort of business you hope to work for. Then determine what positions within that business you are most suited for. Also consider how long you intend to work for them, and how far you would like to advance within the company. For example, say you have a law degree. Ask yourself:What do I hope to do with it? Work for a private law firm? Or for the government, in either the courts or district attorney’s office?
What type of law do I want to focus on? Criminal? Corporate? Environmental?
What specific positions do I want to fill? Trial lawyer? Research? Something else?
Do I plan to stay with them long-term? If so, how far up the ladder do I intend to climb?;
, Think about where you intend to live, or how flexible you are in terms of relocating. Narrow your search down as much as possible. Give yourself the opportunity to conduct several interviews with different people and/or businesses in the same area.The logistics of trying to conduct informational interviews in several different locations is ineffective. The more travel you do, the more time and money you will spend.
If you are undecided about location, but have a particular business in mind that has several locations, an alternative could be to contact the nearest one.

, Use your list of interests and your prefered location to conduct an online search for related businesses in that area. Search their website for ideal candidates to interview. If the website includes personal bios, read those to match things they have in common with yourself so you can establish a personal connection more easily. If not, search for their background through other means, like career-related sites like LinkedIn, or even social media, such as Facebook or Twitter.Widen your search even further by sending feelers through every network you have. Tell friends, families, teachers, coworkers, anyone and everyone you know, about your intentions. Utilize their networks in case they know the perfect person to set you up with.
Be specific about your interests. For example, say something like, ""Do you know any speech therapists who work with kids?"" or ""I'm thinking about teaching in Oregon when I graduate. Do you know any teachers out there?""
If you’re in school, visit their career center for possible contacts with alumni., Announce your interest in interviewing your contact by writing them first. Remember: they have nothing immediate to gain by granting you one, and their work and/or personal lives may keep them pretty busy. So send a letter or email to let them know that you would like them to take time out so you can talk. This way they don’t have to answer you right away, which lowers the risk of them saying no right off the bat in case they’re swamped.Keep a professional tone. Start by introducing yourself and stating that you would like to interview them: ""Hello. I'm Dan Smith. I am currently a student at Pratt University and was hoping to interview you in order to gain more insight about pursuing a career as a librarian after I graduate.""
Follow with a more detailed paragraph about why you are interested in the field and/or company and why your contact seems like an ideal person to talk to: ""I have always had a passion for information and am greatly excited about integrating new platforms of learning into the library's traditional role as a resource of printed materials. We have studied your library program's initiatives in class and I would love the opportunity to learn more in depth.""
Close by thanking them for their consideration and suggesting a window of time in which you would like to meet. ""I will be in the Baltimore area between October 10th and 15th. If you think you could spare the time to meet with me, I would greatly appreciate it.""
Mention any info that you share in common so you stand out more. For instance, if you went to the same school or have a mutual acquaintance, mention it in your intro: ""Liz Darnell recommended reaching out to you about an informational interview."" However, if they were suggested by someone you both know, ask that person first if it’s okay to cite them.Keep your letter brief, no longer than a page, so they’re more likely to read it in full. Include your resume so they have more info about you if they would like to know more.

, Wait a week or two after sending your letter so they don’t feel badgered. Give the idea some time to settle in so they are more likely to plan for it and accommodate you. Then follow up by calling them directly and reintroducing yourself.Briefly restate who you are, why you’re excited to find out more about the company, and why your contact seems like a good person to talk to: ""Hi, this is Dan Smith. I wrote about setting up an information interview. I'm really impressed by the steps your library has taken to revitalize itself and would love to talk more about it in person.""
Ask if they would mind meeting with you sometime soon. If they say yes, let them pick the time and place: ""I'll be in town between the 10th and 15th. Are you free to talk anytime then? Great! When? That's up to you. I'll work around your schedule.""
If they say no, ask if you could interview them over the phone at their convenience. ""That's okay, I understand you're busy. Do you think you'd be free at any point to do it over the phone?""
If they still say no, politely thank them for thinking about it anyway. Ask if they would be willing to reconsider in the future, or if they know of anyone who may be willing now: ""Thanks for considering it regardless. If you think you'll have more time in the future, please let me know. In the meantime, could you recommend anyone else that I should try?""Always maintain a positive impression, even if rejected, since you may be conducting other interviews with people they know.

, Start a detailed list of each contact and your progress with them. For each one, include all of their contact info (email, phone number, extension, work address) for easy referral later on. Mark the date that you send your letter so you know when to follow up with a call. Do the same for your initial phone call and any others that follow.Make a note of when you are unable to reach your contact directly as well. Keep track of when you had to leave a voicemail or a message with another person.
Also keep track of snafus, such as emails that may not have been opened because they didn’t recognize the sender. This will help you avoid making the same mistake again if you reach out to the same person later on.
Use this log to track the success of your efforts. In addition to what you learn from interviews later on, referring back to your log when you apply for a job can help you identify which companies were the most eager to talk with you the first time around.

, Familiarize yourself further with both the company and your interviewee before you meet them. Go through their professional website and read any other company literature that you can get your hands on. Search online for any outside news stories or mentions on other websites about their work.Showing an in-depth knowledge about the company from the get-go will demonstrate how serious you are about possibly joining them.
Citing the interviewee’s personal achievements will further indicate how interested you are, as well as flatter them.
Learning as many personal details about the interviewee can help forge a more immediate connection if you’ve gone to the same schools, lived in the same cities, or shared other experiences.

, You’ve exhausted what you can read about them online and elsewhere. Now identify what information you’re lacking about the company or field, the interviewee, and your own chances at employment. Write down what questions you wish to ask about all three subjects. For example:About the company or field: How much growth does it expect in the future? How many positions are currently or typically available at present? How much room for advancement is there in-house?

For the interviewee: What led them to this company and/or field? What is a normal workweek like for them? What steps would they repeat if they had to do it all over, and what do they wish they had done differently?

About your chances: How much prior experience is preferred? What qualifications do you need (such as degrees, licenses, and certification)? If education or training is required, which programs are the most ideal and respected? How well would my current education and background prepare me for this type of work?

, Plan to reintroduce yourself, explain what sort of work you hope to do and why you want to do it, and what you hope to learn from this conversation. This is referred to as an “elevator speech” because it’s supposed to be short (only 30 to 45 seconds), so tailor it to address the key points you want to make.When you introduce yourself, indicate where you’re at in terms of your job search. Are you looking for work right away? Are you graduating in the near future? Are you just starting school with the goal of joining this field a few years from now?
When talking about why you want to join this field, frame yourself to appeal to the company’s main mission. For example, if it’s a non-profit focused on the environment, stress your concern for the environment. If it’s a publisher, focus on your interest in the types of material that they publish.
When laying out what you hope to learn, consider your lists of questions. If you have far more questions about the company’s inner workings, stress that. Of if you have a fairly good idea about how they work, but would like a more personal take, say that you are keen to find out an insider’s view.

, First, plan to arrive early by at least five or ten minutes, or even earlier, to avoid any snafus that might delay you. If you’re looking to apply in the near future, bring a copy of your resume, even if you already sent one with your letter, as well as business cards if you have them. Bring a notebook and pen or pencil, or a device to write notes. Additionally:Have a watch or other timepiece. If the interviewee only has a limited amount of time to offer, this will help you prioritize questions as you run out of the time.
Dress for the occasion. If you are meeting at their workplace, dress professionally, as you would for a job interview. If you are meeting outside of work, like at a cafe, you can tone it down to smart-casual.
If you are meeting at a cafe, restaurant, bar, or similar establishment, plan to pay for your drinks or meal as a thank-you for their time.

, You’re technically the interviewer here, but remember that your contact is also sizing you up as a possible employee. Expect them to ask questions of their own. Think of this as an initial job interview, even though no specific opening is being offered. Prepare answers to likely questions regarding:Your education and field of study.
Your prior experience in this field and/or related fields.
Your goals overall as well as your goals within the company, should you be hired.
Your working knowledge of the aims and workings of their business.

, Write your questions down so you can refer to them if needed, but memorize them beforehand as best you can. Frame the conversation as a casual chitchat, rather than a point-by-point quiz. Know exactly what you want to learn beforehand so you can:Allow the conversation to unroll naturally by recognizing when your contact’s stream-of-conscious ends up answering questions you have yet to ask.
Casually redirect the conversation back to specific points when it veers off into areas you’re already well versed in so you can make the most of your time.

, Keep an eye on the time. As it runs out, review the questions you have yet to ask. Decide which need answering the most so you can address them. If you can’t include all of these, ask your contact if they would mind answering one or two more via email or the phone some time later. Aim to wrap up discussing your prepared questions with a few minutes to spare so you can then:Ask the interviewee what questions you should have asked, but didn’t.
Ask what other positions or fields would also be a good fit, if not better, for someone with your education, interests, and qualifications.
Ask if they know of anyone specific that you should also talk to.
Relax with friendly chitchat for the last couple of minutes so you can part with a more personal farewell, rather than a rushed goodbye.

, First, send a thank-you letter for their time no later than the next day. Show them how helpful they were by mentioning points raised that hadn’t occurred to you before. Next, update your log by transcribing your notes so you have a record of what you learned from whom. Then:Send your contact periodic updates. Refer to your log to remember what specific advice they gave. Inform them of how you’ve applied that advice to your own career plan, even if you ended up finding work with another employer. Then thank them again for setting you on the right path.
Keeping a running dialogue with your past interviewees about your progress can benefit you. By showing your attentiveness during the interview and your initiative afterward, you are more likely to be remembered as a potential candidate should they have any future openings.

Research the person.,
Clarify your objective.,
Prepare questions.,
Prepare some topics for small talk.,
Check your recording equipment (optional).",How to Conduct an In Person Interview1," You should know as much as possible about the person you're interviewing so you go into the interview feeling prepared and in control. Look up as much relevant information about the person as you can, and try to find some recordings of in person interviews with that person if possible. This will help you have a sense of the person's personality and interview style, and to adjust your interview accordingly.;
, Before you prepare your interview questions, you should understand your objective for interviewing the person. Is it simply to give readers more insight into that person's personal life, to discuss one aspect of that person's career, or to discuss that person's perspective on a certain political situation? Whatever your objective, your questions should help you meet your objectives.


If you're very clear about your objective, you'll also be able to keep your interview more focused and to make sure you don't drift off-topic.

, You should prepare questions that are flexible, open-ended, and which all come equipped with at least two or three follow-up questions that you can ask depending on the answer to the original question. Here are a few general rules for preparing questions for an interview:Don't ask any ""yes"" or ""no"" questions or questions that can be answered in just a few words.
Ask questions that allow the person you're interviewing to expand.
Ask just one question at a time. Asking more than one at a time will overwhelm your interviewee.
Ask questions that are relevant to your objectives. This is an important point. You can make them creative as long as they meet your needs.
Don't ask questions that are so broad that your subject doesn't know how to answer them. Your subject should be directed enough to know what type of an answer you're looking for.

, That's right. You should even prepare the small talk you'll be making at the beginning of the interview. Even if you've only decided to talk about the weather or traffic, you should have this prepared in advance so you start the interview off on the right foot and make your subject feel instantly comfortable.If you know something about the hobbies or side-interests of the person you're interviewing, you can casually bring them up. The subject will feel more at ease if he can talk about something that makes him comfortable, especially if it has nothing to do with the interview.

, If you're using a recorder, make sure it works and has fresh batteries before the day of the interview. You don't want your interview to be doomed before it starts.

Set hiring goals.,
Familiarize yourself with the relevant job duties.,
Create a checklist of questions to be asked.,
Remain as unbiased as possible.,
Stop when you get tired.,
Analyse each question before you ask it.,
Read some examples of good interview questions.,
Stay away from bad interview questions.",How to Avoid Asking Bad Interview Questions1," Most recruiters are not clear about their hiring goals. Being a part of the selection team, you must know what the hiring goals are or what is the purpose of hiring?


Recruiters mostly ask irrelevant questions during an interview just because of lack of information. They are themselves not clear about their job. In other words, they do not really know what they should ask to judge candidate skills.






This is why it's so important to set hiring goals before starting the interview process Create a one page document that mentions the things you are looking for in the candidate or the things you won’t compromise upon while making a hiring decision.
For instance, your hiring goal can be to find a marketing manager, aged above 40 having extraordinary communication skills and past experience of serving in a medium or large organization.;
, Another common reason recruiters ask bad interview questions that are totally irrelevant to the job is their lack of knowledge regarding the job posts being filled.


There is no logic checking leadership skills while hiring a sales worker or checking communication skills while hiring an I.T. expert. You should know the job duties for the relevant post so that you may ask questions accordingly.
It is recommended that you read the job description before taking the interview. Create a one page document mentioning the key job responsibilities, then ask questions on the basis of job duties instead of asking random questions

, It is better to create a checklist of all the questions to be asked beforehand in order to avoid asking bad interview questions. If you are new in the recruitment team then this tip is especially for you.


Creating a checklist does not mean that you have to strictly follow it. You may also ask any other question that comes in your mind at the time of taking the interview. The purpose of creating checklist is just to remain focused.
Read the job description and check hiring goals while making checklist, or get a checklist made from an experienced recruiter. Double check the questions to ask to make sure that all of them are relevant to the job.

, It is very important for recruiters to put aside their personal preferences and biases when giving interviews.


Asking confusing, irrelevant and difficult questions from candidate just because he or she is a certain rare, religion or gender is neither logical nor ethical.
Don’t let your personal feelings affect the interview process and educate yourself about possible biases you have to avoid. Set the same standards for everyone irrespective of their age, gender, race, ethnicity etc.

, Many recruitment teams interview hundreds of people in one day from early morning till evening. This is not a good practice as it may affect the hiring decision.


Recruiters are so tired sometimes that they start asking strange questions that are in no way relevant to the job post. You must stop the interview process after you get tired in order to avoid this issue.
Take a short break after conducting every few interviews in order to regain your energy and grab a coffee to stay fresh.

, There are a few questions you must ask yourself about every single question on your list. You will automatically avoid asking bad interview questions after giving answers to following questions:


Does this question provide me with useful and relevant information about the candidate?
Does this question help me in judging the skills and abilities of the candidate?
Is this question worth asking?
Is this question relevant to the job?
Is this question logical and practical?
Is it necessary to ask this question necessary for taking
Is this question ethical and professional?

, Some good interview questions include:


Tell me about any work experience relevant to this current job.
Why did you leave your last job?
Can you work under pressure?
Why do you think you are a perfect fit for this job?
Give three reasons why we should we hire you?

, You should never ask questions such as the following:


Briefly tell me about your family.
What is your current body weight?
Do you plan to start a family?
Have you ever been arrested?
Have you ever taken any drugs?

"
"
Make the interview seem casual.,
Show that you are listening.,
Stay quiet after posing a question.,
Keep the interview subject on topic.,
Keep questions brief and concise.",How to Ask Interview Questions1," To set your respondent at ease, make the interview seem as casual as possible. Beforehand, refer to the interview as an opportunity for you to talk with them (as opposed to interviewing them), which will put less pressure on them as the designated subject. Be friendly and kind, and allow them to see any nervousness you may be feeling as well.Before starting the actual interview, engage your interview subject in casual small talk to break the ice.
Say something like, ""I'm happy that I have the chance to chat with you. I find your work so interesting!"";
, To build the interview subject’s confidence in you, demonstrate that you are listening to them. In between questions, restate the subject’s last response briefly but accurately. Do not reinterpret the answer to summarize it, which will give your interviewee the clear impression that you don't understand them.For instance, if the subject states that their neighbour’s dog startled them, do not summarize by presuming they are scared of dogs in general.

, It is important to give your interview subject the opportunity to speak freely after you ask them a question. If you attempt to control the conversation too much, you run the risk of missing important points or surprising developments. Let your respondent address the question to their satisfaction before talking again., If your interview subject goes off topic, let them finish without interrupting. Gently guide them back to the context of your original question. Be polite and respectful to avoid seeming critical or uninterested. For example, if you are interviewing a city councillor about the safety of local playground equipment and they end up talking about other city developments, guide them back by saying something like, “It’s wonderful to hear about these new developments, but I am eager to hear what you have to say about the issue of playground safety in the city.”

, Avoid writing questions that are too detailed or lengthy, as they may overwhelm your interview subject. Break longer questions up into smaller, simpler questions that are more conducive to a dialogue. Similarly, avoid two part questions, as the answers to the two parts may be different and result in a confusing response.For instance, instead of writing the question, “Have your health and family life been good recently?”, write, “How is your health?” and then, “How are things with your family?” as a separate question.

"
Before you extend an offer, determine your absolute limits and where some less costly ""perks"" might come in.,
Another way to ascertain if you can deliver a competitive offer is to see what the other guys are presenting.,
Be smart.,
Deliver the offer you think it appropriate, fair and generous in writing and in person.,
Highlight corporate benefits.,
Anticipate your applicant’s response to your offer.,
Be flexible but also be honest.",How to Negotiate a Job Offer if You Are the Employer," By limits, this means the resources beyond which you can't go, no matter how amazing the candidate. Don’t promise the moon and the stars to a great candidate if you can’t deliver. Break down your offer in terms of salary, benefits, vacation and additional perks. Some ideas beyond the normal salary include:


Don't forget to make use of perks that don't cost you much but that still gain a great deal for both you and the employee-to-be. For example, throwing into the agreement that the employee can choose 5 at-home working days will still see the work getting done,has the employee whooping for joy and hasn't cost you much at all, other than perhaps ensuring secure and effective at-home computer and internet access.
Add in an additional week off over the Christmas period or any other period where work dies down. Try to use a time when there are two public holidays in the same week if possible, and this ""extra week"" will only cost you three days more and you get a happy employee with an additional week off!
Consider the possibility of a signing bonus, annual performance bonuses and shares in the company that accrue at various longevity/performance milestones.
If you have the wherewithal to provide a car, consider fuel and maintenance costs and upgrading for performance as other perks.
If there is a move involved, consider ways to keep down the costs, including whether the candidate would be happy to forgo this assistance.
Make sure that all perquisites added are legal and appropriate.;
, If you work in an industry where business is transparent, contact other human resources professionals to ask what they’ve offered candidates to fill a similar position and to evaluate your offer. However, if you can’t get the information directly from others, conduct independent research on salary and benefits to determine if you are within range. Sites like Monster or Salary.com offer resources that can help.


Sometimes a candid call to another boss in your industry can get a direct answer on salary ranges. However, some bosses may be cagey out of fear you're out to poach their best! Only ask for range estimates, not for specifics of anyone they employ in particular.

, Keep room for negotiation within the initial salary offer price. In one survey, 100 percent of the companies said that it was reasonable for a job candidate to negotiate for more compensation and at least 90 percent of them had already accounted for this expectation in their initial offer.In other words, don't offer the candidate the uppermost amount you have available, or the negotiations will be harder and you risk losing the candidate because they'll see you as being stubborn or inflexible (which could mean they also interpret that working with your company will raise the same issues).


Naturally, the benefit to you of taking this approach is that if the employee fails to negotiate higher but is happy to take the job at the first salary offered, you've saved money.

, A written offer is important so that there is no misunderstanding caused by lost elements promised over the phone or face-to-face (which the employee will sure remember but you probably won't). And be sure that you present your written offer in person. That way you can review the offer with applicant and answer any questions on the spot. Make it a comfortable situation; offer to ""pop out"" for 10 minutes while they read through it, then return with a coffee to discuss.


In addition to the offer itself, detail the job responsibilities and expectations so that there’s no confusion.
Never imply more than you can or plan to deliver by saying, for example “You’ll always have a job at our company.”

, Although salary may be what most candidates are gunning for, stress the value of your benefits package, especially health insurance, profit sharing, bonuses or any amenities such as retirement or tuition reimbursement and any additional vacation allowances. Additionally, discuss the candidate’s future at the company and room for advancement. A qualified candidate may compare your offer to another but see that he or she has more room to grow with you, plus may like the stock option and bonus program you offer.


Open the discussion on how the role might grow over time. Let the employee-to-be explore any questions they might have on this.

, Prepare yourself for typical and atypical questions to your offer. Some applicants are crafty negotiators, so you will need to stand strong and stand by your offer; this could also be a time that you see something in the potential employee that you really like or don't like! And although it’s fine to let the candidate know you're interested in him or her, avoid coming across as desperate by trying to meet every demand or revision to your offer. If you walk into negotiations with the best possible offer, let the candidate know this is the best you can do, but that you think he or she will make a wonderful addition to the company. It is definitely give and take on both sides to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.



Suggested response where a candidate angles for more compensation: ""I understand how you perceive your qualifications. However, given our experience of people in the industry at your level of experience and with the qualifications that you have, the amount that we have offered you is very generous. We think it is a fair offer and we also think that you have a fantastic opportunity to grow here and learn a great deal."" Or, if you want to mull it over, ask what they consider to be reasonable compensation and say that you'll think it over and get back to them. You can pick and choose through their counter-demand if that suits best.

Suggested response where the candidate wants even more time to think: ""Thanks for explaining that you'd like more time Dave. However, we've already given you a week to consider the position and we do need to fill it and get the work started. I would be happy to give you another 48 hours to think it through but after that, I really must have a final response. We'd love to have you join us here, but you must feel it's the right decision.""


Suggested response where the candidate seems to be holding back for an unknown reason: ""Well Jane, you know that we got along really well during the interviews and we'd love for you to work with us; I think your contributions to this organization could take us to new heights."" Be considerate and avoid being too pushy, although it's fine to make it clear that indecision time is finite. In some cases, you may never get to the bottom of an indecisive candidate; it could be anything from cold feet at leaving a current job to just finding out a diagnosis of cancer. Don't probe too much, just be ready to enforce a deadline and work down the list.

Suggested response where the candidate comes back with a counter-offer due to another company's offer to employ them: In this case, you need to make a snap decision as to how much you want to fight for the candidate. Return to the limits of what you can offer; have you reached these or not yet? If so, refocus on the perks and supportive environment, to contrast your workplace with the other one. However, beyond this, if you don't have more compensation to pull out of the hat, it is probably the best to say that you're sad to lose them to a good competitor and that you know the other company is gaining a great person.

, There will be a limit to how far you can go and the potential employee should respect this. Be prepared to listen to their preferences and to see if it is possible to compromise on some extra compensation. However, once you have shifted a little and as far as you're willing to go, assert your end point with clarity. There comes a time when the employee-to-be needs to understand that they're not able to get anything more and a decision must be made.


For example: ""Thanks for your explanation about how you perceive compensation for this role. We did go back and look at the figures. We've found that we can offer an additional $2,000 signing bonus, X company shares if you're with us still in 3 years time and a corner office. I'd love for you to join us but that is as far as we're able to go beyond our original offer and I think it's very reasonable. I hope it works for you, and I'm happy to wait another 24 hours but after that, I really do need your final response.""

"
Introduce yourself.,
Make the person comfortable.,
Ask your questions.,
Listen intently.,
Stay quiet.,
Let the person be natural.,
Stay focused.,
Stay in control.",How to Conduct an In Person Interview2," Have warm and open body language as you shake hands with the person and introduce yourself. Tell the person a bit about yourself and show that you're just a regular person instead of an intimidating interviewer. Tell the person whatever will help him understand who you are and why you're conducting the interview.


After you introduce yourself, you can say a bit about how the interview will go -- say how long it will be, if there will be time for more casual conversation at the end, or anything else the subject will need to know beforehand.

, This is the most important thing you can do before you officially give the interview. After you've introduced yourself, you can make the person comfortable with some small talk, some light jokes, and by making eye contact and using your hands to gesture or keeping them at your sides. Keep your body open and posed toward that person without invading his personal space.


Before you even start the interview, thank the person for taking the time to meet with you.
If you're at the person's home or office, look around the room for some objects, such as paintings, photographs, or souvenirs that are displayed. The person put them up because he's proud of them, so ask some basic questions to make the person open up.
If the person is meeting you in your home or office or even a coffee shop, make sure the environment is comfortable by providing comfortable seating, relative privacy, and some tea, coffee, or snacks if you can. Make the person feel at home.

, Maintain eye contact as you ask the question and listen intently to the answer. Don't say, ""My first question is..."" or ""My next question is..."" Make the person feel like you're just having a natural conversation, not firing questions at him like a detective.

, Don't say ""Uh huh,"" every two seconds in an exaggerated manner. Just nod intently from time to time and really focus on what the person is saying at that moment instead of thinking about his previous response or about the next question. If your mind wanders, the person you're interviewing will be able to tell right away.Pick up on important words or phrases that the person says. If they trigger something, you may be able to ask a completely new question that you hadn't planned on.
Listening intently will also make it easier for you to notice when the person is veering off track.
If you don't understand something the person says, don't be afraid to ask. Getting back on track is better than having a potential miscommunication.

, Don't dominate the conversation. While occasionally interjecting relevant personal information can make the person feel more comfortable, you should only talk 10-20% of the time. After your all, your goal is to interview the person, not to talk about yourself as much as you can.


You should also be comfortable with some pauses or moments of silence. Let the person think for a minute before you jump in with more talk.

, Wait out the person's nervousness and canned phrases and keep digging until you get the person to open up and say something informative and maybe even surprising. Remember that you want to walk away from the interview with information that you didn't already know and a new insight into that person's character or ideas.If the person just isn't giving you a real answer, keep rephrasing the question or find a new mode of attack until you start to seeing the person being honest and forthcoming.

, Remember your original questions and your list of questions. Though your questions shouldn't be read like a shopping list and you can ask similar questions based on how the interview is going, you should always meet your objectives. If you notice that the person is drifting off and completely avoiding your real questions -- whether it's intentional or not -- you'll need to veer the person back on track.


If the person doesn't respond much to a question, you can rephrase it a bit by saying, ""Can you think of another example to illustrate what you mean?""

, Though the person should do most of the talking, don't let him take over your interview. Make sure that you're still in the position of asking questions and directing the conversation without being obvious about it. If the person is talking so much that you can't ask your questions, or even asking you questions instead, you should politely but firmly steer the person in the right direction.


Remember to keep things professional. Don't get angry if the person is gaining control of the interview; just be calm and collected and you'll be more likely to get things back in control than if you're visibly upset.

Wrap up the interview professionally.,
Thank the person.,
Follow up with a thank-you note (optional).",How to Conduct an In Person Interview3," Don't say, ""Well, I've run out of questions for you"" or ""I guess that's it..."" This will make things feel awkward and like you couldn't hold up a stimulating conversation. Instead, say, ""We've covered quite a bit in this conversation. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to chat about?"" This makes the person feel like you were in the conversation together, instead of just in a question-and-answer situation., You should sincerely thank the person for taking the time to chat with you and for being so patient and answering your questions. Make sure your words and body language indicate that you really mean it and are truly grateful for the person's time and efforts. Don't become withdrawn the second the interview is over. Instead, continue to be warm and welcoming even after you've put your recorder or notebook away.

, You can also send the person a thank-you card or email depending on your relationship with the person. This will make the person feel that his efforts were truly appreciated.

Understand the importance of asking good questions.,
Identify the possible reasons for not asking any question.,
Know the benefits of asking the right questions.,
Avoid asking about possible promotions.,
Don't ask any questions about salary.,
Stay away from questions about flextime and telecommuting.,
Don't ask obvious questions about the company.,
Avoid asking any questions that give away poor listening skills.,
Follow some tips for asking the right questions.",How to Avoid Asking Bad Interview Questions2," As a smart candidate, you should be able to make the best out of the opportunities the interviewer presents and build an insight about the company and whether the job is the right one for you.


Therefore, the questions that you ask must be intelligent, well-thought out and pertinent. Your questions should demonstrate your attitude, your interest in the job or company as well as your work ethic.
When you ask the wrong questions, you stand the risk of being judged as the wrong fit for the job. When you do not ask any questions, the interviewer may form an opinion that you are not interested in the job.

, There may be a valid reason why a candidate does not ask a question when they are given this opportunity by the interviewer. However, you should still try to avoid or overcome these reasons:


You're caught off guard by the request for questions.
You feel like you already have the information you need.
You're afraid to seem like a nuisance.

, The questions that you ask during an interview process can affect you positively. Some of the key benefits that you derive from asking the right questions during an interview are:


You can find out whether this is the right company for you or not.
When you ask smart questions the interviewers know that you have prepared for the job and are serious about taking it up.
It shows off your ability to sell your skills.
The right questions not only talk about your abilities but also help you direct the interview towards the areas you are happy about..

, This can be an instant put off. Remember promotions are a dynamic situation, and there will need to be a lot of effort on your part to make them happen.


It is not the amount of time you spend in a certain job that will determine your career progression, but rather how well you can handle your current responsibilities and show your potential for handling bigger responsibilities will determine your career progression in any organization.
Therefore rather than asking when you will be promoted, the question can be rephrased to ask about what qualities you will need to display to achieve this.

, Another area that is best avoided is the question of salary. This often disappoints the interviewer.


This topic is best avoided in the initial rounds of interviews, and you should focus more on convincing the interviewer about your suitability to the role.
Along with the salary levels for the role, avoid the temptation to ask about salary raises at this stage, as this can be a touchy topic, especially depending on the financial status of the company.

, These two areas are also best avoided during an interview as they tell the interviewer about your eagerness to get out of the office before you’ve even stepped in.


The interviewer may wonder if you are interested in the job at all. Therefore save it for some appropriate time later on.

, It’s best not to ask about any generic business information that you could easily have found on the internet or on the company’s website. This suggests that you did not bother to find out about the company, which shows lack of interest.

, Be attentive during the interview so that you do not miss out on any important facts that are discussed. If you end up asking questions that might have already been discussed, shows disinterest and can prove catastrophic.

, You can keep your questions on the right track by adhering to the following tips:



Know that open-ended questions are the best: These begin with ‘how,’ ‘when’ and who’ and give opportunities for meaningful conversation.

Avoid confrontational questions: Any question that starts with why may sound like a challenge or confrontation and can put the interviewer in defensive mode. It is a good idea to rephrase the question to ""how"".

Avoid long and confusing questions: When there are too many points to a question, you may lose the essence.

Avoid obvious questions: Do not ask for information that is readily available in the public domain, these will not show you in a good light and will highlight your lack of preparation.

Avoid manipulative or leading questions: These questions can make the interviewer feel cornered and give a bad impression.

Ask all candidates the same questions.,
Avoid asking illegal interview questions.,
Write some open-ended questions.,
Don’t accept “yes” or “no” answers.,
Ease into the more difficult questions.",How to Ask Interview Questions2," When conducting job interviews, it is important to maintain fairness and create an even playing field by asking all candidates the same questions. Write a list of essential questions to ask each candidate and follow this guide during each interview you conduct. To ensure that you evaluate all candidates within the same parameters, ask the interview questions in the same order each time and give each interviewee ample time to answer thoughtfully., Before writing job interview questions, take note of the things that you are legally prohibited from asking potential employees. As a general rule, personal questions are inappropriate during an interview. Be sure to avoid any inquiries about:Age
Gender identity
Sexual orientation
Race or ethnic origin
Disabilities
Marital status

, While an interview will unavoidably require some specific, detailed questions, asking open-ended questions is a great way to broaden the conversation. Open-ended questions can yield interesting, unexpected responses and buzz-worthy quotes. For instance, you might get a variety of responses to a question like, “where do you see yourself in five years?”, If your interview subject answers a question with a simple “yes” or “no”, politely ask them to elaborate. One word responses offer very little to the interview and can dull the momentum of the conversation. Ask something simple, such as, “would you mind elaborating on that?” to prompt a more informative answer., To ease your interview subject into opening up, start with simple, straightforward questions and work up to more detail-oriented questions. Answering easier questions first will allow your interviewee to get into a rhythm of speaking, which should lead them to feel less nervous than at the start of the discussion. Start with questions about the present (e.g. “how are you enjoying the summer?”) before asking questions about the past or future, which will likely require more thought and reflection."
"
Do research beforehand.,
Find what has been overlooked.,
Record the interview.,
Take detailed notes.",How to Ask Interview Questions3," To be well-informed during your interview, learn as much as you can about your interview subject and the topic you will be discussing before speaking with them. While the internet can be a quick way to get information, be sure that your sources are credible. Double check information with several sources, or refer to peer-reviewed, academic sources (e.g. scholarly journals)., If you are interviewing a public figure who has conducted other interviews, refer to those discussions and look for a missing link in the narrative. While other interviewers may opt to ask the same, buzz-worthy questions and yield the same results, you can conduct an original interview by asking about something they’ve overlooked.For instance, while other reporters may be asking a local sports hero about their winning streak, you can shift the focus by asking them about their participation in local community organizations.

, Having a recording of your interview will vastly improve your chances of accurately representing the discussion later on. Record the interview on your smart phone, or using a simple tape recorder. Note that you must ask your interview subject’s permission before recording any conversation you have with them., Whether or not you are recording your interview electronically, take notes about other details of the conversation. These may include distinguishing features of the interviewee, things that were happening in the background during the interview, or notable emotional reactions to certain questions. If you can’t record these details during the interview, write them down immediately following it while the experience is still fresh in your mind.For instance, note that the cafe that you conducted the interview in was particularly crowded that day, and that your interview subject teared up when asked about their parents.

Keep away from prissy people who condemn us to age-appropriate behavior.,
Keep hip.,
Stay informed.,
Keep exercising.,
Check the kids' attitudes at the door with the coats.,
Boogie with the best of them.,
Skip generations.,
Travel.",How to Stay Young at Heart," Some people are born old. You can see it in their eyes. They tut tut everything and they act superior all the time. It is best to keep away from such people because they will inform you of such things as ""grow up"", ""that is beneath me"", ""how childish"" and ""that is so very immature"". You may have heard a 10 year old or a 60 year old say these things - it matters not - both of them are old at heart.;
, It is possible to dress young and not be accused of being mutton dressed up as lamb. Don't wear a bikini if you have flab spilling out over the bikini bottom, whatever your age - 10 or 70. But if you're 70 with an enviable body, why shouldn't you flaunt it? Ask the 18 year old splutterer just what his problem is - you're not asking him on a date after all. If you have great legs at 70 - you have great legs. So be it.

, Listen to the radio, watch the news and read the papers. Use the Internet as an information tool. Stay up there with the trends, the news items and the facts. And be a source of reasoned wisdom when the young-in-age folks get panicked and outraged by ridiculous media hype. You've already lived through it all and know better. Help them to see that too.

, Yes, you keep being told this every day of your life from the day you're born. There's a reason for that - it works. It keeps your bones in shape, your tush in shape and your muscles flexible. It means that as you get older, you can still bend over without having to ask somebody else to pull you back up. Seriously. Just do it. The great thing about getting older is that you have a much better understanding of which exercise works best for you. Just because someone swears by aerobics does not mean it works for your needs - keep trialling different exercise techniques and settle on those that make you feel good, alive and supple. And then stick with it. Become an instructor for other young-at-heart people if you get really enthused. After all, why not?

, Kids get embarrassed by parents from about the age of 10 - until about age 99. It's a human curse thing that comes with being a parent. So the sooner you get over it, the better. The great thing is that they'll get their turn at knowing how it feels when their kids do it to them and on and on ad infinitum. What you do need to do is to tell them that you'd appreciate support for your young views on life and not criticism and that they can leave their ageist attitudes at your front door. If not, they're definitely not welcome to your marathon yoga session nor your great alcohol-infused tea parties. You've got better things to do than to be upbraided by their bizarrely placed morals.

, Who says you can't stay trendy and still listen to the classics. Beethoven's a classic; Shakira will probably be one some day too. The key is to have broad music tastes and keep them all guessing. Anyone who listens to only one music genre is a dead bore, whatever their age, so having varied tastes keeps the ""trying-to-be-hip"" critics right off your case.

, We tend to embarrass our children. Grandchildren are another case. They like hip grandparents in the main. It sets them apart from the kids with old fuddy-duddies for grandparents and it sure beats the dull parents who can't get with the funky grandparents! Seek them out as allies. They'll be very willing to keep you in touch with youth culture and help decipher the ins and outs for your curious mind.

, Never stop traveling. It is the key to a healthy mind, an open heart and makes up for all those years you went without travel to save money. Make sure to have the right medication on hand and know where the escape routes are if needed. But, provided you're healthy on the whole, traveling as a young-at-heart person is no less worrying than a young-of-age person and certainly a lot safer than someone wearing next-to-nothing and getting drunk at Ibiza in the hope nothing bad will happen. Keep your wits about you as any traveler is meant to and you'll be fine. And write your travels up - in a diary, a blog, even a book. That will serve as inspiration for others and is a great reminder for you and your family.

Determine the venue of your career resource center.,
Compile career resources for others to access in your career resource center library.,
Develop programming.,
Network with other organizations.,
Incorporate one-on-one interaction.,
Establish a web presence.",How to Develop a Career Resource Center," Resource centers can be available as an entire organization dedicated to assisting people with career and educational choices. Or, they can be smaller settings within organizations like businesses, colleges, and employment centers.


The location will influence the type and amount of resources you are able to provide, as well as the clients you will typically serve.;
, Career resources include articles, books, and other resources about searching for a job, career planning, setting and achieving career goals, and writing resumes. Start with foundational resources and build your library up from there. Focus on resources for your target audience.


In a college or university setting, career centers should focus on resources that will help students identify a career to pursue, get the education or training they need to get that job, and then develop the skills they need to get hired.
In a business setting, career resource centers can point to opportunities for further education and training. For example, personal growth classes, self-study programs, and GED, advanced certifications, and other degree programs.
In an employment center, resource centers may help adults transition between one career to another. This may be a voluntary transition or a forced one. Either way, resources that help adults make that switch will help them identify life goals, find educational opportunities that fit their lifestyle and personality, and locate potential jobs in their new field.

, Workshops and classes offer groups of people to learn in a cost-effective way, which is important for someone looking for a job. Teach basic resume writing skills in a group setting, introducing different industries to consider entering, and offering interview tips.


Tailor these workshops to things specific to your local community. For example, if your town hosts one or two major industries, offer classes or workshops that give individuals an inside look at what these industries do, how many employees are involved, and what those employees do.
Schedule these with other events in mind. For example, if there is a job fair every spring, help your clients prepare by teaching a series of workshops on resume writing and interview skills. Use examples specific to the job fair environment.

, It is important for career centers to build and maintain positive relationships with other businesses and organizations, both on a local and national level. By maintaining these relationships, you will be able to quickly and confidently connect your clients with someone who can help them in their specific need.


Partner with local businesses that hire frequently or in large numbers.
Be familiar with national agencies that provide a wide range of resources your career center may not be able to offer.
Connect with counseling centers that can provide career counseling.
Have contacts with colleges and universities that offer training programs designed for specific industries.

, Though some individuals may be able to navigate through a career resource center alone, many others are seeking the advice and guidance of a more knowledgeable individual. They need someone to point them toward resources they have not been able to find on their own, help them interpret their self-assessment results, or develop their career goals.


One-on-one writing sessions allow clients to talk to a staff member about their resume and what they can do to improve it.
Practice interviews help clients prepare for the real interview in a way that a workshop on interview skills cannot.
Career counseling provides clients with the opportunity to explore different passions and job opportunities related to those passions.

, This will help you reach out to people in your community before they even enter your career center. It will also provide extra resources and support while clients are at home or seeking a different job on their own.


Create a website for your career resource center. Provide basic information about your career resource center, such as address, business hours, staff members, and contact information. Explain what your center can do to help people find a job or develop specific skills.
Use social media and blogs. These provide a more informal way to connect with clients and potential clients. It also offers you an opportunity to share general job-searching tips, announce upcoming workshops or classes, and see what people are talking about as it relates to careers.
Offer an online chat system if you have the staff to support it. This allows shy individuals or those without transportation to talk with staff members and get their questions answered.

Read a lot of Chicken Soup for the Soul - they have so many good stories about kids and getting the right attitude.,
Remember that it's ALL about your attitude!

,
Every time you feel sad, smile.,
Spend time with little kids.,
Really, you just need to MAKE yourself happy.,
Think back on a time when you were a kid.,
Don't be mean to kids.,
If you are a kid, and yet you are reading this article, take a piece of paper and write ""In 15 years I am going to be doing <--insert whatever you think you will be doing in 15 years-->"".,
Look at your childhood photos.,
Live in the present.",How to Look at Life the Way You Did As a Kid," Also try reading children's literature, such as the Winnie-the-Pooh series by A. A. Milne, and The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. Read anything by Dr. Seuss!;
,, Even if you don't feel like smiling, do it. If you can, be silly - jump up and down, or spin around and around until you feel sick. Act like a kid! But whatever you do, even if there isn't anyone around, SMILE! This can help cheer you up even in the worst of moods. (However, it is also important to keep in mind that young children always honour their emotions - don't force yourself to feel something you truly do not.)

, Even though you won't ever be one again, spending time with them can make you smile more. If you have children of your own, great! Spend lots of time with them. If you have relatives, friends, or neighbors with kids, offer to babysit or take care of their children when needed. If you don't know anyone with kids, try volunteering with an organization like Big Brothers Big Sisters - the experience will be rewarding for both you and the child!

, When you are sad, decide that you're going to be happy.

, Then, try to remember how old your parents were. If you're not as old as they were when you were 8, then, for a second, you will get the feeling that you are 8 again and that's how your parents felt when you were that age (even if they didn't, you still will get the feeling and memory of that time).

, Try to be very nice to them. Do not spoil them too much, though. Just bring them joy and let them love you.

, Then, seal the letter in envelope and put it somewhere you won't forget. Open it up in 5 years. Write down what has changed, but don't erase the old sentence. Seal it again and repeat this every 5 years until 15 years have elapsed. Then, look at very first thing that you wrote down. This will make you feel like a kid again. Try to do (for at least one day) whatever you estimated you would be doing.

, Try to remember what you were doing when the photo was taken. Then, visit your childhood friends and talk about photos with them.

, You probably can't completely ignore the future as that seems to be part of growing up, but at least for a few minutes or hours, live completely in the now.

Try to jog, walk, swim, or do other physical (aerobic) activities for 150 to 75 minutes per week; focus on the low end of that if you exercise more vigorously and on the high end if you exercise less vigorously. Aim for two strength-training sessions, such as weight lifting, a week.It may seem like a lot, but 150 minutes a week is really only 30 minutes five days a week. You can break up those 30 minutes into 10-minute intervals, which makes it even easier to stay active.

, Drinking too much can give you serious health problems that will make you look and feel old. Excessive drinking can cause cancers of the digestive tract, heart problems, strokes, high blood pressure, and liver disease.If you do drink, you shouldn't drink more than one drink per day as a woman or a man over 65. Men under 65 can drink up two drinks per day., Smoking will age your skin, reduce your stamina, and give you serious health problems. Smoking can cause a number of diseases and make you look older.Smoking can contribute or cause lung diseases, heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, eye disorders like cataracts, respiratory infections, gum diseases, and various cancers (from cancer of the esophagus to cancer of the mouth, lungs, bladder, throat, or kidneys).Even if you’ve smoked for many years, quitting will still improve your health, let your body heal, and make you look and feel younger.

, Tanning, whether from natural sunlight or from a tanning bed, exposes you to ultraviolet radiation which damages your skin.Avoid wrinkles, sun damage, and skin cancer by using sunscreen when you are exposed to strong sunlight.
Spray tans have chemicals that shouldn’t be inhaledand tanning pills have chemicals that can turn cause hives, liver damage, and vision problems.If you get a spray tan, make sure you hold your breath and close your eyes, and make sure the facility is well-ventilated. You can also try using a self-tanning lotion, which is generally considered safe., Hydration keeps your skin hydrated and helps you stay healthy. It helps flush toxins from your body, helping you look and feel younger.Adults should consume about 16 cups (4 quarts) of fluids thought the day — this includes water from foods, water, and other beverages, like milk, juice, and even coffee."

Keep your body resilient by eating enough protein.,
Give yourself the energy to lead an active lifestyle.,
Keep your youth by eating lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.,
Slow down on fat.,
Maintain a low-salt diet.",How to Look Younger and Feel Better3," Your body needs protein to heal and regenerate damaged or old tissues.Two to three servings of protein rich foods per day should be plenty for the average adult.


1 ounce of meat counts as equivalent to one ounce of protein, but so does a single egg, 1/4 cup of cooked beans, and 1 tablespoon of peanut butter.From age 19 to 30, women should eat 5 1/2 ounce-equivalents of protein per day, while women over age 30 should eat 5 ounce- equivalents of protein per day. Men age 19 to 30 should consume 6 1/2 ounce-equivalents of protein per day; from 31 to 50, men should eat 6 ounce-equivalents, and over 50, you should eat 5 1/2 ounce-equivalents of protein per day., Carbohydrates provide energy for you to get out and move. You should be getting about half of your calories from carbohydrates.Try to choose unprocessed, whole grains over processed carbohydrates. For instance, eat whole-grain pasta, whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, fruits, and vegetables over foods such as white bread, soda, fruit juice, or desserts. Whole grains have more fiber and keep you fuller for longer, as it takes your body longer to process., A healthy diet with fruits and vegetables will provide you with the nutrients you need for an active, on-the-go lifestyle.Try to eat the rainbow, meaning you should vary the color of your fruits and vegetables, as they all have different nutrients. For instance, greens are high in vitamin K, which can help reduce bruising, while red vegetables, such as tomatoes, are high in lycopene, which can help protect your skin from the sun.On a 2,000 calorie diet, you should eat 2 cups of fruit and 2 1/2 cups of vegetables a day.Fruits and vegetables are low in calories and fat, but high in fiber and vitamins. This healthy eating pattern will reduce your risk for getting cancer, heart problems, high blood pressure, strokes, and diabetes.

, As you get older, your metabolism slows down and you want to be careful not to gain too much weight. You should keep your daily intake of fat under 65 grams.Try to pick healthy fats over unhealthy fats. Unhealthy fats include saturated fats (mainly in fatty beef, chicken with the skin still on, and full-fat dairy)and trans fats (mainly in hydrogenated oils and processed foods).Healthier fats include monounsaturated fats (in olive oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, peanut butter, and avocado, to name a few),polyunsaturated fats (in many plant-based oils), and omega-3 fatty acids (mainly in fish).Eating too much fat increases your chances of high cholesterol, heart problems, and strokes. You can reduce your fat consumption by eating lean meats, poultry, fish, and choosing low-fat dairy products., Reducing salt will help you avoid high blood pressure and reduce your chances of heart, liver and kidney conditions. While you need some salt to stay healthy, too much is not good.Adults should consume no more than about a teaspoon of salt per day, which is about 2,300 milligrams of salt per day. If you have a health condition, such as high blood pressure, you need to keep your intake under 1,500 milligrams per day.Read labels, as many products have more salt than you would think. Often, processed foods, such as canned vegetables, lunch meats, frozen foods, and pickles, are high in salt.

Stay mentally resilient by getting enough sleep.,
Dedicate time to relax and recharge.,
Take up new hobbies.,
Stay connected to loved ones.,
Drink your coffee.",How to Look Younger and Feel Better4," Sleep deprivation will make you feel foggy, out of it, and irritable.Therefore, getting enough sleep will help you feel younger. Also, not getting enough sleep can leave you looking dragged-down, so getting your rest will also help you look younger.

You should try to get seven to nine hours of sleep every night., Use a relaxation technique to help you take a mental break from the world around you and reduce the physical toll that stress takes on the body.For instance, you could try deep breathing, yoga, meditation, art or music therapy, or tai chi.


One way to relax through breathing is to try the 4-7-8 method. That is, breathe in for four counts. Hold your breath for seven counts, and then blow out for eight counts. Focus on your breathing as you repeat it over and over until you relax. Make sure to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth., New hobbies will challenge your mind, keeping you engaged in the world. In addition, you may meet people through your hobbies.Keeping yourself interested in the world will keep you happier, and as was noted, happier people look younger.
You can try anything from cooking to woodworking to volunteering at your local soup kitchen. You could even try a sport.Try your local parks and rec department for opportunities available in your area.

, Friends and family will provide you with support, distraction, advice, and help when you need it.Staying involved with friends and family will be a source of emotional fulfillment and keep you happier and engaged.


Try using social media to stay in touch with friends and family who are far away.
If you are not close with your family or don't have family but would like to talk to someone, try calling a Warm Line, which is a peer-run non-crisis hotline.You don't need to be in crisis to call — anyone who wants to talk is welcome to call this toll-free service.You can meed people by going to religious services, meetups, classes, and community events.

, Some studies have shown that drinking coffee can reduce your risk of developing dementia. So go ahead and have a cup or three a day."
"
Decide who will create the template.,
Write a description of your company or organization.,
Prepare job summaries, if relevant.,
Begin with the position title.The specific job title is important because it differentiates one position from another.,
Leave room to specify the department (if relevant).If your company or organization is divided into multiple sections, then a job description should mention which department or other unit that particular position reports to.,
Define the supervisor.You may find it useful to leave a section on your template to be used for detailing the supervision of a particular position, and/or the extent to which it is supervised.,
Provide a job summary section.Think of this as describing the purpose of the position, and its role within your company or organization as a whole.A job summary will briefly acknowledge the fundamentals of the position, so leave space on your job description template to answer:What do you want the job to achieve?,
Create a space to describe essential duties and responsibilities.These might also be called “major functions” or “essential functions.”Whatever you call it, this section of a job description should provide a list of those duties that are associated with the position, no matter who fills it.,
Consider leaving a space for “other” duties.If the exact duties of some positions at your company or organization depend upon the individuals filling them, then you might want to leave a space stating “Other duties may include….” This will give you flexibility to incorporate other duties and responsibilities based on a candidate’s experience or abilities.

,
Create a required skills section.Identifying a particular set of skills that are required to perform in a particular job can help individuals understand if they have the abilities and knowledge to complete its basic duties.Examples of skills include things like “Ability to use spreadsheet software proficiently” and “Effectively manage team of 5-6 interns”
Remember that skills may be “hard” (teachable skills, such as working with a particular tool, knowledge of a specific software program, or the ability to create a certain type of document or object) or “soft” (often called “people skills,” these refer to your ability to interact with others and to use emotional intelligence).,
Set aside a space to list required qualifications.The qualifications section of a job description template is used to list any education, specific training, or certification that is require to perform the job.,
Make room to describe any special physical or mental effort the job may require.For instance, you may want a space on your job description template to describe whether or not a particular position requires things like lifting heavy objects, sitting for extended periods, performing repetitive tasks, or traveling.

,
Leave a section to characterize working conditions.For some positions, it is relevant to disclose working conditions.,
Make a space to detail the salary, benefits, or funding.,
Distribute a draft of your template to managers and supervisors.,
Use the template to input a few job descriptions that are already written.,
Save the template.,
Review and update the job description template on a regular basis.",How to Create a Job Description Template," Typically, organizations use their human resources or personnel department to create job description templates. In some cases however, a departmental group, a manager, or another individual (usually the direct supervisor of a position) might be responsible for creating one. In any case, make sure the creator of the template is familiar with the company’s or organization’s needs.;
, This overview will be included with all job descriptions, to give a sense of your workplace. Thus, it can be written ahead of time so that it can be inserted into the template when you prepare it.

, You can use the job description template you use for each position that you advertise by filling in the template with the information that is relevant to that position. However, if you do (or expect to do) a lot of hiring of a particular position, you might make a special template that includes a summary of that job.This will save you some time.


For instance, a school might have a general template for all jobs, as well as a more specialized template for Math teachers, another for English teachers, etc.

, You will want to leave a space at the beginning of your job description template for the position title.


Think about including a job title that is specific enough to differentiate the position, and help individual understand its duties, yet also broad enough to cover all potential duties of the position.
For instance, “Teacher” might be too broad of a job title, while “Mathematics Teacher for Seventh Grade” might actually be too specific if the position might also occasionally need to teach math to sixth- or eighth-graders. Instead, “Middle Grades Mathematics Teacher” might be both specific and broad enough.
Often, the job title is specially formatted (using a bold font, or a larger font size, etc.) in order to draw attention to it.

, When creating a job description template, it is important to leave a place for listing the department, usually near the beginning of the document.

, This can help an individual understand who he or she would report to while performing a particular position, and the role of the position within the hierarchy of a company or organization.


You may also leave a section to discuss the supervisory roles of a particular position (if relevant), if it involves managing other people.Including a section on supervision within a job description can also be a useful record when determining how to handle any conflicts that may arise regarding a particular position.

,
What is its purpose?
What is the primary duty of the person working in this position?

,


List the duties in order of importance, using a bulleted list or other clear formatting.
Keep in mind the following model to effectively write about the essential duties of a job: action word + subject + specific activities.For example, you might list one specific duty of a workplace safety compliance officer as “Prepare monthly safety reports by collecting, verifying, and summarizing workplace safety data.”
You may also wish to include percentages describing the amount of time a position spends doing particular duties.For instance, a job description template for teachers could be used to indicate that perhaps 75% of the position is devoted to teaching duties, 15% to advising students, and 10% to serving on committees.

,, Your job description template may want to reflect this by making a specific place for one, or the other, or both.

,


Qualifications might include: degrees earned; specific number of years of experience doing a particular kind of work; experience using specific equipment, software, etc.; and certifications required by law or other regulations in order to complete the duties of the job.
You may also consider including a space on your template for minimum qualifications as well as desired qualifications.For instance, a particular position may require the knowledge and experience of a bachelor’s degree to perform its essential duties, but your company or organization may prefer that someone working in that position has a master’s degree.

,, For example, some positions require working with or around things like toxic materials, potentially dangerous equipment, excessive noise, or extreme weather. If this is relevant for your workplace (or may be relevant for some positions), include a section for it in your job description template.


If a particular position that you later use the template for does not have any hazardous or otherwise notable working conditions, you can write something like “normal office environment” in this section, or simply delete it from the template.

, If the job description template you are creating will or may be used for advertising open positions and recruiting candidates, you may also decide to include financial information. You may leave a place to identify a particular salary or salary range, a description of benefits available at your institution (whether general or position-specific), and the position’s funding source, if relevant., Anyone who will need to use the template to create job descriptions should have an opportunity to review the template, provide feedback on it, and work together to make any improvements to it., This will help you determine if you left anything out, or need to broaden the template. If you do not already have a job description written out, use the template to practice writing one, then review it together with any relevant managers.

, Keep the template in a place that is easily accessible. If many different people will need to access the template in order to write job descriptions, it needs to be readily available.


For example, put the final template on a company intranet, if you have one. Otherwise, save it in a shared folder or cloud storage.

, As a company or organization changes and grows, its job descriptions will as well. Make a periodic (annual, biennial, etc.) review of the template a calendar item in your human resources and management meetings."

Stay away from cigarettes.",How to Prevent Parkinson's Disease," Having a cup of coffee or can of soda every day may help minimize your risk of developing Parkinson’s. Make sure to stay within recommended daily allowances for caffeine so that you don’t develop other health problems.Choose any beverage with caffeine, as there is no evidence that one type of caffeine is better than others. For example, you could have coffee, tea, cola, or energy drinks. Some foods even have natural caffeine. These include: protein bars, coffee-flavored ice cream or yogurt, and chocolate.Consume less than 400 milligrams of caffeine daily.This is about four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of soda, or two “energy shot” drinks.If you are drinking soda in order to get caffeine, consider limiting how much you drink. Sodas are often packed with sugar and won’t promote good health if you drink them too often.;
, In addition to having coffee or tea, green tea may also prevent Parkinson’s.Green tea has compounds called green tea polyphenols, a type of antioxidant, that may eliminate free radicals in your system.Be sure to read labels when drinking green tea. Some products have caffeine while others don’t. Remember that green tea counts towards your daily hydration totals.

, Eating more peppers—red, green, yellow, and orange—may lower your risk for developing Parkinson’s. Incorporate peppers into daily meals and have them as snacks, both of which may help you stave off Parkinson’s when combined with other dietary and lifestyle choices.Be aware that doctors are still unsure if raw or cooked peppers are better for decreasing your risk. Try having some peppers at each meal and make sure you vary the colors to get the most nutrients. For example, you could have an omelet with peppers at breakfast, a salad with diced peppers for lunch, and stuffed peppers for dinner. Have some pepper strips dipped in hummus or light ranch dressing for a snack.

, In addition to eating peppers, having fresh and raw vegetables at every meal may decrease your Parkinson’s risk. This is because low levels of the B vitamin folate, which is also called folic acid, may increase your risk for the disease.You can easily get folic acid by incorporating lots of vegetables in your diet. Some of the best sources of folate are:


Spinach
Endive
Romaine lettuce
Asparagus
Mustard greens
Collard greens
Okra
Cabbage, Oxidative stress, which is a result of free radicals in the body, may contribute to Parkinson’s. Getting rid of free radicals by eating foods with lots of antioxidants may also help prevent Parkinson’s. Some great sources of antioxidants include:


Artichokes
Kale
Potatoes
Berries
Pears
Apples
Grapes
Eggs
Kidney beans
Lentils
Pecans
Walnuts
Dark chocolate
Red wine
Fava beans, Antioxidants can scavenge free radicals and may reduce your risk of developing Parkinson’s. Eating a healthy and nutritious diet can help you get antioxidants, but consider taking antioxidant supplements to help boost free radical elimination.Take supplements for Vitamins C and E. Consider getting mixed supplement that has multiple forms of Vitamin E to avoid possible side effects of this compound. Another antioxidant that may help is Omega-3 fatty acid.Try Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is also present in foods such as organ meats, sardines, and mackerel.Make sure to stay within recommended daily limits of any antioxidant to avoid toxicity. Reading product labels can alert you not only recommended daily values and how much is in the specific supplement. Ask a pharmacist any questions you might have.

, Eating iron is important to staying healthy, but it’s important to consume it within recommended levels. Too much iron may put your body into oxidative stress, which is when your body releases toxic free radicals into your system. In turn, this can contribute to the degeneration of brain cells that are often found in Parkinson’s patients.Get no more than 8 mg iron daily if you are a man. Women over the age of 51 should also not have more than 8 mg iron every day. Women between the ages of 18 and 50 should have 18 mg iron as a part of their daily diet. For example, one cup of fortified breakfast cereals has 18 mg, 3 ounces of pan fried beef liver has 5mg, and ½ cup of boiled and drained spinach has 3mg., Like iron, too much manganese can lead to oxidative stress, which can contribute to Parkinson’s. Make sure to stay within adequate intake margins of manganese to help prevent Parkinson’s.Recognize that there is no dietary allowance for manganese. Instead, there is adequate intake (AI) use. Eat less than 1.6 mg if you are a man and 2.3 mg if you are a woman. Sources of manganese include nuts, legumes, seeds, teas, whole grains, and leafy green vegetables., One of the common treatments for Parkinson’s is physical activity. Regular physical activity or exercise may minimize your risk for developing the disease by about 30%. This may be especially true for people in their 30s and 40s, which is decades before Parkinson’s often develops. Try and get some type of physical activity most days of the week to try and reduce your Parkinson’s risk.Do aerobic activity that gets your heart beating faster, which has a protective effect on brain tissue.
Aim for least 75 minutes of vigorous activity or 150 minutes of moderate activity each week. This translates to about 30 minutes five days a week. Do exercises and activities that challenge your body and that you enjoy. Things like hiking, walking, jogging or running, swimming, or biking are great options. Activities like jumping rope or on a trampoline can also get your heart pumping., Exposing yourself to pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides may increase your risk of developing Parkinson’s.These compounds can mimic the same function as Parkinson’s in the brain: they kill neurons in a small part of the brain called the substantia nigra pars compacta.Avoid or limit your exposure to any pesticide as much as you can.


Stay indoors if you are around an area being sprayed with insecticides.

, Like pesticides, petrochemical solvents such as paints and glues may increase your risk for Parkinson’s. Although the evidence isn’t entirely clear on the connection between the two, it’s advisable to steer clear of solvents as much as you possibly can.Check product labels for the names of commonly used solvents including: isopropanol, toluene, xylene, white spirits, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and perchloroethylene.
Make sure your employer uses safe practices if exposure to solvents is a part of your job. If not, contact OSHA at 1-800-321-6742 to file a report and set in motion getting proper protection from solvents.Use low-volatility paints and glues if you can. Make sure any area exposed to solvents is adequately ventilated with open windows and fans.

, A strange fact about Parkinson’s is that people who smoke appear to be less likely to develop the disease; however, this is no reason to start smoking, because the harmful effects of smoking far outweigh any benefit you might gain against Parkinson’s.Recognize that the link between smoking and a lower risk of Parkinson’s is that tobacco is a nightshade plant. You can incorporate other healthy nightshades into your diet by eating veggies like peppers, cauliflower, eggplant, potatoes, and tomatoes.

Living your life to the fullest is a process that will take you your whole life to develop. Don’t get frustrated if it takes you awhile to learn some things, or if you experience setbacks. This is a natural part of life.;
, Dishonesty saps away energy and happiness. When we aren’t honest with ourselves, we hold ourselves back from learning and growth. When we aren’t honest with others, we damage trust and intimacy.We may be dishonest for a variety of reasons. Research has shown that sometimes we lie because we’re jealous and want to hurt others. Sometimes, we lie because we’re afraid we will be hurt if we reveal the truth, or we’re afraid of a confrontation.It can be hard to be honest, especially with yourself, but doing so will help you live a fuller, richer life.

, All too often, we spend a lot of time looking at what we don’t like about ourselves, what we’d like to change, what we think should be different. Spending all your time focused on what you don’t like or what happened in your past means that you aren’t able to focus on your future. Make a conscious decision to learn to love yourself, just as you are.Make a list of your strengths. What are you good at? These can be lofty achievements, such as inventing a new technology, or “everyday” skills, such as being friendly to others. Paying attention to what your strengths are can help you continue to develop them without focusing on yourself as a “failure.”

, Your core values are the beliefs that shape who you are and how you live your life. They may be spiritual beliefs or simply deeply-held beliefs that are important to you.Reflecting on your values will help you set goals for yourself that are “value-congruent,” meaning in line with your values.You are more likely to feel fulfilled and happy when you’re living in accordance with your values.


Stand up for what you believe in and don’t let others push you around. It's possible to do this and still be open to other people's ideas, as they may surprise you.

, Sometimes, society confounds self-criticism with helping yourself improve. However, much research shows that the more hostile and critical you are of yourself, the more likely you are to be the same way toward others. Negative self-talk and self-criticism don’t help you become a better person or achieve your goals.Try self-kindness and self-compassion instead.


For example, if you find yourself consistently telling yourself what is wrong with you or what you don’t like about yourself, be purposeful and challenge those thoughts with positive ones. Replace thoughts like “I’m such a loser” with “That situation didn’t go exactly the way I’d planned. I’ll go back to the drawing board and think of another way to approach it.”
Try to think logically about your self-criticisms. Criticizing ourselves can be all too easy. The next time you notice yourself being harsh, try to find a rational response to that criticism. For example, if you found yourself thinking “I’m so dumb, I don’t know anything in this class and everyone’s smarter than I am,” examine that thought logically. Is everyone really smarter than you, or are some individuals just more prepared for the material than others? Is your performance in the class related to your intellect (not likely) or is it because you may not have the preparation you needed to excel? Are you studying effectively? Would you benefit from a tutor? Breaking things down in this logical manner can help you figure out steps to take to help yourself improve without writing yourself off.

, One of the reasons we become frustrated is that we expect things to stay the same. However, life is full of change. Open yourself to the processes of change and growth, and learn to adapt to the new situations and challenges that happen.Fostering positive emotions, such as happiness and optimism, will help you develop flexibility.Look for patterns in how you respond to events and situations. Determine what’s helpful and what isn’t. This can help you learn to modify the responses that aren’t helpful and learn to be more adaptive. Not only will you feel better yourself, you will also be able to better interact with others.Learn to look at “negative” events as learning experiences instead. Looking at setbacks or situations that appear as negative as “failures” can lead you to obsess over them, rather than learn and grow from them. Rather than seeing a challenge or roadblock as a negative, see it as a positive space for learning and improvement.
For example, famous entrepreneur Steve Jobs said that “getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.”J.K. Rowling, the author of the phenomenally successful Harry Potter series, has said that she sees failure as incredibly beneficial, something to be valued rather than feared., Part of living life to the fullest is taking care of your body. You only get one; make sure it’s able to carry you through your life of adventure and learning.


Eat a healthy diet. Avoid foods that are high in sugar and empty calories. Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, and lean proteins. Don’t deprive yourself, though; it’s perfectly healthy to have a slice of cake or a glass of wine from time to time.Stay hydrated. Men should drink about 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids per day. Women should drink about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day.Get exercise. Studies have shown that regular exercise helps you feel healthier, happier, and more positive. Aim for about 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise every week., Learning mindfulness can help you live your life to the fullest by keeping your focus on what is happening in the present moment. Mindfulness is rooted in Buddhist traditions and avoids judgment of your experiences; instead, it encourages you to accept them just as they are.You can’t live your life to the fullest if you’re constantly absorbed by what happened in the past or what might happen in the future. Learning to be mindful of what is going on right now will help you worry less about what has already happened or what may happen.
There are many ways to learn mindfulness, including mindfulness meditation and spiritual study.Exercises such as yoga and Tai Chi incorporate mindfulness into their practice.
Some of the many benefits of mindfulness include: improved physical and mental health, lower stress, better interactions with others, and a greater sense of overall well-being., This is a term coined by the psychologist Clayton Barbeau. It refers to humans’ tendency to tell ourselves that we “have to” do something, even if it doesn’t fit with our goals or values.“Should” statements can cause a lot of dissatisfaction and grief. Eliminating them from your life can help you live more fully.For example, consider this “should” statement: “I should lose more weight.” Why do you feel that way? Is it because you have a fitness goal that you want to achieve for yourself? Because you’ve consulted with your doctor and agreed that you need to get healthier? Or is it because someone has told you “should” look a certain way? The same goal can be healthy and helpful or harmful, all depending on why you feel like you need to achieve it.
Deciding not to “should” yourself doesn’t mean you don’t set goals. Instead, it means that you set goals for yourself based on what is meaningful to you, not what others want for you or demand of you.

, Research has consistently shown that people need to push themselves beyond their comfort zones to perform at their best.This is called embracing “optimal anxiety.” It turns out that the more you’re willing to challenge yourself, the more comfortable you will become with new experiences.It can be terrifying to take risks, because we’re generally not comfortable with the idea of failure. Most people are afraid of risk in the short-term. However, people who don’t take risks and push themselves are more likely to regret not doing so later in life.Getting out of your comfort zone occasionally can also help you develop the flexibility you need to deal with life’s unexpected roadblocks.Start small and work your way up. Go to a restaurant without checking it out on Yelp first. Take an impromptu roadtrip with a loved one. Try something at work that you haven’t done before.

, Set attainable goals according to your abilities and talents. Consider each effort to be an attainment. Achieve one step before the other towards stability and security.Set goals that are meaningful to you, and don’t compare them to anyone else’s. If a personally meaningful goal is to learn to play your favorite song on the guitar, don’t feel bad if you don’t become a rockstar guitarist.
Keep your goals performance-based. Achieving your goals takes hard work, dedication, and motivation. However, you need to make sure that you can achieve your goals through your effort -- remember, you can’t control anyone else.For example, “Become a movie star” is a goal that relies on others’ actions (casting agents have to cast you, people have to go to your movies, etc.). However, “Audition for as many movies as I can” is achievable because you control that action. Even if you never get a part, you can view your goal as a success, because you accomplished what you set out to do, which was work for what you want.

, When you live life to the fullest, you take chances. You go after what you want. You make decisions that have consequences. And sometimes, these things don’t go the way you’d hoped. Embracing vulnerability, the possibility that things will go differently than we had planned, is crucial to experiencing life in a full, open, honest way.Vulnerability helps you take actions in all areas of your life. If you’re afraid of being open and honest with another person because you might get hurt, you won’t be able to develop a truly intimate relationship. If you’re afraid of taking a chance because it might not work out, you may miss out on opportunities.
For example, consider the example of Myshkin Ingawale, an inventor who wanted to develop technology to help the child death rate in rural India. Ingawale frequently talks about how he failed the first 32 times he tried to create this invention. Only on the 33rd time was he finally successful. That willingness to be vulnerable, to accept the possibility of risk and failure, is what allowed him to develop this technology that is now saving lives.

, Don’t be content to let your life just happen. Be active and present in it. Always consider what you can learn from whatever situation you encounter. This will help you avoid stressing over challenges and will keep you focused on moving forward, not looking back.Learning new things also helps keep your brain at the top of its game. When you actively ask questions and investigate experiences, you’re more likely to feel healthy mentally and emotionally., Gratitude isn’t just a feeling; it’s a way of life that requires active practice. Research has shown that practicing gratitude makes you feel healthier, happier, and more positive.Gratitude can help you overcome past trauma and strengthen your relationships with others.Recognize daily the things you are grateful for. Let your family, friends, and other significant ones know how grateful you are to have them. Share and express love while you can. Your life will feel more fulfilling when you actively practice being grateful.


Savor the moment. Humans have a bad tendency to focus on the negative aspects of life and ignore all the beauty and positivity around us. Take the time to acknowledge and savor the small moments of beauty in your everyday life. Think about what this experience means to you. Be mindful of the happiness it is bringing to your life in that moment. Writing these experiences down can be helpful.Even small things, such as an unexpected text from a friend or a beautiful sunny morning, can fill us with gratitude if we let them.
Share your gratitude with others. You’re more likely to “store” positive things in your memory if you share them with other people. If you see a gorgeous flower while you’re riding the bus, text a friend to let her know about it. If your partner did the dishes as a surprise for you, tell him how much you appreciate it. Sharing your gratitude can also help others feel positive and inclined to look for ways to be grateful in their lives., Keeping a journal can help you reflect on your goals and values. It can also help you determine what’s going well in your life and what you’d like to continue to work on. Journaling can also be a great way to practice mindfulness.


Journaling should be active, not simply a recording of your random thoughts and experiences. Rather than just recording every single thing that happened to you, use your journal to reflect on situations you experience. How did you initially react? How did that situation make you feel at first? Do you feel differently now? Would you do anything differently if you encounter a similar situation?, Laughter really is the best medicine. Laughter lowers stress hormones and releases endorphins, your body’s natural mood elevators. It burns calories and sends oxygen to your body, helping you feel more positive and healthy.Laughter is also contagious; when you express joy through laughter, others are likely to share it with you. Laughing together can create emotional and social bonds., Your possessions can end up possessing you. A cluttered house full of things won’t make you happy. Make an active decision to have simple daily needs. Research has shown that often, a preoccupation with material goods is a way of covering up some deeper need.Have what you need, and need only what you have.


Highly materialistic people are often less happy and fulfilled than others.Stuff won’t make you happy, but the relationships you cultivate with others can.
Get rid of things in your home that you don’t use or don’t like. Find a local charity to donate clothing, household goods, and other things that are just lying around your house.
Simplify your personal life, too. It’s okay to say “no” to commitments or invitations. Choose to spend time doing things that are meaningful or helpful to you.

, Believe it or not, humans can “catch” emotions as easily as we catch colds.If you spend a lot of time with people who are happy and positive, you’re more likely to feel that way yourself. If you spend a lot of time with people who are focused on negativity, that will rub off on you as well. Surround yourself with people who care for you, respect you and others, and enrich your life.


Who do you spend your time with? How do they make you feel about yourself? Do you feel respected and validated by the people in your life?This isn’t to suggest that your friends and loved ones shouldn’t offer constructive critique. In fact, sometimes we need a friend to point out when we’ve done something thoughtless or hurtful. However, you should always feel like your loved ones approach you with kindness and respect, and you should treat them the same way.

, Learning to communicate assertively (but not aggressively) can help you feel stronger, more confident, and more fulfilled. Assertive communication acknowledges that both you and others have needs, and works to give everyone a way to be heard.Be open and honest, but don’t use judging or blaming language. If someone has hurt you, it’s healthy to share your feelings with him or her. However, don’t use language that puts blame on the other person, such as “You were so unkind to me” or “You don’t even care about my needs.”
Use “I”-statements. Using statements that focus on what you are feeling and experiencing keep you from sounding blaming or judging. For example, “I felt hurt when you forgot to pick me up from work. I felt like my needs were not important to you.”
Give constructive criticism, and accept it from others. Don’t simply tell others to do or not to do something. Explain why you are asking.
Invite others to share their needs and ideas with you. Use cooperative language, such as “What would you like to do?” or “What do you think?”
Instead of automatically feeling a need to assert your own point of view, try saying something like “Tell me more” when you hear something that at first seems like something you’d normally disagree with. Try to see from his/her point of view.

, Be selfless in your attitude towards others. One of the biggest things that holds us back in our lives is our focus on the idea that we “deserve” certain things. This feeling can result in feelings of dissatisfaction and anger.Give love without expecting it to be returned. Love others even when it’s hard.


This doesn’t mean you have to be a doormat for those who don’t treat you right. You can love and accept someone and still recognize that they aren’t good for you.
Believe it or not, love is helpful even in the workplace. Workplaces that foster a culture that includes compassion, caring, and expressions of affection are more productive and have more satisfied workers., Forgiveness is good for your body and your soul. Forgiving can be incredibly difficult, but it also reduces stress, decreases your blood pressure, and lowers your heart rate. Forgiveness can help you feel fulfilled and happy even if the other person never acknowledges the wrongdoing.Think about whatever it is you want to forgive. Notice how those thoughts make you feel. Accept those feelings; judging them or trying to repress them will only make it worse.Transform that painful experience into a learning experience. What could you have done differently? What could the other person have done differently? What can you learn from this experience that can help you become a better person now?
Remember that you can only control your actions, not others’. One of the reasons forgiveness is so hard is because it’s entirely dependent on you. The other person may never acknowledge the wrongdoing. S/he may never face consequences or learn from the experience. However, holding on to your anger about the situation ultimately only hurts you. Learning to forgive, regardless of whether the other person takes any action or experiences any result, will help you heal.
Forgiving yourself is as important as forgiving others. When we dwell on things about our past lives or behavior that we regret, we can end up falling into an unproductive cycle of self-blame, rather than using those experiences as tools to help us focus on becoming better people in the present.Use the techniques in this article, such as challenging negative self-talk and practicing mindfulness, to help you forgive yourself and show yourself the same compassion you show others.
While forgiving remember we need to forget certain situations in life which brought us negative emotions.

, Be selfless in service to others. Begin with your neighbor. Do charitable service outside of your immediate community as well. Giving back will not only make you better as a person, it will help others.


Helping others not only benefits them, it has physical health benefits for you. Being charitable may cause what’s known as a “helper’s high,” an endorphin rush that we experience when we do something good for others.You don’t have to start a soup kitchen or found a non-profit to help others. Even small acts of everyday kindness can have a huge effect. Research has found that the “pay it forward” effect really does exist: your kindness can inspire others to show generosity and kindness in turn, which then inspires more and more people to do the same., Be kind and courteous. Enjoy the company of others. Treat others as you would like to be treated.


It may feel uncomfortable at first to talk with someone whom you see as “different” than you. Remember that you can learn something from every person you encounter. And the more diversity you embrace in your daily life, the more you’ll realize that we’re all human.

Go outside your comfort zone.,
Select challenging reading.,
Learn a new language.,
Learn to play a musical instrument.,
Play video games, but cut out TV.,
Play chess or solve puzzles.",How to Keep Your Brain in Top Shape1," Your brain is like a muscle and requires challenges and novelty in order to more fully develop. Once you determine that a certain area of study or mental activity is outside your comfort zone, push yourself to attempt it anyway. A good rule is that comfort is not good for your brain. Aim for unsteadiness and uncertainty in learning.For example, if math is difficult for you, then you might want to spend some more time working on it. This may be better for your brain than moving on to a more comfortable subject.;
, Instead of just jumping into the first book that catches your eye, think about what subjects interest you and seek out books in those areas. Begin your reading at the ground level and work your way up to master works. This is one way to achieve a degree of mastery in a subject. You’ll also find that your vocabulary and ability to explain difficult concepts will improve as well.For example, if you are curious about physics you might want to start with an introductory college textbook and then move on to more specialized books by famous physicists.

, Enroll in a local college course. Work with a tutor on a weekly basis. Or, purchase online language software and teach yourself. When you work on a new language it activates parts of your brain that remain generally dormant otherwise. Once you get comfortable with one language, move on to the next and so on., Take a lesson with a private tutor. Enroll in a local college course. Or, find an online or digital instructor who offers introductory to advanced lessons.

Long hours of t.v. watching has been linked to ADHD, too.
Video games, such as Minecraft, can help people to develop social connections that extend outside of the gaming sphere. Instead of becoming the antisocial stereotype, part-time gamers can develop prosocial attitudes., Buy a chess set and challenge friends and family to a game. Go online and join a chess club. Look up the crossword or Sudoku puzzle in your local newspaper. Or, find an online puzzle site and subscribe to regular emails. Puzzling and strategy games teach your brain to remain calm under pressure and to come up with creative solutions to problems."

Chronic stress can push you toward dementia and other brain disorders, so relaxing can go a long way towards improving cognitive performance., Invite coworkers out for social activities. Participate in social clubs to meet new people. Try to talk with people whenever you go out instead of staying focused on your phone. Every time we make positive human contact our brains experience an uptick in good chemicals, such as endorphins. Be social and your brain will thank you!, Take a formal meditation class at a yoga studio or recreation center near you. Or, go online and watch tutorials on how to enter a meditative state of mind. Spend at least 15 minutes each day mediating or reflecting. You can even sit in bed at night, clear your mind, and think about the day’s events. This gives your brain a jumpstart on its work once you go to sleep.To enter a meditative state, you might need to repeat a word or phrase, such as, “relax,” or “reflect.” Try to mediate in an area where you will be undisturbed and can try to slide into a semi-conscious frame of mind.
You can, of course, meditate for longer than 15 minutes if you like.

, For things that you do every day, try to establish pattern of how to behave or what to do and stick with it. So, when you come home at night, place your keys at the same spot in your house. Taking away any decision-making in simple scenarios like this frees up your brainpower to tackle more complex problems.For example, it is good idea to write down all of your appointments in a calendar or planner so that you don’t have to worry or stress about remembering the basic details.
Making a habit of tidying up and putting things away after you use them will create a clean, orderly environment for living and working.

Consult with your doctor.,
Get at least eight hours of sleep per night.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Exercise at least three times a week.,
Maintain an upright posture.,
Take supplements.",How to Keep Your Brain in Top Shape3," It’s a good idea to see your general doctor before you decide to boost your brain power. They will likely run a series of blood tests to make sure that no physical ailments will halt your progress. Some conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, can negatively impact your brain’s ability to process and store information., Going to sleep early and waking early as well is one way to improve your brain power. So, set a consistent bedtime and rising time and try to stick with them. Eight hours of uninterrupted sleep is just enough for your brain to process information and to prepare fully for the next day.To minimize sleep interruptions, turn off your phone and let anyone you live with know your nighttime schedule. Every moment of sleep disruption raises your brain’s stress levels., Your brain will run best with unprocessed foods, lean meats, lots of fresh produce, and healthy fats. Eating healthy can improve both your brain’s memory capacity and overall functioning. Sugar, on the other hand, can slow down brain cell connections and lead to a general feeling of mental fogginess.It is especially important to add foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as broiled or baked fish, to your diet. These can boost the spaces in your brain set aside for memory., Create a workout regimen that includes both cardio and weight resistance motions. This routine should take a minimum of 30 minutes. If you want to work out more than three times, then you will likely see even more cognitive benefits. Exercise increases blood flow to your brain and keep its cells active and refreshed., Keep your spine straight, shoulder back, arms uncrossed, and stomach sucked in towards your spine. Check each hour to see that you are maintaining these positions. Poor posture sends a negative message to your brain that can contribute to depression and slowed down memory. Holding yourself in a positive way can push your brain in that direction too., Talk with your doctor about your diet to see if a multivitamin or supplement might be a good fit for you. Fish oil supplements, in particular, are often linked with improved memory and overall brain functioning. Your doctor can also order a blood test to see if your levels are too low on any other important nutrients, such as vitamins B, C, D, and E.Human growth hormone (HGH) supplements can be useful for certain people older than 30 who are trying to combat memory loss and brain slowdown."

Join a group, club, or volunteer at a library or senior center.",How to Grow Old Without Feeling Old/Large," Never think of age as being anything but just a number. There are some things in life we have no control over, such as when we were born. Age is no more than a circumstantial detail, like the color of your eyes, or the names of your parents; it does not define who you are. There are other things that do--those things we do have control over, such as how we think and what we do.;
, There is always something positive or something to look forward to each day. Enjoy the sun shining on your plants, or a movie you are going to see. Look forward to reading a good book, or meeting with friends for lunch. If you feel lonely, go to the library. It is a great place to meet and talk to people who have a similar interest. Surround yourself with people, even if you might never see them again. You can do this at a supermarket, or even a department store or coffee shop.

, As long as you have your health, you can do just about anything you find an interest in doing. If you have never used a computer, buy one! Learn how to use it. You will find you have brought the whole world into your room. Learn new things and do the things you never had the time to do before.

, Take vitamins and eat healthy. Exercise at either a gym or at home. Dance to the music on a CD, as moving your body is great exercise. Get a full physical and visit your dentist at least once a year.

, Don't worry about what happened in the past. Live just for today. The one thing that no one can change is the past. What has been is over and done with. The future has not yet come, so all we have is today. So enjoy today, let the past go, and plan for the future.

Eat breakfast every day.,
Select foods that are high in protein.",How to Get Energy if You're Tired2," Green tea contains caffeine, which is why it can help to boost your energy. But unlike coffee, green tea may also reduce your risk of stroke, high blood pressure, depression, heart attack, and diabetes.Try having a cup of green tea to help boost your energy.


Limit yourself to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day.Just keep in mind that different types of caffeinated drinks have different levels of caffeine. For example, coffee may have between 60 and 150 milligrams of caffeine per cup, while tea may have between 40 and 80 milligrams., Most people don't drink enough water throughout the day, which can lead to low energy. Aim for eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day, but drink more during a workout. For example, you should have a glass of water before and after workouts. If you exercise for more than 30 minutes, then take small sips of water during your workout., Some natural dietary sugar is important for normal brain function, but too much processed and concentrated sugar (such as a candy bar, cookie, or soda) spikes blood sugar levels. Sugary foods can give you a short energy boost, but then it will be followed by a slump.Some good snack choices include:


Whole wheat toast with nut butter
A piece of fruit
A handful of carrot sticks and a tablespoon of hummus

, Eating a nutritious breakfast keeps you alert, kick starts your metabolism, and prevents you from having sugar cravings in the afternoon.Skip sugary donuts and breakfast cereals. Some better choices include:

Get good, quality sleep at night.,
Take a short nap during the day.,
Exercise more.",How to Get Energy if You're Tired3," A common reason why people get tired during the day is lack of a restful sleep the night before. Lack of quality sleep can lead to feelings of fatigue and tiredness. Most healthy adults need an average of eight hours of sleep each night.Make your bedroom as quiet and as dark as possible in order to promote the best sleep possible. Try to keep your room cool and avoid electronics (including your phone) right before bed.
At least 40% of American adults experience daytime tiredness multiple days per month due to poor sleep habits., Taking a short (power) nap may help you feel invigorated and increase your energy levels. A 20 – 30 minute nap during the day provides significant benefit for increased alertness and improved performance without leaving you feeling groggy or interfering with sleep at night.Finding a place to nap while at work may be a challenge, but consider cutting your lunch short and sleeping in your car (if your drive to work).


Make sure your boss and co-workers know of your power napping intentions and don't think you're just being lazy.
Try drinking a cup of coffee or tea right after your nap to improve the effectiveness of the nap., Heavy, strenuous exercise may cause fatigue, but regular cardiovascular exercise (such as walking briskly) for 30 – 60 minutes a day delivers more oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your heart and lungs work better.Regular cardiovascular exercise also improves mood (and libido!) and promotes better sleep, which both contribute to higher energy levels.
In addition to walking, other good exercises include swimming, cycling, and jogging on a treadmill.

Consult with your doctor about diabetes.,
Talk to your doctor about hormonal imbalance.,
Get tested for anemia.,
Consider whether depression or anxiety are causing your fatigue.,
Get a referral to a weight-loss clinic.",How to Get Energy if You're Tired4," If your energy levels do not improve, then make an appointment with your family physician and get your blood sugar levels checked. Diabetes is characterized by chronic high blood glucose due to lack of insulin or insulin resistance.Your body needs insulin to get glucose into cells so energy molecules (ATP) can be made.


A common symptom of diabetes is daytime fatigue that is not alleviated by sleeping, exercise or eating nutritious meals.
Dehydration from excessive urination is also common with diabetes, which contributes to tiredness too, as noted above.
Other symptoms of diabetes include weight loss, confusion (brain fog), blurred vision, and a sweet-smelling breath odor.

, Another common cause of tiredness and fatigue is hormonal imbalance. Glands in your body produce hormones, many of which impact metabolism, energy production and mood. Your doctor can send you for blood tests that measure hormones and other compounds made by these glands.


Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) is a common cause of chronic fatigue, especially in women.Adrenal fatigue can be caused by chronic stress, heavy caffeine consumption and/or over-medication. The most common symptoms of adrenal fatigue are fatigue, lack of energy, nervousness and sleep disturbance.Menopause commonly leads to lack of energy, hot flashes, insomnia and emotional problems.It's brought on by a natural decline in female reproductive hormones (estrogen and progesterone), but certain diseases and conditions can trigger it prematurely.

, A major symptom of anemia is feeling fatigued or weak. Anemia occurs when your body doesn't have enough healthy blood cells to function properly.Anemia may be caused by an iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency, a chronic disease (such as Chron's disease or rheumatoid arthritis), or many other factors, so it is important to see your doctor if you are experiencing ongoing fatigue., If you are constantly tired but testing determines that you are otherwise healthy, you may want to look at your emotional health. Both depression and anxiety can cause tiredness.Some signs and symptoms of depression include: feeling hopeless, empty, or worthless; difficulty concentrating; loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed; negative thoughts you can't control; turning to alcohol or drugs or other risky behavior.Some signs and symptoms of anxiety include: constantly feeling worried, tense, or on edge; avoiding everyday situations and activities that might cause you to feel anxious (such as socializing); you have irrational but uncontrollable fears; you have a sense of doom, or like something bad is always about to happen.If you think you may be suffering from depression and/or anxiety, talk to your doctor about a referral to a therapist that can help you overcome these issues, or a psychiatrist who can evaluate your health and possibly prescribe an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication.

, If you're overweight or obese, then losing weight might make the most positive impact on your day-to-day energy levels. Losing weight can improve your physical health, energy levels, mobility, mood, and self-confidence.A weight-loss clinic may help motivate you and teach you how to alter your diet by eating more fresh fruits and veggies, lean meats and whole grains, while cutting back on empty sugar calories.


Combining dietary changes with an increase in exercise can speed up the weight loss process.
The key to losing weight is reducing your daily calories (no more than 2,500 if you're male, 2,000 if female) while adding some fat-burning cardiovascular exercise on a regular basis (even just a 30-minute walk every day).
Losing weight also reduces your risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which also contribute to feeling tired and fatigued.

Pay more attention to how things feel.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Become more aware of your body.",How to Fine Tune All of Your Five Senses," Practicing what some doctors call ""scent therapy"" can engage new receptors in your nose, improving your sense of smell over time.Choose several strong smells that are pleasant to you and spend a few minutes every day sniffing each one. After a few weeks, your nose will be able to pick up on these smells more easily. When you start noticing a difference, practice with more smells.


Essential oils are very useful tools when it comes to scent therapy. Chose 3 or 4 oils with smells you like, such as lemongrass, cedar, vanilla and geranium rose.
You can also use raw materials to conduct scent therapy. Gather a few small jars and fill each one with a different strong-smelling substance, such as ground coffee, dried basil leaves, a few drops of your favorite floral shampoo, and so on. Keep the lids on the jars when you aren't using them so the smells stay strong.
When you conduct scent therapy, you should sniff quickly, rather than deeply inhaling each scent. This way you'll avoid scent fatigue.;
, Another form of therapy you can try is experimenting with identifying different types of smells with your eyes closed. Practicing this over the course of a few months will enhance your ability to distinguish between different smells. Close your eyes and have someone hold different substances under your nose one at a time. See if you can identify the smells.Start by rotating smells that are quite different, like chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon, or bourbon, orange juice and peppermint tea.
As you get better at distinguishing between smells, start working with smells that are more difficult to tell apart, like strawberry, cherry and raspberry, or lemon, lime and grapefruit.

, When you identify and describe a smell out loud, your ability to perceive it is sharpened.Make a practice of talking about smells as you experience them. Describe them out loud using specific language, the way a wine connoisseur would talk about the characteristics of different wines.


Make a point of noticing and talking about everyday smells. For example, describe the nuances of your dinner's scent: ""I can smell the earthy ground corn in these tortillas, the sweet and spicy tang of the pork filling, the fresh soapy scent of the cilantro, and the floral citrus burst of the lime.""

, Getting a little exercise can enhance your sense of smell. Go for a walk or jog, then pay attention to the smells around you. It's possible that the extra moisture in your nose that accumulates with exercise helps sharpen your ability to smell, Having a zinc deficiency can lead to a dulled sense of smell as well as taste.Take supplements or consume foods high in zinc, like lamb, grass-fed beef, scallops, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and oats., Certain medications have the side effect of dulling the sense of smell. Medication prescribed for Parkinson's disease, antibiotics, and blood pressure medication can affect your sense of smell. If you're on a medication that has this side effect, talk to your doctor to make sure you're receiving the right dosage., A clogged sinus, whether it's caused by a cold or allergies, will prevent you from being able to smell properly. A cold will go away, but if you tend to have allergies throughout the year, you might want to check into getting on medication to free up your sinuses so you can smell properly again.

, Smoking cigarettes is a huge culprit when it comes to dulling the senses, especially your sense of smell. If you can cut back or quit smoking your sense of smell will greatly improve. Chewing tobacco and other tobacco products have the same effect., Foods laden with these two ingredients can mess with your sense of taste. They mask subtler flavors and make it more difficult to pick up on the taste of your food. When you first cut back on salt and sugar, you might feel that your food lacks flavor, but after a week or two you'll begin to notice the complex flavors you were missing before.Try reducing salt and sugar by 1/3 or 1/2 in all of your recipes, including your baking recipes. You could also substitute sugar with a less intense sweetener, like honey.
There's no need to cut salt entirely. A little salt can actually enhance the flavor of food. It's when you pour it on everything that it starts dulling your sense of taste.

, Processed foods are often filled with sodium and sugar, so that's one good reason to avoid them. They also often contain chemicals and artificial ingredients that can mess with your sense of taste. Eating sweet and spicy chicken tenders from a fast food joint is going to make a homemade version taste dull by comparison, since you'll be used to tasting a burst of chemically-enhanced flavors. Retrain your taste buds to pick up on the subtleties of natural flavors by avoiding foods that are processed and combined with chemicals.


Snack foods like chips, candy and sodas are designed to be flavor bombs that tap into your brain's pleasure center and stimulate cravings. Reach instead for homemade popcorn sprinkled with salt and pepper, or homemade soda sweetened with fruit juice.
It might be hard to make the switch at first, but eventually you'll be able to enjoy natural flavors more than ever.

, Stimulate your taste buds by mixing things up in your diet. If you tend to eat bland meals, your ability to taste may deteriorate. Use herbs and spices you don't normally use. Steam your vegetables instead of boiling them. Choose foods with different textures and colors, so that every meal is a banquet of new tastes for your tongue., Fat makes food taste better, and enhances other flavors. Consider a bowl of steamed broccoli: it's fine on its own, but how much better does it taste with a drizzle of melted butter? There's no need to go overboard with fat, but using some in your cooking will bring out the best in your food.


Get creative with the fats you use. There's butter, but you can also use a variety of oils, each with its own flavor profile. Try olive, sesame, peanut, grapeseed, and coconut oil in your cooking.
You can also garnish your dishes with a bit of fat. Try sprinkling chopped nuts over your vegetable dishes, and serving your salads with avocado.

, Dishes in which all the flavors are mushed together aren't the best for stimulating your taste buds. It's difficult to distinguish the flavors from one another, and dishes like these often end up tasting bland. Keep the components of your meal separate from one another for maximum tastebud stimulation.

, Your senses of smell and taste are connected to one another; when one is sharpened, so is the other. You'll enjoy the taste of your food more if you inhale it before you begin tucking in., Tobacco products affect your sense of taste just as they affect your sense of smell. Smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco is going to be detrimental to your ability to taste - there's no way around it. If you want to get your tastebuds back, quit smoking and chewing.

, Foods rich in vitamins A, C, and E are vital for good vision. Eating plenty of food rich in these three vitamins is a great first step for sharpening your ability to see. You should also strive to eat foods rich in beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, since these antioxidants protect the eyes from sun damage.Eat dark leafy greens, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, carrots, and peppers.
Blueberries, grapes, garlic, onions, and shallots also contain antioxidants that protect your eyes.
Foods with DHA, a fatty acid, are also essential for healthy eyes. Eat salmon, sardines, cod, and mackerel.

, Having to strain to see what you're doing can hurt your vision over time. Invest in good lighting in your office and home workspaces to avoid hurting your eyes.

, It's very important to get up and look outside, so that your eyes don't get strained from staring up close at the blinking lights on your computer. Every hour or so, stand up and look out the window. Gaze at an object several miles away, if possible. Keep looking until your eyes adjust to the view.

, Having dry eyes can cause your vision to look blurry. Drink at least 8 glasses of water every day. If you wear contacts, be sure to clean them properly and change them frequently. Use saline drops as tear replacements if you have trouble producing your own tears.

, You can sharpen your vision by performing a few simple exercises on a daily basis. Do them when your eyes feel a little tired and you need a break from whatever task is at hand.


Roll your eyes around. Look up, then to the side, then down, then to the other side. Repeat ten times.Focus on an object. Hold it close to your face, then move it slowly backward, keeping your eyes focused on the item. Move it close to your face again, maintaining focus. Repeat 10 times.
Test your peripheral vision. Stand facing a wall, staring straight ahead. Try to identify what is on either side of you using your peripheral vision. Move closer to the wall and keep using your peripheral vision to see from side to side. Continue until your side views are blocked. Repeat every few days, and little by little, you'll gain a greater ability to see what's in your peripheral vision.

, Red wine contains resveratrol, an antioxidant that has been shown to improve hearing in mice. Drinking a glass of red wine every evening may enhance your ability to hear over time., Foods containing certain nutrients can enhance your ear health, keeping your ability to hear in good shape for as long as possible. Add the following foods to your diet:


Foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids, like fish, improve blood flow to the ear canal and improve hearing.Foods rich in zinc, like lamb and sesame seeds, can lessen inflammation in your inner ear.
Apples contain quercetin, which is an antioxidant that repairs free radical damage.

, You can sharpen your hearing by listening to music at a medium to low volume. Choose music with elements that are clearly distinct from one another, so you can focus on one instrument or sound at a time. Pay full attention to the music, noting the distinctions between sounds and movements.


Jazz is a great choice for improving your hearing, since musicians take turns playing their instruments solo.
Don't turn up the music past medium volume. You should be able to have a conversation without trouble.

, Attending loud concerts really does reduce your hearing ability. The same goes for experiencing other sustained loud sounds, like the sound of traffic on a highway or machinery at a construction site. When you can't help but be around noises, protect yourself by wearing earplugs or headphones.

, Research shows that tactile sensation and vision are related, so looking at the object you're touching will enhance your ability to feel it. When you're touching something interesting, pay attention to what it looks like, too.

, Our sense of touch might be the one we take most for granted. Deliberately paying attention to how things feel can awaken your brain so that your sense of touch gets stimulated. Start being more aware of what your skin is touching.


When you're shopping for clothes, run your hands over the different fabrics. Identify the difference between cotton and polyester, silk and satin. Make deliberate choices based on which ones feel best.
Make a point of touching different textures throughout the day. Let your fingers graze a tree as you're walking by, and stop to pick a delicate flower. Run your hands through your hair and feel the cold tiles under your toes.
Be aware of things that change the feel of your skin, like a cool breeze or the warmth of the sun.

, Soft skin is more sensitive than rough skin. If you have callouses on your hands and feet, you're limiting the sensation you can feel. Use a pumice stone or another exfoliating tool to remove rough edges, then moisturize with lotion or oil to keep your skin soft and sensitive., Dancing, running, doing yoga, getting massages, and getting acupuncture treatments can all help you get more in tune with your body, making you more sensitive to touch. Having physical contact with another person also helps you become more physically awake."

Be aware that poor hygiene is not always a choice.,
Get an idea of the person’s general grooming habits.,
Suggest a change in routine.,
Avoid mentioning any issues with odor.,
Ask the person about their concerns and needs regarding bathing.",How to Get An Elderly Person to Bathe or Shower1," As people age, bathing may become difficult. This may be due to a fear of falling, difficulty getting in or out of the tub or shower, difficulty washing themselves, or even a result of a cognitive disorder, such as Alzheimer’s or dementia.As you start to approach an elderly family member or friend about their hygiene, keep all of these things in mind and aim to be as respectful and tactful as possible.
, Approaching the situation indirectly will avoid putting too much pressure on your loved one or client. It is important to make them feel comfortable before going about suggesting a change in routine, which for many elderly can be upsetting and difficult.


For example, you can begin by asking whether they have enough grooming supplies, and if they respond yes, ask,”Well is that enough soap for your showers and baths this week? How many would you say you take on average?”, or if they respond no, “Just to get an idea for when I’m shopping, how many baths or showers a week should we restock you for?”

, If you find out that they’re bathing fewer than two times a week, change your tone of voice from casually inquisitive to concerned. Approach the issue from a medical, rather than a personal, standpoint, stressing the importance of hygiene to overall health.


Explain that doctors recommend bathing at least twice a week to prevent infection.Try something like, “You know I’ve heard on the news / from my doctor that not only should everyone bathe every week, they should bathe at least twice a week for better health. I think we should give this a try.”

, Bringing up body odor might disappoint or anger them, making it more difficult to convince them to change their routine. And since seniors can have a decreased sense of smell, they might not be aware that there is an odor problem.Pointing this out to them could cause anxiety if they’re unable to detect the odor and might wonder about it.

, Depending on their physical condition, bathing or showering may be a source of anxiety—undressing, getting in and out of the tub, washing, drying off, and dressing might require more energy than they have. They may be afraid of falling in the tub, have had a bad experience with scalding or icy-cold water, or easily lose track of time.Take note of these for consideration when arranging for help with washing, and improving bathroom safety.


To try to understand what anxieties they may have, ask questions such as, “Have you been hurt while using the tub, by falling, or by the temperature of the water?” or “Do you feel really tired after washing?” If fatigue or fear of falling seem to be issues, strongly consider either bathing the person yourself or hiring a caregiver.

Give them an incentive to wash.,
Offer to help them wash.,
Ask suggestive questions to arrange a washing time.,
Arrange for help with washing.,
Schedule a caregiver.,
Set a regular washing schedule.,
Check in to make sure that washing is taking place as planned.,
Consult a doctor if you meet resistance.",How to Get An Elderly Person to Bathe or Shower2," If your loved one hasn’t been washing frequently enough, it’s likely they don’t feel the need to because they aren’t going out or seeing people regularly. You can give them an extra incentive to bathe by encouraging them to make plans. Go beyond simply suggesting things to do, and mark out specific plans with them on a calendar.


Outings and activities that are easy arrange include lunch with friends or family, going to the movies or a musical performance, or a trip to the park., Even if they prefer to wash themselves, it’s safest to supervise your loved one for at least the first couple of washing sessions. Stress that you only want to be there to set things up and ensure safety, with the possibility of letting them wash on their own after making sure they feel safe.


If you do help the person bathe, then try using tactful questions to help them with the bathing process. For example, you might ask things like, what kind of soap do you prefer? Do you need a washcloth? Is the water warm enough?
You can also make tactful suggestions during the bathing process, such as, “Here’s the soap for washing your body.” Or, “I’m going to hand you the shampoo next so you can wash your hair.”, Instead of asking whether or not they want to bathe, pose your questions in a way that assumes they want to. Avoid yes or no questions, such as ""Do you want to bathe or not?""--in addition to coming off as testy, this omits the assumption that more bathing should be done.


For example, you can ask “When should I come back to help you with your bath?” or “What time of the day suits you best for showering?”

, Depending on your relationship with the person, they may feel awkward about your helping them with such a private routine. If the person is living with a spouse or partner, first suggest that the spouse or partner help them bathe. If the pair seem open to this, begin by discussing and establishing a routine with both of them. Mark the washing days (at least two per week) on the calendar.

, If the person can’t bathe alone and is uncomfortable with a family member helping out, hiring a caregiver for home visits is the best option. These services are widely available in most communities. Search your directory or the internet for “In-Home Health Provider” or “Home Health Care.”Schedule a bathing session for at least twice a week, marking it on a calendar that is easily visible (attached to the refrigerator, hanging on a wall in the kitchen).


The idea of an unfamiliar person helping them to wash could be worrisome. Assure them that the caregiver is a professional, and is specifically trained to help people take care of themselves.
Regardless of who helps with washing, remind the loved one that bathing can be a pleasant, refreshing experience and is important to staying healthy.

, Whether it’s you, a spouse, or a caregiver who will be helping, putting washing times on the calendar will help the loved one to improve their memory, and get a better sense of the week’s activities. When you or the caregiver arrives, it’s “bath time,” an event as expected and routine as dinnertime or bedtime., If you’re not the one helping with washing, either ask the spouse or partner whether the schedule is being followed, or call the in-home agency to make sure the treatment is running smoothly.


If the person is washing themselves, an easy way to make sure they’re using the bath regularly is to check the soap bar size and body wash / shampoo bottle levels to see whether they’ve been used.
Since you’ve already completed the difficult task of asking them about hygiene, it should be easier at this point to casually ask whether they’ve been keeping to the new bathing schedule you’d agreed on.

, It’s possible that your loved one will refuse to bathe, despite repeated attempts on your part to explain the benefits and to offer to help. In this case, consult a family doctor, and ask about medications that are designed to ease resistance to care."

Install grab bars as needed.,
Install a tub bench / shower chair if the person can’t sit down in the tub.,
Add a non-slip mat or apply anti-slip tape to the base of the tub.,
Install a handheld shower head.,
Ensure the proper functioning of the water system.",How to Get An Elderly Person to Bathe or Shower3," These can be very reassuring, and helpful for a person who has already fallen or is afraid of falling in the bathtub. They should be readily available at a pharmacy or bath supply store.

, These are especially useful if there has already been a fall, or if there is apprehension about falling because of frailty or fatigue.Pharmacies or bath supply stores are again the best places to shop for these.

, Many bathtubs may already have this sandpaper-textured tape affixed to the bottom of the tub, but it could help to add more in the middle area where most of the standing is done when showering. Non-slip mats (for drying off) are available for the floor just outside the tub as well., This will give the person more control while washing. It is also much safer, since it prevents falls by 1) eliminating the need to maneuver under the shower head to wash hard-to-reach areas, and 2) allowing them to sit in a shower chair while washing., Test the water temperature by hand. Let both the hot and cold water run for a few minutes each to check for major temperature fluctuations. If the temperature changes from hot to cold frequently, contact the landlord or hire a plumber to resolve the problem.


If the person lives in an apartment, it’s best to do the test in the early morning when other residents will be showering, and fluctuations would be most common.
Check the water heater’s temperature gauge, and make sure it is set to 120 degrees. This should help prevent scalding temperatures."

Drink water.,
Go for a brisk walk.,
Get some sun.,
Have a nutritious snack.,
Laugh.,
Take a 10-20 minute nap.,
Nibble on some dark chocolate.,
Drink a cup of coffee.,
Listen to music.,
Take a deep breath of a stimulating scent, like fresh lemon, lime, or orange.,
Take a break.",How to Get Energy Fast1," Dehydration is a common, easily fixed cause of low energy. Even mild dehydration can sap your energy and affect your ability to think and reason.If you're lacking energy, try drinking a few glasses of water as your first plan of attack.


Try to drink water throughout the day, not just when you feel thirsty.
Women should aim for 9 cups (72oz) of water daily, men 13 cups (104 oz).Drink more water if you have exercised to replenish what you sweat out, or if you consumed dehydrating beverages, like coffee or soda.;
, A 10-minute walk can pump up your energy for up to two hours. The energy bump you get from sugar or caffeine only lasts about an hour and you may suffer a major crash afterwards, leaving you with even less energy than before.Other exercises that can get your energy up in 10 minutes include jumping rope, dancing, climbing stairs, lunges and squats.You don't have to break a sweat to reap the energy benefits of a quick workout. Just getting your body up and moving for 10 minutes can increase energy and boost mood., Light suppresses the production of Melatonin, a hormone your brain releases to make you feel sleepy. If you're indoors all day in a dark office or classroom, your brain may think it's time to go to sleep and release Melatonin, impacting your energy.Try to spend lunches or breaks outside.
If possible, sit by a window when you're indoors so you have some exposure to the sun throughout the day.
If you can't get outside during the day or there's very little daylight (like during the shorter winter days), consider purchasing a lightbox. These mimic the effects of daylight and can be used to lift energy, A combination of complex carbs (i.e. green vegetables, whole-grain bread, oatmeal, yogurt, apples) and protein (i.e. nuts, chicken, eggs, tofu, cheese) can give you the fuel you need without spiking your blood sugar, which can lead to crashing.Carbohydrates are broken down by your body and absorbed into the blood stream to provide energy. The addition of protein slows this process so that your blood sugar remains steady, giving you more energy for longer periods of time.
Bananas, apricots, and dates are also easy pick-me-up snacks.

, Watching a brief, humorous video or reading a comic that makes you chuckle can both decrease tension and increase energy. It may also make you more willing to tackle challenging projects., A power-nap around 2 or 3pm can improve cognitive ability, creativity, and memory, and can leave you feeling rested and refreshed. Just don't oversleep or you may end up groggy instead of revitalized.If you have more time, sleeping for 90-minutes will allow you to complete a full REM cycle. You'll get more rest and avoid grogginess.
Find somewhere quiet, dark, and away from people, where you have some room to curl up.
If there's nowhere nap-worth nearby, try reclining the seat of your car and use an eye mask to block out any light.

, Chocolate contains theobromine and caffeine, both proven energy boosters. Flavonoids, a mood-enhancing antioxidant, can also be found in cocoa. Just remember to enjoy in moderation!You can still get results from milk chocolate, but the darker the chocolate, the greater the energy benefits.
Stick to straight chocolate bars or squares and avoid chocolates packed with sugary extras like marshmallow, caramel, etc.

, There's a reason most people turn to coffee to wake them up in the morning--it's packed with caffeine and increases metabolism, energy, and focus. The catch is that these effects peak quickly but can have far-reaching side effects, like preventing you from falling asleep at bedtime, which can impact your energy long-term.Try not to exceed a single cup of coffee in a day, or try smaller, more frequent servings instead of one large cup.
Don't sweeten the pot. Adding sugar will spike your blood-sugar and lead you to crash in about an hour.

, Listening to uptempo music before you begin work or during breaks can make you feel motivated and more alert. This works best if you pick songs you really enjoy.If you are working on a creative project or complex tasks (like writing a paper, reading, studying for a test), try listening to repetitive ""background"" music while you work.Do not listen to popular music or music with lyrics while you are working. Your brain will try to process both things at once and it will be more difficult to process the task at hand. Save this kind of music for breaks to reinvigorate yourself.Tapping your toes can provide an extra bump of energy., Cinnamon, rosemary, and peppermint can also help improve focus and decrease fatigue., While you may want to plow through your work as quickly as possible, taking a 5-10 minute break can actually provide an immediate shot of energy and increase productivity overall.If you're sitting for most of the day, try taking four 30-second breaks every hour and a 14-minute break after two hours."

Eat a healthy breakfast every day.,
Exercise regularly.,
Get on a regular sleep cycle.,
Improve your diet by eating foods rich in Omega 3 fatty-acids and magnesium.,
Quit smoking.,
See a doctor.",How to Get Energy Fast2," Just like mom always said, breakfast is too important to skip. It provides fuel to keep you alert throughout the morning and wakes up your metabolism.A breakfast that's high in complex carbs and fiber provides the most effective energy boost. Try foods like high-fiber cereal, multi-grain toast, and oatmeal., Engaging in physical activity for 20 minutes three times a week has been shown to drastically increase energy. You don't have to engage in high-intensity activities like sprinting for it to work, either. Low- and moderate-intensity work outs, such as walking and an easy or brisk pace, are extremely effective in fighting fatigueIf you find yourself lagging by 3pm, try working in a mid-day workout. This can increase productivity and may even help you think more creatively. , Sleep deprivation is often the culprit when it comes to feeling low-energy. One of the best ways to ensure you get restful sleep is to get in sync with your body's natural sleeping pattern, or circadian rhythm. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day--even on weekends!--to feel the full benefits of a good night's sleep.Going to sleep and waking up at the same time is actually more important than getting the same number of hours of sleep at a different time. If you are getting enough sleep, you should be able to wake up without an alarm. If you rely on the buzz of a clock-radio to get you out of bed, you need to set an earlier bedtime., Maintaining a steady blood-sugar level and getting vital nutrients and vitamins is essential to keeping your energy up.Omega 3 fatty-acids are found in foods like salmon, kale, Brussels sprouts, walnuts, and flaxseed. Omega 3's produce energy for your cells, reduce inflammation, and cognitive reasoning.Magnesium is high in legumes, dark leafy greens, cashews and seeds. Magnesium plays a vital role in energy production--without it, your cells cannot transform fuel into useable energy.Make sure you are consuming enough calories to fuel your daily activities.
Try to get vitamins and nutrients from food instead of supplements.

, You may feel a little buzz from the nicotine from a cigarette, but smoking actually makes you feel more lethargic.


Smoking damages delicate lung tissue and pollutes your bloodstream with carbon monoxide, making your body less efficient at absorbing oxygen, which is essentially fuel, and delivering it to your muscles (including your brain)., If you can't seem to shake your fatigue, a trip to the doctor may be in order. They can dig deeper to find the root of your low energy and determine if it is a symptom of a larger, more serious medical condition.

Stay away from simple sugars found in candy, sodas, and other sweets.,
Eliminate energy drinks.,
Break ties with people who stress you out.",How to Get Energy Fast3," These sugars are too quickly absorbed into the blood stream, causing your blood sugar level to spike. Your energy will spike, too, but very briefly. The crash that occurs after consuming simple sugars will leave you with even less energy than before.The yo-yoing of your blood sugar level will leave you craving more energy and nutrition. To keep from crashing, you would have to constantly eat sugary foods with very little nutritional value. This can lead to weight-gain, and the stress of carrying around excess pounds can leave you even more exhausted.Check the ingredients and sugar content of any processed foods you buy. They are often laden with simple sugars.
Other common sources of simple sugar are maple syrup, molasses, orange juice, table and brown sugar.

, These drinks often combine a high amount of caffeine or similar supplements like guarana with an excessive amount of sugar. Even short-term use can cause severe dehydration, high blood pressure, irritability, and even heart palpitations.Regular use can result in vomiting, dizziness, tremors and nausea.If you choose to use an energy drink to stay awake, make sure you know how your body reacts to caffeine. Try to pick one with less sugar and only drink them sparingly.

, Feeling stressed-out is a sure way to drain your energy. Being in the presence of some people can cause a physical stress reaction that will zap your energy and may leave you feeling dizzy or tired and may even give you a headache.You can't always control the people around you--you may have an unpleasant teacher or relative you can't escape from--but do your best to associate with positive people or people who make you feel good.
When you must interact with people who cause you stress, try taking a deep breath. Remember their attitude is about them, not about you. Keep things as neutral as possible and try avoid being drawn into their drama."

Schedule regular outings with friends.,
Volunteer at a school or children’s organization.,
Take up hobbies that can be shared with a partner or group of people.,
Reach out to others with whom you still have unresolved conflicts.",How to Grow Old and Stay Contented1," Having consistent and regular social interaction will get you out of the house, improve your mental and emotional health, and allow you to enjoy new and longstanding relationships whether or not you are of retirement age.


Schedule a weekly breakfast at a local cafe.
Coordinate social activity around time spent being physically active.
It is not always possible to see your friends, family, or loved ones as often as you’d like to, especially if you are unable to travel long distances. Having routine phone calls, sending letters, or sending emails are helpful ways to reduce the distance between you.;
, Volunteering at a school is not only a way to keep your social interaction up, but also allows you to absorb all of that youthful energy. Giving back to a community will also give you personal satisfaction and a sense of purpose.


Volunteer at a daycare center.
Visit a children’s classroom and read a story.

, Participating in group activities is a great way to make new friends and enjoy older relationships. Taking up hobbies and activities with others is another mindful way of making sure you do not miss out on essential social interaction.Try taking a class on an unfamiliar subject or learn a new language.
Visit a senior center and participate in group activities with other seniors.
Join a group or club focused around activities you are already interested in.

, Resolving long term conflicts or regrets will give you the peace of mind to be fully in the present and enjoy your surroundings. Although not always possible, reaching out to those with whom you still have unresolved conflicts will help clear your conscience and move forward.Consider reaching out to a sibling or family member with whom you had a childhood rivalry or conflict that has had lasting effects on your relationship. Remember to stay calm, be non-defensive, and listen respectfully.Forgiving and forgetting will help you move past long standing conflicts.
Enlist the help of a family mediator or therapist if you find you are unable to resolve the conflict yourselves.
Although not ideal, simply cutting your losses and accepting, rather than resisting, the differences between you is another solution that will give you peace of mind."

Release your inhibitions.,
Stop being judgmental.,
Toss your planner or schedule.,
Embrace being bored.,
Let someone else take charge.,
Break a few rules, within reason.",How to Feel Like a Kid Again1," Adults spend a lot of time worrying about how others perceive their behavior, but this leave you feeling stressed and self-conscious. To feel more youthful, even just temporarily, don’t worry about appearing stupid, silly, or crazy.For example, don't worry about how loud you are laughing. Just enjoy the feeling.
If you start to worry about what other people might think, push these thoughts aside and focus instead on how good it feels to laugh, joke around, or play.
Many of the activities you can do to feel more like a kid will require you to let go of your inhibitions and worry less about what other people may think. This may be hard to do, but you can start out small. Watch a funny movie and laugh as much as you want.;
, Worrying about how other people view you prevents you from feeling like a kid, but so does judging other people. Kids are often more accepting and open-minded than adults, so try to follow their example.When you catch yourself thinking negatively about another person, make yourself think of something nice instead. This might feel forced at first, but it will help retrain your brain to stop being judgmental and start being positive.
Psychologists suggest that one of the best ways to reduce your judgmental attitude about other people is to start being nice to yourself since judgement comes from a place of insecurity. Make a list of your best personality and character traits. Read this out loud every morning, and you'll notice that you have a better perspective on the world and the people around you.

, Feeling like a kid again involves embracing spontaneity and a less structured schedule. It is difficult to feel youthful and free when you have to worry about upcoming appointments, meetings, or responsibilities.While not every day can be unscheduled or open, try to avoid making lots of commitments for your days off.
Plan activities with friends or family, but don’t set a specific time or precise schedule.
For a brief time, allow yourself to let go of adult responsibilities. Laundry, bill paying, and cleaning won't help you feel like a kid again.

, A lot of adults feel the need to spend all of their free time engaged in specific, productive activities, but this is not how most kids live. It might take some effort, but allowing yourself to feel okay about having nothing to do will help you relax and feel more youthful.Giving yourself time to be bored provides you with the time to imagine, explore, and think about whatever you’d like.
Most adults discourage themselves from daydreaming, but experts say daydreaming and a healthy imagination often lead to more productive and creative ideas.

, Few things are more stressful than being responsible for everyone else and their schedules. To feel more like a kid, occasionally let someone else take charge.Ride in the backseat of the car instead of driving.
Let someone else decide what to eat for dinner.
Instead of managing an activity or outing, just sit back and enjoy the day.

, As adults we often feel like we have to follow rules all the time, but kids are often more adventurous. While you shouldn’t violate laws or ignore your responsibilities, try breaking a few unwritten rules of adulthood.


Stay up late on a work night.
Eat dessert first.
Watch a movie in the middle of the day.

Research.,
Listen.,
Acknowledge.,
Find out why your relative is depressed.,
Try to understand.,
Don't tell your elderly relative that life is still worth living and that this situation will improve and the sadness will get better.,
Be patient.,
Advise them to seek professional help.,
Bottom line (and this is from a depression sufferer): This is an evil disease.,
The best thing I heard during one depression period was from a friend who sincerely and simply said ""Man, I feel so bad for you.""",How to Help a Depressed Elderly Relative," If you don't know much about depression, it's harder to recognize if your family member really is depressed. It's not hard to learn a lot about depression. There are websites, books, magazine and newspaper articles, and of course, many doctors. Look it up and determine what type of depression your family member has or may have. Look over the symptoms, various medications and other treatments. The more you know, the easier it is to help.;
, Although you may think that the last thing your relative wants to do is talk to you about depression, you could be wrong. Sometimes a friend just needs someone to talk to. Actively listen without judging or giving advice. Depression is an issue that people sometimes feel they must hide, in order to maintain their usual life. Either that or they are only just coming to terms with it themselves, let alone the idea of letting other people in on it. However, from time to time, your relative may open up, or express the desire to talk to you. When this happens, be understanding and kind. Don't interrupt, don't try to convince them they're wrong, and try not to react in horror. It can be difficult to hear about how terrible your friend feels, but remember that they're trusting you. Value this trust and keep it close.

, Tell the person suffering from depression that you've noticed that they seem down or depressed lately.

, Did they just have a bad break-up or did their parents get divorced? Ask them if there is anything you can do to help. Ask carefully and gently, don't get upset if they're slow to tell you. Some people take longer than others to talk. If they say they don't have a reason, it's probably true.

, Every person's story is different, and so it is impossible to completely understand. However, keeping an open mind and putting yourself in your friend's shoes can help you come closer to them. Once you've done your research, you should know a lot more about depression. Apply the symptoms and emotions to yourself, and contemplate how you would feel if this was happening to you. Call upon things your friend has done or told you, and try to understand why and what they mean. In times of need, having someone understand can be all the relief in the world.

, This trivializes their pain and will not help.

, Because depression is heavy, slow moving and unpredictable, it can frustrate and even anger those who are trying to help. Remember that depression is a complex disease, and try to understand that the depressed person is not herself or himself right now. If your relative doesn't seem to appreciate your efforts, or is pushing you away, don't walk off in a temper. Give them space or give them comfort if they need it, and be there for them, no matter how much they believe you don't need to be.

, Depression is not something that goes away by itself after a while. This is probably the most difficult step. Sometimes, a depressed person is more than happy to talk about it, go to a therapist, have people know, and start the healing process. But other times, they will argue, refuse, deny things, and often get angry and defensive. It is a serious mental illness. However, just because your friend doesn't want you to get involved, it doesn't justify you standing there and letting the problem get worse. Be sensible. If your friend is sounding like they are harming themselves or are thinking of suicide, you need to alert somebody.Encourage the person to start with a family doctor or local mental health associations. Offer to help them find resources or counseling services.

, And you MUST know it IS a disease. Chemicals in the brain have become unbalanced for whatever reason and an ""outsider"" can no more expect a diabetic to cure him/herself than they can expect (or tell) a person with depression to ""pick themselves up; you have a great life"". And, trying to show them how they DO have a great life or how someone else ""is much worse off than they are"" is BAD advice. Repeat BAD. While you may think you are doing the rational, correct thing, you are not. Why? Because the person with depression will think ""they're right...I do have a good life or that person IS much worse off than I am...BUT...I still can't feel better. LOOK AT ME! I'm a true weakling who has no reason to be depressed. Now I feel even worse because I can't get myself out of this and because I don't have anything to be depressed about"". Then, things go from bad to worse. Listening and expressing your concern and sympathy is best. Get them to try to find a good counselor (it may take a few tries)....to try medication (and stick with it for at least 3 weeks...although that long a time is an absolute LIFETIME to the depressed)...give them things to look forward to each day or every other day...prayer...and, sadly, just plain old ""time"". This disease takes it's own sweet time to get flushed out of one's brain.

, That was it. That simple phrase. I had a good cry for a couple minutes and then I started to feel a bit better. For me, it was actually hearing someone NOT try to solve this disease for me with ""rational"" comments...it was just knowing of his care and concern for me in my illness that helped me more than any professional counseling or medication. Sometimes it happens that way...simple caring is always best.

Greet the person.,
Ask questions.,
Make small talk.,
Bring interesting props.,
Ask for advice.",How to Have a Conversation With an Elderly Person1," If you already know the person, let them know you’re glad to see them by saying hello cheerfully. Give them a hug if it’s appropriate. If you do not know the person, introduce yourself in a friendly tone of voice and offer a handshake., If you don’t know what to talk about, ask the person an open-ended question. Elderly people usually like to share their interesting stories and memories with others.If the person is a family member, you could ask them about events in your family history or about other family members you never had the opportunity to know.
If the person is a stranger, you could ask them about their family or what their life was like when they were your age.

, Not every discussion you have with an elderly person needs to be in-depth. Older people enjoy making polite small talk, too. You might use any previous knowledge you have about them or information in your surroundings to make small talk.For instance, you might say to your neighbor, ""I haven't seen your grandchildren in a while. When's the last time they visited?"" Or, you might say, ""What sort of books have you read lately, Mr. Henderson?""

, If you know ahead of time that you’ll be visiting an elderly person, consider bringing something to do or talk about. A few ideas include a family photo album (if you are visiting a family member), music from when the older person was young, or a homemade treat that you can enjoy together., If you’re in a sticky situation or you’re having trouble making a big decision, consider talking about it with an older person. Elderly people have collected a lot of life experience, and most of them are happy to share their hard-earned wisdom with others. They will probably be flattered that you asked them, too.You could say something like, “Uncle Joe, I’m having a hard time choosing between two jobs. Which do you think is more important, making a lot of money or enjoying your work?”

Don’t assume you’re too old to make a difference.",How to Improve Old Age Health During Your Youth," By now, you’ve probably heard of the “Mediterranean diet,” which prioritizes fruits and vegetables, lean proteins like seafood, and healthy fats like olive oil, among other details. A growing body of evidence indicates that this type of diet does indeed improve the odds of living a longer and healthier lifespan.Consult this wikiHow article for more information on the newest nutritional guidelines, healthy eating in general, and resources regarding the Mediterranean diet.;
, Jogging, swimming, biking, and other aerobic exercises are clearly beneficial to your health, but simply being regularly physically active — walking around, doing house- and yardwork, dancing, etc. — seems to be a clear point of differentiation between those who tend to live longer lives and those who do not. In simple terms, the more you move your body, the more likely you are to live longer.Even small changes can make a big difference. Walk to the market instead of driving. Get a push lawnmower instead of a riding mower. Plant a garden. Play with your kids or grandkids. Be more physically active every day, and you are likely to have more days in your future.

, Of all the lifestyle choices you can make, smoking is perhaps the surest way to reduce both your actual life expectancy and your “active life expectancy.” To name but one of many examples, smoking regularly during middle age (45-64) increases your chances of an eventual nursing home admission by over fifty percent.It is well known that smoking increases your likelihood of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and a host of other medical problems. Among these, it also increases your chances of developing osteoporosis and bone fractures, which can severely limit your activity level in old age.In fact, even secondhand smoke exposure during childhood and early adulthood may increase your risk of developing low bone mass, a precursor to osteoporosis.

, Getting adequate sleep — which, for most adults, is seven to nine hours per night — is beneficial at any age for your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Sleeping well in middle age, however, also appears to help maintain mental function not only the next day but also 30 years down the road.If you’re a young, busy professional or a parent to young children, you may say to yourself that you’ll sleep when you’re retired or the kids are grown up. Unfortunately, you can’t really “catch up” on sleep you missed in your younger years, and people over age 70 usually sleep less and less well regardless. Investing in good sleep in your earlier years is the best way to pay dividends later on.
Sleeping well is also good for your cardiovascular health, which is essential to an active lifestyle now and later in life.

, People who experience regular, excessive stress can face a host of health consequences — like heart disease and diabetes — that can impact longevity and overall quality of life. They may also have trouble sleeping and/or turn to unhealthy stress-relievers like smoking, which also negatively impact longevity. Excessive stress, then, might be seen as a “gateway” to many other factors that can hinder your old age health.Visit the excellent article How to Relieve Stress for a wealth of information on identifying stressors and avoiding, counteracting, and moderating stress.

, It is true that the oldest person in recorded history (she died at age 122!) smoked well past her 100th birthday, and that many thousands of healthy, active, athletic people die young of heart attacks and other diseases each year.There is simply no guarantee for a long or healthy life. That said, the more healthy choices you make throughout life, the better your odds of having a longer “active life expectancy” — a life without major health-related limitations.Eating healthier and exercising regularly are the most effective proven methods for promoting healthy aging, and the sooner you start, the better.
Making healthy lifestyle choices earlier in life benefits you now and into the future. It is also the better way to go because changing unhealthy behaviors (like smoking or overeating) is hard, and only gets harder the longer you have done them., If you’ve ever known a physically healthy older person afflicted by Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia, you know how essential brain health is in old age. While there is no guaranteed way to prevent these terrible conditions or mental decline in general, the same healthy choices that benefit your body are also good for your brain. For instance:Regular exercise and physical activity supports nerve cell formation and survival in parts of the brain that are essential to learning and memory.
A diet high in sugar and unhealthy fats increases the formation of proteins in the brain that are indicated in the development of Alzheimer’s.
Chronic, uncontrolled stress can damage the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for learning, memory, and emotional control.
Despite their increasing popularity, brain games, puzzles, apps, etc. have yet to be proven to improve long-term mental acuity.

, Any small amount of physical activity, even simply standing instead of sitting, is good for your health and may benefit your longevity. As relaxing as it may seem, sitting down and watching TV may be one of the worst things you can do to your expected lifespan. A 2011 study indicated that every hour spent sitting in front of the TV after age 25 reduces 22 minutes from your life expectancy.Try to make standing your default position. Stand instead of sitting while eating lunch, paying the bills, or, yes, watching TV.

, You may have heard it said that “a little hard work never hurt anyone,” and it turns out that hard-working people tend to live longer. You may think that dedicated workers experience more potentially harmful stress, but they also tend to be happier due to more social connections and a greater sense of pride and achievement. Such forms of happiness are good for your overall health and, in turn, your longevity.You probably also know the saying “work hard, play hard,” and driven people who do complement their hard work with relaxing, enjoyable, healthy activities are likely to derive even greater benefits in regards to longevity.

, Your personality and interests may or may not make you the life of the party, but it happens to be good for your life expectancy to make friends and interact socially regularly. Individuals who have multiple positive, healthy, deep relationships tend to live longer on average than “loners.”A loving partner, a close confidante, or a reliable friend provide comfort, solace, encouragement, and happiness, all of which are good for your body and mind. They also make you more likely to remain physically and mentally active.

, The older you get, the more eager you become to find that magical “fountain of youth” that will keep you feeling and looking young. Many pills, creams, exercises, etc. advertised as “anti-aging” are nothing but shams, but there are scientifically-encouraging possibilities for slowing age-related decline; however, the old standbys of regular exercise and healthy eating should still be your main focus. For instance, while there are many claims made about the anti-aging properties of antioxidants, there is no clear evidence to support them. Antioxidant-rich foods like fruits and vegetables are excellent food choices regardless, though.
Calorie-restricted diets (that provide all necessary nutrients), or chemicals that mimic calorie-restriction effects (including resveratrol and rapamycin) might possibly offer anti-aging benefits. Again, though, the evidence is limited and unclear at present.
Popular “anti-aging” hormone treatments — including HGH, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and DHEA, among others — have not shown evidence of effectiveness in this area, and include a significant risk of side effects.

, Whether you are 22 or 62, healthy lifestyle changes will benefit you for the rest of your life. Whether it’s quitting smoking, shedding some weight, or getting active, it is never too late to start improving your health today and tomorrow.It turns out that, after age 40 or so, age really is “just a number.” Your chronological age becomes a less significant indicator of your body’s aging process, while factors you can’t control (like genetics) and ones you can (like lifestyle choices) become more indicative of your overall health, “youth,” and longevity.So remember, even though you can’t turn back the clock, you can do a good deal to feel younger than your chronological age, no matter how far along in life you are.

Learn what a healthy plate of food looks like.,
Eat high quality protein.,
Look for important nutrients.,
Cut down on refined sugar and simple carbohydrates.,
Eat more fiber.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Grow Old and Stay Contented4," Keep in mind that although there are many familiar tools to remind you what your diet should consist of, like the USDA Food Pyramid, those methods are changing. Refamiliarize yourself with updated dietary suggestions like nutrition, calorie intake, and portion sizes.Dietary needs are different for everyone and are often based on a wide range of information. Consult your doctor or healthcare professional to find out the necessary information, like weight, sex, age, and medical conditions, required for making the most informed dietary decisions.

, Eating a significant amount of high-quality protein will help reduce depression, stress, and anxiety, and will even help with mental clarity. Try and resist eating low-quality industrially produced protein, like hotdogs and salamis, that are known for causing heart problems and cancers.Fish is a great low-fat source of protein that also happens to be rich in essential fatty and omega acids.Chicken breast, whether roasted, steamed, or baked, is another high-quality, low fat option.

, Making sure each meal has at least some of the necessary nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle can have tremendous effects on your health.


Eat healthy fats, like monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and omega-3.
Be sure to consume vitamin B and vitamin D. Both vitamin B and D are essential, especially to those over 50, as your body begins to naturally produce less of them., Simple carbohydrates and sugars often spike blood sugars levels causing overeating and mood swings. Cutting down on these ingredients, while replacing them with natural sugars and complex carbohydrates, will improve your health immensely.Try and avoid rice and white flour. Instead, replace them with whole grains or beans.
Avoid sodas and sweetened drinks.
Instead of adding sugar to your meals, try and find sweetness naturally, like in fruits.

Opt for whole grains rather than processed and simple carbohydrates.
Eat whole fruit rather than drinking fruit juice.

Drinking enough water a day will help you avoid urinary tract infections while keeping your brain and metabolism functioning to the best of its ability.Getting older can often mean a dulling of thirst. Keep small routines, like drinking a glass of water every time you leave the room, to make sure you stay hydrated.

Find a good environment to talk.,
Speak clearly.,
Provide choices.,
Make eye contact.,
Allow the person time to think.,
Let the person know when you are leaving.",How to Have a Conversation With an Elderly Person2," Talk somewhere quiet and calm, where neither you nor the other person will get distracted or overwhelmed. Turn off any radios or televisions in the background so you can hear each other. Sit somewhere the older person can see your face clearly, so they can read your lips if they need to., Enunciate your words distinctly, speak loudly enough to be easily heard, and don’t talk too fast. Don’t shout at the person, though, unless they ask you to speak up more.If the elderly person has trouble following what you’re saying, you may need to slow down or use shorter sentences. This doesn’t mean you should talk down to the older person, though.

, If you’re offering the older person something or trying to find out what they want to do, give them two or three choices. This will give them a sense of control over the situation without overwhelming them with too many options.For instance, don’t just say, “Where would you like to go today?” Instead, say, “Would you rather go to the park or a coffee shop?”

, Meet the older person’s eyes when they’re talking to you, even if you are having a hard time understanding them. Making eye contact shows the person that you’re paying attention to them and care about what they’re saying., During your conversation, the elderly person may need to pause to find the right word, recover their train of thought, or reminisce about something. Wait patiently for them to finish talking. Don’t try to complete their sentence for them or find the word they’re looking for unless they ask you to., If the elderly person has dementia or gets confused easily, make sure they understand when you are leaving. Say goodbye to them and tell them when they can expect to see you again. Giving them a hug or a handshake is another good way to signal the end of the conversation."

Listen carefully as the person talks.,
Remember that older people are just people like you.",How to Have a Conversation With an Elderly Person3," Notice whether the person you’re talking to is hard of hearing, has memory problems, or otherwise has trouble communicating.

If the person seems to get confused easily, use shorter sentences and be patient as you get your point across.
If they have memory loss, avoid asking too many questions at once. Also, avoid ""why"" questions, which may frustrate them. , Talk to them like you would any other adult. If they show no signs of confusion, there’s no need to simplify your vocabulary or over-explain things to them.Many older people feel insulted when others talk to them as if they are children, even if those people don’t mean any harm.

, Give the elderly person your full attention, even if they ramble. Make sure you’re understanding them by asking questions related to what they are saying. Don’t look around the room or check your watch while the other person is talking, since that will make you seem bored.For instance, if the person mentions living in another country, you could ask them to tell you more about that part of their life.

, Elderly people were once your age, and they’ve experienced the same feelings and many of the same life events as you. Treat the person with the same respect and courtesy you would expect from others, and look for common ground that will help you connect with each other.Think about how you want people to talk to you someday when you are elderly, and use that as a guideline for yourself.

Estimate using your height.,
Order a 36-inch cane if you're of average height.,
Borrow a cane from someone of similar size.,
Use a measuring tape.,
Measure differently if you're hunched over.,
Get professional assistance.,
Try different cane lengths.,
Consider what your cane is for.,
Choose a grip that works for you.,
Don't forget about the tip.",How to Determine the Correct Height of Walking Canes," If you don't have a tape measure and you're ordering a cane online, you can estimate the size you might need by using your height as a general guide. A person between 76 to 79 inches tall should order a 38-inch cane, whereas those between 72 to 75 inches tall may find that a 37-inch cane suits them better.The length of the cane you order should drop one inch for every three inches that you are under the suggested height ranges. For example, a person standing 64 to 67 inches tall should buy a 35-inch cane.


Many canes are height adjustable, but some are not (particularly those carved from wood).;
, Because many people (particularly men) fall within the height range of 68-71 inches, most canes are manufactured or adjusted to 36 inches in length.As a default, some cane manufacturers send 36-inch canes to online customers automatically unless they specify a different length.


Walking with a cane that's either too long or short can lead to more aches and pains, especially in your elbow, shoulder and neck.

, If a friend or family member temporarily needed a cane to help recover from an accident or injury, and if they are the same height as you, then ask them if you can borrow or buy it. If they were properly measured for the cane and tend to wear similar shoes to you, then their cane may be a great fit for you.


When trying to correlate your height to the length of a cane, remember to factor in the height of your shoes because you likely won't be using the cane without them.

, The most precise way to determine the correct cane length for you is by measuring the distance between your hand and the ground while you wear shoes. With your arm hanging straight down at your side, the top of your cane should line up with the crease in your wrist.In other words, the number of inches between your wrist and the floor is the length that your cane should be.


With the cane in hand, your elbow should bend at a comfortable angle — about 15 degrees or so.Bending your elbow a little more is okay if you're primarily using the cane for balance instead of weight support.

, You should consider measuring yourself differently if you have a condition that does not allow you to stand up straight. In this case, you'll likely need a shorter cane than that normally dictated by your height. Thus, measure the distance between the floor and wherever your wrist is as you walk with shoes on. Get a friend to help if need be.


If your cane is too short, you might lean to one side — which can throw you off balance.

, If you find it too difficult to make the appropriate measurements for your walking cane, then your best bet is to have your physician or physical therapist help you with it. Try asking your doctor to write you a prescription for a cane. You may also want go to a medical supply store and ask a sales associate to help you out with finding the right cane for you. Your doctor or a sales associate can also recommend the most appropriate material for your cane, as well as the handle shape and type of grip.


Normally the hand you hold the cane with is on the opposite side of the injury, but sometimes it's the same side — your doctor or physiotherapist can determine the correct side for your situation.

, Although measuring the distance from your wrist to the floor is the ""gold standard"" of determining cane length, you may prefer a slightly different height based on many physiological factors, such as the flexibility or strength in your hands, wrists, elbows or shoulders. For example, if you can't bend your elbow very much, you might need a cane that's a little shorter.


Try a few different lengths of canes while at the medical supply store or your physician's or physiotherapist's office before determining the perfect size for your particular condition.
Choose a walking cane based on function as well as personal preference.

, Many people who carry a walking cane use it primarily for balance (especially when walking on unbalanced or slippery surfaces), as opposed to needing it to support the majority of their body weight. The length of your cane doesn't need to be as precise if you're using it mainly for balance instead of weight bearing / support.


There are different kinds of canes. Some have one tip while other have four tips. The ones with four tips provide more stability but these canes are harder to use.
Not all walking canes are designed to support all of your body weight, especially if you're obese.As such, perhaps you should consider crutches or a wheelchair if you need more support.

, Canes also have different types of grips. For example, you can get a cane with a foam handle grip with or without a cuff that fits around your arm. You can also get a cane that has a large handle to make it easier for you to hold onto.Try gripping different types of cane handles to see what feels the most comfortable for you.

, Walking canes typically come with rubber or plastic tips on the end, which provide grip but they also affect the height of the cane.So when measuring the cane, always take into consideration the size of the tip. Furthermore, when the tips wear down with use, the cane's height will reduce somewhat, so remember to replace worn out tips.


The pliable rubber tips on the ends of canes grip the floor much like the tread on tires grip the road. Make sure your cane has a tip that is in good shape. If you need to replace the tip, then go to a medical supply store and buy a new one.
When buying a cane, make sure the rubber tip is supple and the tread is in good shape.

Time the move.,
Find the right CCRC.",How to Find a Continuing Care Retirement Community," If you are looking for the ideal situation for senior family members, consider a Continuing Care Retirement Community or CCRC. A Continuing Care Retirement Community is a relaxed, comfortable, and secure environment that offers active senior housing, assisted living and nursing home care all in one place. 55+ communities offer mature living without extended care options.


The Continuing Care Retirement Community concept is to provide elderly residents with social and physical care aspects to enable a long and happy existence. When care is required, it is available on a short-term or long-term basis as needed. The goal is to recuperate and return to independent living.
For example, when a resident undergoes surgery, they temporarily move into the nursing or assisted living section to receive personalized care and physical rehabilitation aimed at building strength to move back to their independent living section. During the time they are recuperating, their active senior home awaits their return. If they are unable to return to independent living, the move to assisted living or nursing care is seamless, as they remain within the CCRC family.;
, These offer conclave settings of individual, one story homes (typically) with community recreational facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts, and even golf courses in some cases. Restaurants and other meal options are not usually included, but may be, so check what options are available in the community you are researching.

, Once you have decided that a CCRC is the best choice, the time to move into a Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) is when you are healthy enough to live independently and take advantage of the many social and health related activities offered.


Residences range from single, detached homes with garages to apartment-style living.
Communal facilities often include fitness centers, recreation rooms with pool tables, swimming pools, art studios and dining rooms or restaurants.
You buy into the CCRC and own your home, free to make reasonable modifications to truly make it your home.

, The CCRC aims to provide residents with care to enable them to live a dignified and productive life. When residents require assistance with facets of their life, such as dressing, laundry, cooking, managing medications, which they can no longer do for themselves, a cheerful apartment is provided where extra care is available with minimal additional costs.


Residents in the Assisted Living area of the community still have their own apartment and are free to come and go as are the folks in the independent living residences.
The communal facilities and social activities are still enjoyed by those living in Assisted Living arrangements.

, Whether on a short-term or long-term arrangement, CCRC's usually provide their residents with on-site nursing care. There is an additional cost tier for these services. Nursing home residents remain a part of the community because they can visit with their CCRC friends and keep up with community news and activities as they are able.

, There are various financial arrangements from community to community. Generally, there is a one-time fee to hold a space on the waiting list for the residence best matching your needs.


These typically range from a couple hundred dollars to a few thousand. Once a residence becomes available, the one-time entrance deposit is required. Again, these fees vary depending on size and location within the community.
Once moved in, there is a monthly fee that generally covers 1-2 daily meals, general community upkeep, monthly housekeeping, transportation to medical appointments, and basic laundry needs.
There are always options to buy additional amenities. These costs will be explained in detail when you visit the CCRC being considered.

, As already stated, the best time to consider moving to a CCRC is when you are healthy. Many seniors find it easier to acclimate to a new lifestyle when they are mentally and physically fit. CCRCs offer many activities and amenities aimed at making active senior life relaxed and enjoyable. Once in a CCRC, you automatically have the extended care options available if and when they are needed.


Finding reliable, reputable and affordable extended care options at the time they are needed severely limits your options and adds costs. CCRCs have sprung up everywhere, so it's easy to find communities in desirable retirement locations or close to where you already live and have your ties.

, There is a wealth of information on the Internet about Continuing Care Retirement Communities. Keep in mind, these are not the same as 55+ Retirement Communities, which do not offer extended care. Many CCRCs are affiliated with religious or fraternal groups. These usually are subsidized and offer pricing benefits. Most CCRCs do not provide costing information on their web sites, but some do. In either case, you will need to make an appointment and visit the community to learn all they have to offer.

Look for signs of weakening physical condition.,
Look for changes in behavior.,
Have the senior evaluated by a specialist.,
Examine options to keep the senior at home.",How to Find a Nursing Home for a Senior1," One or more of the following signs may mean that a loved one may need the care a nursing home can provide:


Unsteadiness when standing, walking on getting onto or off of his or her feet.
Difficulty eating with utensils.
Readily gets tired from light to moderate activity.
Excessive weight gain or loss.
Unusually thirsty.
Urine odor on person or in the home, indicating incontinence.;
, Older people may suffer from depression or a more serious mental condition such as the after-effects of a stroke or dementia. Some of the signs that a senior may need the care of a nursing home include:


Decline in personal hygiene (wearing stained or smelly clothing)
Inattention to household tasks (unopened mail, unpaid bills, piles of dirty laundry, un-mowed grass, spoiled food or burnt cooking utensils)
Memory problems (frequently gets lost in familiar places, misses appointments, forgets to take medications)
Seems withdrawn or avoids contact with family and friends

, While your family doctor may be able to give the person a complete physical, it may be necessary to refer him or her to a someone with specialized training, such as a gerontologist, geriatric nurse practitioner or neurologist.

, If the senior is having problems in only a few areas, such as having difficulty in cooking and cleaning, but not in getting around, community programs available through local social service agencies, such as Meals on Wheels or cleaning services, may be enough. You may also need to make modifications to the home, such as installing grab bars or raised toilet seats in the bathroom, to help seniors with difficulty in standing and sitting.


Consider also the opinions of other family members and close friends, as well as your own ability to care for the senior. Being a caregiver can be taxing and at times frustrating; it may be necessary to put a loved one in a nursing home for your own well being as well as his or hers.
Another option to consider is hiring a geriatric care manager to provide in-home care or consultation, particularly if you live in another city or if there are few other available alternatives to a nursing home.

Determine your ability to pay for nursing home care.,
Research available nursing homes online.,
Consult with experts in nursing home care for recommendations.,
Determine the right balance of criteria for your situation.,
Visit prospective nursing homes.,
Interview the nursing home's administrator and staff.,
Ask residents and their families about the quality of care the home delivers.",How to Find a Nursing Home for a Senior2," Determine which nursing homes are covered by private medical insurance or government funding.


In the case of Medicaid, many times it is necessary for the person placed in a nursing home to spend down his or her own assets before Medicaid funding kicks in to cover the cost of ongoing nursing home care.

, You may want to begin your search with an online search engine; if so, use the most specific keywords you can when searching for a nursing home, such as ""around-the-clock care"" if that's what your loved one requires. You can also use government Web sites such as Medicare's Nursing Home Compare, independent review sites such as CareGrade.com or SeniorsApprove.com, or background-checking sites such as LexisNexis' ChoiceTrust.


You can also contact individual nursing homes through their Web sites; many have online forms that let you specify the kind of services you're looking for.

, These experts may include family doctors or specialists in geriatric medicine, as well as social service agency representatives, clergy and state and county health departments. They may have a working knowledge of which nursing homes have good overall track records and can direct you to the people to contact at those homes to arrange an interview.


You may also want to consult with your state's long-term care ombudsman, whose office usually has insight into the rankings for a given nursing home as well as a record of complaints filed against that home and their resolution.

, This requires evaluating not only the services available and what they cost, along with the quality of care, but also the distance from your love one's original home to permit close family and friends to visit regularly. Deciding which items are most important will help you build a list of nursing homes to visit. In some cases, how close the nursing home is may outweigh cost and quality of care.

, Evaluate the homes for overall appearance and cleanliness. Look at how well-staffed the home is on both weekdays and weekends and get a sense of the overall attitude of the people who work there, as well as how frequently the residents are visited by how full the home's parking lot is. Look at the residents themselves to see if they appear clean, well-fed, happy and active or messy, malnourished, sullen and bored.


Take along copies of any nursing home checklists you may have found online. They'll help you determine what you should be looking at if you don't trust your own common sense.
Be aware that a strong antiseptic smell may mask odors of urine or fecal matter, indicating that the nursing home has difficulty handling incontinent residents, as may having a large number of residents on urethral catheters.
Listen as well as look. If you hear the staff gossiping about someone's late-night partying or hear a resident's plaintive, unanswered cry of ""I want something to eat!,"" the home may not provide adequate care for your loved one.

, In addition to looking over the nursing home inside and outside, interview the home's administrator and members of the nursing staff to evaluate whether or not the nursing home would be suitable for your loved one.


Ask the administrator or director of nursing how the home handles general issues such as nutrition, falls and incontinence and specifically how they will provide for your loved one's individual needs. You should also get copies of recent health inspection reports and ask how the home remedied problems identified in those reports.
Ask the staff about the workload, employee morale and turnover rates, as well as the ratio of staff nurses to nurses from medical temporary services and how many families hire private nurses to assist in their loved one's care.
Ask both the administrators and staff about any upcoming changes in ownership. If the nursing home is to undergo a change in management, the change could be either beneficial or negative. You'll need to investigate the incoming owner as you did the home itself.

, It's helpful to corroborate the information given by the nursing home's administrator and staff with the opinions of the residents and the observations of their family members to give you a more complete picture of the home.


Ask residents how well they're treated by the nursing staff and whether they have the same nurses caring for them regularly. Also find out if they need and get help with eating, bathing or going to the bathroom.
Ask residents' family members for their observations about how the home handles nutrition, falls and incontinence and how well it meets their loved ones' specific needs. Also note their comments on the residents' quality of life.

Find out if the elderly relative has any dietary restrictions.,
Decide what food is safe to bring your elderly relative.,
Help your relative to sit comfortably.,
Reassure your relative.,
Assess your relative.,
Check in with your elderly relative every once in a while to find out if they've had enough.,
Be kind, respectful, and loving.",How to Feed an Elderly Relative in the Hospital," For example: Do they have diabetes? food allergies? difficulty chewing certain types of food? difficulty swallowing? do they need thickened fluids? You can ask your relative's healthcare worker if you don't know of any dietary restrictions. And of course, you can ask the patient directly when possible.;
, Find out what he or she likes. If the relative asks for a treat like ice cream or fast food, that would be all right for a one-time treat. However, most of the time, try to bring a healthy meal - one with protein, vegetables, and a starch. Whole grains and raw vegetables are sometimes difficult for the elderly person to digest, so be sure you know what they are capable of eating.


In most cases, the hospital will provide the food, taking into consideration all the dietary needs and restrictions of the patient. If you wish to change from the usual meal, let the staff know that you'll be bringing in a favorite meal in place of the usual meal.

, Once you have the meal in front of you, be sure your elderly relative is sitting in a comfortable, upright position. This is important so that the person can swallow the food safely without choking on it.


Some elderly people who are not able to feed themselves may spill food when trying to get it to their mouths, or will drop food from their mouths. Perhaps a towel or adult bib is called for to keep their clothes clean.

, Always talk patiently to the person you are feeding, let them know you are ready to provide another spoonful or forkful of food. Don't just hold the utensil in front of them, waiting for them to open their mouths (although this is sometimes the natural rhythm that occurs). Ask them if they would like a sip of water to help them swallow the food.


Ask if you can wipe or dab the mouth when food is stuck around the mouth, instead of just presuming.

, See if they do better with a bit of communication, or peaceful concentration on the task at hand. Generally, mealtime is a social time, but not always. Sometimes swallowing is difficult and the patient may choke or sputter if there is too much distraction (talking, trying to respond to your questions). Bear this in mind when talking to them as they eat.

, You do not need to finish the whole plate. On the other hand, it may take a long time for them to finish a small meal. Just because they eat slowly does not mean they're full.

, Enjoy yourself. Make the meal a peaceful experience. Remember, someone had to feed you sometime in your life, or you wouldn't be here.

Talk to your family member.",How to Evaluate a Nursing Home," Start by doing an online search for nursing homes in your area to get an idea of what your options are. Great resources for finding services include Eldercare Locator, Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs), Centers for Independent Living (CILs) and Medicare Offices. Doing basic preliminary research will give you a sense of what is available for your family member. Look on the websites of nursing homes in your area to see which nursing homes offer the medical services and attention that your family member needs. You can use this research to compare prices and decide your price range.


Look into information on specialized care. Make sure the nursing home has specialized care if your family member needs it and ask how they separate specialized care residents from residents who don’t need it.;
, Once you have selected a few nursing homes that you like look online for reviews. There are websites where people who have used services can rate what their experience was like, such as Yelp. There are also many blogs and retirement and nursing home websites with reviews from residents and residents’ families.

, Visit the U.S. Medicare website to compare the quality of nursing homes. The website includes information such as the number of residents, number of licensed staff, if the home is for-profit or non-profit, and other basic information. The website also tells you if the home is Medicare or Medicaid certified. There is also the overall rating and detailed information on inspection results to give you an idea of the safety, care, and health of the nursing home., Call the nursing home you are interested in and ask for references. You can call their references and ask for information on families of residents to get an idea of what residents and their families think of the nursing home you are interested in. If someone says that their family member was neglected in the nursing home, you might want to reconsider choosing that nursing home.

, Every time somebody sends in a complaint about a nursing home for things such as abuse and neglect to residents, it is documented and put on file. Obtaining public records varies from state to state.In some state (such as Oregonand Minnesota) this information is online on the state government’s website.
You can email, call, or visit the department in your state in charge of nursing home complaints (usually the Department of Health or Human Services), if you can’t find the complaint registry online.
Search Medicare’s Nursing Home Compare by visiting https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html


, Search news databases online for the name of the nursing home to see if it has appeared in the news for anything negative. Do not choose a nursing home with news stories about residents being abused, neglected, or scammed.

, Once you nail down what nursing homes you like, call them and ask them if they are taking new residents. There is no point in going to visit a nursing home that is not even accepting new people., When you arrive at the nursing home to visit, pay attention to the surroundings of the home. Notice the area of town and the security outside of the nursing home. Is the nursing home easy for someone to break into? The home should be in a quiet and safe neighborhood, not a noisy and dangerous part of town., You want your family member to live in an aesthetically pleasing environment. This could be where they spend their last years of life, so you want them to be in a cheerful setting. The décor can really determine the mood of an environment. Choose somewhere where the decorations and furniture look nice, well designed, and pleasing., There should be safety devices throughout the home that are in good shape. There should be working smoke detectors, handrails, sprinklers, and bathroom grab bars. Ask about the medical staff and what happens in an emergency. Are there medical providers such as a physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant or nurse that assess the residents on a regular basis? Do they call 9-1-1? What is the emergency procedure? Find out if they have a Medicare and/or Medicaid certification.

, Nursing homes might smell poorly because of the nature of the environment. A strong smell, particularly of urine, could mean that the nursing home is not being cleaned well.


Ask how often diapers are changed. They should be changed whenever it is necessary and not longer than every two hours., The visiting hours should be when you are available, not when you always have work or have an obligation. The home should have the hours clearly posted. You can ask the staff about the visiting hours if you don’t see them.Don’t be afraid to ask questions. You can use a “Nursing home checklist” when you visit to ask about residents’ life. The list can be found at https://medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare.

, When you visit the home, tour the cafeteria and ask if you can try the meal being served. If you or your family member thinks the food is poor quality or tastes bad, the home is likely not going to be a good fit. Appetites can naturally decline with age, so nursing home food should look appealing and taste good.If you are unable to try the food yourself, observe the residence during a mealtime. It is a bad sign if you notice multiple residents barely eating their food.
Ask for a weekly menu to get a sense of what foods are served over time.
Ask whether there is a nutritionist on staff to ensure that residents' nutritive needs are met.

, Residents only being called general names such as, “Grandma,” is a bad sign. The staff might not have taken the time to remember patient’s names. It could also mean they don’t respect the residents if they did not take the time to ask what they want to be called which is likely their first name or title and surname., Ask them how often they work and how long their shifts are. Staff who work a lot of doubles and seem tired and stressed might reflect on how the nursing home treats their residents. Try to find out whether there is a lot of staff turnover. If people don't stay, it's likely that the facility is poorly run.


Also pay attention to how the staff members treat each other. Staff members who are rude to each other might also be rude to their residents. The staff should be focused on the residents instead of spending their time gossiping to each other., Residents that are up and about is a good sign that they aren’t forced to be cooped up in their rooms all day. You want a nursing home with a calendar of daily activities or activities that can be brought to the residents’ rooms if they need it. Pay attention to the residents' mood and if they seem generally happy or not., Don’t automatically assume that any bruise means that there is abuse happening, but do look for finger-shaped bruises and bruises in places that don’t usually occur when you fall (such as the face, stomach, or back)., They can be unavoidable as your family member ages, but not always. A family member who is capable of walking around, being out of bed, and does not refuse food should not have bedsores. Ask the staff why your family member is not getting out of bed and why they are spending a long time in the same position if you see bedsores. If your family member is confined to a bed, ask the staff how often they are being rotated., Pay attention to how the staff reacts when a resident falls. Watch if they check for injuries and if they keep a close eye on the resident. If your parent falls or has a medical emergency how were you notified? How long did they wait to notify you? Did they call 9-1-1? Were doctors helping your family member immediately? Don’t ignore it if you think a medical emergency was handled poorly., Ask your family member how they are liking the nursing home. Ask them how they like the food, the social activities, the staff, and the environment. Notice if they seem happy or not. If they have a complaint, don't brush it aside. Address it with the staff — it might be an easy fix."
"
Assess the situation.,
Consider external factors.,
Ask questions.,
Listen carefully.,
Don't take it personally.",How to Deal with a Cranky Senior Citizen1," When dealing with an irritable elderly person, your first step is to try to figure out what the problem is. Is it evident what is bothering them? For example, do they seem to be struggling to get groceries inside the house during nasty weather? If so, that's probably why they're cranky.If you can't tell at a glance what the problem is, try to dig a little deeper. If your neighbor or relative seems cranky for no discernible reason, try to use communication to figure out what might be the problem.;
, Keep in mind that elderly people are often dealing with an extra set of attributes that can affect their mood. For instance, as people age, their bodies are changing. It is entirely possible that the elderly person in question is dealing with physical pain that you don't know about. That could certainly affect their mood.Many older citizens are on several different types of medication. Often, different prescriptions can have negative affects on a person's mood. Be aware that your elderly friend might be crabby because of medication, not because of an immediate issue.

, When trying to figure out why a person is irritable, the most straight-forward and effective way is to ask questions. You don't have to pry, but you can try asking a series of open-ended questions. By opening up a conversation, you might be able to ascertain the cause of irritability.For example, instead of just saying ""How are you?"", use a more open-ended version such as, ""How's your day going? What's on your agenda for the day?"". Using open-ended questions will not only provide you with more information, but will allow your relative to vent some frustrations.
Make sure to speak clearly. Some older people suffer from hearing loss. They might not necessarily be cranky--maybe they just didn't hear you when you said hello.

, When you initiate a conversation with an elderly person, make sure that you are being an active listener. Focus all of your attention of the conversation. Make the older person feel like you really value what they are saying.There are several ways you can demonstrate that you are fully engaged in the conversation. Make sure to make eye contact. Also paraphrase what the elderly person is saying, and ask questions throughout the conversation.

, Remember that when an elderly person is irritable, it likely is not your fault. Sometimes you might be the only person they are interacting with that day, so they unfairly take their anger out on you. Try not to take their negativity to heart.When you remember not to take it personally, you will become more objective. That will allow you to step back from the situation and more clearly assess the problem.

"
"
Change your perspective.,
Take a deep breath.,
Take a break.,
Focus on the positives.",How to Deal with a Cranky Senior Citizen2," Remember that generational gaps can cause issues in communication. When there is a big difference in age, there can also be significant differences in opinions and and views.Try to be respectful of the elderly person's view point. Shift your perspective to try to see where they are coming from.


Asking questions can be a great way to help you change your perspective. Getting more information can help you understand the elderly person's point of view.

, Sometimes it can be very frustrating to deal with an irritable person. It can even feel like nothing you do is right. Often the best thing you can do is just to calm yourself down and mentally reset.Practice deep breathing. Take several lengthy inhales, and take measured exhales. This will lower your heart-rate--and your stress level.

, It can sometimes be very useful to take a time-out from a frustrating situation. If you feel like the other person's cranky nature is negatively affecting you, it is normal to feel like you need a mental break. Taking a step back can allow you to calm down and return to the conversation when you are mentally refreshed., Remember that you are interacting with this person for a reason. Chances are that there is something that you like about them. For example, maybe it is your elderly aunt who is routinely cranky. Try to focus on remembering the fun you used to have making Christmas cookies with her.If the irritable person is a fairly new acquaintance, it might be a little harder to think of something positive. Try to find a detail that is positive. For example, if the cranky person is your neighbor, maybe focus on the fact that they never have noisy parties.

"
"
Offer to help.,
Be empathetic.,
Ask for assistance.,
Provide resources.,
Remain positive.",How to Deal with a Cranky Senior Citizen3," Once you have determined what the problem is you can extend an offer to help. Make sure that your offer is genuine--do not offer to help if you are unable to or do not sincerely want to. Instead, extend an sincere and concrete offer of assistance.For example, your elderly mother might be having difficulty taking care of her home. Ask her if she would like you to hire a cleaning service or help her find an assisted care living situation.

, Being empathetic means that you try to put yourself in the other person's shoes. Once you know why this person is cranky, try to think about how you would feel in their situation. Then try to determine what would make you feel better.Elderly people are often lonely and this can account for their unfriendly disposition. Offer your company, and suggest an activity the two of you can do together, such as playing a card game.

, You might not be able to solve the other person's problem. Especially if you do not know the elderly person well, the situation might be out of your hands. What you can do instead is ask for assistance. Try reaching out to close friends or relatives of the elderly person to see what they suggest.

, Most cities have senior centers where older people can go for recreational activities. Other organizations, such as churches and libraries, also offer programs geared towards seniors. You could look up some local resources and provide that information to your neighbor or relative. This could be potentially very helpful and go a long way towards lifting their mood., It can be very draining to deal with a cranky senior citizen. The most important thing you can do is to remain positive. Remember that you are doing a good thing by being kind and helpful. Even if your help is not obviously appreciated, you are probably making an impact.Smile. When it is difficult to remain positive, try putting a smile on your face. Even if it feels false at first, the simple act of smiling will make you feel better and help you maintain a good attitude.

Accept that your marriage will change.,

Exercise to relieve stress.",How to Cope when Your Spouse Has Dementia," Know that your marriage will not be an equal partnership anymore. Eventually, you will have to take on all of the responsibilities of managing your household, caring for your family, and even helping your spouse with the smallest of tasks. Your role as spouse will gradually transform into the caregiver, or even “parent” in the relationship.


For instance, you will likely have to do all of the household chores, make all of the decisions regarding your family and home, and provide constant supervision of your spouse.;
, People with dementia often take on new personalities and may lash out at their spouses and caregivers. Not taking these behaviors personally is difficult, but necessary. Understanding the cause of the aggressive behavior may help you to not become offended by your spouse, and help them in the process.


Take a look at the situation and what is really making your spouse upset. This is where really knowing your spouse comes in handy. For example, your spouse may not appreciate being fussed over or having you speak for them. Engaging in an argument will likely only make the situation worse. Instead, try to shift the focus away from the matter, while speaking in a calm and reassuring voice.For example, if your spouse says “I really don’t need you standing over my shoulder all day long. Go away,” rather than arguing, say “I’ll give you some space, then. But you can expect me to check in on you every half hour.”

, When you said your vows, you probably didn’t plan on marrying someone you would have to take care of completely. You likely envisioned a relationship in which you both put in equal amounts of work and when this doesn’t happen, resentment is often common.


Feeling angry and resentful of the situation is normal, but if you let those negative emotions become directed toward your spouse, you will likely make your new reality even worse. Instead of getting mad at your spouse, get mad at the disease.
Write down a list of what you are most upset about, including changed retirement plans, missed vacations, and the like. In a few days, look at the list again and determine whether these topics are really that upsetting and if there are any alternatives. For instance, if your spouse is in the early stages of dementia, you can likely still travel and do the things you always planned together., Because of the cognitive decline of your spouse, you may not be able to experience the emotional and physical intimacy you once did. Along with physical impairments, your spouse may become depressed, which can also affect their sex drive. Additionally, you may not feel attracted to your partner anymore because of these changes. Don’t feel guilty about this loss of attraction; you can find other ways to connect.New ways of connecting may include reading books together, going for walks, talking, and experiencing things together that you couldn’t before due to other obligations. Take advantage of all the time you spend together.

, Although lots of things have changed since your spouse developed dementia, if you think about it, much is also the same. Perhaps your spouse always had a sideways grin when they were caught doing something naughty like drinking from the milk carton. Or, maybe your spouse still dances wildly to their favorite music like they did when they were younger. Take note of these small ways in which you still have your spouse rather than focusing on all that you’ve lost.


Being positive also means being optimistic about the future. Dementia is not a death sentence.Many people continue to lead healthy, fruitful lives with this condition. Of course, some modifications may need to be made, but your spouse can likely continue to engage in many activities that they once enjoyed.

, Taking on the role of caregiver is an overwhelming and stressful concept for many spouses. However, understand that it is OK to ask for help. You don’t always have to do everything on your own, and asking help from your children, friends, siblings, and in-laws isn’t a sign of weakness.


Something as simple as asking someone to make you dinner once a week or helping you to clean your home can make a huge difference in your emotional well-being. Chances are, your loved ones will be more than happy to help.Reach out by saying “Hey, dear, I know you have a lot going on, but I could use some help with your dad. Could you come by one day this week and sit with him while I run errands?”

, No one understands what you are going through better than those who are experiencing it for themselves. Joining a support group allows you to talk freely about all of the emotions you are feeling and receive feedback and encouragement from those who are in the same place as you.You don’t have to worry about receiving criticism or judgment from those in the support group, so you may be able to discuss exactly how you feel about these changes and your new responsibilities for the first time.

, Know that it is not a sign of weakness to ask for help from a professional. Along with caring for yourself, you now have to take care of someone who is likely difficult, emotional, and physically and cognitively impaired.Hiring a caregiver to give your spouse a bath, prepare meals, give medical care, and perform other tasks can help take some of the pressure off of you and make your life easier.

, Caregivers are often under constant stress and pressure, and it is common for them to experience depression and anxiety because of it. Experiencing grief over your changed spouse may also cause you to feel down. Talk to a doctor about seeking therapy or taking prescription medication to help treat your issue. Doing so will enable you to be in better mental health to take care of your spouse., Caregivers commonly lose touch with activities they enjoy, as they often feel they don’t have time for anything else except looking after their spouses. In addition to adding to the level of resentment you may feel, depriving yourself of activities you enjoy can also negatively affect the way you take care of your spouse. Make time to engage in your hobbies, even if it means asking someone to relieve you for a few hours a week so that you are able to participate.


Taking care of your mental, emotional and spiritual needs is just as important as caring for your spouse. Fortunately, many hobbies can be enjoyed without even leaving the home, such as reading, knitting, doing yoga, painting, meditating, and spending time with growing grandchildren., Exercising can help your emotional and physical well-being, which is beneficial to both you and your spouse. Spending just a few minutes a day walking, running, participating in tai chi or yoga, or riding a bike can make you feel better emotionally and physically.You may be able to exercise with your spouse during the early stages of dementia, which gives you a chance to connect with your spouse and support their physical and mental well-being.

This could be chronic disorders like COPD, diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure. Consider illnesses like pneumonia, or damage caused by falling or accidents. These are concerns that you parents may not be able to heal completely on their own and may require further assistance of a senior residence.;
, Mental disorders in the elderly may be hard to diagnose. Make note of anything that seems out of the ordinary with your parents including forgetfulness, depression, or anxiety.These mental disorders can progress with age and your parents may require further assistance to live a happy and safe life. Signs of mental distress may include:


Forgetting dates or appointments
Having trouble recalling names
Challenges in planning or solving problems
Difficulty with day-to-day tasks or routines
General confusion
Difficulty telling time
Unable to visualize images or relationships (For example, picturing or describing concrete items may be difficult.)
Trouble with speech and/or writing
Withdrawal from social activities
Changes in behavior, mood, and/or personality

, According to the National Center for Assisted Living, 54% of seniors aged 85 or older require at least some assistance with daily tasks.. If your parents or loved ones are having difficulty in the following tasks, it may be time to consider moving them into a senior residence.


Navigating stairs
Bathing
Dressing
Eating
Maintaining a clean house or yard
Paying bills
Tending pets or plants
Taking medications

, Signs of unkemptness may be the beginning warning signs of other, more problematic medical concerns. If you see a decline in your parents appearance, such as changes in cleanliness, you may need to investigate for further problems.

, Humans are living longer and longer lives. Your parents have not have financially planned for a future. Or, medical bills may make it difficult for your parents to live the retirement they wanted. Whatever the reason, moving into an assisted living or retirement home may help the burden of debt.Sometimes, insurance companies may even pay for a portion of living expenses.

, If you are already involved with your parents’ health, you may be able to talk with their doctors and get a professional recommendation. They may be able to provide specific medical insight on what would be best for your parents.


You can also ask the doctors for referral of different living facilities or other healthcare options.

, Sometimes, moving your parents into a new residents may not be the best option. If your parents can still live on their own but require some assistance in day-to-day tasks, an in-home health aide or nurse might be right for you. These assistants can give your parents the help they need but without having to move your parents out of where they are most comfortable.

, This may be an option for you if you are worried about your parents safety. They can be worn on the person to call for help in case of an emergency or accident. This may be a good option if your parents can still manage a healthy daily lifestyle.

, Retirement communities come in a wide range. They can provide little assistance so that the residents can live a fairly independent life-style. Or, they can provide personalized care for each resident. Consider what your parents need to live a happy and healthy life style. Retirement communities can be great for not only physical assistance, but also provide much-needed social activities.

, More than 735,000 people in the United States, as of 2010, live in assisted living.Assisted living is designed for short term or long term health care for the elderly or disabled.It is often personalized for the individual based on need. If your parents require more help than you are able to give, consider assisted living.

, As the baby-boomer generation ages, advancements in aging continue to to grow. There are now specialty facilities that can give specialized help to patients with unique disorders. Assisted living facilities may have a wing dedicated to Alzheimer’s patients. If your parent has a special need or condition, ask facilities that you are interested in if they have specialized care.

, Do not just announce the idea out of the blue. Your parents are likely to feel hurt and unwanted if that is the case. You should be honest about your concerns.Broach the conversation in a respectful manner. Consider:


“Mom, Dad, can we talk about the future?”
“I see that you’re having trouble walking down all of these stairs. Would it better if you were to live somewhere easier to navigate?”
“I know you’ve recovered from your broken hip, but would feel better if you would get more help.”

, Perhaps your parents have been thinking it is time for a change on their own. Before you make demands or offer suggestions, have a heart to heart talk with their wishes and needs. Use some of the following conversation for some ideas:


”Have you thought about moving to somewhere you can get more health?”
”Have you considered hiring a home health aide to help out with your diabetes?”
”Where do you see yourself in the next few years?”

, No good decision was ever made in the heat of anger. The decision to move your parents into senior living should not be made alone.Do not try and force your opinion on your parents without first talking about all the options and listening to their opinions. This might help make the idea of moving more palatable and less combative.

, Researching, reviewing, and presenting facts may help distance yourself from a very emotional decision. This may be a tough time in your life and your parents’ lives. Try and examine facts as much as you can rather than making a decision solely on emotion.

, Your parents may be resistant at first to moving. This may especially be true if they have an attachment to their current home. They have resided there for many years. Try to place yourself in your parents’ shoes. Try and be courteous to their wishes and respect what they want. This might not always be the case given health concerns, but at least consider their viewpoint.

, This is a stressful situation. Your parents might vehemently disagree with this at the start. Keep calm and keep the conversation open. Remember that you love them (and they love you) and everyone wants to the best for all those involved.

, No situation has to last forever. Do your research and try different options. If you and your parents do not like the first option that you have chosen, try a different one.

, If your parents are resistant to change or to moving, the first step you should try is compiling a list of factual reasons why they should move. Try and keep your opinion on of this list. Try and present logical reasons to make it more difficult for your parents to argue against the move.

, If your parents are resistant to the idea of moving, try and enlist a friend or confidant to help join the conversation. Perhaps you parent has a close sibling or doctor that they confide in.

, This may not seem like the best option as you may not see it as your parents agreeing with your point of view. However, give your parents a chance to acclimate to the situation.Say something like:


”Why don’t you try it for six weeks. If you don’t like it, we can look for other options”
”If you don’t like facility, how about this one or this one?”
”Okay, I understand you don’t want to talk about this now. We’ll talk about it tomorrow.”

, If your siblings or other family members are involved in this decision, it is first important that you all agree on the next steps. Presenting more than one solution or opinion may exacerbate or make the situation even more overwhelming., Moving is a stressful situation for anyone. When you and your family are moving your parents, be sure to stay organized.


Keep copies of important documentation (like birth records, medical records, power of attorney, etc)
Organize items by type (clothes, furniture, personal items, etc)
Keep medications well labeled
Have a list of all medications and doctors
Provide a list of family members’ names, phone numbers, and relation

, List the times that you will be moving so that you have a clear idea of what items are involved. Make a copy of this list and give it to your parents, the movers, the doctors, or facility director.

, Chances are your parents are moving into a much smaller space than before. Your parents may have accumulated a lot of items throughout the years. Take the time now to go through the items and get rid of, sell, donate, or keep things. This task may be overwhelming so be sure to do it over a span of some time.

, If your parents are moving into a facility with other residents, it is important to label items. You do not want items lost, stolen, or misplaced. Put initial on clothes labels and keep labels on personal items. Make sure valuable are insured and are kept in safe places.

, Before you make the big move, call the facility to ask what has already been provided. Ask about:


Furniture
Dishes, silverware, kitchen items
Towels, sheets, blankets, etc.
Toiletries

, Power of attorney is essentially designated another individual to act on your behalf.Talk with your parents before they move to see if they want to sign over this power to someone in the family. This can help with financial or medical decisions. This is particularly helpful in situations of limited health or mobility.

, Your parents may be nervous or anxious in this move. Do not just leave them to their own devices. Make frequent contact via phone or visits while they adjust to their new space.

, Talk to the facility director or nurses on staff to see what activities your parents can get involved with. This can help them acclimate faster to the environment, as well as make new friends. This can also be beneficial to their health and mobility.

, Get to know the people who are taking care of your parents. Know their names and history. This can help you better understand the care that your parents will receive, and allow the staff to get an insight into their patient’s life.

, Making a decision about moving a parent is not a light one to make. You have probably been focusing heavily on the process and may feel like you are abandoning your parent or loved one. Know that this is a very realistic feeling and consider ways to cope with it..


There are a lot of online resources to help you including stories done by NPR, Forbes, and Time.
There are professional organizations like the AARP, CDC, National Plan Caring Council that have programs specifically designed to help families in this situation.

, If this situation is overwhelming, consider seeking professional help for you and your parent. This is a big life change, and you need to feel comfortable with it as well as your parents. Talk with doctors who can understand and help you with a coping plan.

Figure out times where you're most at risk of injury.,
Get a hepatitis B vaccination.,
Protect your skin when handling needles.,
Use alternatives to needles when possible.,
Dispose of needles without recapping them.,
Place the needle in a wide mouth puncture proof container.,
Remove and replace needlestick containers when they are three quarters full.,
Seal containers and dispose of them.,
Wash the wound.,
Report needle stick injuries right away.,
See a doctor immediately.,
Undergo post exposure prophylaxis.,
Refrain from certain activities until your test results are received.",How to Protect Yourself from Needlestick Injuries at Work," The first step to protecting yourself from needlestick injuries is knowledge. Understand when and where you're most at risk. If you work in a medical facility, you are at risk for needlestick injuries. Needlestick injuries occur most often during the following activities:


Recapping needles
Transferring body fluids between containers
Disposing of used needles;
, Hepatitis B is one of the most common diseases transferred via needlepoint injury. If you are not already vaccinated against Hepatitis B, get a vaccination as soon as possible.


The hepatitis B vaccination is an intramuscular vaccination. There are 3 rounds of injections. The second injection is administered one month after the first, and the third injection is administered six months after the first.You may experience a minor reaction, like pain or redness at the injection site. You may also experience headache and fatigue. Reactions should pass within a few days., Always protect your skin when handling needles or administering injections. Be particularly careful about any open sores.


Any open skin or lesions should be covered by gloves or a dry dressing at all times when handling needles.While administering injections, make sure the eyes, nose, and mouth are covered to avoid any splashes of blood., Needles should only be used when absolutely necessary to a patient's health. Use alternatives when possible.


If a medication can be administered orally in pill form, choose this over injecting the medication.If you need to run tests on a patient, see if there are any alternatives to blood tests you can use. For example, you could collect a swab from the inside of a patient's cheek or run a urine test., Once a needle has been used, you do not need to recap it. This is unnecessary and increases the likelihood of a needlestick injury. Never recap a needle once it's been used., Once a needle has been used, place the needle in a wide mouth puncture proof container.


If your hospital adheres to the guidelines laid out by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, they should have puncture proof containers on hand to dispose of used needles.If containers are not available, this a needlestick hazard and should be immediately reported to your employer., Needlestick containers should not be filled to the brim. This increases the likelihood of leaks or tears in the back. When containers are three quarters full, they need to be disposed of and replaced., Seal containers tightly. Then make sure they are collected by those responsible for dealing with medical waste. Disposal of needles depends on the local regulations in your area regarding medical waste. If you are unsure, ask a superior., The first thing you should do in the event of a needlestick injury is carefully wash around the wound. This can minimize your risk of any infections.


Use soap and water to clean the wound. If water is unavailable, use alcohol-based hand rubs or solutions., Needlestick injuries can expose you to a number of blood-borne pathogens. It's essential to report all injuries right away to ensure that you receive appropriate followup care.


Notify a supervisor as you'll probably need to fill out an accident report form., You will need to leave work and immediately see a doctor. See if anyone in your hospital can see you. If they cannot, immediately go to an emergency room.


A doctor will take detailed information about your injury and perform a physical exam. He or she will ask you how deep the needle went in and whether or not it was visibly contaminated at the time.Your doctor should also explain transmission risks, which are luckily relatively low. He or she will probably want to perform blood tests to check for pre-existing diseases., If your doctor believes the risk of transmission is elevated for any reason, he or she may recommend post exposure prophylaxis. This is a treatment in which you are given a round of antibiotics designed to prevent the transmission of certain infections.


If the person who was initially injected with the needle was positive for any diseases such as HIV or hepatitis C, your doctor will probably recommend prophylaxis. If you know there was blood on the needle, your doctor will also likely recommend the treatment.You will probably be referred to a specialist for specifics on your treatment options. The medications used depend on which diseases your doctor thinks you're most at risk for., Your doctor will probably test you for certain infections. Until you get the test results back, you should not engage in unprotected sex or donate blood."

Inspect holiday lights every year for frayed wires, broken plugs, excessive kinking, and gaps in the cord insulation.,
Ensure that all holiday decorations are flame retardant or non-flammable and placed away from heat sources.,
Put fragile decorations out of reach of children.,
Place lit candles where they cannot be easily knocked over.,
Select a tree that is healthy and recently cut.,
Remove all holiday plants and flowers from the reach of children and animals.,
Avoid overeating.,
Limit alcoholic beverages.,
Turn in pot handles when cooking on a stove and close the oven door at all times.,
Hire a professional to hang your holiday decorations.,
Dispose of wrapping paper in a garbage receptacle.",How to Prevent Holiday Accidents,"


Never link more than 3 strands of lights together, and always plug the lights into an extension cord before plugging into a wall outlet.
Unplug all holiday lights before leaving the house or going to bed.
Only use lights that have an approval label from an independent testing facility.;
, Read the packaging on an artificial tree to confirm that it is flame retardant as well.

, If an ornament breaks, sweep up the broken glass immediately.

, Never decorate a holiday tree with lit candles.

,


Pick up the tree and bump the trunk against the ground. If many needles fall off, the tree is not fresh and can be a potential fire hazard. The trunk should be sticky to the touch.
Display the tree away from a heat source, such as a furnace or fireplace.
Make sure the tree is watered daily and not left up for longer than two weeks.

, Poinsettias, holly berries, Jerusalem cherry and mistletoe are all toxic and can cause severe rashes, vomiting and other severe physical reactions. Write down the phone number of your local poison control center in case of accidental ingestion.

, The holidays offer many delicious and exotic foods, but by overindulging you run the risk of intestinal issues, including abdominal pain and bloating that can last for up to 3 days. Eat small portions and drink plenty of water to maintain regular digestion.

, According to Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), alcohol is linked to more than half of the driving-related deaths over the holidays.

, Keep small children away from a hot stove to avoid burns and spills.

, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that more people were injured by falling off of ladders during the holiday months than any other time of the year.

, Never throw wrapping paper in a fireplace. A larger fire with sparks can result, triggering a larger fire within the home.

Warm up your muscles before exercising.,
Practice proper landing techniques.,
Strengthen your quadriceps muscles.,
Include hamstring exercises in your daily routine.,
Keep your calves strong with calf lifts.,
Look into using a personal trainer.,
Try wrapping or taping your knees for additional support.,
Recognize that certain sports cause more ACL injuries.,
Take special care if you are female.,
Use caution if you are an older athlete.,
Monitor the environmental conditions.,
Get plenty of rest to optimize coordination.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Recognize an ACL injury.,
Understand knee joint anatomy.,
Learn about varying degrees of injury severity.,
Know that ACL injuries can happen with other injuries.",How to Protect Yourself from an ACL Tear," As you prepare to practice or play a game that may strain your ACL, be sure to warm up fully. This should happen about 10–15 minutes before activity. Warm up with a series of stretching and exercises intended to enhance blood flow and bring oxygen to the knee joint muscles. These will also increase the flow of lubricating synovial fluid, which helps your knee joints function smoothly.Increase coordination via active stretching with exercises such as:


Moving knee pull-ups: While making your way across the gym floor or other area, flex at the hip and knee and pull your knees up towards waist height. Do approximately four sets of 10 with each leg.
Moving butt kicks: Jog across the gym floor for about 20 feet while extending at the hip and flexing the knee. This will keep your hamstring engaged. Move your feet towards your rear in a “cheerleader” style maneuver.
Traditional jumping jacks.;
, Physics that play a role in ACL injury are “ground reaction forces” (GRFs). These refer to the pressure that must be absorbed by the body when the front of the foot hits the ground. With normal walking, GRFs are equal to our body weight. When an athlete lands after a jump, the pressure may be between two to eight times his body weight.Know the proper landing technique, especially if you are a basketball player, in which you may be jumping and landing often. Our bodies will naturally assume the proper landing technique, except at those times in competition where it is not easily accomplished due to opposing team members and high stress. Practice appropriate landing techniques so that these will be second nature to you when the adrenaline is flowing during a game.


Landing on the wrong foot or landing flat-footed can increase the GRF you experience, thus increasing your chances of ACL injury. Both can increase the ground reaction force that is transmitted from the ankle to the knee. Be sure to land on the balls of your feet., Target the muscles located on the front of your thighs in order to support your knee joints. Squats and lunges will build strength in your quadriceps and will keep you on top of your game.


Squats: Stand with your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart. Flex at the hip with your rear somewhat extended as though you're going to sit in a chair. Extend your arms out in front of you at shoulder level. This will help you balance. Squat down, holding at the terminal end of the squat for a period of two to three seconds, then return to a standing position. Do four sets of ten reps each.
Lunges: Stand with your feet together. Take a giant step out with one foot, flexing at the hip and knee. Lean deep into this until the knee on your back leg almost touches the ground. Hold this position for two to three seconds. Then, alternate with the other leg. Repeat for three to four sets of ten reps each.

Keep your body in proper alignment when performing a lunge. This means that a straight line should bisect your hip and run parallel to your flexed knee.
In addition to working your quads, lunges also work your glutes and hamstrings.



, Hamstrings, or the muscles along the back of your thighs, also require strengthening in order to protect and support your knees. Lunges are good hamstring exercises, as are floor exercises.


Lunges: Stand with your feet together. Take a giant step out with one foot, flexing at the hip and knee. Lean deep into this until the knee on your back leg almost touches the ground. Be sure that your forward knee does not extend beyond the toes of the foot. Hold this position for two to three seconds. Then, alternate with the other leg. Repeat for three to four sets of ten reps each.
Kneel and place your palms on the floor. Extend one leg back and flex your leg up at the knee. Lift your flexed knee just a small but significant movement toward the ceiling. Keep your foot flat and parallel to the ceiling. Perform 10 reps on this leg and repeat twice. Switch legs and repeat the exercises.

, Calf lifts, or calf raises, will strengthen your calves, in turn giving your knees added support. To do calf lifts:


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Press your toes into the ground and lift your heels off the ground. Use a wall to balance yourself.
Lift your body weight for a set of 10 repetitions. Repeat two to three times.
Stretch each calf muscle by sitting with your legs spread and extended.
You can also do calf lifts with a weight lifting machine, especially if you need more resistance.

, You may find it useful to consult a personal trainer to learn how to protect your ACL. This person can be especially useful during your initial training so that you can learn proper form when doing exercises. Personal trainers can be expensive, but you can often get an initial consultation that may be enough to demonstrate proper technique for you.

, Wrapping your knees with braces can potentially help you prevent ACL injuries, but you shouldn’t rely on this exclusively.Consult with a personal trainer or physical therapist before wrapping your knees.

, A basic understanding of physics will allow you to better understand the forces at play that result in an ACL tear. Movements during sports such as basketball and soccer, where sudden deceleration, landing and pivoting maneuvers are common, increase the anterior shear “loading” forces on the ACL. Take care when playing these types of sports in order to avoid ACL injuries.

, Female athletes are over twice as common to sustain an ACL injury as compared to their male counterparts.This is because females have different knee positioning and alignment than males., People over the age of 40 are more prone to experiencing ACL injuries. This is due to overall age-related weakening of muscles in the body. If you are over 40, make sure you take special care to warm up and strengthen your leg muscles., There can be environmental conditions that impact how stable your feet and legs are in a game. For example, some types of artificial turf have been known to increase risk of injury among football players.You may also experience increased risk on uneven playing surfaces or in cold weather., Studies show that sleep is essential to improving coordination and performance in athletics. Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, and athletes often benefit from as many as 10 hours of sleep per night. , Excessive weight throws off balance and coordination. You may also experience decreased reaction time if you are overweight.Aim for a body mass index (BMI) of less than 27.

, Hydrate your body by drinking plenty of water every day so that your muscles will work properly and don’t fatigue too soon., An ACL injury can be caused by a number of different actions, including landing improperly, twisting your leg, changing direction suddenly or rapidly, or getting hit by someone or something, among others. With an ACL injury, you may experience a range of symptoms. These may include:Pain
Swelling within 24 hours
Instability of the knee
Unable to use your leg’s full range of motion
Tenderness at your knee joint
Difficulty walking

, The knee joint is comprised of the femur, supporting the thigh or quadriceps muscle, and the tibia and fibula, which are located in the lower leg. There is also cartilage that cushions the knee joint. This cartilage, called the meniscus, is sandwiched between the upper and lower leg bones. Multiple ligaments support the knee and provide stability from all angles, with the ACL playing a critical role.


Ligaments join bone to bone. The ACL is formed in a cross-like structure, functioning to join the femur to tibia. This prevents the femur from sliding backward on the tibia. It also prevents the tibia from sliding forward on the femur.

, The ACL can be strained, torn, or severely damaged. If strained or torn, the ligament is stretched beyond its usual capacity. This results in small or large tears that compromise the integrity of the ligament. Consequently, the knee joint is less stable. In addition, you may suffer a microvascular injury that results in bruising and swelling of the knee.


At the other end of the spectrum, in cases of more severe trauma, the ligament may be entirely ruptured, resulting in significant knee instability. This type of injury is also usually accompanied by severe swelling and bruising as a result of the internal damage to blood vessels in the region.

, ACL tears may occur in conjunction with other ligamentous or meniscal injuries to the knee, or even a fracture of the tibia or fibula. Fractures are more common with “contact” ACL injuries such as a car accident, while “non-contact” injuries occur most commonly in sports like basketball and soccer.

Don’t overload sockets.,
Have your electrical wiring checked.,
Stop using appliances with frayed power cords.,
Don’t leave pots or pans unattended.,
Turn handles in when cooking.,
Keep knives out of reach.,
Monitor children around hot objects.,
Store heavy items close to the ground.,
Install smoke alarms.,
Have a fire extinguisher on hand.,
Create a fire escape plan.,
Just say no to smoking in the house.,
Install safety locks where medicine/cleaners are kept.,
Label medicine properly.,
Consider outdoor cleaning products as well.,
Don’t forget carbon monoxide detectors.,
Install safety gates for small children.,
Buy pads for area rugs.,
Keep driveways and sidewalks clean.,
Install lights at the top and bottom of stairs.,
Fence in your pool.",How to Prevent Home Accidents," Many older homes contain electrical systems, which aren't properly equipped to handle the modern power demands.Don’t tempt fate by plugging too many devices into the same socket.


Never plug more than two appliances into an outlet at once. Using extension cords to plug multiple appliances into one outlet, is also strongly discouraged.Large appliances such as your refrigerator should have an outlet to themselves.
Contact a professional if you hear a sound coming from the outlet or smell something burning.
Cover unused sockets with a socket plug. This is particularly important if there are small children in the home.;
, Dangers from electrical shock and fire are so concerning that when it comes to the construction industry, electrical wiring is very closely monitored.Even still, things can deteriorate over time. This is particularly true in older homes, but is applicable to newer homes as well.


It may be a good idea to have a licensed electrician inspect your home if you've never had your wiring inspected.If the lights are flickering or some of the outlets don’t function properly, this could be a sign of an electrical issue. Contact a professional to come in and inspect the house.
Though it is not advisable, should you decide to inspect the wiring yourself, make sure to turn off the circuit on your breaker panel!

, You may not realize it, but power cords have several layers. Visible damage at the outer layer of a power cable, whether that’s pinching, tearing or frays, is probably a good indication of damage to the inner layers as well.Do yourself a favor and stop using the appliance if this happens.


If the appliance needs to be used until a replacement is found, you can temporarily fix the cord with electrical tape. However, it is not advisable to do this, as fires and short circuits could still occur.
If you can’t bear to part with the appliance, have the power cord replaced by an electrician as soon as possible.
Most importantly, if you suspect damage has been done to the middle layer of a power cable, you need to stop using it immediately., Regardless of whether you have small children in your home, pots and pans should never be left unattended. Grease fires are often the culprit of kitchen fires, so never leave a pan unattended when you're frying fat.If you need to leave the kitchen, turn off the stove and remove pots and pans from the hot burners.
Treat the microwave the same as a stove. Don’t leave items unattended while they are heating up.
When you are cooking, children should not be left unattended in the kitchen either.

, Children and adults alike could fall victim to burns and other related injuries if handles aren’t turned in toward the back of the stove while cooking.


If the handles have plastic on them, be sure they are not placed above another hot burner.
Handle pots and pans, without plastic guards, with care. The handles could be extremely hot and may cause burns.

, Whether they are in use or not, be sure all knives are kept out of reach and are properly secured. When you are using them, make sure they are not resting on something that can easily be pulled down. Get in the habit of placing knives on a flat, clutter free surface to ensure they won’t accidentally fall.


Knives should be stored, blade down, in a designated container, far from the reach of children.
Dirty knives should not be left in the sink. Instead, immediately wash the knife after each use.
When carrying knives, keep the cutting edge angled away from your body and leave the tip facing your side.Do not attempt to carry knives while there is a lot of commotion in the kitchen.

, Whether it’s a hot stovetop, a pot of boiling water or a bowl of soup, children should always be monitored around hot objects. One idea is to establish an off-limits area, which encompasses any hot appliances such as the stove, fireplace, barbecue, heaters, etc.Never allow your child to carry hot items.
It may be wise to restrict them from playing with pots and pans when they’re not in use. This will help to avoid any confusion when they are on the stove.

, When organizing your kitchen, place heavy items such as pots, skillets and appliances in lower cabinets. You don't want to risk having a heavy item fall on your head., One of the easiest ways to reduce fire-related injuries, is to install smoke alarms that are properly installed and maintained.Make sure alarms are installed in bedrooms and on every floor of your house.
Alarms need to be replaced every ten years, so remember to keep track of when they were installed.
Get in the habit of testing your alarm every month or so.
Do not change or alter the alarm in any way; that includes leaving it unpainted, regardless of whether it stands out!
Spring ahead and fall back - you may want to consider changing the batteries on your alarm every time you change your clocks. Many people commonly change their batteries every fall during daylight savings time. This is also a good time to test fire alarms., Though they have limitations, make sure you have a portable fire extinguisher on every level of your home along escape routes. It not only saves lives, but can aid in reducing property damage.Owning a fire extinguisher is just as important as knowing where it is located. Try to keep it in the same spot and to inform your family members of its whereabouts.

It may make sense to keep the fire extinguisher in your kitchen at least 30 feet away from your stove, as this is where many fires start.


Read the instructions after purchasing a fire extinguisher and familiarize your family members with how to work it.
To operate a fire extinguisher, remember the word PASS:Pull the pin. Keeping the nozzle pointed away from your body, hold the extinguisher and release the locking mechanism.
Aim low. Aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire, as opposed to the top.
Squeeze the lever slowly and evenly.
Sweep the nozzle from side-to-side.


It's very important that you only use a fire extinguisher if the fire is small. Do not try to manage a fire that has spread throughout your house.

, In the event of a fire, you and your family should have an escape plan, as you may only have a minute or two to escape from a rapidly spreading fire.One minute or two doesn't give you enough time to formulate a plan, which is why it’s so important to have one in place.


Prior to creating the plan, walk around the home and point out all exits.
Establish a meeting location outside of the home.
If there are children in the home, indicate which adults should get the kids.

If the children are older, you may want to draw a map of the house, indicating exit points.


Make sure everyone knows the plan and try to review it every couple of months.

, The best way to prevent smoking related injuries and accidents is to not allow it in your home.


Any paraphernalia, such as matches and lighters, should be kept out of reach.
If someone is smoking outside, provide them with an ashtray so that they can safely extinguish the cigarette.

, Have a designated spot for cleaning products, along with an additional spot for medicine. Keep the storage spaces locked, particularly if they are within reach of children.


Don’t forget to move medicine back to its safe storage spot after work or vacation. Medicine, which was accidentally left within reach of a child (a purse, counter, etc.), results in 67% of emergency room visits for medicine poisoning.Similarly, return cleaning products to their spot immediately after use. Do not leave them laying around while you’re cleaning.
Have a plan in place for medicine brought into the house by visitors. It may help to have a cabinet installed in the guest bathroom that is out of reach from children.
Don’t let your children play with medicine bottles. While it may seem like a good substitute for a rattle, this will only cause confusion.

, In addition to being properly stored, medicine should also be labeled correctly. If possible, try to keep it in the original bottle, so as to avoid confusion. This will also help when it comes time to administer the medicine, as you will be able to follow the instructions.


Keep an eye on expiration dates. If you do move the medicine into a new container, be sure to note the expiration date.

, It’s not just potential hazards inside your home that you need to consider. Products such as windshield wiper fluid, pool cleaners and pesticides need to be safely stored as well.


If you decide to store outdoor cleaners in the garage, be sure it is kept locked and shut when children aren’t being supervised.
You should still purchase a secure cabinet for such materials. Even after they've been installed, get in the habit of checking to make sure all cabinets/containers are tightly secured., Carbon monoxide is often referred to as the invisible killer, as it's an odorless, colorless gas.For this reason, always make sure you have a carbon monoxide detector installed in your home.


Like fire alarms, carbon monoxide detectors should be checked frequently.
If you hear the signal on the detector, check the batteries first. If the batteries are still working, immediately call the fire department.

Wait for the fire department outside.



, Choose the right type of safety gate based on the location.Primarily, there are two types of gates - one that requires screws in order to be mounted and another which is held in place by pressure. It’s important to understand which type of gate should be used where.


Gates used at the top of stairs are often hardware-mounted, while pressure-mounted gates can be used at bottom of stairs and between rooms.Always follow the instructions carefully. When in doubt, ask a professional to install the gate.

, While an area rug can instantly transform a room, it can also be the source of household injuries. Always purchase a rug pad for your area rugs. In doing so, you can help to prevent children and adults, alike, from accidentally slipping.


If you’re concerned about a rug pad damaging your floor, consider a rubber pad, as it has a non-slip grip, is made of eco-friendly materials and is generally safe for hardwood floors., It is important, particularly during the fall and winter months, to keep driveways and sidewalks clean. Both should be free of leaves, snow and ice, in order to prevent injuries from occurring.


The harsh winter months may also cause cracks and splits. Try to make the repairs as quickly as possible. If you are unable to fix the problem, seek the help of a professional.

, One common household injuries is falling down the stairs.The culprit is often dim or non-existing lighting. By adding lights to both the top and bottom of your staircase, you can help to prevent unnecessary falls.


The same is true for outdoor steps. Be sure there is good visibility by installing an overhead light.
You may want to consider installing a motion detector light for outside staircases as well, in case of unexpected visitors.

, Thousands of American families suffer from unnecessary swimming pool tragedies on a yearly basis.By fencing in your pool and using a self-latching gate, you will be helping to prevent needless accidents.


Consider a pool cover as well. This should be used in addition to and not in lieu of the fence. A pool alarm may also be useful to let you know when others get into the water.
Ensure the fence is at least 4 feet tall, though anything above 5 feet tall is preferable.
Don't place chairs, tables or benches near the fence. You want to avoid having anything nearby that would assist someone in climbing over.
Be sure to actively supervise children when they are using the pool, and have everyone in your household informed on responding to aquatic emergencies."

Ensure that all stairwells conform to safety standards.,
Keep stairways clear to prevent accidents.,
Mark the edge of the steps a different color so as to avoid stairway accidents.,
Attach treads to the edges of your steps.,
Install handrails on both side of the stairway.,
Post notices on oddly designed stairwells.,
Make sure that the stairway is well lit during the day and the night.,
Inspect the stairway regularly and make sure that it is maintained.,
On rainy or snow days, make sure that the stairwells are dried off.,
Make it a house rule to hold the handrail when using the stairs and make it natural to remind those who do who forget.

",How to Prevent Stairway Accidents," Research building code standards and any other legal requirements for stairwell designs. By following certain codes, you can avoid being responsible in the event that someone is injured falling down the stairs.;
, Don't pile items anywhere near a stairway.

, Make sure that the paint does not wear out.

, This will add a grip to them and help prevent accidents. Again, ensure that the treads are secure and not loose.

, Select rails that are curved and smooth so that clothing and bag straps don't get caught on them causing stairwell injuries. Check that the handrails are not unsteady or detached from the wall.

, If there is an odd step at the bottom of the stairwell or narrow steps, let people know. Post signage at that top and bottom of the stairwell that explains the oddity. Make sure that these signs are posted in a very visible spot. If you do have the means, get the oddity fixed. In some places having a sign may work against you if someone does have an accident. Find out what the law is in your area., Install light switches at the top and bottom of the stairway for both safety and convenience. Check periodically that the bulbs are all working.

, Make sure that none of the steps are loose or rotting. If you have carpeting on the stairway, ensure that there are no pulls or openings that would cause someone to trip. Be proactive about correcting accident-causing issues.

, Don't put cloth or carpet down at the top of stairs. Someone may trip and fall down the stairs and hurt themselves badly. Just dry the area. If you need to mark the area with a wet floor sign, make sure the sign is visible but not obstructing the path. Another option would be to treat the floor with a non-slippery coating.

Contact the Department of Justice with respect to accessibility and disability issues.",How to Get Government Assistance for Elderly," Unless an elderly person has been diagnosed with a severe cognitive or mental illness, do not assume that you alone can determine their needs. Ask elderly people to express their challenges, hopes, desires, and listen carefully to what they say. Doing so will help you determine which forms of governmental assistance are appropriate.


Remember to ask elderly people specific questions regarding what would make their lives more fulfilling, independent, financially stable, and safer.;
, The best source for information is the Administration on Aging (AOA).This agency administers a long list of programs for elders. Their website, www.aoa.gov, lists all of the national services and programs available for elderly people .


Also visit sites such as www.govbenefits.gov and www.benefitscheckup.org, which will further help match elders with appropriate services and programs.

, Acting as a caregiver and advocate for an elderly person can be frustrating, time-consuming, and exhausting. It can also be expensive, resulting in missed work and many hours of unpaid labor. Looking after your own health and welfare will enhance your effectiveness as a caregiver and advocate for an elderly person.


Excellent information is provided by the National Alliance for Caregiving, the Caregiver Action Network, and the Family Caregiver Alliance.
Visit their respective websites at: www.caregiving.org and www.caregiveraction.org .

, This is the most important financial assistance program for the elderly, and one they have been paying into for most of their lives. Social assistance can supplement their income or serve as an elderly person's entire income in the absence of retirement savings. Elderly people may apply for Social Security between the ages of 62 and 70. The longer an elderly person waits to apply, the larger their monthly benefit will be.

, This federal program is funded by general tax revenues and not Social Security taxes. Elders are eligible if the amount of social security they receive is too low to live on, and they have little or no other sources of income available. The program also considers factors such as disability and medical history.


The Supplemental Security Income program is designed to help cover the cost of food, clothing, and shelter.
For more information and to determine eligibility, visit https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/ , Federal programs often mandate that states and local communities help elders and senior citizens access funding and other resources. Look for the local Area Agency on Aging in your city, town, or county. These agencies can connect elders with counselors trained to determine their needs and match them to available programs.For a comprehensive list of Area Agencies on Aging, visit www.agingcare.com/local/Area-Agency-on-Aging.. Some of the cost-saving services these agencies provide include:


Respite care
Chore services
Yardwork and snow removal
Meals on wheels
Home repairs and accessibility modifications
Legal services
Transportation

, An elderly person who served in the armed services might be eligible for special compensation and assistance. Find out if a service-related disability or medical problem will increase benefits or provide a pension to an elderly veteran who needs government help. Visit www.benefits.va.gov.The Department of Veteran’s Affairs may provide special pension benefits if an elderly person is bedridden, in a nursing home, or unable to care for themselves.
Additional benefits may also be provided to elderly veterans unable to leave the immediate premises of their home due to a permanent disability. , They are government assistance programs that manage healthcare costs for the elderly over age 64. Medicare and Medicaid can be complicated; research which Parts are best suited for the elderly person in question. Part A and B concern hospitalization and physician services, and are the most popular components of coverage. But it is also worth considering Part C and D, which respectively concern supplemental insurance and prescription medication coverage. Visit www.medicare.gov and www.medicaid.gov. to learn more.


Consider having Medicare premiums deducted from Social Security payments for the elderly person who receives both forms of government assistance.

, The FDA can provide assistance to elders by helping to manage their prescriptions. Use the FDA's database to understand safety protocols for different drugs and to ensure you are not mixing drugs that harmfully interact. The FDA provides services to help elders who are taking prescription medication appropriately manage their diet, lifestyle, medication schedule, and communications with doctors and pharmacists.
The FDA also helps seniors find ways to reduce the cost of prescription medications, for example by asking for seniors discounts, buying in bulk, using mail-order services, purchasing generic drug brands, and obtaining samples., These are programs such as Medi-Cal in California, Mass Health in Massachusetts, BadgerCare in Wisconsin, and SoonerCare in Oklahoma. Many of these programs are means-tested, so they are only available to low-income people. Programs vary from state to state, so contact your state government for information about eligibility requirements and the specific services available. However, most of these programs provide assistance in areas such as:


ambulatory patient services
emergency services
hospitalization
mental health and substance abuse treatment
dental care
vision care
long term care

, These services provide extra support so that elderly people can continue to live at home after hospitalization or due to long term disabilities. In-home support services entail regular visits by trained professionals such as registered nurses, physical therapists, and/or direct service workers. Depending on where you live, these services are variously funded by by Medicaid, Medicare, or long term insurance -- for more information, visit https://medlineplus.gov/homecareservices.html. Standard in-home support services entail help with:


Bathing and showering
Dressing and laundry
Using the toilet
Eating and light meal preparation
Walking and transferring
Taking and managing medications
Injections and IVs
Wheelchairs and mobility devices

, Indeed, the Justice Department enforces and provides information about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Remember that all elderly people are entitled to the reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Check out the ADA website for information and instructions on how to ensure that elderly people have safe access to places of residence, work, and worship "

Take pride in your age.,
Refrain from comparing yourself to others.,
Appreciate what you have.,
Pamper yourself.","How to Cope when Reaching a ""Milestone"" Age1"," Don't forget, age is just the number of times the Earth has gone around the sun since you were born.From this perspective, turning a year older is actually exciting! Don't let the arbitrariness of your age set you back.;
, Instead, focus on your own achievements and goals. If you ask others about their age milestones, you will likely see that goals vary, so that while one 30 year old might want to be married and have kids by 35, another 30 year old might not want the same thing at all.You don’t have to stick to a script of what you should do by a certain age once you realize that people act in their own best interest, and what is right for another might not be right for you. Forge your own path according to your own interests and desires.
Speak with others about age milestones. While you shouldn’t compare yourself to others, asking can still be positively reinforcing, because you will get a variety of perspectives on the topic.

, You have built an entire network, a world of sorts, around yourself and filled it with acquaintances, memories, goods, knowledge. Make a list of all you are thankful for, and appreciate it.


Start a gratitude journal - not only will this be a way to visualize what appreciate, but you will get a health boost! Studies have shown that writing a gratitude journal leads to fewer symptoms of illness, better sleep, and overall happiness., If you’re anxious about turning 50, allow yourself a revitalizing spa day. If you’ve been saving up to buy that motorcycle for your 35th birthday, treat yourself a little earlier than planned - consider it an advanced birthday gift. Whatever will make you see your new age as a positive, go ahead and do.

"
"
Take a moment to look back on all you’ve achieved so far.,
Reflect on whether there are things you wish you had done differently in the past.,
Recall how you managed transitioning to a previous milestone age.,
Explore why you perhaps didn’t cope well with reaching your last age milestone.","How to Cope when Reaching a ""Milestone"" Age2"," Make a list of your proudest moments; these will be subjective, but could range from graduating college to having a kid to staying in close touch with a friend who lives far away.If it matters to you, and you have achieved it, write it down.


Use this list as a motivator: a milestone age is the perfect time to add a new achievement (or several!) to the list.

, Perhaps you would have liked to have spent more time with friends and acquaintances, or perhaps you wish you had gone to the gym every day. A milestone age is the ideal time to take note and make any changes for future endeavors.

, If the transition was a positive one, it can help you see your upcoming one as a potentially great one too. Take that previous approach and try to translate it to this new milestone.


Say you coped extremely well with turning 18: consider why that was the case. Perhaps you were excited about the doors that you knew would open up, or maybe you were thrilled about the freedom typically associated with that age. So now, if you are now turning 40, ask yourself what the benefits of this age are. These could range from greater confidence to having more knowledge about who you are and what you stand for., The fact that reaching a previous milestone was not all it was lived up to be does not at all have to translate to your upcoming birthday. Consider these to be independent events.


Do, however, try to take your previous experience and learn from it. Perhaps you felt unprepared to be 27; if that was the case, and you fear the same thing will happen this time, take precautionary steps starting now. Think about how you can best prepare for this new age ahead of time.

"
"
Set future goals based on past experiences.,
Identify points of anxiety and resolve to improve upon them.,
Write down how you could improve on each point of anxiety.,
Form goals out of excitement.,
Be flexible.","How to Cope when Reaching a ""Milestone"" Age3"," You have knowledge and experience under your belt that you can now use as a guide to best determine what you want out of life. Create a long-term roadmap of where you want to be by what age based on what you have already accomplished.


If you want to be working at Company X by age 27, married by age 32, and living in Country Y by age 40, write this down. This is a way to get excited about your upcoming prospects and to give you an informal, low-stakes way to think of how to achieve your goals.

, Do this by making a list of what you are nervous about in reaching this new milestone age. Seeing these fears clearly laid out can put you at ease, for they are no longer abstract concepts floating about in your mind: they are delineated and materialized, and you can actively target each one as need be.The list could include items as varied as “I should have been more adventurous in the past” to “I am afraid I will no longer have the vitality of younger people” to “I am scared that job opportunities will be scarcer now.”

, Whatever your anxiety is, get to the root of it and brainstorm potential solutions. A clearly articulated list of solutions can be a source of relief and can promote positive thinking about your new milestone age.


Perhaps you are unenthusiastic about turning 50, but it's not really the 50 that bothers you, it's that recurring back pain that you see just getting worse and worse. In that case, jot down all potential remedies: perhaps there are preventative physical therapy exercises that you can do, or maybe there is a different sitting posture or a new pair of orthopedic shoes you could try., After all, it could be that you’re more enthusiastic than nervous about reaching a new milestone age. If you just want to optimize that excitement, making a list of what you are looking forward to at this new age can be positively reinforcing.

, Perhaps you have not achieved all you would have wanted to by this point. Maybe you would have liked to have started a career by age 25 but unforeseen circumstances delayed that prospect. Allow yourself time to briefly mourn this situation, but then readjust. Forget the old goal, set a new one, and work towards achieving it.

Review and adjust your current mindset.,
Meditate.,
Live fully in the present.","How to Cope when Reaching a ""Milestone"" Age4"," Often times, milestones are reminders of societal, familial, or individually-set expectations that you must, should, or want to comply with, and thus can seem imposing. Instead, you can choose to think of life not as milestones or easily divisible moments but as a broader continuum of experiences that you get to decide about.


There is also a lot of pressure embedded in the concept of “age:” how you should act, what you should be capable of doing, at what stage of your personal life or career you should be, and so forth.These guidelines can be helpful to a certain point, but if more than anything they are stressing you out, bid them adieu: age really is just a number.
Remember that you are the main driving force behind the decision of what you want to do and when you want to do it by.

, Meditation is known to reduce stress and anxiety and to quiet down mind-wandering and self-referential thoughts.If you’re worried about reaching a new milestone age, meditation could be a good temporary solution to your concerns, since it will draw you out of your preoccupation so that you can be in the moment.


As you meditate, reflect on the series of events and occurrences that has led you to where you are. Remember that you’re right where you’re supposed to be. The right journey for you is the one that you are on at the moment, the one you have the power to shift and mold however you desire. Adopting a meditation strategy can help you see that only you can take ownership and charge of what lies ahead.
There are many different kinds of meditation strategies; it is not one size fits all. Read a book, watch a tutorial video, or consult with a meditation practitioner to find the strategy that works for you.

, The past is already behind you, and you can plan, but not predict, the future. Seize today as your milestone: the day, the hour, this very instant which you can make your own.


Love what you do. Living in the present is most satisfying when you enjoy your work, your studies, and your free time.
Don't dwell on past accomplishments or failures. Spend your time thinking about the now and setting goals for the future instead.

Choose a time of day when the sun is not at its peak.,
Wear breathable clothing.,
Slather on the sunscreen.,
Take frequent breaks to cool off.,
Drink lots of water.,
Know your risk factors.",How to Prevent Heat Stress1," Whether you’re going out to do some gardening or gearing up for a jog, one of the easiest ways to prevent heat stroke is to avoid the combination of sun exposure and strenuous activity entirely between 11 am and 4 pm. Instead, pick a time in the early morning or late afternoon when the sun’s rays aren’t so fierce.Heat stress can occur even when indoors—for example, cooks and boiler room workers are at particular risk so don’t think that the sun is the only factor causing stress.;
, Clothes made of synthetic fabrics can significantly increase your risk of heat stress: since they are not breathable, they make you sweat and lose moisture at a higher rate than usual. Opt instead for loose-fitting garments made of cotton or other breathable fabrics.Light-colored clothing will keep you cooler in the heat, but dyed and darker fabrics are better at absorbing UV rays and preventing sun damage., You don’t need to worry about this consideration if working indoors, but any outdoor labor should be accompanied by plenty of topical sun protection. This will prevent sun burns and rashes, skin conditions which—although painful enough in and of themselves—can also have serious consequences. Left untreated, they can interfere with your body’s natural cooling capabilities and eventually lead to more serious heat-related illness such as heat exhaustion.Initially, you should use at least an ounce of sunscreen to cover your exposed body parts. Afterward, you should reapply sunscreen every two hours at least. If you're sweating profusely, though, you should go no more than 80 minutes before reapplying.While there are many sunscreens available with relatively low SPF levels, you should opt for a sunscreen with an SPF no lower than 30., You can work safely in extreme heat and humidity as long as you take regular breaks to retreat to a cool, shaded area. These breaks bring down your temperature while refreshing your body’s capacity to cool itself. If toiling strenuously, you should rest for at least an hour in this cool environment.


While some good shade coverage is sufficient if working in an arid climate, it is probably not sufficient if laboring in a humid environment. If your home doesn’t have air conditioning, seek out a public space such as a mall or movie theater where you can rest. In a pinch, you can try taking cool showers or baths throughout the day., When your body gets hot, it cools itself off by sweating. This coping strategy is effective, but it also causes you to lose moisture rapidly, so you must replenish fluids regularly in order to avoid dehydration.When you're working outdoors in extreme heat, you'll need at least 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of fluids each day. You can drink plain water, but it’s even better to consume sports drinks like Gatorade or Powerade, which provide the electrolytes, salts, and sugars you lost through sweating.


If you don’t have any sports drinks handy, you can make your own oral rehydration solution by adding six teaspoons of sugar and half a teaspoon of salt into one liter of water.In addition to drinking the right fluids, you should also avoid the wrong ones. Alcoholic drinks in particular are dangerous, as they accelerate dehydration while impairing your coordination and judgment., Though any individual can get heat stress, some people are at an elevated risk for this condition. For example, elderly people, pregnant and nursing women, babies, children, and people with heart disease are more likely to be affected by all kinds of heat stress. If you belong to one of these groups, you should take special precautions. Never labor or work out in the heat, and always carry sports drinks with you whenever you’ll be in a hot environment."

Review federal and local guidelines regarding safe employment conditions.,
Organize mandatory safety training for workers.,
Provide plenty of cool water and sports drinks for employees.,
Assign extra workers to the most laborious tasks.,
Schedule mandatory breaks in a cool, designated area.,
Increase work load gradually.,
Look out for equipment-related risks.",How to Prevent Heat Stress2," In most places, employers are responsible for the safety of their workers and must take measures to prevent heat stress. That being said, these regulations vary considerably depending on country and region, so employers should become familiar with local regulations in order to ensure compliance.Many federal governments and international nonprofit groups provide detailed online resources dedicated to such guidelines, so browse sources like osha.gov if you're in the U.S. or hse.gov.uk if you're in the U.K.

, Before introducing your workers to high-temperature work environments, make sure they are well educated regarding proper safety measures, prevention, and treatment of heat stress. Make sure they know who to call if a symptom is detected and how to direct paramedics to the site. Additionally, assign all workers with groups or partners who are specifically responsible for monitoring each others' conditions and potential symptoms.In the event that a worker does get heat stress, be sure to use the incident as a learning opportunity. Review what you and your team did wrong, and how you can correct it in the future.

, Hydration is one of the most important ways to prevent heat stress, as the ingestion of fluids will replenish moisture lost through sweating. Every worker working in heat stress prone conditions must drink a minimum of one pint of water per hour. Enforce this by monitoring water consumption and, if possible, giving workers water bottles to carry at all times.Hourly intake of water should not exceed 6 cups per hour or 12 quarts a day. To avoid problems with overconsumption, encourage workers to sip often rather than in big, high volume doses., You should try to schedule heavy work days and projects on cooler days or during cooler morning hours. When this isn’t possible, minimize the toll of these heavy work periods by appointing as many workers as possible to these tasks.You should also be conscious of the expertise and experience of all of your workers. Experienced workers who have been on the job for a long time will have a higher endurance in the heat, whereas new workers will need to get acclimatized gradually before they build up a tolerance., Even with proper hydration, your workers will need to take frequent breaks throughout the day in order to allow heart rate to slow and internal temperature to decrease. Establish a work/rest schedule for all workers that mandates when and for how long each worker must retreat to the cool area to rest. Optimally, these breaks should be shorter and more frequent—for example, 15 minutes every hour—rather than longer and less frequent.The special break area should be well air-conditioned if working in a humid climate, and at least a fully shaded spot if working in an arid environment.
If 15 minutes every hour seems excessive and likely to diminish productivity, remember that these break periods don’t have to be idle! Workers can complete bureaucratic or organizational tasks during this time, attend a necessary training, or engage in planning for the project.

, When work in the hot area begins, you need to start with reduced work loads for all employees. The amount of exposure to high-heat conditions should increase gradually over a period of 7-14 days, with the first day including no more than 20% of the work day spent in the heat. You should increase this percentage by no more than 20% every afterward.Experienced workers can start off at 50% on the first day, with the percentage increasing to 60% on the second, 80% on the third, and full-time by the fourth day.
Be aware that it will take older and less physically fit workers longer to acclimatize.

, Some engineering and industrial jobs will require insulated gloves or suits, while others may need reflective gear and helmets. This gear is necessary to protect the workers from other, non-heat related hazards on the job, but it can also contribute to the risk of heat stress. Consult with a health professional to ascertain whether work/rest cycles should be adjusted to compensate for this additional risk.Keep a close eye on workers who might be tempted to remove safety equipment as relief from the hot conditions. Even if it seems like there is minimal danger in shedding extra equipment, you can be fined for permitting this lapse if witnessed and sanctioned by a governmental authority.

Monitor skin for signs of heat rash.,
Address any cramping or pain.,
Administer first aid if fainting or vomiting is observed.,
Seek emergency medical assistance if signs of heat stroke are detected.",How to Prevent Heat Stress3," Heat rash occurs when sweat does not evaporate from the skin. It manifests as clusters of small, red bumps or blisters and, while not serious, should be treated before the condition worsens. Remove the affected party from the heat and humidity while keeping rashy areas dry.


These rashes will most likely appear on body parts with folds or increased chafing and contact with clothing, such as the chest, neck, groin, elbow and knee crease, and under-breast areas.

, If you lose too much salt and moisture through sweating, your salt-depleted muscles can begin to cramp. Affected individuals should retreat immediately to the cool, dry area to rest and hydrate for a few hours at minimum. If cramping persists, you should summon medical assistance.


Cramps most commonly occur in the abdominal area, but they can also affect your legs or arms, so pay attention to any unusual pain and address it at once.
You can try to avoid heat cramps in the future by removing excess clothing and consuming more electrolytes when hydrating., If a person begins to sweat heavily, complain of nausea, dizziness, or weakness, and demonstrate clammy skin and irritability, you should consider the person at risk of heat exhaustion. This is a serious condition and should be remedied immediately. Have the person lie down in a cool, shady area, give them cool beverages, and apply cold compresses or ice to their skin.


Even if you’re conscientiously administering immediate treatment, don’t let it drag on for too long. If you’re not noticing tangible and substantial improvements within the span of 30-60 minutes, call paramedics immediately in order to prevent exhaustion progressing to heat stroke., Heat stroke occurs when a person’s internal temperature reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) and the body loses its ability to regulate cooling and temperature. This condition can cause permanent disability and death, thus it demands urgent professional care. You can recognize heat stroke from the following symptoms: dry, hot skin due to discontinued sweating, rapidly and catastrophically climbing temperature, confusion, slurred speech, and disorientation.You can tend to the affected person while waiting for emergency services by treating it as you would heat exhaustion or cramps. Place them in a cool area removed from sunlight, loosen or remove their clothing, and give them fluids and cold compresses.

Reduce your risk of injury by warming up.,
Stretch your calves.,
Stretch your thighs.,
Strengthen your legs.,
Increase your explosive power.,
Do agility exercises.,
Don’t forget a cool down routine.,
Talk to your trainer about appropriate equipment.,
Listen to your body when you train.",How to Prevent ACL Injuries in Basketball," This part of the program requires that you mark off a distance of 50 yards (45.7 m). This can be done with flags, cones, even household objects. Do the following three warm up jogs:Jog the 50 yards (45.7 m). Jog slowly and easily to allow your muscles to engage.
Jog sideways. Start with your knees bent and side step your way across the 50 yards. At 25 yards, turn around so that you are leading with the other leg. Keep your hip, knee, and ankles in a straight line while you do it.
Jog backwards. Land on your toes while you run backwards. Keep your knees slightly bent so that they will not lock. This will warm up your hip extensors and hamstrings.;
, Your lower legs need to be strong and flexible so that you can jump and turn safely during games. Stretching them will increase your flexibility and reduce soreness after the work out. If you have not done other warm up exercises, walk quickly for five to ten minutes to do so. Your muscles must be warm when you stretch or you risk injuring them. When you stretch always hold the position for approximately 30 seconds without bouncing. Keep breathing. You should feel the stretch but it shouldn’t be painful.Stand with one foot slighting in front of the other. Keep the heel of the back leg on the ground while you slowly reach down towards the ground. You should feel a stretch in the calf of the back leg. Repeat this twice for each leg holding it for 30 seconds each time.

, Your thighs are important for jumping, landing, and pivoting during basketball. You have several muscles in your thighs which you can stretch individually.Stretch your quadriceps. Hold onto the side of a building or tree while doing this. Bend your leg on the opposite side so that your heel is near your backside. Use your free hand to hold your ankle. Your knee should be pointing to the ground and should not go out to the side. Do this twice for each leg, holding it for 30 seconds.
Stretch your hamstrings. These muscles are on the back of your thigh. Sit on the ground with one leg bent so that the bottom of the foot is against the thigh of the outstretched leg. Reach for your toes. Do this twice for each leg holding it for 30 seconds.
Stretch your inner thighs. Sit on the ground with your legs wide apart in front of you. Lean into the middle. Then reach with one hand towards the toes on the same side. Bring your other arm over your head and continue to reach for your toes. Hold this for 20 seconds and repeat it three times on each side.
Stretch your hip flexors. These muscles are that front of your upper leg. Take a large step forward with one leg and drop down to the knee of the back leg. Keep your shoulders above your hips. Use your hands to gently pull your back ankle towards your buttocks. Do this twice for each leg, holding it for 30 seconds each time.

, If the muscles are strong, they will be better able to keep your knee joint stable during the quick changes of direction that are required in basketball. You can do the following:Walking lunges. While walking, lunge forward on one side. Lower your back knee towards the ground while keeping your front knee over the ankle. Your knee should not slip in front of your ankle. Keep the motion controlled and smooth as you walk. Do three sets of 10 replicates.
Russian Hamstring. Have a friend hold your feet while you kneel on the ground. Keep your back straight and do not bend at the hips as you lean towards the ground. You will use your leg muscles to support yourself. Do three sets of 10 replicates.
Single Toe raises. This will improve your balance and increase the strength in your calves. While standing on one leg, slowly lift yourself on to the ball of the foot which is on the ground. Do two sets of 30 repetitions on each side.

, This is important for having the strength, not only to jump, but to support yourself throughout the landing. These exercises are called plyometrics. For these exercises you will need to set up a cone or other object that is about 6 inches (15 cm) high. For children 12 or under use an object that is 2 inches (5.1 cm) high or a line on the ground.Do 20 lateral hops. Jump sideways over the cone. Land on the ball of your foot in a soft and controlled manner.
Do 20 hops forward and backwards over the cone. Your knees should remain bent and you should land on the balls of your foot.
Hop forwards and backwards over the cone on one foot. Do this 20 times for each foot. These may need to be omitted for younger children who may not have enough coordination to do it safely.
Jump straight up in the air, landing on the balls of your feet with your knees bent. Do this 20 times.
Do 20 scissors jumps. Lunge forward on one leg so that your knee is over your ankle. Push off with your front leg and jump into a lunge position with that leg behind and the other leg in front. Land on the balls of your feet with your knees bent. Keep your knee stable.

, These exercises will increase your speed and the ability of your muscles to stabilize your knee. They will also help increase your awareness of how your body moves in space. This will improve your coordination. For these exercises you will need to set up two lines of cones or markers which should be about 30 feet (9 m) apart. Use 4 or 5 cones on each side.Forward / backward running. You will run back and forth between the lines. Sprint to the first cone, run backwards to the second, sprint to the third…and continue until you reach the last cone. Do this three times.
Diagonal run. Run between the cones while pivoting on your outside leg. Keep your knees bent and make sure the knee stays over the ankle. Do this three times.
Bounding run. Run for 30 to 60 seconds doing the bounding run. During this exercise you bring your knees up towards your chest while keeping your hips level. Land on the balls of your feel with your knees bent.

, This will help reduce soreness and tight muscles. Aim for a cool down routine of about 10 minutes. You should include:Easy jogging.
Repeating the hamstring, calf, inner thigh, and quadriceps stretches.
Rehydrating with plenty of water.

, There are two types of equipment that may help you protect yourself from an ACL injury:


Good shoes. Good shoes are necessary for you to be able to maintain traction when taking off from jumps, landing, or pivoting. If your soles are worn out or they don’t cushion your joints enough, it may be time to get a new pair.
Extra knee support. Ask your trainer about whether he or she recommends that you wrap your knee or wear a brace for additional support.

, If you are too tired to be able to train with the proper technique, you may want to consider giving yourself a rest. Injuries are more likely to occur when you:


Are sleep deprived. Most adults require approximately 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night.Are hungry or dehydrated, causing you to lose coordination.
Are ill. If you are ill, you may want to take a break to give your body time to heal.

Exercise.,
Lose weight.,
Maintain good posture while awake or asleep.,
Lift properly.,
After addressing these questions:


Align your body correctly in front of the object.",How to Prevent Back Injury," Strong back and stomach muscles are essential in order to free your back from strain throughout each day. Simple back-toning exercises strengthen your back and reduce stress. Such exercises can better your appearance, as well, so you get dual benefits.;
, Excess weight and a large belly create added pressure on back and stomach muscles. Your back compensates for the added weight in front of you by swaying backwards. This causes an overabundance of strain on the lower back muscles and places your posture out of alignment. Losing weight can lessen the burden and pain in your back.

, Many back pains can be prevented by learning to stand and sit in the proper manner. You can also help prevent back pain by sleeping on the right mattress in the correct position, and even while driving.


Stand tall - keep your head up and your shoulders back, keep your neck aligned with your body
Don't slump over in a slovenly posture when sitting. Slouching causes the back ligaments (not the muscles) to elongate and they will start to hurt, putting undesired pressure on the vertebrae
Sit up straight. Place your back against the back of the chair. Put your feet flat on the floor with your knees a tad higher than your hips
Sleep on a firm mattress. If you want, you can place plywood between your box springs and mattress. Either way provides acceptable back support. A soft mattress could bring about a back sprain or sway back (abnormal sagging of the spine); if a hard mattress is not your cup of tea, look for mattresses that are posture tested and ask the salesperson to find a mattress that will provide support and comfort - be prepared to pay a little more for this but it is worth if for your health's sake
Try to sleep on your side with your knees bent. Or, sleep on your back and place a pillow under your knees; this is especially helpful for pregnant women and those who are overweight
While you are driving, place your back against the seat and sit close enough to the wheel so that your knees are bent slightly higher than your hips; some people use small seat cushion rolls to help prevent sagging back into the base of the car seat.

, Improper lifting techniques result in unnecessary strain on the back and the surrounding muscles. To reduce strain on your back, it is essential to plan every lift in advance. Stop and think about the following:


How much does the item weigh? Is it bulky?
How far will the item be moved?
Will you need help? Be honest when assessing this question.
Are there any hazards that could be removed?
Is there equipment available that could be used safely to assist the lift?

, Place your feet straddling the object, one foot slightly in front of the other for added balance.
Squat down by bending your knees, not your stomach and back.
Grab the load tightly using both hands. Bring the object as close to your body as you can. This helps to distribute the weight of the object over your feet, making the move less difficult.
Slowly unbend your legs until you are standing upright.
Make sure that the object is not blocking your line of sight, and walk slowly. If vision is impaired and you need to look around the object, turn by moving your feet. Do not twist your back to see where you are going!
When you have reached the area the item will be placed, squat down as you did before (bending at the knees) and place the object out in front of you. If you are placing the object at table height, maintain contact with the object until you are sure it is firmly in place and will not fall.

Always warm up before class or practice.,
Stretch.,
Work out.,
If you are injured, be smart about it.",How to Prevent Common Ballet Injuries,"


Get your heart rate up by doing some laps around the studio and maybe holding plank for a minute or two.






Warm up your ankles, back and hips. Those are definitely the main three.






To warm up the feet, circle the ankles both ways about 10 times. Do some jumps, relevés and tendus. #*To warm up you back be sure to crack it (if you can) and do some twists (like turn around from the waist up) and do some bridges or ""seal stretches"".






To warm up your hips, do some battement cloches, splits, and some deep grande pliés.Don't forget to warm up other parts of your body: like hamstrings, shoulders, neck and such.





;
, Stretching at least 40 minutes per day prevents injuries and improves your dancing. If you do not have the time, it's your choice, but try to stretch every day. Even if you are on a vacation, a break or it's New Year's Eve or your birthday. If you can't do a longer stretch, try to do at least a shorter one.

, Strengthen your core and turnout muscles to prevent knee or back injuries. Simple things like doing plank, sit-ups, plies and easy classes while paying attention to every single muscle all work.

, Don't push it to make it work. Of course, all you want to do is dance, not sit and watch people do your class, but if you push it, it can become worse. If you want to, learn by watching your class closely while you rest the injury.

Debris on burners or in the oven can catch fire, especially grease and fat. Just make sure you wait until they have cooled. Do not wipe a burner while it is on or still hot.
Clean up spills. Liquids on the floor can cause you to slip and fall. This is never good, but can be even worse if you're carrying food or a hot pot. If you are in the middle of something, and can't clean it up right away, throw a towel onto the spot to remind you to get to it as soon as you can.;
, Put away dishes and utensils after you are done with them and they have been cleaned. You should always have enough room on your stove and counters to do what you need for cooking, and you don't need items in the way, or falling off counters., Because they don't cut as well, dull knives are more likely to slip and slice you.

Stay in the kitchen.,
Avoid distractions.,
Establish kitchen rules if you have children.,
Wear proper clothing.,
Use your pots properly.,
Use oven mitts.,
Use a sieve or colander for straining.,
Keep flammable objects away from the stove.,
Be careful when using the microwave.",How to Prevent Accidents in the Kitchen2," If you are frying, grilling, broiling, or doing anything else on your stove, you should always remain in the kitchen to keep an eye on things., Don't try to do other things while you are cooking. Your attention should be completely on what you are trying to do, especially if it involves heat and sharp objects. Stay in the kitchen, and off the phone. Using a timer can help, especially if you are worried something might distract you from your cooking, Set up some ground rules for when you are cooking to avoid accidents. You can either tell your children that they are not allowed in the kitchen when you are cooking or you can designate an area of the kitchen where children can be. Be consistent with your rules and your children will take you seriously., This doesn't mean pads or a body suit, but making sure you limit exposed skin to prevent against splashing., and clothing like shirts, pants, and socks to protect the rest of you. Avoid loose sleeves or jewelry, which will get in the way., You will use pots regularly when cooking. If you are not careful, they can also cause accidents from drops, spills, and burns.


Use the right size pot. If you put too much food into a pot, it can overflow, creating both a mess and the potential for fire or spills. Most food containers have a maximum capacity.Keep lids near to pots and pans in use. If you have a grease fire, or what you are cooking otherwise catches fire, you can put out the fire by covering the pan with the available lid and turning off the stove.Turn pot and pan handles in when cooking on the stove. This will ensure that pots are not accidentally knocked off the stove or pulled down by a young child. You may want to cook on the back burners whenever possible.Open hot pots away from your face. Escaping steam can burn fairly easily, so don't put your face right over a pot when you take off the lid., These should be proper mitts with insulation, and not a dishrag. Mitts are a better choice than pot holders for carrying things because they give you better grip. You should always wear something over your hands to protect from burning when carrying hot pots or pans.Mitts will not work properly if wet or worn out. Make sure your mitts are dry and still have their insulation before using. If they've worn out, you can easily burn your hands. , When pouring hot water out of a pot, using the top to hold in what you are cooking can release steam on your face and hands. This can cause burning, and make you drop the pot as well. Use a strainer for vegetables, pasta, and anything else that requires draining boiling water., This includes towels (both cloth and paper), potholders, food packaging, or anything else that might catch on fire., Always let food cool for a minute or two after running the microwave, and be careful when tasting food, as microwaves can heat things unevenly, creating hot spots. Remove covering very carefully, as escaping steam can burn."

Give yourself enough storage space.,
Get good lighting.,
Install a slip-resistant floor.,
Regulate your water temperature.,
Have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen.",How to Prevent Accidents in the Kitchen3," Clutter is dangerous in a kitchen, so you want to make sure there is enough room to store all of your cooking equipment when you aren't using it. If you don't have enough storage space, you may need to create more, or get rid of unnecessary items., A well-lit kitchen will help you to see what you are working with. It can also keep the area cheerful and welcoming.Make sure your lighting fixtures don't produce glare or shadows., Polished marble is very slippery, and can be dangerous. Instead, wood, rubber, cork, or slate are all better for a kitchen. You should also consider a non-slip mat, especially in front of the sink., Make sure your water temperature is not set too high to avoid scalding and burns. A temperature between 120 and 125 degrees should be high enough for what you need, but not too hot that you will get burned.You can also install anti-scald devices on your faucets to prevent the water from getting too hot., Since many fires start in the kitchen, get a fire extinguisher. It should be stored somewhere away from stoves and ovens, as that will be where you will most likely need it. You don't want the flames to prevent you from getting to the extinguisher.Make sure you read the instructions when you buy the extinguisher. Don't wait until you have a fire in the kitchen before you read the instruction on how to use it.

Stay warm.",How to Prevent Accidents on Icy Roads," Just because you can drive safely on icy roads, it doesn't mean other drivers can. Any time you venture out on the road when driving conditions are bad, you increase the chances of getting into an accident. If you don't really need to go out, put off driving until the roads have been salted and stay indoors., The best way to prevent an accident is by planning ahead. Knowing whether the roads will be icy can help you anticipate hazardous driving conditions or assess whether you really need to be out on the road.Your local Department of Transportation (DOT) should offer information on road conditions in your area.
You can find this information on the DOT website in the US or by searching online.
If conditions are hazardous, consider postponing your trip.
Remember that the weather can change rapidly in areas that are well above sea level. Double check weather conditions and road closure notifications if you intend to travel in high elevation areas, especially in winter.

, When driving in any hazardous conditions, it's imperative that you increase your visibility as much as possible so that other drivers can see you. Use dome lights at night to make your vehicle even more visible.Even if it's still light out, you may want to turn your headlights on so that your vehicle can be seen from a greater distance.

, It may sound obvious, but driving at high speeds puts you at a greater risk when the roads are icy. At the very least you should not exceed the posted speed limit.However, even that may be too high a speed to safely drive.


Never accelerate or decelerate rapidly. Apply the gas slowly to speed up and apply the brake pedal gently to slow down, giving yourself plenty of extra time and space to come to a complete stop.Applying too much pressure on the gas pedal will only cause your tires to spin. This can cause you to lose control of the vehicle or slide downhill if you're traveling on an incline.

, In addition to watching your speed, you'll need to watch other drivers on the road. You may be a cautious and prepared driver, but another driver's carelessness could result in property damage, serious injury, or even death. Be careful whenever you drive around other vehicles or pedestrians, and give yourself enough time to slow down before reaching stop signs and intersections.


Remember that it takes longer to stop on an icy surface.Don't follow other vehicles too closely.While it's generally recommended that you leave at least one vehicle length between you and the car in front of you, on icy roads you should at least double that distance.Stay as far away as you can from any vehicle whose driver is going too fast or is in danger of losing control of the vehicle. Slow down or move over to the side of the road so that you will not be hit if the other driver loses control and skids out.
Exercise caution when approaching and crossing intersections. Just because you slowed down to a stop on time without losing control, there's no guarantee that other drivers will be able to do so.
Be extra cautious when approaching pedestrians and crosswalks. Sliding into another car can damage the vehicle, but sliding into a pedestrian could be fatal.

, Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your vehicle may slide on a patch of ice. This is particularly common in areas that are prone to melting and refreezing, resulting in black ice. If this happens, you'll need to remain calm and resist the urges that might come naturally to you when your car slides.Try not to panic. Resist the urge to slam on the brakes, as this will only cause your vehicle to slide out more.
Don't turn the steering wheel where you want to end up. Instead, take your foot off the gas pedal and turn your steering wheel in the direction your vehicle is sliding.
If you have anti-lock brakes, apply gentle but steady pressure to the brakes (but don't ""slam"" on the pedal). If you do not have anti-lock brakes, pump the brake pedal slowly and gently so that your brakes do not lock and make the skid worse.

, Impaired and fatigued driving are tremendously dangerous under normal road conditions, but on an icy road impaired/fatigued driving dramatically increases the risk of an accident.Never drive unless you're sober and wakeful enough to get home safely.


Have a designated driver if you or anyone else with you will be drinking alcohol. Make sure your driver is sober and knows how to drive in winter conditions.
If you're too tired to drive, get off the road to a safe place.
Once you've parked your vehicle in a safe spot, take a 15 to 20 minute nap. This will help you feel refreshed and more alert.Drink a caffeinated beverage like coffee or tea to help keep you awake. If you need to nap, drink a caffeinated beverage immediately before napping so that you will feel the effects when you wake up.
If you have another driver in the vehicle with you, consider asking that individual to take over driving duties for you (if it's safe for that person to do so).

, You may get impatient being stuck behind a snow plow or salter truck, but these vehicles will make the road safer for you. Rather than trying to pass these trucks, stay behind them or pull over for a few minutes to let the salt or sand do its work on the icy pavement.Remember that passing any vehicle on icy roads may be hazardous.
In the case of snow plows, the road will be unsalted or unsanded in front of the truck. You're much safer driving behind them where they've cleared snow and laid down salt or sand.
Give plows and maintenance trucks room. Leave at least 200 feet between the truck's back bumper and the front of your vehicle., Before you travel, you should always ensure that your vehicle has enough gas and windshield washer fluid to get you safely to your destination. Insufficient gas could cause you to get stranded, and running out of windshield washer fluid can dramatically reduce your visibility on the road.Stop at a gas station whenever possible if you're running low on gas or washer fluid.

, You may not realize it, but having insufficiently-inflated tires could cause you to lose control of your vehicle on icy roads. Check your air pressure before you drive to ensure that your tires can properly handle the road., If you live in an area that's prone to icy road conditions, it may be helpful to keep some supplies stored in your vehicle. That way, if you ever get stranded somewhere, you know that you'll be prepared.A good emergency kit should include the following:


at least two blankets and/or sleeping bags
extra clothing, including a winter hat, gloves, a parka, and warm boots
bottled drinking water
high-calorie food that won't go bad, such as candy or packaged nuts (if you're not allergic)
flares and reflectors
a flashlight and extra batteries
booster cables
a snow shovel and scraper
a bag of sand, cat litter, or pieces of carpet for tire traction
extra windshield fluid and antifreeze

, Before you begin driving, you should always ensure that your vehicle is free from snow and ice. Even if you can see well enough to drive while your vehicle is parked, snow and ice may come loose and create a hazard for you or other drivers while you're in motion.Don't just clear off the windows. Snow on the hood can blow onto your windshield and reduce your visibility, while snow on the roof can blow back onto other drivers' windshields.
Ice that seems caked to your vehicle could come loose and fly onto another driver's windshield on the road. This can cause accidents or property damage.
Brush away as much snow as you can from every surface of your vehicle and try to gently chip away at any loose ice pieces with the scraper side of your snow brush or an ice scraper.
Make sure your headlights, taillights, fog lights, and turn signals are all clear of snow and visible to other drivers.

, Depending on where you live, you may be required to use snow chains during part of the year. Sometimes this is even mandated by law.If you live in or are traveling through an area where snow chains are necessary, keep them in your vehicle and know when and how to use them.Before you apply snow chains, make sure your vehicle is at a complete stop, then put the parking brake on. This will ensure that your vehicle doesn't move while you apply the chains.


Untangle the chains so they form a web shape. Then check your owner's manual to determine whether the chains should go on your front or rear tires.
If your vehicle has front-wheel drive, put the chains on your front tires. If you have rear-wheel drive, put them on the back tires.
Start from the top of each tire and work the chains down to the ground. You won't be able to cover the portion of your tires touching pavement, but you should get the chains down as close as possible to the road.
Once both tires have as much of the tires covered as the road allows, disengage the parking brake and pull forward a few feet. Then re-apply the parking brake and cover the remaining portion of each tire with the chains.
Use a closer link to tighten the chains. Then drive about 50 to 100 feet, pull over, re-apply the parking brake, and re-tighten the chains, as they will have some initial slack after they've spread across the tires.

, If anyone is injured or if an emergency arises, call for emergency services. In the United States, this phone number will always be 911. If everyone is safe and your car is stuck in the snow or in a ditch, call for a tow truck. You can find tow truck operators near you by searching online (if you have a smartphone), or by calling someone with access to the internet to look for you.If you have roadside assistance, call that number and the dispatcher will arrange for a tow truck to come get you.

, If you're ever stranded or in an accident, you should always stay inside your vehicle. Leaving your vehicle leaves you susceptible to hypothermia, inclement weather, and getting hit by other vehicles on the road. You may also get lost and have a hard time finding your vehicle again. Getting out of your vehicle also increases the chances of overexerting yourself. You may end up injuring yourself, having a heart attack, or simply getting wet and cold, which could lead to hypothermia.Put your four-way hazard lights on and keep your headlights on so other drivers can see you. You can also leave the dome light on (if it's dark out), as this increases visibility without significantly draining your battery.

, Your number one priority when you're stranded should be to stay warm. If you've contacted a tow truck or emergency services, you should only have a short wait. However, depending on where you are and how busy those services are, you may have to keep warm for a while.Clear snow away from the radiator and the exhaust pipe of your vehicle. This will reduce the risk of your engine overheating or your vehicle filling with carbon monoxide.
Only run the engine for 10-minute intervals to heat the vehicle. Once the vehicle warms up, turn the engine off after about 10 minutes so that you do not burn through all your fuel or overheat the engine.
Put on any extra clothing you have so you stay warm. If you're wearing loose clothing, try to tighten it as much as possible.
Change positions frequently and move your arms and legs to keep your blood circulating. Rub your hands together or stuff them in your armpits to keep your fingers warm, and periodically remove your shoes to rub your feet.

Use oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE).,
Sample some citronella oil.,
Patchouli oil can be used in the same manner for similar results.,
Make lavender insect repellent.,
Choose clove oil.",How to Make Natural Insect Repellent1," Known by the “fever tree” and “blue gum tree” pseudonyms, the eucalyptus tree is primarily exported from Australia, and its oil serves not only as an insect repellent, but also a natural insecticide.While OLE is not recommended by the CDC because it lacks the extensive testing required for commercial repellents and synthesized materials, the efficacy of OLE as a mosquito and deer tick repellent is widely recognized.One example of an OLE-based insect repellent is to mix 2 tablespoons of witch hazel (relives skin irritation), 2 tablespoons of a carrier oil like almond or olive, a half teaspoon of vodka, and 100 drops of OLE. Shake it in a spray bottle, apply it to the skin, and reapply every few hours.A simpler approach would be to just blend 1 part OLE with 10 parts witch hazel (sunflower oil as a substitute) and apply it directly to the skin.;
, The oil from citronella comes from a grass indigenous to some Asian countries, and is extracted via steam distillation. Aside from various benefits like being an antibacterial and antiseptic, the insect repellent properties work on mosquitoes that carry Yellow Fever, lice, and fleas.Citronella oil may evaporate quickly, requiring frequent reapplication. Apply minimal amounts of pure citronella oil to your forearms for up to two hours of protection.

,


Mix citronella oil with some vanillin then moderately apply it on your skin to get brief protection., Lavender oil is extracted from the flowers of the lavender plant via steam distillation, and has been known as a soothing fragrance for quite some time. Whether applied directly or as part of a formula you've concocted at home, it can also be used as an insect repellent.A liquid soap can be created by adding 10-15 drops of lavender essential oil to some Castile soap, a plant oil-based soap made without animal fats.You may also dilute it into a carrier oil like olive oil, or put it in some apple cider vinegar.Create a potent mix by using 10-25 drops of lavender oil with a couple tablespoons of olive oil. Stir the contents until blended and dab on your skin when applicable.Try a heavier lavender based option by using 25 drops of the essential oil and a quarter cup apple cider vinegar. Mix together well and apply as necessary.
Combine 15 drops of lavender oil, a few tablespoons of vanilla extract, 1/4 cup of lemon juice, and some distilled water. Shake up the combo and spray it on exposed skin., In some tests, the use of undiluted clove oil repelled three species of mosquitoes for up to four hours, which outperformed diluted oils by up to two hours, and similar undiluted oils like citronella and patchouli, against three species of mosquitoes.Clove plants can also be placed around the yard to repel insects before they even get to you.Mixing equal parts clove oil with some makaen oil mixture and applying approximately 0.1g for every 3x10 cm of exposed skin has shown a repellency of over 95% efficacy for up to 5 hours.Try 6 drops of clove oil mixed with patchouli, grapefruit, lavender oil, and carrier oil for a easy to use spray."

Use apple cider vinegar (ACV) as a base for herbs.,
Mix herbs with distilled water.,
Combine turmeric with various ingredients to make an effective repellent.,
Use dish washing liquid to make homemade spider repellents.",How to Make Natural Insect Repellent2," ACV is an astringent, meaning it constricts body tissues.It serves as a great base for mixing kitchen ingredients that can battle the bugs.


Add 32oz of apple cider vinegar to 2 Tbsp each of the following herbs sage, rosemary, lavender, thyme and mint. Shake it each day for two weeks, then strain the herbs and dilute the oil mixture with water.Use sparingly, this is supposed to be a strong one!

, If the vinegar base is too dense, or has too strong a smell for you, distilled water works well. Boil water with 3-4 Tbsps of any of the following dried herbs: peppermint, spearmint, citronella, lemongrass, or catnip. Use whichever combo you prefer. Once it’s mixed, let it cool down before straining. Add in a bit of rubbing alcohol and you have a great mix., The spice comes from the turmeric plant, commonly found in curry. Sometimes it’s used in powders, mustards, and butters for its strong flavor and taste.In lab studies, adding just 5% vanillin to various ingredients, including turmeric, increased ability to repel mosquitoes for up to 8 hours.Try combining the two ingredients, 95% turmeric and 5% vanillin, to replicate the mixture. Or experiment with varying combinations until you gain the greatest effectiveness.
Turmeric has been used as an insect repellent in Indian families for generations.Make the repellent by grinding turmeric together with navadhanya grains and water. Once that paste is combined, add some slaked lime, which is essentially limewater, until the color turns red.Use pure turmeric sprinkled where you want to deter pests. The high curcumin content in turmeric hinders the insects’ access to oxygen, and the antimicrobial aspects create an unendurable environment for bedbugs.Mix turmeric powder and neem leaf powder together. Mix with water to form a paste. Smear over uncovered flesh. The neem leaf has shown the ability to not only repel insects near the tree, but also disrupt insect breeding nearby.This natural insect repellent combo will keep insects at bay for an hour or more. Reapply as needed., Simply combine 5 drops of dish washing liquid and 5 drops of essential oils – particularly citrus-based oils – to keep the eight-legged pests away.

Use beer to keep insects at bay.,
Cover every inch of flesh with a thin layer of wet blue clay or mud.,
Plaster animal fat on your skin.,
Find native airborne flame retardant poisons.",How to Make Natural Insect Repellent3," You can make traps and repellents using beer. Try mixing equal parts flat beer with mouthwash, then add in Epsom salt and dry yeast. Shake vigorously and put it in a spray bottle. Use it as a barrier around locations you want to keep pest-free, and they are likely to cross.

, This layer solidifies into a thin sheet that will help protect you from being bitten, even if there are cracks where the skin folds.This method was used by Native Americans and works against pests drawn to smell or those that bite.You may still be pestered, but most insects will not be able to bite through this layer.

, The Cherokees and Akokisa used bear fat and alligator fat, respectively, as their natural insect repellent.You may need to render the fat prior to usage.Sometimes the fat was combined with pine tar for an especially greasy concoction., Black Jack can often be collected around, and in, shrubs to burn as an insect killer and repellent. Ensuring moisture in plant fires produces large amounts of smoke, helping to deter the insects."

Do not rub or scratch the affected area.,
Immediately carefully remove any clothing you wore while in contact with fiberglass.,
Wash your skin if you are exposed to fiberglass.,
Remove any fibers that are visible.,
Use a cream to soothe your skin.,
Wash clothing and any other materials that may have come in contact with fiberglass.,
Clean your work area.,
Pay attention to the affected area.,
Wear appropriate clothing when handling fiberglass.,
Keep your work area clean and ventilated.,
Shower after handling fiberglass.,
Talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have about fiberglass exposure.",How to Lessen Fiberglass Itch," Fiberglass can cause intense itching on the skin, and it is tempting to scratch it. However, this can force the irritating fibers deeper into or over the skin, making the problem even worse., Keep it apart from your other clothing as personal items, and wash it separately. This will help keep the fibers from spreading and causing more irritation.

, If you see, feel, or suspect that your skin has come into contact with fiberglass, you should wash the area as soon as possible. If you are already suffering from itching and irritation, wash the affected area with mild soap and warm running water.You can use a washcloth very lightly to help remove fibers.
If fiberglass got in your eyes, flush them with water for at least 15 minutes., If you see individual fibers sticking out of or just under the skin, you can try to carefully remove them yourself.This will help to stop the irritation.


First, wash your hands and clean the area with soap and water (if you have not already).
Sterilize tweezers by wiping them with rubbing alcohol, then use them to remove the fibers.A magnifying glass can help you see small fibers.
If you see the fibers but cannot remove them easily with tweezers, sterilize a clean sharp needle by wiping it with rubbing alcohol.Use it to lift or break the skin over the fiber. Then use sterile tweezers to remove it.
Squeeze the site gently gently to allow bleeding to wash germs out. Wash the area again and apply an antibiotic cream.
If you see fibers deep below the skin, contact a doctor and do not try to remove them yourself.

, After washing the area of skin affected by fiberglass, apply a quality skin cream.This can help to soothe and moisturize your skin, giving some relief from the irritation. You can also apply an over-the counter anti-itch cream for additional relief.

, Remove any clothes worn while in contact with fiberglass, and keep them separate from other clothes. Wash them as soon as possible, separately from any other clothes. This will help to prevent any lingering fibers from spreading and causing irritation.If there is a lot of fiber material on the clothing, presoak it before washing. This will help to loosen the fibers and rinse them away.
After washing your clothing that came into contact with fiberglass, rinse your washer with water before washing any other clothing. This will wash away any fibers that might have stuck in the machine, and keep them from spreading to other clothes.

, If you were working with fiberglass when you came into contact with it, be sure to clear any remaining bits of fiberglass from your work area as soon as possible. This will help prevent another reaction to the material.


Use a vacuum to remove bits of fiberglass, rather than a dry broom (which may sweep particles into the air).
Wearing protective clothing, goggles, and a mask or respirator while cleaning will also keep particles from affecting your skin, eyes, or lungs., While contact with fiberglass can be painful and irritating, the symptoms should subside soon if you follow the steps for treatment. If the itching and irritation persists, however, seek medical attention., Whenever you work with or know you will be exposed to fiberglass, wear protective clothing. Long sleeves, pants, closed-toed shoes, and gloves will all help to protect your skin from fibers.Try to keep as much of your skin covered as possible.


Wearing any sort of respirator or face mask will also protect you from breathing in airborne particles of fiberglass., If you are working with fiberglass, your work area should have a good airflow so that bits of the material do not linger in the air and settle on your skin or clothing and so that you do not breathe them in. Keep your work clothes separated from other clothes.
Don’t eat, drink, or smoke while handling fiberglass. This will keep you from accidentally eating or inhaling fiberglass particles.
If you notice any symptoms of irritation caused by fiberglass, stop and treat them before returning to work.

, Shower as soon as possible after handling or being exposed to fiberglass—even if you don’t notice any irritation or itching. This will help to rinse away any fibers that might be on your skin but that aren’t yet causing a reaction.Showering with cold water, if you don’t yet notice any reaction, will rinse any fiberglass particles off of your skin while also keeping your pores closed and any particles out of them. , If you are unsure about your symptoms, or your contact with fiberglass, talk to your doctor.


Some people may develop a kind of tolerance to fiberglass in time, so that it doesn’t irritate them in the way it once did. However, this does not mean that there are no potential skin or lung problems, so always be careful handling fiberglass."

Remove the ticks.,
Wrap the tick tightly in tape.,
Kill with rubbing alcohol.,
Wash your hands and the bite area.,
Save the tick.,
Watch for symptoms.",How to Kill a Tick1," If the tick is fastened to a person or a pet, detach it first. Grasp the tick's head with a pair of tweezers with pointy tips. Pull slowly upward, in a straight motion.Tweezers with wide tips may crush the tick or squeeze out infectious germs.
Never use your bare hands. If you must touch the tick, wear disposable gloves.;
, Cover the tick with transparent tape on all sides. The tick will die on its own, and cannot get free.This is the best method to use, since the tick will be mostly undamaged.This makes it easy for a doctor to identify the tick, if you end up showing symptoms.


You can use a sealed, clear container instead, such as a small zip-locked bag. Check for holes and make sure it is fully sealed.

, If you do not have tape, drop the tick into a container full of alcohol.It may take a while for the tick to die. Watch it or cover with a transparent lid to make sure it does not escape.


Water will not kill the tick. If you don't have rubbing alcohol, try bleach or vinegar.

, Scrub with rubbing alcohol or an iodine scrub, if you have it. Use soapy water if not.This reduces the chance of an infection spreading.

, Tape the dead or trapped tick over an index card. On the card, write the date you found the tick, and locations it might have come from. Store it away from pets and children.

, Some ticks can spread diseases, especially deer ticks. Bring the victim and the tick to a doctor if the victim develops these symptoms within three months:Fever or chills
Headaches, muscle aches, or joint pain
A rash, especially a large red ""bulls eye"" rash.

Swollen lymph nodes, usually in the armpit or groin

Determine the severity of the bite.,
Identify the type of animal.,
Look for loss of blood.,
Evaluate pain levels.,
Find any additional injuries.,
Seek immediate medical treatment.,
Ask about vaccination history.,
Monitor for infection.,
Watch for signs of tetanus.,
Seek a doctor’s opinion.,
Get immediate medical attention in certain situations.,
Teach your pet not to bite.,
Know the signs of an impending bite.,
Stay away from unfamiliar pets.",How to Know if a Pet Bite Is Serious," Look at the bite to evaluate how severe the victim's condition is. Check for signs such as bruising, punctured skin, bleeding, and objects stuck in the wound. The more severe the bruising or bleeding looks, the worse the bite is.A bite that shows only minor scratching and irritation to the skin is likely not serious. It should be cleaned with soap and warm water and monitored as it heals, but likely will not need medical attention.
A severe bite that may need additional attention will include either rapid heavy bruising of unbroken skin, heavy or uncontrollable bleeding of broken skin, multiple punctures to the skin, or an object such as a tooth stuck in the skin.;
, If possible, try to quickly identify the type of animal that caused the bite. Naturally venomous reptiles, amphibians, and arachnids may or may not be de-fanged, and dogs with strong jaws such as pitbulls and rottweilers may be able to cause greater immediate injury.If the pet was not yours, ask the owner what type of animal the pet was, down to the species or breed.
If you don’t know if a certain type of exotic pet is venomous, quickly search online or call a local vet’s office to see if they have anymore information.

, A little bleeding is common with many pet bites, but rapid or uncontrollable bleeding can quickly become problematic. Look at the bite site to see if blood is slowly pushing out of the injury, or if there is a fast flow or heavy squirts of blood.Regardless of how much blood is being lost, try to stop excess blood flow by elevating the injury and applying pressure to the wound when possible. Use medical gauze or a towel to keep the blood from getting on others.
If you notice blood loss, it is important to act quickly to slow the loss and seek medical attention. After you get the bleeding under control, you need to see a doctor right away. If you can’t stop the bleeding within 10 minutes, then call 911.A loss of as little as 15 percent of a person’s blood can have negative side effects., A pet bite that breaks the skin will likely cause some form of discomfort. However, extreme pain may be an indicator of problems under the surface such as hemorrhaging or a broken bone. Check with the bite victim to see if they feel any identifiable discomfort under the broken skin.You may also test levels of pain by applying very gentle pressure to the affected area. If the bite victim has an extreme reaction to a normal touch, that may indicate trauma under the skin.

, If the bite was accompanied by other force, such as the pet knocking the person down or pushing them into a wall, look for other potential injuries such as serious bruising, a concussion, or other breaks and tears in the skin. Even if the bite is not serious, accompanying injuries may be.Additional injuries may be especially common when a larger animal such as a large-breed dog bites a child or an already injured individual.
Signs of additional trauma may include pain or swelling at a point of impact, broken skin and/or bleeding, or heavy bruising on an impacted area.

, If you notice any signs of physical trauma, do not wait to see if more problems appear. Seek medical attention at a clinic or emergency room. Let the doctors know everything you can about the bite, including what type of animal caused it, when it happened, and any pain or symptoms that the bite victim has reported. You should seek emergency medical treatment if:


the bite is from a severe attack.
there is heavy bleeding.
there is injury to the face, eyes or scalp.
the bite is from a stray pet or household pet that has not or may not have received rabies protection., If the biting pet was not yours, ask the owners about the animal’s vaccination history. In particular, let them know, “I would like to see records of your pet’s last rabies vaccine, as well as any other vaccines they have had in the past year.”If the owner refuses to provide you with this information, call your local animal control office and ask for assistance in acquiring the necessary information.
If the biting pet was your pet, check their vet records to see if they are up to date on all of their vaccinations.
If the pet does not have a current rabies vaccine wash the wound with warm water and seek immediate medical attention from an emergency or urgent care facility., Certain bites, such as bites from cats, are more likely to become infected. Monitor the wound closely for early signs of infection, which may include swelling, redness, or difficulty moving the bitten area.If you think the bite is likely to become infected because of the particular animal or the conditions under which the bite happened, contact your doctor immediately and let them know, “I worry that this pet bite might become infected. Do you recommend any immediate medical attention?”
Wash a bite with a mild soap and warm water, apply antibiotic ointment, and dress it with a clean bandage immediately after receiving the bite to help reduce chances of infection., Animal bites that break the skin may allow the bacteria that causes tetanus to enter into the body. If the bite victim has not had a recent tetanus booster within the last 5 years or is not immunized against the disease, immediate medical help should be sought.Those who have been immunized should check with their general practitioner to ask about their most recent tetanus booster and see if their doctor recommends any additional preventative care at that time.
Symptoms of tetanus, if left untreated, may appear in as little as four days and include jaw cramping, involuntary muscle stiffening, trouble swallowing, seizure, fevers, and an accelerated heart rate., If you have any concerns regarding a bite, even if it shows no immediate signs of trauma or infection, it can still be helpful to check with your doctor. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible and let them know that you want them to evaluate a pet bite.Report any soreness, tenderness, or residual pain to the doctor. This could be an indicator that something was damaged under the skin.
Let your doctor know what kind of animal bit you and how long ago the bite happened. Include any information you may have on the animal’s vaccination status.
Ask your doctor, “What type of care or treatment do you recommend for this injury?” Follow any wound care routines and take any prescribed medications as instructed.

, There are some situations where you should seek immediate medical attention for a bite no matter what. These situations include:

Being bitten by a cat.
Getting a bite from a dog to the hand or foot.
Getting a bite that is deep, large, and/or that caused a laceration large enough to require stitches.
Having a broken bone or internal injury.
When a child has been bitten on the head.
When there are signs of infection including redness, pus, swelling, and worsening pain.
When the bite was sustained by a person with diabetes, cancer, liver, lung disease, AIDs or another condition causing a weakened immune system., If your dog or cat was the one responsible for the bite, enroll in a training program or work with your pet at home to teach it not to bite. Often, many animal rescues and shelters have training programs for aggressive pets. Call and ask if their programs are open to pets from the community, as well.If you have a pet that is not easily trained, such as a snake, frog, or small mammal, make sure the pet is kept in proper housing with an effective locking mechanism.
If you have a pet that requires certain equipment such as gloves to handle them, make sure to always use the equipment properly every time you handle your pet.

, Different types of animals have different signs that indicate they may be about to bite. Learn common signs of distress for typical pets such as dogs and cats to help identify potential bite risks.


Signs a dog is about to bite may include snarling, barking, growling, ears back, an aggressively wagging tail, repeated stress yawning, and more.Signs a cat is about to bite or scratch include increased stiffness in the body and a twitching of the tail. Cats are especially prone to bite during tummy rubs, as well., If you do not know if a pet is friendly or not, err on the side of caution. Keep a safe distance from any pets you do not know until you’ve talked to their owners and have a better idea of the pet’s demeanour.When you want to approach a new pet for the first time, ask the owner, “Is it alright if I touch your pet? Does your pet have any issues with temperament that I should be aware of while interacting with them?”
Allow the pet owner to instruct you or demonstrate for you how to interact with their pet for the first time.

Recognize the appearance and most likely location of fire ants.,
Be aware of the symptoms.There are local symptoms (localized to the area of the bite), as well as more systemic (full body) symptoms in some people who are susceptible to allergic reactions.,
Watch out for signs of an allergic reaction.,
Call the Poison Control Center or Emergency Medical Services.If you suspect that you have a fire ant sting, it is always important to get professional advice on how best to proceed.,
Treat mild fire ant stings with home remedies.If you have seen a medical professional and ruled out a serious reaction to your fire ant sting, you can proceed to treatment via home remedies.,
Take an oral anti-histamine.Another option to control itchiness is to take an oral anti-histamine such as Benadryl, which is particularly good for treating a sting or reaction to a sting.,
Use a topical corticosteroid cream.You can purchase 1% hydrocortisone cream at your local pharmacy or drugstore, and apply this over the area of the bite.,
Use an EpiPen and go to the hospital for severe allergic reactions.As previously mentioned, severe allergic reactions can be life-threatening if not handled immediately.,
Understand that your risk of severe allergic reaction increases after one bite.If you have been stung once, you should carry an EpiPen with you in the future in case you ever get stung again.,
Take comfort in knowing that the vast majority of people recover well.In less serious cases, the sting should feel better within a few hours to a few days.",How to Identify Fire Ant Stings," Fire ants are red or black colored insects containing venom (poison) that gets into your system when they bite you. They sting easily with little provocation, and you usually get multiple stings from multiple fire ants at once as they come in groups.They are quite prevalent in areas in the southeast United States, and have appeared as far west as California., Common local symptoms of fire ant stings include:


Itchiness around the bite
Pain and burning around the bite (hence the name ""fire"" ant)
Swelling and redness around the bite
The bite may blister, which typically lasts three to eight days and then scabs over as it recovers

, In addition to the local symptoms of a venomous fire ant bite, you want to be especially careful if you notice any systemic (full body) symptoms indicating a potential allergic reaction.An allergic reaction can progress rapidly and, in rare occasions, be extremely serious or even fatal. Therefore, it is key to know the signs and to call Emergency Medical Services (911) for help if needed. Allergic symptoms include:


Rapid swelling in the areas surrounding the bite (for instance, if the bite is on your arm, your whole arm may begin to swell)
Difficulty breathing and/or tightness in the chest
Swelling of the throat and/or lips and tongue
A fast heart rate, accompanied by a feeling of dizziness and/or light-headedness.

, This is because the complications of not properly dealing with a fire ant sting can, in rare cases, be very serious and even life-threatening. Therefore, always seek out professional advice, even if you feel that your sting is not serious; it is better to be safe than sorry.


The phone number for the National Poison Control Centre in the United States is 1-800-222-1222.
Call 911 for Emergency Medical Services, or drive to the nearest hospital or doctor's office.

, This includes washing the bite gently with soap and water. Do not use alcohol to clean it. After washing your sting, you can use ice to diminish the pain and to reduce the inflammation. Ice for 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off, until you begin to feel symptom relief.


You can wash the stings with warm water and vinegar, which may help neutralize the venom of the ants and bring some relief.

, These are available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle.

, This will reduce symptoms such as swelling and inflammation, and it will also decrease the pain.


Do not use for a longer period than that recommended by your doctor, or, if self-administered, what is listed on the box.

, If you have a history of being allergic to insect bites (such as bee stings), your likelihood of suffering a severe allergic reaction from a fire ant sting will be higher as well. Therefore, if in doubt, carry an EpiPen with you as a preventative measure.


Always go to the hospital if you show signs of a severe allergic reaction. In hospital, they will monitor your vital signs (such as your heart rate, your respiratory rate, and your blood pressure) to ensure that you are stable for a period of time prior to discharging you.
They can also administer IV fluids as needed, breathing support, and medications if your condition deteriorates for any reason.

, This is the best preventative strategy, especially if you find yourself in areas of the southeast United States where fire ant stings are common.


Other preventative strategies include having an exterminator get rid of any fire ant nests on your property (if that is where you got stung), receiving allergy shots, and protecting yourself by wearing full-body clothing, socks and shoes if you are in an area known to have fire ants. (And remember to tuck your pant legs into socks so that they can't climb up and into your pants!)

, For those with allergic reactions, it is not so simple; however, with prompt medical treatment, there are usually no long-term consequences.

Look for a two-fanged puncture wound.,
Look for a ""bull's eye"" bite wound.,
Watch for needle-like hairs in your skin.,
Identify other spider bites.,
Remember that many insect bites are more painful than spider bites.,
Watch for painful scorpion stings.,
Don't confuse tick bites as spider bites.",How to Identify a Spider Bite," A bite from a black widow is often immediately painful and can be distinguished from other spider and insect bites by the two puncture marks it makes on the skin.Although it may be painless, usually a black widow bite is at least moderately painful because the spider has long, sharp fangs. The two-fanged puncture wound then starts to turn red, become inflamed and form a nodule. Tenderness at the bite site tends to increase and spread out within an hour.


Pay attention to more serious side effects such as severe muscle cramping (especially in the abdomen), excessive sweating around the bite mark, nausea, headache, delirium, chills and high blood pressure. These are all reactions to the spider's neurotoxic venom.Anti-venom is available if the black widow bite causes severe pain and symptoms. It's injected into the thigh or given through a vein (intravenously) by a medical professional, although the anti-venom can cause serious allergic reactions that are worse than the symptoms caused by the venom.
For identification purposes, the black widow spider is shiny, round and has a red diamond (or hourglass) shape on its underbelly. In the U.S., this spider is more common in the southern and western states.;
, A bite from a brown recluse spider is usually painless or causes a mild stinging sensation similar to a mosquito bite. Within about 30 – 60 minutes however, the bite area becomes red and inflamed with a central sore called a ""bull’s eye"" lesion.Redness and intense pain develop within eight hours as the central sore becomes larger, fills with blood, ruptures and then leaves a very tender ulcer. During this stage, a deep blue or purple area often forms around the bite, usually with a red ring around it.Medical attention is usually only needed if an ulcer forms and lasts for more than a few weeks.


In most cases the ulcer heals over with a scab and flakes off within a few weeks, but sometimes it can take many months for complete recovery if the victim's immune system isn't very strong — which is often the case in children and the elderly.
There is no anti-venom to help control the effects of a brown recluse spider bite. Its venom is classified as necrotizing, which means it kills the surrounding tissue and turns it black or blue.
To treat the wound, clean it with mild soap and water. Apply cold packs and elevate the area to reduce pain and inflammation.Take over-the-counter pain relievers (acetaminophen) or anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen) as needed.
For identification purposes, brown recluse spiders are brown or yellowish. They have long spindly legs and a body with a head and oval abdomen. They're found in dark, quiet places in southern and Midwestern states.

, Although tarantulas are arguably some of the most scary looking spiders, the types native to North and South America are not venomous and rarely ever bite.However, these ""New World"" tarantulas do throw or eject needle-like black hairs when agitated or threatened. The hairs lodge with skin and trigger an allergic-type reaction (anaphylaxis) involving hives, swelling and breathing difficulty, particularly in sensitized individuals. The initial pain is usually described as a stinging sensation.


Sensitized people are usually pet owners who handle their tarantula frequently.
Tarantula species native to Africa and the Middle East lack needle-like hairs, but they are more aggressive and produce venom.

, The bites from black widow and brown recluse spiders are most identifiable, mostly due to the fact that they have the most potent venom and typically cause the most symptoms.However, other spider bites are more common and can lead to pain and swelling also. For example, the Hobo is a large, fast-running spider with yellow markings on its brown back. They inject neurotoxic venom when they bite people that can cause some surrounding skin to die, but not nearly to the extent that brown recluse venom does.


Bites from Hobo and Sac spiders cause discomfort and wounds that mimic a bee or wasp sting, although the initial pain is much less because the fangs of these spiders are not nearly as large or strong as bees / wasps.
To help identify the type of spider bite you have, capture the spider or take a photo with your phone and take it to a local clinic (someone might be able to identify it) or research it online. Most spider bites or harmless or cause only mild discomfort that fades away after a few days.Treating spider bites with antiseptic gel, ice and over-the-counter medications is typically all that's needed.
Generally speaking, spiders bite only in defense, particularly while being crushed between your skin and something else., Spider bites are often falsely suspected by patients because they assume that spiders can do more damage than what they're actually capable of.For example, insects such as bees and wasps use powerful stingers to inflict skin wounds, which does much more initial damage than the small fangs of spiders. A bee leaves its stinger in the skin and then dies shortly thereafter, whereas wasps (including hornets and yellow jackets) can sting you repeatedly.Reaction to bee and wasp stings can range from minor skin swelling and redness (like a small contusion or bruise) to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) in those who are sensitive — medical attention may be necessary. Bees and wasps don't inject venom, but kill many more people per year than spiders due to anaphylaxis reactions that go untreated.
Anaphylaxis is usually controlled by epinephrine (adrenaline) injections that reduce the body's allergic response. An injection can be given by your doctor or administered at home if you have an epinephrine ""pen"".
The type of spider bites most often confused with bee / wasp stings are from Hobo and Sac spiders. Black widow bites can cause similar serious symptoms, but their two-fanged puncture wound doesn't resemble a bee / wasp sting.

, Although scorpions have crab-like pincers, they sting with their tail instead of pinching or biting. Scorpion stings are usually painful and cause localized redness and inflammation, but they are rarely serious and usually don't need medical attention. However, the bark scorpion can inflict potentially fatal stings because it produces a potent neurotoxic venom.Although the sting marks of scorpions look much different than the two-fanged puncture wounds of black widows, the pain and other symptoms can be quite similar because both species produces neurotoxic venom.
An antivenin (Anascorp) is available, but it's not used widely in the U.S. due to America's low mortality rates.
Much like most spider bites, the vast majority of scorpion stings can be treated with antiseptic gel, ice and over-the-counter medications.
The bark scorpion is native to Arizona, New Mexico and parts of California.

, Tick bites are sometimes confused as brown recluse spider bites (and vice versa) because they can also produce a skin reaction that looks like a bull's eye.Some ticks (such as deer ticks) may carry Lyme disease, so they shouldn't be taken lightly. Symptoms from a tick bite that carries Lyme disease include a skin rash in concentric rings, which appears up to a month later, as well as fever, fatigue, headaches and aches in muscles and joints.


The main differences from a brown recluse spider bite is that tick bites don't initially hurt and never lead to ulceration (necrosis) of the skin surrounding the bite.
Another difference is that ticks usually burrow into the skin before infecting the host, so you can sometimes see them underneath the top layer of skin. In contrast, spiders don't burrow or nest in or on people.

Use a treatment specifically for your pet's species (such as cat or dog).
If small children or other pets are in the house, look for an oral medicine.
Never use a treatment that contains an organophosphate. Check the ingredients for amitraz, fenoxycarb, permethrin, propoxur, and tetrachlorvinphos (TCVP)., Dry heat will kill almost all ticks, but wet heat might not. After walking through areas with ticks, put your clothes through the dryer. Wash them afterward, then dry again., This chemical kills ticks faster than other insecticides, and is safer for humans.Spray it over your clothes before a hike, and on the inside rim of shirt sleeves and trouser legs.



Never use permethrin around cats. They can become sick and may even die.Talk to your doctor first if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or allergic to ragweed.Permethrin skin cream is not typically used for ticks.

Clear your yard.,
Create a border around woodlands.,
Spread nematodes.,
Use pesticides cautiously.,
Add guinea fowl to your farm.,
Keep an eye out for tick robots.",How to Kill a Tick3," Ticks need damp and shade to stay alive. Clear your yard of leaf litter and shady hiding places. Keep grass mowed short.


Rodents and deer can transport ticks. Keep them away by tightly covering all trash and food kept outdoors. Use a fence to keep away deer.

, If your yard is next to the woods, create a three foot wide border of dry mulch or gravel. This prevents plant growth, and makes it much harder for ticks to enter your yard.

, Give the ticks a parasite of their own to worry about. These microscopic worms are sold online, and come in many types. The ones sold as a tick treatment are completely harmless to humans and pets. Mix with water and spread over your yard. Keep the area moist for seven days while the worms get established.Look for Steinernema carpocapsae or Heterorhabditis bacteriophora if you have a deer tick (black-legged tick) problem. Ask a vet about nematodes for other types of ticks.

, Many pesticides are dangerous for pets, children, or local wildlife. If you decide to use them, hire a licensed pesticide applier for a yearly or twice-yearly visit. Before he begins, ask for a written plan with safety information, and for signs to post around your property.


Permethrin, a common anti-tick pesticide, can kill cats and fish.

, Guinea fowl hunt and eat ticks. Deer ticks are often small enough to escape, but there should be many fewer than before. Be aware that guinea fowl can be very noisy., As of March 2015, Delaware company is raising money to test the next stage of a tick-slaying robot. The ticks are tricked into latching on and drinking pesticides, killing them in a much safer way than a pesticide spray. It will be a while before an individual or even a pesticide company can buy one, but maybe one day, you'll have your own yard Terminator."

Inspect your bites.,
Look for new bug bites when you wake up.,
Pay attention to where you’re being bitten.,
Look for signs of an allergy.",How to Identify Bed Bug Bites1," Look for slightly discolored, pin-like raised red dots that are about 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm in diameter. You may also see hives or wheals that are significantly redder than the surrounding skin. If you’re experiencing a more rare, severe case, you might even find blisters larger than 0.5 cm in diameter that have developed on bed bug bites.1 centimeter equals 0.4 inches.;
, If you wake up with fresh bug bites or itchy welts, you likely have bed bugs. See if they look and feel like mosquito or flea bites -- bed bug bites are often red and slightly swollen, itchy and irritating like other bug bites. Look for a series of bites that appear in a line or a random grouping of bites. These appear because bed bugs will bite several times a night.If you’re experiencing new bites during the day, it’s likely not bed bugs.

, Look for bites on skin that is exposed when you’re sleeping. Also check for bites under loose clothing. Note that bed bugs will avoid the soles of your feet, so any bites there are less likely to be from bed bugs., If you’re allergic to bed bugs, you might find that you develop hives or a rash similar to eczema or a fungal infection. Also check to see if the bites are getting larger, are painfully swelling, or even exuding a pus. These are also common signs of an allergy to bed bug bites.Note that it can take up to two weeks for your body to fully react to a bed bug bite.
Consult a doctor if you develop a severe reaction to the bite.

Avoid processed foods.,
Maintain a balanced diet.,
Eat the right amounts and at the right times.,
Drink water to stay hydrated.,
Avoid false energy.,
Consider herbal teas and supplements.",How to Feel Energetic Every Day1," This will help you maintain a healthy diet and have more energy. Fresh, whole foods are a better choice than processed foods because they contain more nutrition and healthy vitamins. Processed foods — such as those found in microwaveable meals, fast food, and prepared foods — are high in calories. They often include preservatives, added sugar, added fat, dyes, and more. Such foods provide little nutrition, which translates to less energy.Whole foods — which are rich in nutrients — provide much more energy to your body. They include fruits, vegetables, unsalted nuts, lean meats, fresh fish or shellfish, eggs, low-fat milk, plain yogurt, and low-fat cheese.;
, Keep in mind the importance of whole foods and make sure your diet is well-balanced, meaning all food groups are represented. A balanced diet will promote optimum nutrition and help you feel more energetic every day.


Fruits and vegetables should make up half your diet.
Eat the amount of grains that corresponds to your age, sex, and level of activity. The USDA MyPlate initiative can help you find the correct amount to eat, half of which should be whole grains.Eat the amount of protein that corresponds to your age, sex, and level of activity. The USDA MyPlate initiative can also help you with protein.Dairy is also part of a balanced diet, and MyPlate can help with that as well., Eating too little, or eating too much, can effect your energy levels. Skipping meals or skimping on calories slows your metabolism, as your body is attempting to conserve energy, and may lead you to feel lethargic. On the other hand, overeating (especially refined carbohydrates and sugary snacks) can cause a spike in your blood sugar levels, which will cause a burst of energy, followed by a crash that will leave you feeling tired (and probably cranky).Try eating three meals daily or six small meals, spaced evenly throughout the day.



Avoid binge eating. You may be good at controlling portions; however, if you find yourself suddenly losing control and eating large amounts of food all at once, you are binge eating. This behavior can interrupt a healthy diet. If you find yourself binge eating, keep common items eaten during a binge out of your house. When you feel the need to binge, find distractions such as crafts, exercise, etc.
Do not skip meals. Always have a healthy snack on hand in case you are rushing around and don't have time to eat.

Avoid emotional eating. If you have the tendency to eat when you are upset, whether you are angry, happy, sad, or lonely, you are allowing these emotions to act as triggers to eating. Emotional eating contradicts a balanced diet. Instead of eating, find other activities to relieve emotional stress.

Avoid nighttime eating. Eating many more calories after dinnertime can be problematic, particularly if you tend to eat foods that are not wholesome or are high in fat. You can combat nighttime eating by getting most of your calories during the day.Make lunch a bigger meal than dinner.

, Keeping yourself hydrated by drinking water throughout the day is an important way to avoid fatigue and feel more energetic. If you are not in the habit of drinking enough water throughout the day, you run the risk of being fatigued.


If you are an adult male, about three liters per day of water intake is recommended.
If you are an adult female, just over two liters per day of water intake is recommended—2.2 liters to be exact.When you exercise you lose water through your sweat, so make sure you are replenishing by drinking more water on top of your recommended daily intake.

, There are many products that claim to give you energy when you consume them, but they do not always deliver. Even if they do give you energy, the effects are often short-lived. Many of these products may have negatives that outweigh whatever energy they might provide.


Coffee can give you a quick boost in energy, and studies now show that coffee is not as bad as was once thought.However, the caffeine in coffee is mildly addictive,and the amount of time it takes the body to metabolize it can interfere with sleep patterns, which can affect your level of energy during the day. Coffee with added sugar and cream does add extra calories and fat, so this should be considered when drinking coffee.
Energy drinks have high levels of caffeine, which, in itself, is not necessarily any worse than coffee, but energy drinks have also been linked to heart problems where excessive use is involved. The high levels of sugar in many energy drinks are empty calories and can lead to a crash later in the day., Many herbal teas and supplements are available to help people feel more energetic. Always speak with your doctor or pharmacist before taking a new supplement, especially if you are taking other medications.


Vitamin B-12 may improve your energy if you have a deficiency. If you are not getting enough vitamin B from your diet, it may be appropriate to take a supplement. Talk to your doctor about whether or not this is right for you.Siberian ginseng helps increase stamina, counteract fatigue, and reduce the effects of stress. It can be found in both teas and supplements.Ginkgo is another herb that helps with the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which helps with the brain's metabolization of glucose, in turn giving you mental energy and clarity. Ginkgo can be purchased loose in health stores for tea, but it is often in tea blends and it can also be bought as a supplement.Green tea is sold as an extract and in tea form. It contains caffeine naturally and has other health benefits—such as being an antioxidant—that can make you feel better and therefore more energetic.Peppermint essential oil is another performance-boosting supplement. Exercise performance has been studied with peppermint oil as a supplement, and the conclusions suggest that peppermint can be effective for feeling more energetic."

Do not apply heat to the area.,
Take over-the-counter pain medications.,
Talk to your doctor about medical treatment for the bite.,
Follow up with the doctor in three to four days.",How to Identify and Treat Recluse (Fiddleback) Spider Bites," If you can, try to trap the spider that bite you to determine if it is a recluse spider. You can also try to remember the appearance of the spider that bite you. A recluse spider is tan all over, with legs attached to the upper part of its body.You don't have to catch the spider. Even taking a picture of the spider with your phone can help the medical professionals to identify the spider and treat you.
This spider gets its nickname, ""fiddleback"", because of the unique violin-shaped marking on the back of the upper body part. The lower body part doesn't have any markings.
A recluse spider has three pairs of eyes across the violin-shaped marking, rather than the two rows of four eyes that most U.S. spiders have.;
, When you are first bitten, you may not feel anything. Within hours of the bite, you may feel mild burning or irritation in or around the bite wound. You may also have the following symptoms:Severe swelling and pain at the bite site.
A blister may develop that is blue in the center and ringed by redness, like a bull’s eye. The blister may then burst, and the area will enlarge into an ulcer that extends deep into the tissue.
A pimple-like lesion with yellow or green pus.
A rash around the bite site that itches.
Your urine may appear dark in color.
You may also experience fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, seizures, or joint pain.
Like other spider bites, a recluse (fiddleback) spider bite will leave a small red mark. Unlike other spider bites, soon after the bite, a small white blister will appear and the tissue around the bite will become hard. The bite will then turn into a lesion that is blue-gray or blue-white, with ragged edges surrounded by redness. If left untreated, the skin around the recluse spider bite can become gangrenous, and develop into a large open wound., Brown recluse spiders like dark, sheltered areas, like under porches, in woodpiles, basements, closets, and under sinks. Consider if you were in any of these areas when you were bitten.Though the brown recluse spider can be found all over the United States, it is commonly found in Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana and Alabama; most of Mississippi, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Tennessee and Kentucky; the southern portions of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana; northern Georgia and eastern Texas., If possible, bring the spider who bite you in to the doctor’s office.

If the person who is bitten has circulatory problems, reduce the time the compress is on the bite site.

, This will slow the spread of the venom from the bite site to the rest of your body and reduce any swelling of the bite area.Wrap a compression bandage above the bite to reduce pain and swelling. If you do not have an actual compression bandage, tying any cloth above the bite site can slow down the spread of the venom. Raise the arm, hand, leg or foot with the bite above your heart by propping it up on a pillow. Make sure the bandage is snug, but is not cutting off your circulation.

, This will only accelerate the tissue destruction around the bite and increase swelling and pain. You should also never attempt to remove the spider venom with a suction device or cut out the affected tissue.Avoid applying any steroid creams to the bite area, such as hydrocortisone cream.

, Acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen or naproxen will help reduce the swelling and pain..


You can also take an antihistamine to alleviate any itchiness around the bite area.

, At your doctor’s appointment, or in emergency care, confirm the bite is a recluse spider bite and allow the doctor to treat the bite. After the initial evaluation, your doctor may prescribe the following treatments:A Tetanus immunization shot.
Antibiotics, if there are signs of infection in the wound.
Antihistamines, such as Benadryl, to help with itchiness.
Pain medications.

There are two kinds of aftershave: aftershave splash and aftershave balm.Aftershave splash is a scented, alcohol based astringent. Aftershave balm is a hydrating lotion with a more mild scent. Experiment with a variety of aftershave brands and products to find one that soothes your razor burn.


Aftershaves with vitamin E, provitamin B5, and chamomile are especially good for razor burn.
Shea butter and birchwood are also ingredients you should look for in an aftershave product that is effective against razor burn.

, There are a variety of moisturizing lotions that can effectively get rid of razor burn fast. The best lotions for razor burn will contain glycolic acid, which encourages healing in razor-burned skin. Lotions containing alcohol, salicylic acid, or both are also useful, but could dry out your skin. If you have sensitive skin, check the ingredients label on your lotion to ensure it contains glycolic acid instead.

, Rub a thin layer of petroleum jelly across the razor-burned area. Your skin will absorb it, so you don’t need to wipe or rinse it off. After about two hours, apply another layer. Continue until your razor burn has subsided.

, Take two or three aspirin tablets and crush them in a small bowl. To crush them, you could use the flat bottom of a cup or a wide spoon. Add a few drops of water to the bowl and mix the contents with a fork to make a creamy paste. Four to five drops of water is usually sufficient, but add more if necessary. Rub the paste on the bumps and wait ten minutes. Rinse with lukewarm water. Apply this treatment twice per day until the bumps heal.


If you are pregnant, allergic to aspirin, have a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia, or have a history of intestinal bleeding, do not use aspirin. Additionally, do not use aspirin while nursing or taking blood thinners.

, Hydrocortisone is a topical medication that reduces itching, swelling, and redness of irritated skin. It can help calm itchy areas and speed up healing time.


Don’t apply hydrocortisone cream for more than three days at a time.
Avoid applying it to open cuts.

Don’t shave too often.,
Use a sharp razor.,
Use shaving cream.Wet your skin with mild soap and warm water before shaving, then apply shaving cream or shaving gel.,
Perfect your technique.,
Try not cover the razor-burned skin.",How to Get Rid of Razor Burn Fast4," Shaving too often will not allow your skin the time it needs to heal sufficiently from previous shaving sessions. Try not to shave more than once every four to five days., Razors should be disposed of after five to seven shaves. This way, you’re always using a sharp blade, and less likely to irritate the skin., Shaving cream helps you get a smoother shave and reduces the likelihood of getting razor burn.

, Shave in short strokes.Don’t apply excess pressure; the weight of the razor should be enough to help you shave with the proper pressure. Always move the blade in the direction the hair is growing. If you pull the razor in the direction the hair is not growing, you might end up pushing hair into your follicles., Allowing your razor burn to be exposed to fresh air can help you get rid of it more quickly. If you must cover the razor burn, wear only loose-fitting clothes to allow your pores to breathe.Wear cotton clothes. Synthetic clothes can irritate razor-burned skin. Wool, similarly, can exacerbate your razor burn. Cotton, on the other hand, is a more breathable material and will accelerate the razor burn healing process."

Swish and gargle cold water right away.,
Suck on ice chips.,
Eat a scoop of ice cream.,
Rinse and gargle with salt water.,
Drink a glass of cold milk.",How to Heal Mouth Burns1," Minimize mouth burns by cooling your mouth down quickly. Swish, rinse, and gargle cold water in your mouth for 5 to 10 minutes after you burn yourself., Suck on ice cubes or ice chips if you have some available. This can cool your mouth down even better than cold water. Carry a cup of ice around with you and suck on fresh ice until the stinging in your mouth subsides.If you burn your cheek or the roof of your mouth, try holding ice chips against the burn with your tongue.

, If you have some available, eat a few spoonfuls – or a bowl! – of ice cream. The cold will soothe your burn. Kids may especially enjoy this option.Eating an ice pop or scoop of cold yogurt or drinking a glass of cold milk may also help improve the pain.

, Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm (not hot!) water. Rinse your mouth and gargle with the salt water once your mouth cools down.Do not swallow the salt water.

, Down a glass of cold milk if you burn the inside of your mouth. Milk will coat and protect the mucous membranes inside. The cold liquid will also soothe and cool your burning mouth."

Exercise regularly.,
Trade inactive time for active time.,
Eat more fiber.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Quit smoking.,
Visit your doctor.,
Stay on top of personal hygiene.",How to Enjoy Life After Retirement1," Take walks. Go swimming. Work in the garden. Every little bit helps you stay active and healthy.Grab a buddy when you want to exercise. Having someone exercise with you will make you more likely to keep to an exercise routine.
Aim for half an hour of activity every day.Check your local community for classes. Many cities offer exercise programs specifically for seniors at free or reduced costs.;
, That is, instead of being on the computer, go bowling with friends. Instead of watching television, try playing a game that makes you get up and move., Fiber is essential for keeping your digestive system happy. However, it also may keep your cholesterol down, an important consideration the older you get. In addition, it can decrease your risk of developing certain types of illnesses, such as cancer and diabetes.If you're over 50, you need 21 grams (0.74 oz) of fiber daily as a woman and 30 as a man.Whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are all a great source of fiber.

, Incorporate plenty of fruits and vegetables into your diet. Trade red meats for fish. Skip sugary sodas and desserts. The better the fuel you put in your body, the happier it will be., This recommendation is important for people of any age, but it's especially important for seniors. Smoking increases your chances of heart disease and cancer, so consider taking the plunge into non-smoking as you enter retirement., When you're older, you need to visit your doctor more often to check up on your health. You should be going at least once a year but preferably more often., Make sure you are brushing and flossing twice day. Moisturize your dry skin. Make sure you're wearing sunscreen when you go out. These little preventative measures will help keep you happy and healthy as you age."

Have a snack before your workout.,
Grab a cup of coffee.,
Listen to upbeat music.,
Try higher intensity exercises.,
Go for intervals or circuit training.,
Stay hydrated during the day.,
Get enough sleep.,
Maintain a balanced diet.,
Consider changing the time of your workout.,
Slow down if you're feeling under the weather.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Schedule in one to two rest days weekly.,
Become familiar with signs of overtraining.,
Consider outside stressors.",How to Feel Less Sluggish During Your Workout," If you're in need of a little jolt of energy before your workout, consider having a snack before you head out. This can help give your body energy to begin and finish your workout.Having a pre-workout snack is essential if you need that boost of energy or are planning on being active for over 45 minutes at a time.
In addition, this snack needs to be primarily simple carbohydrates. These break down quickly in your body and turn to usable energy quickly. Mix these with a protein or more complex carbs to keep the fuel supply available longer.
Try: smoothie with greek yogurt and fruit, a slice of whole grain toast with jam, a small bowl of oatmeal with fruit, a small yogurt with fruit, or an apple with peanut butter.
Plan to have 100–200 calories before you work out. This will give you the energy that you need to have a strong workout.;
, A little jolt of caffeine is great to get your morning started or push you through an afternoon slump at work. Drinking a quick cup of joe may also give you a little boost of energy to start your workout.


The caffeine in coffee (and even in tea) is a stimulant. It can help give you energy, make you more alert and improve concentration.
People who drink coffee often have better circulation in the short-term. This helps your body circulate nutrients and oxygen more efficiently during exercise.
Consider drinking a small cup of coffee before your exercise routine; however, the rest of the day should still be made up of mostly water in order to keep your body hydrated.
Roughly 400 mg is the limit on the amount of caffeine that an adult should consume in a day. This is approximately four cups of brewed coffee.

, Listening to music doesn't just help pass the time as you chug away on the treadmill or elliptical. Listening to music, especially upbeat and motivational tunes, can help you feel a little more energized during your workout sessions.


Many studies have been done on exercise and music. They have shown that those who listen to music needed less oxygen during exercise and were able to exercise longer compared to those who weren't listening to music.In order to get music to improve your energy level, you need to be choosy about what you're listening to. Classical music probably won't stimulate your energy. Find tunes that match your pace or rhythm.
Listen to a radio station, download music on your smartphone or consider using a music/fitness app. This can help you stay in tune with music and keep you going during your workout.

, Another exercise option you can do to increase your energy level is doing high-intensity exercises. These heart pumping exercises can help wake you up quickly.


High-intensity exercises are those that require close to maximal level of effort.Regardless of how sluggish you were feeling prior to your exercise routine, the sharp increase in intensity or activity level can help wake you up.
The other benefit of high-intensity exercises is that you do not have to do them as long as more moderate-intensity exercises. In fact, you can cut your workout time in half if you are doing higher-intensity exercises.This is a great idea if you're feeling tired or don't have a lot of energy while you're exercising.
Jogging, running, jumping rope, swimming laps, playing sports or hiking up hill are all examples of more intense activities.

, If you're feeling a little mentally sluggish during your exercise, try including more intervals or circuit training. This constant change in your exercise can help keep you more mentally alert.


Interval and circuit training are a type of exercise that alternates between a few different activities. It's a perfect way to beat boredom and to pep you up during your normal exercise time.If you're feeling sluggish, try doing a quick interval or circuit training routine. Alternate between high and moderate intensity aerobics and fit in some strength training.

, Drinking adequate fluids is essential to staying alert and energized before and during your workout. Drink enough both during the day and during your workout to prevent sluggishness.If you're not adequately hydrated during the day, especially right before your normal exercise routine, it's normal to feel tired and sluggish. Signs of dehydration include fatigue, dark colored urine, thirst, and headaches.
If you're dehydrated, your body may feel weak and tired. In addition, you might find it hard to complete your workout.
Most health professionals recommend consuming at least eight 8-ounce (236-ml) glasses of water daily; however, depending on your age, gender and activity level, you may need more than 10 glasses daily., Sleep and exercise have a unique relationship. Without adequate sleep, you'll feel more fatigued during your workouts; however, if you don't work out regularly, you may have poorer quality sleep.If you're not getting adequate sleep, your body doesn't have time to refuel and recover. Over time, this could lead to fatigue and sluggishness in your workouts.
In addition, it's during rest that your body develops the most gains. You'll see better improvements in muscle mass and endurance with proper rest.It's recommended that most adults get about seven to nine hours of sleep each night. If you're not currently meeting this guideline, it's time to go to bed earlier or wake up later.
Try and practice good sleep hygiene. This means getting up and going to bed at the same time each night and making the bedroom a restful peaceful place.

, Your diet also plays a huge role in whether or not you're feeling sluggish during your workout routine. Following a well-balanced and nutritious diet will help fuel you through your workouts.A well-balanced diet includes foods from every food group each day. In addition, it includes a large variety of foods from within each food group during the week.When your diet is unbalanced (like if you're following a low-carb diet) or have a poor diet in general, your body and energy levels will suffer. It's difficult for your body to push through a workout when it's lacking in one or more nutrients.
If you've been feeling sluggish during your workout, think back to how you've been eating lately. Are you getting in enough fruits, vegetables, protein and whole grains? If not, make sure to clean up your diet and you'll see improved energy levels.
If you are trying to lose weight and exercise you should not go below 1,200 calories a day without being under the supervision of a doctor., Most people either work out early in the morning or hit the gym after work. If you're not feeling energized for your workouts, consider changing the time of day you're exercising.


Studies have shown that a variety of factors affect your energy levels during exercise. Body temperature and circadian rhythm play a big role in when your body is feeling energized and when it's more sleepy and sluggish.Body temperature is higher in the afternoon after your body has warmed up. Studies have shown that with a warmer body temperature, your performance improves.
However, some people experience more energy in the morning due to their circadian rhythm and sleep cycle.
If you're a morning person, but are feeling sleepy, try waiting until the afternoon to do your workout. If you're an after work exerciser, switch to the mornings to see if that works better.
Experts say the morning is the best time to exercise, but you should follow you body clock to see what is the best time for you., The occasional cold, runny nose or cough can cause you to feel more tired and sluggish during your workout. Play it safe and listen to your body to decide whether or not you should push through your workouts when you're sick.


Most health professionals say that light to moderate exercise is OK for your average cold or runny nose. In fact, studies have shown that exercise can help open up nasal passageways and decrease nasal congestion.However, if you have a more serious cold or the flu, you need to stay home and probably stay in bed until you're feeling better. In addition, its not recommended to exercise if you have symptoms ""below the head"" like a cough, chest congestion or an upset stomach.
Exercise requires your body to exert energy. This is energy being diverted away from healing your body and recovering from whatever illness you have.

, If you continuously feel sluggish regardless of what changes you've made to your diet or lifestyle, consider talking to your doctor. Chronic fatigue and lack of energy isn't considered normal.


Talk to your doctor about any medications or supplements that you're currently taking. Many prescription medications and other supplements make you feel more groggy, sleepy, fatigued or sluggish.
There are some medications available that will stimulate your metabolism and increase your energy and weight loss but you need to be evaluated by a doctor to see if you are a candidate.
Also consider getting bloodwork done. For example, if you've had issues with anemia, you will feel sluggish and fatigued consistently. You'll need to get bloodwork done to confirm any issues and to begin treatment.
Thyroid issues may also be the cause of your fatigue and sluggishness. Bring this up with your physician as well.

, Your body will let you know when its time for a break. So if you're feeling sluggish lately at the gym or during your workout, it might be time for a rest day.


Most health and fitness professionals recommend that you include one or two rest days each week. You can still include a large amount of training during the other days, but allow your body time to rest adequately.
If you notice you're a little more sluggish, think back over the last week or two. Have you been hitting the gym hard? Have you been overly active everyday? Has there been one day where you've relaxed?
If you think it's time for a rest day, take a day off. Avoid the gym, don't go for a run and skip your spin class. You should, however, try to keep your body moving, even on rest days. Try a leisurely walk, gardening, tai chi, or a restorative yoga class, which can provide the same benefits as sleeping.

, If you don't allow your body adequate rest, you can cause more damage than good.Schedule in rest days to avoid injuries and other issues. Look out for signs of overtraining like:


Increased resting heart rate
Increased and nagging muscle soreness
Moodiness and depression
Increased sickness and colds
Loss of concentration
Constant fatigue and sluggishness

, In addition to making sure you're eating well and drinking enough fluids, there are some outside stressors that can make you feel more sluggish during your workouts.


If you have a significant amount of stress going on in your life, you may want to use exercise to help you relax and let off steam; however, chronic stress can make you feel more tired and sleepy — even during those stress-busting workouts.For women, during menstruation, you may notice increased fatigue as well. This is normal as your body goes through changes during this time of the month."

Eat soft, cool foods for a week.,
Keep your foods bland until your burn heals.,
Use a licorice mixture.,
Consume honey.,
Stop using tobacco.,
Avoid alcohol while your burn heals.,
Brush your teeth twice a day.,
See a doctor if your burn doesn’t improve in a few days.,
Seek medical care if you get a fever or can’t swallow.",How to Heal Mouth Burns2," Left alone, your mouth should heal itself in a few days to about a week.Avoid further injury during that time. Don’t eat foods that have sharp edges, like potato chips or crispy apple slices, or are hard like hard cookies. Allow hot foods and beverages to cool to a warm temperature before you enjoy them.

, Enjoy mildly seasoned foods, but stay away from spicy foods and foods flavored with citrus. These can irritate the sensitive skin in your mouth while your burn is healing., This is a home remedy that may help. Add 10 grams (0.35 oz) of dried licorice root to 100 milliliters of cold water (about 4/10 of a cup). Boil the mixture and let it sit to infuse for 15 minutes. Let it cool, then strain it. Use this as a mouthwash and gargle with it as often as you like while your burn heals. Licorice can help heal inflammation and sores, and can fight off some bacteria.Add honey to the mixture while it’s still warm to sweeten it.
Alternately, try sucking on licorice tablets.

, Eat a spoonful of honey a couple of times a day to help soothe pain and promote healing. If your burn is on your cheek or the roof of your mouth, try to press the honey to the hurt area with your tongue.Let the honey dissolve in your mouth.

, Quit smoking – at least while your burn heals.Smoking cigarettes and using other nicotine products can slow healing time or even make the burn worse. Ideally, stop smoking altogether.

, Help speed up healing – stay away from alcoholic beverages. If you can’t stop, minimize how much alcohol you drink while your burn is healing.Talk to your doctor if you feel like you can’t stop drinking alcohol.

, Maintain good oral hygiene while your burn heals.This promotes healing and helps you avoid infections. Brush your teeth twice a day as usual, in the morning and before bed. Go slowly and be careful not to scrape your burn.


If you simply can’t use a toothbrush due to pain, put the toothpaste on your finger and use your finger for a toothbrush at least for a day or so until you can tolerate the brush.

, After a few days, your mouth burn should feel better. If it hasn’t improved by that time, see your doctor. You may need medicine to help with pain and prevent infection., Mouth burns rarely cause serious health problems, but serious burns can get infected. See your doctor if you burn your mouth and then start to experience any of the following symptoms:Fever (a temperature of 100.4°F/38°C or higher)
Drooling
Difficulty swallowing
Severe mouth pain

Take over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Apply a pain-relieving paste or gel.,
See your doctor for prescription medication.",How to Heal Mouth Burns3," Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) as directed on the bottle for some pain relief. Ibuprofen (Advil) will also help, but don’t take it without talking to your doctor first if you have kidney or liver problems.


Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about taking OTC medicine if you have any health conditions or medication allergies.
Aspirin is appropriate for adults, but never give aspirin to children under age 12., Check your local drug store or pharmacy for an oral pain-relieving product like Orabase or Orajel. These are over-the-counter ointments and do not require a prescription. They contain benzocaine, a numbing product that you can use in your mouth for painful sores or burns. Apply it as directed on the label or by your pharmacist.Do not use this product on children under 2 years old.
Before using it, ask your physician if you have any medical conditions or blood disorders that would be a risk.

, If your pain is severe or doesn’t improve with at-home remedies, ask your doctor about topical pain medications. Some medicine used for canker sore pain might be appropriately for painful burns. However, some doctors won’t prescribe a numbing agent because a patient might eat and do more damage to their mouth without realizing it."

One proven way to grow new neurons is to learn. The existing axons, dendrites, and synapses, need to be maintained so don’t get lazy. Continue to perform the things you already do, including sports, reading, puzzles, exercise, crafts, or music.
The key to growing new neurons is to teach yourself something different, maybe even something that feels awkward at first.
Neuroplasticity of the brain, or the ability to grow new brain cells, happens if you take charge and expose your brain to something different.;
, Learn to juggle, dance, play a musical instrument, or anything that is new to you.


Even doing familiar things in a different way can help. For example, navigate your way through your home, safely, while walking backwards.
Try anything you can think of that creates a challenge for your brain, but it must be something that requires you to think.

, Neurobics are exercises designed to stimulate new growth in the brain. The primary basis of neurobics involves using the senses to stimulate new brain pathways.Think of ways to challenge your brain by altering your sensory perceptions. Some basic examples follow:Get dressed in the morning with your eyes shut or a blind-fold on.Wear headphones that suppress sound while trying to verbally communicate with a friend. Include speaking and trying to understand what they are saying by mouth movements and hand gestures.If you play the piano, try playing a simple and familiar piece with your eyes shut, or with two fingers taped together.Try playing a simple piece using all fingers, but play the bass clef using your right hand and above middle C, and the treble clef with your left hand and below middle C.Use your non-dominant hand for routine activities. Try brushing your teeth, combing your hair, and using a computer mouse using your non-dominant hand.Write with your non-dominant hand.Try writing several sentences from memory, perhaps the first verse of a familiar poem or song, making the letters upside down, as a mirror image, or from right to left on the page.Try playing your favorite sport using your non-dominant hand.Break your routines. Put your shoes on in the opposite order. Mow the yard in the opposite direction. Think of other frequent routines and alter their order.Go for an early morning walk simply to identify smells around you.Try to identify the ingredients in a meal just from taste and smell., A recent study used only strategy-based brain training, without introducing any elements of physical exercise, to improve blood flow in the brain. The results showed that whole brain blood flow was significantly increased by using only brain-training exercises The point of the study was to increase whole brain blood flow using only mental exercises.When blood flow to the brain slows down, atrophy of brain tissues results. Atrophy in the brain means that cells degenerate, important communicate pathways degrade, and the brain tissue and important structures shrink away.The study enrolled people of all ages that had suffered a traumatic brain injury, with about 65% of the enrollees having suffered the brain injury at least 10 years prior.Part of the group was exposed to strategy-based brain training, and the others were exposed to general teaching materials, for the same amount of time, about how the brain works.The group that received the strategy-based training improved abstract thinking scores by more than 20%, memory function measures improved by 30%, and the whole brain blood flow showed a significant increase as compared to the control group.Many of the group participants also suffered from symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Depressive symptoms were improved in the strategy-based training group by 60% and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms improved by almost 40%.Strategy-based brain training really works to increase whole brain blood flow and can help to prevent brain shrinkage., This form of brain training is common and can be found all around you, including in your daily newspaper.Strategy brain games are any games that you have to think about to solve. Do a crossword puzzle, a word-scramble puzzle, complete a Sudoku puzzle, or put together an actual table-top puzzle. Puzzle games that are not left to chance, that require you to think about them to solve them, are considered strategy-based brain games.Play with another person. Games like chess, Go, or even checkers, involve thinking about your moves, and anticipating the moves of the person you are playing against., Make a list of something you commonly do, like a grocery list or things to do that day, and memorize the list.A few hours after you have completed the list, or even the next day, try to remember everything on it., Start simple and systematically.As you get more comfortable with the easier problems, work your way into harder math. Make it even more interesting by taking a walk while you do the calculations in your head., Visualize a word, then create a way to challenge yourself using that word.One way is to think of other words that start and end with the same letters, or think of words that have more syllables than the first one but still rhyme., The musical experience is a valuable one. Do something musical that you are not accustomed to doing.If you already play an instrument, learn to play a different one.Join a singing group. Even if you cannot sing well, joining a choir or vocal group will significantly expand your brain function on several levels.You will learn to understand organization of the music on the pages you will be singing, timing and rhythm, and organized singing. Plus, you will be exposed socially to a new group of people which provides a wonderful opportunity to expand your brain even further as you learn about music., Try a cooking class, auto mechanics, wood-working, sewing, or crafting.Taking a class in something that you do not know how to do, but are interested in learning, helps to develop new pathways in your brain.
This happens both by learning the new material and interacting with new people in a new environment., This is a very good way to improve cognitive function and thinking ability.New languages also help to expand your vocabulary which is associated with higher cognitive functioning. Plus, hearing and speaking a new language develops new pathways in your brain., Try a sport that is new to you, and consider one that involves at least one other player.Golf is a sport that you can basically play alone, but it is more challenging when you play with someone. This creates additional experiences for your brain to organize and react to, and therefore the growth of new brain cells and pathways result., The more conversations you have, the more your brain has to work in order to compensate and process the new information.If you have children, have conversations with them. The more conversations you have with your child, the smarter they will be., Having conversations on topics with people that have very different opinions challenges your brain, and your executive function abilities, to determine how you respond to the same topic but in different groups.The more diverse your friends are, the more your brain is challenged to become creative both in conversation and in participation of different types of social interactions., More and more research points to physical exercise as the most effective way to improve thinking skills and overall brain function.Create an exercise routine that includes one hour sessions, three times a week, and basic exercises like walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike.Stay with your exercise routine for at least 12 weeks in order to improve your brain fitness, cognitive abilities, and thinking skills.A recent study done in sedentary people, aged 57 to 75 years of age, supports this level of exercise with scientific data.The exercise group showed rapid improvement in circulating blood flow to areas of the brain, significant improvement in both immediate and delayed areas of memory function, improved cognitive abilities, frontal lobe functioning, visuospatial skills, processing speed, and overall improved cognition. Cardiovascular measures included as part of the study design were also notably improved.The authors interpret the study results as further indication that any person, at any age, can take steps through the use of physical exercise to positively influences brain neuroplasticity., Recall of vocabulary words was significantly improved when exercise was included just before, during, or immediately after, exposure to the vocabulary words.


Two different studies, one in female college students, and one in male college students, validated much improved recall of vocabulary words studied when associated with exercise.
The female students did the best when they were exposed to their vocabulary words for 30 minutes while they were also exercising. The form of exercise in this study was riding a stationary bicycle for 30 minutes.The male students were divided into groups that included no exercise, moderate exercise, or vigorous exercise. The improvement was noted in the students that were exposed to their vocabulary words either immediately prior, or immediately after, vigorous exercise., Cognitive function and memory recall is improved when a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, is elevated.Exercise increases you levels of BDNF.Your BDNF levels fall back to normal ranges approximately 30 minutes after stopping your exercise routine so take advantage of that time. Tackle a difficult project from work or study for an exam as soon as you can following your exercise routine., Structures within our brain perform different functions and communicate through complex networks to keep our thinking skills sharp and memory function stable, help make critical decisions, strategize ways to solve problems, process and organize incoming information, keep our emotions in check, and control how we respond to countless situations.When structures in the brain lose volume, or start to shrink, our brain function declines along with the parts of the brain that are shrinking. Exercise helps to prevent shrinkage.The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, structures in the brain that support memory function and higher-level cognitive functions, begin to shrink at a rate of about 1% to 2% each year for people over the age of 55 years.Research done in 2010 showed the first documented evidence that exercising early in life helps to prevent shrinkage in the brain in later years, reducing the risk of cognitive decline., The scientific community is still working to determine the best exercises to do, and how long to do them, in order to provide the greatest improvement in brain function. While that question remains unanswered, some things have become clear.Stretching and muscle tone exercises do very little to nothing to improve brain function.Whatever you do, it needs to be something that requires active participation.Walking on a treadmill and riding a stationary bicycle count as actively participating.This type of aerobic exercise helps not only to maintain brain abilities but can actually help to recover abilities that may be fading away. Even when the aging process, medical conditions, and even brain injury, are working against you, exercising is your proven way to fight back.So get up and move. Walk using a treadmill or a calculated and safe path, ride a stationary bicycle or a regular one if safety permits, and possibly even participate in competitive sports like tennis.Competitive and active sports, such as tennis, may provide even greater benefit since other areas of the brain are engaged. The additional parts of brain exposure involve socializing, problem-solving, visuospatial reaction, anticipation, and reaction times., Cognitive flexibility allows us to think about more than one thing at the same time, to rapidly switch your activity and your thoughts from one topic to another, and to quickly adapt to changing situations.Active and persistent exercise, specifically running, has been associated with significant improvements in cognitive flexibility., Your frontal lobe is the largest of the four lobes and is the area responsible for higher level cognitive function.The frontal lobe is the center of your executive function and also integrates communication throughout the rest of your brain in order to carry out your executive function decisions.
Executive function abilities are needed for organizing the information that is coming into the brain and to regulate how your respond.
Examples include time management, attention processes, multi-tasking and switching focus, being detail oriented when needed, controlling what you say and do, and making decisions based on you own prior experiences.

, Both physical play as exercise and gentle play with a child, friend, or family member helps to strengthen the frontal cortex and the processes involved with executive function.Physical play helps to sharpen your executive function skills as you anticipate and react to constantly changing situations., Imaginative play helps to strengthen executive function ability as your brain works to strategize your reaction to the unknown circumstances and situations you are creating in your mind.Think of positive scenarios and develop them into stories, or chapters within a story.Find images in the clouds, imagine a conversation between ducks and fish, create a painting in your head of your favorite song, or do anything that engages your imagination. Using your imagination stimulates your brain to release chemicals that are rewarding and engaging. Firing brain neurons along axons, dendrites, and synapses, that are seldom used is key in growing new ones., While it is important to address situations that are difficult, try to avoid allowing the negativity to persuade the way you think and feel.Some people and situations can be very dramatic. Keep a positive and problem-solving attitude when faced with negative circumstances., Forms of physical contact, such as giving and receiving hugs, and other physical gestures of support and friendship, provide a calming effect on the brain.Positive social interactions are healthy and can help to develop new pathways in your brain when you are in an unfamiliar, yet positive, situation. Social interaction is important to creating new brain pathways.Your brain is constantly learning and utilizing executive function skills as you interact with other people, formulate your response to situations, and consider possible reactions of the other person and react accordingly., Music has been clearly shown to cause changes, both positive and negative, in the frontal lobe of the brain.Exposure to music has been proven as an aid to improve your IQ and enhance the ability to learn. Reading and literacy skills improve, spatial-temporal reasoning is enhanced, and mathematical abilities are improved.Some styles of music has been tied to bad outcomes, including unhealthy lifestyle choices, criminal activity, and even suicidal behavior.Other styles of music are linked to early development of visuospatial abilities, better math performance, improved ability to learn a foreign language, and an overall healthy lifestyle., The study used three groups of mice exposed to different music styles.The group exposed to rock music, including disharmonic beats, behaved in a disorganized, confused, and lost manner. That group forgot their way to food in a maze they had already located.Two other groups, one exposed to only classical music and one to no music at all were able to find their way through the maze to the food, actually performing even faster.With further study, the scientists found frontal lobe shrinkage and hippocampal damage in the group exposed to the rock music with disharmonic beats.While several studies suggest that rock music, or possibly the binaural beats within rock music, has a negative influence, other research supports music of choice, including rock music, as a good way to engage your brain and develop additional neuronal pathways.

, Improving your critical thinking skills is a commitment to yourself. This is a process that takes time.Critical thinking is a method of analyzing, evaluating, and making decisions. Most people take thinking for granted and overlook the need to evaluate thinking habits and develop new and positive ways to critically evaluate and react to daily circumstances.Realize that it takes both time to evaluate, change, and develop critical thinking skills, and practice to arrive at the level you want. Just as a professional athlete or musician continues to sharpen their talents and abilities, you can work to sharpen your thinking skills.Improving your critical thinking ability requires approaching information and decision making by avoiding prejudice, over-generalization, common fallacies or pre-determined beliefs, deception, and rigidity and narrowness in your thinking.Doing things that are concrete helps to bring your thinking processes to light, and helps you to make changes that improve your critical thinking. Any one step can be helpful, but actively and routinely practicing changes over time improves your thinking ability.

, Avoid flipping through channels, getting frustrated while sitting in traffic, worrying unproductively, and jumping from one activity or diversion to another without enjoying anything.Use that valuable time to ask yourself questions that can improve your approach to the next day. Ask questions that help you evaluate what you did well that day, or not so well. Consider your strengths and weaknesses of the day so far.If possible, record your answers so you can develop your thoughts in those areas even further., Set aside problems that are out of your control, and focus on the tools you need and the steps to take to solve problems within your control.Avoid becoming overwhelmed or emotional and work through the problem in an organized, logical, and thoughtful manner.Consider factors like short-term solutions as opposed to long-term solutions, the advantages and disadvantages of the solutions you are considering, and develop a workable strategy to solve the problem., Accepted intellectual standards include clarity of thought, precision, accuracy, relevance, depth, breadth, logical factors, and significance.For example, during the week you focus on clarity you may want to think about how clearly you communicated something during a meeting or in a conversation with your spouse or a friend. Think about ways you might have improved on your clarity.Also consider how clear others have communicated information to you, or to a group.Clarity in writing is just as important. Evaluate your own written communications, those of others, and in published literature., Follow a pattern to your journaling, and make several entries each week.Write about situations in which you were involved, how you responded, your analysis of things apparent and hidden in the situation, and an assessment of what you learned about yourself in the process., Focus on one intellectual trait each month, including perseverance, autonomy, empathy, courage, humility, and any other traits you may admire in others but find lacking in yourself.Think about each trait and develop a strategy to improve that trait in yourself. Possibly include your progress in your journal.Keep your focus on your selected trait throughout the month. Continually evaluate your performance noting improvement, setbacks, and additional work needed., Placing bias on yourself is a natural way of thinking.Ask yourself questions to help identify situations where you may have placed too much emphasis on your own opinion. Include questions that help you evaluate any actions you may have taken based on irritability over unimportant or small things, saying or doing things irrationally to push things your way, or situations where you imposed your own will or opinion on others.Once you recognize your egocentric reactions, take steps to modify your thinking to correct those behaviors., Practice seeing the good in difficult or negative situations.Every situation has the potential to be positive or negative. Seeing the positive in a situation leads one to feel more rewarded, less frustrated, and overall happier. Take the opportunity to turn mistakes into opportunities, and dead-ends into beginnings., Evaluate situations or thoughts that cause you to feel angry, sad, frustrated, or upset.Take the opportunity to explore what is causing your negative emotion and find a way to turn that into a positive reaction., Groups have a way of suggesting certain beliefs or behaviors that are “better” than others.Analyze the groups in your own life that influence your decisions and your actions. Consider pressures placed on you by the group and evaluate those pressures as being positive or negative. Consider how you can adjust your own reaction to negative pressures without damaging relationships or altering the group dynamic., Practice your thinking skills and develop your critical thinking ability.Develop and implement strategies that use your personal experiences in order to further influence and develop your critical thinking skills., A recent article evaluated the diet in 550 seniors. The study authors were only looking for evidence of a link between diet and brain function.


The researchers found more than what they were looking for. The study revealed that eating a healthy diet actually improves executive functioning in the frontal lobe.
The results also strongly suggest that eating a healthy diet can shield the brain against aging processes that lead to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
Study participants that had the best scores also were more interested in physical activity and in avoiding habits like smoking.

, While cholesterol levels have not been directly tied to brain function, people with lower cholesterol levels have stable blood flow which allows the oxygen in the blood to be effectively carried to the brain for optimal function.


Talk to your doctor about your cholesterol levels. There may be ways to effectively address any levels that are not within the normal range. Interventions recommended by your doctor can include both prescription medications as well as non-medication options.
Some study participants showed results as high as 66% reduction in the odds of developing poor executive function based solely on healthy levels of saturated fat intake which contributes to lower cholesterol levels.

, Beyond the brain function values, researchers concluded that maintaining a healthy diet can prevent conditions that lead to slower thinking, cognitive decline, and lower executive functioning abilities.


Some medical conditions known to contribute to an overall decline in brain function include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, vascular disease, and obesity.

, According to information provided by the National Institute of Health’s Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, many products are claiming benefits that do not exist.Scientific evaluations of supplements that claim benefit in improving brain function, preventing memory loss, improving memory function, treating dementia, or slowing Alzheimer’s disease, reveal those claims to be unsubstantiated.To date, there is no evidence to support the claims of efficacy that any dietary or herbal supplement can prevent decline in functioning or improve problems in memory function. This includes products such as ginkgo, omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil, vitamins B and E, Asian ginseng, grape seed extract, and curcumin.While there is no evidence to support any claims of efficacy of these products, scientists are continuing to study some of these agents to determine if there is any possible benefit.Research involving mindfulness techniques and music therapy is ongoing, with preliminary results showing some promise in these areas., Do not delay in seeing your doctor while you attempt to try other approaches.While some approaches may be helpful to your condition, your physician can provide a tremendous amount of information that may direct your care in a manner that has proven results.Many complementary approaches that include herbal medicines and some vitamin products can seriously interact with prescription strength medications.Talk to your doctor before you try any products to treat symptoms of decline in cognitive abilities or evidence of memory loss."

Look for senior perks.,
Downsize your living.,
Live in a No-Tax State.,
Take small side jobs.,
Sell what you don't want.,
Cash in rewards.,
Apply for Medicare.,
Consider your bills.",How to Enjoy Life After Retirement2," Many restaurants and businesses offer discounts for people over 65. Some even offer this benefit for people as young as 55. Don't be afraid to ask about discounts because not every place advertises it.Also, consider joining AARP, which provides even more discounts for seniors at various businesses., After you retire, you may realize you don't have enough income to meet the demands of what you want to do. If so, you might consider downsizing to a smaller house. Even if your house is already paid off, you can use the profit to invest, allowing you to have more income in your later years.You may also consider moving to an apartment. That way, you can invest all the profits from your house, and you have a place to live where you don't have to provide upkeep., While it may seem odd to move to a new state at this point in your life, you'll find that certain states do not tax pensions and social security. For instance, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Nevada are just a few states with this benefit., Maybe you just want a little extra cash for the occasional dinner out. If that's true, think about taking small side jobs. For instance, you could offer tutoring services to local high school students. You could also put your expertise to work by still consulting in your professional field. Another option is pet sitting or house sitting. All of these side jobs will give you the extra cash you need to help you enjoy retirement., While it's a nice gesture to donate items to local charities, you can also sell items you don't want in your local classifieds or online. You can make some extra cash and de-clutter your home at the same time., That is, many grocery stores have reward programs, such as offering a discount on gas or personalized coupons if you join their reward programs. Your credit card may have a reward program, as well. Make sure you take advantage of all the rewards you come across because they do add up to extra cash., Medicare will cover many of your medical expenses in retirement, though not all. To cover more, you may need to get a supplemental plan, which can be cheaper overall.Most people get at least Medicare Part A and B. These two plans cover hospital visits and doctors' visits with a copay. Some people also get Part C, which is a supplemental plan that covers parts of what A and B don't. A Part D plan, also supplemental, can help cover your medication expenses.Part A is free in most cases (if you paid into to Medicare for at least 40 years), while the premium for Part B is based on your income. Parts C and D usually cost money as supplemental plans., Take a hard look at your monthly bills, and cut anything that you do not use often or that is not essential. For instance, you may decide that getting a newspaper everyday isn't important because you can get most of your news online. Alternatively, maybe you'll decide you can do without cable and get your entertainment cheaper through online streaming services."

Take some time to travel.,
Volunteer your time.,
Visit your local library.,
Pick three to four hobbies.,
Find a local group with similar hobbies.,
Keep up with old friends.",How to Enjoy Life After Retirement3," If you've always loved adventure, retirement is a great time to travel. You now have all the time you need to visit the places you always wanted to see. Plus, seeing the world will keep you engaged and interested in the worldUnfortunately, as a retiree, money may be a problem for you. If it is, try traveling on a budget. For instance, some websites allow you to do travel exchanges; you allow someone to stay in your home for the opportunity to stay in someone else's home in another location.Similarly, think about other cheaper places to stay, such as hostels and even dorm rooms. Some hostels limit their guests to young people, but others accept people of all ages and even offer semi-private rooms. Also, some universities offer dorm rooms up for people to stay in for cheaper than a hotel.
Another option is to explore places close to home. Most people don't take the time to see the attractions within an hour or two of their homes, so take day jaunts to nearby places.

, You are a skilled individual who has extensive experience--put that experience to use. If you have accounting skills, small nonprofits would love your help. If you are a writer, maybe you can assist with newsletters for the library. Your skills would be much appreciated, and it keeps you involved in the community and seeing people., Your library is a well of information. It offers free resources to help you pursue your interests, from books on guitar playing to computers. Most libraries also have free programs that you can attend and enjoy., While that number seems arbitrary, it's not. With just one or two hobbies, your schedule won't be very busy. However, having more hobbies will create a busier schedule and make you happier overall.Think about what you've always wanted to do. Maybe learn the violin, or take a dance class. You could also learn how to play chess or take up gardening.

, For instance, if you love to knit, find a local knitting club to join. If you enjoy soccer, find a local group in your age range. Check with your local library or the parks and recreation department to find groups. You can also use websites such as Meetup., Whether it's work friends or just neighbors or church friends, make it a point to have social engagements with your friends. Try to schedule an evening or afternoon out at least once a week."

Be observant of your surroundings and senses.,
Eat mindfully.,
Pause between activities.,
Listen.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Engage in activities that can increase mindfulness.",How to Be More Mentally Aware1," If you want to be more mentally aware, the first step is becoming more observant of your surroundings. In your day-to-day activities, try to take stock of the environment, your senses, and your breathing.


Walk with purpose. Do not zone out when walking to the bus stop or to work or school. Pay attention to the movement of your body. Take in the scenery. What does your world look like? Smell like? Feel like? Watch the movement of those around you. Be aware of your feet connecting with the ground, your lungs taking in the air, the sense of your clothing against your body.Paying attention to your own breathing can help increase your overall awareness. If you find yourself getting caught up in worry and zoning out of the moment, pause to think of your breaths. Distracting thoughts can be quelled by tuning into breathing as it's a natural and rhythmic bodily process.Pay attention to all your senses. What does morning coffee smell like? Taste like? How does it feel against your tongue? How do you feel about starting off another day? As you drive to work, take stock of the sensation of the steering wheel against your hands, any songs on the radio, what the air smells like through your car's window. Try to stay in the current moment as much as possible by paying attention to your senses.;
, For many, eating is an activity done in front of the TV or computer. This means you lose track of the sensation and taste of food. This can lead to overeating as well as eating itself becoming less pleasurable. Try to be mindful when you eat.


Do not attempt to engage in other activities when you eat. When you eat, eat and do not do anything else. Have regular meals at the table, away from the television.It can also be helpful to eat slowly and pay attention to this bite. This will make food more satisfying to you and make you less likely to crave additional snacks or nourishment later on., People often rush between day-to-day activities needlessly. This decreases mental awareness and can contribute to feelings of stress. Try to pause between activities. Let the phone ring a few times before it picks up. Take in the sound and think of who might be calling you and why. Feel the door handle for a moment before entering your home. Take short, mini-pauses to feel, observe, and consider the present moment throughout your day., Oftentimes, people get busy and do not listen as mindfully as they should. You end up planning activities in your head while listening, considering how you're going to respond, or making judgment's on the speaker's character. Instead of doing this, listen as fully as possible. Try to focus only on understanding the words the speaker is saying. Trust that, when it's your turn to speak, you'll be able to think of an appropriate response., Paying attention the present moment, as well as your own thoughts and feelings, is referred to as mindfulness. Practicing mindfulness throughout your daily activities can help increase your overall mental awareness.


The first step to mindfulness is simply, as has been discussed above, being aware of the present moment. However, you should also strive to be aware of your own thoughts. Many people find it helpful to have a set time period each day to simply observe your own thoughts. Allow your mind to wander and any worries, concerns, or interests to creep in uninterrupted. Do not try to judge or control your thoughts. Simply be aware of what you're thinking.It can sometimes be helpful to silently name thoughts as they come in. This can help you address negative thoughts without engaging in them or trying to talk yourself out of them. Simply think to yourself ""Here is my worry that I'm not as successful as I should be"" or ""Here is my concern that my friends don't really like me."", Certain activities can increase mental awareness and mindfulness. Look for classes in your area that teach such practices. You can also practice some activities at home on your own.


Meditation is the process of sitting silently and tuning into your own body and sensations.Many people find guided tutorials online or in books that help them practice meditation. You can also take meditation classes.
Yoga is an exercise routine where you move through a series of postures designed to stretch and flex the body. Not only does yoga have benefits for your physical health, it places emphasis on awareness of the present moment.You can take classes at a local yoga studio or find guided yoga routines online.
Tai chi is somewhat similar to yoga in that participants are guided through a series of slow movements. You will be asked to pay attention to your body and breathing.Like yoga, you can practice tai chi at home with guided routines or take classes at a local studio.

Give your body more protein.,
Choose slow-burning starches.,
Select good sources of fats.,
Eat more raw fruits and vegetables.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Avoid sugar.",How to Boost Energy Levels1," Even if you're eating enough food every day, it's possible you're not eating the right kinds of food. Dietary deficiencies are one of the most common causes of low energy levels, and protein in particular plays a big part in your daily energy levels.Protein is essential for increased energy levels.But not all protein is good protein. Some meats, for example, are high in protein but also come with high sodium or saturated fat levels.Medical professionals recommend that adults consume at least eight grams of protein for every 20 pounds of body weight (or 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight) every day.Optimal sources of heart-healthy protein include salmon,eggs,and legumes like beans, lentils, and tofu.;
, Starches and carbohydrates are an essential part of a healthy diet. They provide us with energy to complete all manner of activities, from running to breathing.But there are good carbs and bad carbs, and if you're feeling fatigued it's important to choose healthy carbohydrates that will help fuel your body throughout the day.Eat four to eleven servings of grains each day, and opt for whole grain foods instead of processed or refined grains.Whole grain or wholemeal sources of starch and carbohydrates release energy gradually throughout the day, helping you feel more energetic. Choose whole grain, complex carbohydrates rather than simple carbs, which can cause an energy crash shortly after eating.Some sources of energy-boosting, complex carbohydrates include vegetables, legumes, and whole grains like bran and germ.Choose breads and pastas made from whole grain whenever possible., Fats act as a source of energy as your body begins to run low on carbohydrates. Your body needs some dietary sources of fat, but it's important to choose the right kinds of fat.


The four basic forms of fats are monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, saturated fats, and trans fatty acids. Of these, saturated fats and trans fats are the worst fats.Choose a diet high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids for more energy and a healthier heart.Some heart-healthy sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats include seafood, nuts, seeds, olives, avocados, olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, grape seed oil, and flaxseed oil.Nuts that provide healthy fatty acids include macadamias, hazelnuts, pecans, almonds, cashews, peanuts, walnuts, and Brazil nuts., Fruits and vegetables provide you with vitamins and minerals that your body needs to feel full and energetic throughout the day.Eat at least five servings of vegetables each day and two to four servings of fresh fruit.Aim for fruits and vegetables that are low on the glycemic index (GI). High-GI foods cause a spike in blood sugar levels, which typically causes a subsequent energy crash. Low-GI foods enter the blood more slowly and can help avoid energy crashes.Examples of low-GI foods include non-tropical fruits, sweet potato, corn, yam, beans/legumes, and non-starchy vegetables like carrots, asparagus, cauliflower, broccoli, and squash.Select vegetables for daily consumption that are leafy and dark green. Green and leafy vegetables are packed with vitamins and nutrients., Inadequate water consumption can lead to dehydration, which causes fatigue and feelings of low-energy.Help fight fatigue by staying hydrated throughout the day.


Experts recommend drinking nine to twelve glasses of water each day to stay properly hydrated.That total includes water you consume through juice, coffee, tea, and dietary sources of water like fruits and vegetables.If you're engaging in strenuous physical activity, or if you are in a hot environment, you will need to drink even more water to stay properly hydrated.Avoid sugary sodas and beverages.Avoid drinking too much caffeine. Caffeine is a diuretic, which can cause you to lose a considerable amount of water., Sugar gives consumers a temporary burst of energy (known as a sugar rush), but these effects wear off quickly. Once the sugar rush ends, most people feel tired and sluggish.Don't eat candy, sweets, soda, or any other food products with added sugar, as these will only make you more tired as the day goes on."

Do not drink alcohol underage, and if you are of age, only drink it in small portions.,
Do not drink Red Bull.,
Don't smoke.,
Have a healthy diet.,
Consume sugar or products high in sugar rarely.,
Concentrate on the road while driving.,
Don't do drugs.",How to Extend Your Life," You risk many diseases when you over-drink, such as liver disease. And if you are underage, it opens up a whole new variety of illness. Drink in moderate amounts only. No, it is not okay to not drink for a week or so and then drink the night away on Friday.


If you have drank more than two glasses of alcohol, wait around twelve hours (depending on how much you had) before driving. Don't think that if you drive home fast, you can get home before alcoholic effects take place. Because of ethanol; a strong molecule in alcohol that dissolves quickly into the bloodstream; you will barely have any time before you start going into a daze. Can't wait that long? Ask a friend (who hasn't drank any alcohol around that time) to give you a ride. It may be a bit of a hassle, but it's worth not getting into a serious car accident.;
, If you do, do so only in small doses. It has 80 milligrams of caffeine in one can, the equivalent of a cup of coffee. There have been recorded deaths that Red Bull has been presumed to be the cause of. It has an unhealthy amount of caffeine and other vitamins, and shouldn't be consumed too often. And if you drink it, do not mix it with vodka or other alcohol. Red Bull masks the drunk effect, so you're more drunk than you know.Caffeine isn't only unhealthy for your metabolism, but it also rots your teeth and causes osteoporosis. Avoid caffeinated foods and drinks as they are not the best for your body.

, Smoking is the second leading cause of death in the United States of America. It's also the leading cause of cancer. Smoking puts you at risk for multiple illnesses, such as cancer, and several organ problems. If you already smoke, it's never too late to quit. People who quit smoking at age thirty were able to gain ten years of life, people who quit at fifty were able to add six. Smoking has bad effects on your body, and the people around you. So if saving yourself isn't a good enough reason, think about how it takes a toll on those close to you.

, Obesity is the number one cause of death in the United States. Make sure that you don't overeat, and that you maintain a healthy weight. If you are underweight or overweight, or have a fear of being one of the two, contact your doctor. They can help you set up a healthier diet for you. If you want to know if you're considered healthy or not, calculate your BMI. Under 18.5 is considered underweight, 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal, 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, and anything above 30 is considered obese. Try calculating yours, and see where you stand. If you are anything other than normal, contact your doctor to see how to approach the situation., Yes, it's okay to go ahead and have a slice of that sugar-filled cake at the wedding. However, it isn't okay to be overconsuming sugar commonly. If you absolutely can't stand not having a packet of sugar with your iced tea and such, look out for sugar substitutes. Most people can't notice the difference, and many restaurants supply them. Try brands such as Sweet N Low out and see how you like it. It will greatly change your life and make you healthier.

, Just because you're driving in a straight line for the time being, it doesn't mean that you can take your hands off the wheel and text. It's illegal in some states to text and drive. It's also illegal in others to eat and drive. Clip on your seatbelt before you turn the key in the ignition, and always keep an eye on the road. Driving is not the time to multitask.

, It's okay if you have a prescription and are under medication, but drugs can be very dangerous. Most present some sort of dependency, and can also put you at risk. You could be risking injury, illness, or even death. It can also become hard to quit taking drugs. It's better not to start at all. However, if you are addicted to a certain drug, you can still quit. Contact your doctor so you can get help and become healthier.

Eating a nutritious and not-too-heavy breakfast will give you the energy you need to start the day and will keep you from crashing or getting tired before noon. You should eat a balance of lean proteins, healthy veggies, and some carbs to get your day started. Avoid foods that are too sugary like muffins or too greasy like bacon and opt for something filling but healthier instead. Here are some foods that can help you feel energized:Oatmeal

Hard-boiled or sunny-side eggs made with low-fat butter
Turkey bacon or ham
Greens like celery, spinach, leeks, or kale
Blackberries, raspberries, bananas, apples, or pears
Whole wheat toast or whole wheat bagels
Cereal with low-fat milk
Yogurt and granola;
, Though breakfast is the most important meal, you need to keep yourself energized throughout the day so you can continue to feel alert and motivated. Make sure to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, no matter how busy or tired you may feel. Have a balance of proteins, carbs, and fruits and veggies during all of your meals, and try not to have too heavy of a lunch, or you will feel yourself flatlining afterwards. Your dinner should be medium-sized so you don't wake up feeling too hungry, but not so heavy that you feel completely lethargic after you eat. Here are some great foods you can eat for lunch or dinner:


Lunch: salads with nuts and berries, tomato soup, turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread, salmon, polenta, and tuna with fennel.
Dinner: salmon and quinoa, whole wheat pasta and lemon chicken, brown rice and mushrooms, and couscous and turkey.

, Your three meals are important, but so are the snacks you eat throughout the day that will keep you going. You should eat something at least every 3-4 hours even if you're not particularly hungry. Try to avoid going into any of your meals feeling lightheaded or incredibly hungry, because this will undoubtedly make you lose your energy, overeat, and then get tired from eating too much. Avoid this cycle by keeping healthy and nutritious snacks on hand to keep you going throughout the day. Here are some great energizing snacks you should eat:


Granola
Yogurt
Almonds, cashews, or peanuts
A small piece of chocolate
Celery and peanut butter
Apples and honey

, Fiber gives you more energy throughout the day than carbs because it enters your bloodstream at a steadier pace than carbs do, so the energy it gives you can last longer. Foods that are rich in fiber can be great additions to your meals or to the snacks you eat throughout the day. Here are some foods known for being rich in fiber:Rye bread
Pistachios
Raspberries
Lentils
Figs
Lima beans
Pecans

, You can find Omega 3 fatty acid in canola oil, fatty fish, and walnuts. Omega 3 is known for making you feel more mentally alert, and therefore more energized. You should try to eat fatty fish and walnuts at least every day or two to energize yourself., If you want to energize yourself, then you have to drink at least 10 8-oz. glasses of water each day. You need to do this even if you don't feel thirsty at all if you want to keep yourself feeling alert and enthusiastic. Carry a water bottle wherever you go, and stop to drink at water fountains even if you aren't really thirsty. Have a glass of water with each meal or snack to remind yourself to stay hydrated.

, You don't have to stop drinking caffeine completely, but you should know that while drinking more caffeine may make you more energetic in the short-term, it'll make you feel more fatigued and tired in the long run. Try to avoid drinking coffee after noon and if you do drink caffeine, try to sip it slowly instead of downing that cup of coffee in ten minutes and then feeling the jitters.The caffeine in tea can affect you a bit less harshly than the caffeine in coffee so you should try switching from coffee to tea to keep yourself from losing energy quickly.


Drinking too much caffeine will also keep you up at night, which will lead you to wake up with less energy -- which you'll try to fight with more caffeine. Break this cycle if you want to feel more energized.
If you do want to wean yourself off of so much caffeine, you can do it slowly; quitting coffee cold turkey can make you feel tired and restless, especially if you're used to drinking a lot of it.

, Alcohol is a depressant and it can make you feel tired and lead you to fall into a less restful sleep. If you want to energize yourself, then you may think that going out to the bars and downing five beers with your friends will make you feel more excited about life; in fact, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to feel tired and irritable -- even if you don't feel its effects right away.


If you do like to have a glass of wine or two in the evenings, avoid drinking alcohol less than two hours before you go to bed. It can help you fall asleep, but it will make you have a more shallow and restless sleep., Exercising will make you feel more energized, happier, and more physically fit. If you’re feeling sluggish, chances are that working out is the last thing you want to do, but that’s precisely what will make you feel more alert and alive. Just 30 minutes of exercise a day will boost your energy levels overall, not to mention that it will have marked improvements on your health. You can run every other day, take a yoga class a few times a week, join a team sport, or find a workout buddy and hit up the gym.Try to be active whenever you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of driving. Do some sit-ups when you’re watching TV.
Work out in the morning. This will wake your body up and will give you more energy throughout the day.

, Power naps have been proven to wake up your body when you’re feeling a lack of energy. Just close yourself off in a dark room for 15-20 minutes, close your eyes, and let yourself drift off. Even if you don’t end up falling asleep completely, you will gain energy from resting your body. Power naps are superior to real naps; sleeping for over an hour or more will actually make you feel more tired and groggy when you wake up, and can keep you up at night.


A good time to take a power nap can be after lunch, when you’re feeling a little tired after eating.

, Take a few handfuls of cold water and splash it on your face when you’re feeling tired. This is a great trick to wake yourself up in the morning – not to mention make yourself feel cleaner – and also for energizing yourself throughout the day.

, Just being outside as much as you can has been proven to make people feel happier and more energetic. Getting some fresh air in your lungs can invigorate you and make you feel ready to embrace the day. Stepping outside or onto your balcony right after you wake up and breathing in fresh air just for a minute can make you more energized almost instantly. If you can get some sunlight, make sure to do it; instead of eating lunch at your desk, step out to get some lunch or eat it on a park bench.


If you spend eight hours in a row indoors, then you will be drained of your energy much more quickly than if you took breaks and spent some time outside.

, Walking for just twenty minutes can wake up your mind and body and make you feel more energized. Whenever you feel your energy waning, step outside, get some fresh air, and move your body., Getting enough sleep is crucial if you want to energize yourself. You may be feeling tired simply because you haven’t been sleeping enough. You may think that enough willpower and caffeine can combat the fact that you’ve been averaging five hours of sleep a night, but nothing can substitute a good night’s sleep. Make sure to sleep for at least 7-8 hours a night and to go to bed around the same time every night and wake up at the same time in the morning; changing your sleeping schedule regularly can make you feel like you’re waking up with jet lag.


Make sure you have a good winding-down routine at least an hour before sleep. Turn off all visual stimuli, such as your phone, computer, and television, and read quietly in bed or listen to some calming music. This can help you fall asleep faster.
When you wake up, stop hitting snooze and start your day. Hitting snooze repeatedly will only make you fall back into a short, jagged sleep, and won’t actually make you feel any more rested. Waking up after you hear your alarm will make you feel more energized and more in control of your day., Turning on music can make you feel more energized instantly. If you’re feeling a little low on the energy scale, just put on your favorite pump up jam, whether you’re listening to Macklemore or Jackson 5. Get a friend to join a quick dance party with you or dance by yourself in a room. Just getting yourself moving will make you feel more energized, awake, and excited to be alive.


Alternately, you can also try listening to classical music, even if that’s not your thing. It has been proven to wake up your mind.

, Another way to energize your mind is to switch to doing something new. Let’s say you’ve been studying for your chemistry test for three hours and you feel yourself flagging. Well, try something new. Start planning that English essay instead, or write that Spanish paragraph you’ve been dreading. Switching gears to something new when the first thing isn’t working is a great way to make yourself feel energized.


Even if the task you’ve switched to isn’t necessarily more exciting than the last, just the effort of switching will make you feel a bit more energized.
Start your day off with a to-do list. That way, the options of tasks you can switch to will be more readily available and you’re less likely to get stuck doing something that is draining your energy.

, Setting up rewards for yourself is a great way to feel energized and motivated to continue on with your work or whatever else you have to do. Tell yourself that you’ll eat an ice cream sundae after you study for four hours. Say that you’ll finally go see the second Hunger Games with your friends after you finish all of your chores. Just the thought of something fun on the horizon can make you feel more energized and motivated to continue on with your day.


You can even reward yourself without leaving your desk. Tell yourself that after half an hour of work, you’ll spend five minutes reading that article your best friend sent you.

, You may think that multi-tasking will keep you alert and can make you get everything done faster, but studies show that multi-tasking can actually drain you of energy faster, make you more distracted, and also make you less efficient than if you were focused on just one task at a time. Checking off items from your to-do list is much more effective – and much more likely to save energy – than trying to complete three tasks at once without fully getting them accomplished.

, Whenever you’re really flagging in the middle of a task, tell yourself, “I’ll just do this for ten more minutes.” Repeat this to yourself like a mantra as you continue to tackle the task. Setting a short time limit can make your task feel more manageable and less overwhelming and can keep you focused instead of making you lose patience.


If this trick works for you, then you can set longer time limits for yourself – half an hour or even an hour – if you want to muster the energy to master a particular task.

, This is another great trick for energizing yourself throughout the day. Though most people don’t have the luxury of scheduling their entire day around the peaks and valleys of their energy levels, small changes can make a big difference. If you know you have the most energy in the mornings, schedule your run for the mornings instead of struggling to run after a long day of work; if you know you get a little tired after lunch, then schedule some mindless tasks for that time, from running errands to doing the easiest part of your job.


Make a list of your typical schedule and try to chart your energy levels around it. What parts of your schedule can you change to make your life a little easier?
You may not be so aware of the ebbs and flows and of your energy levels. Try monitoring yourself on a typical day and keep track of how you feel.

, Though you obviously can’t take a vacation every time you feel the need to really energize yourself, you’ll be surprised by how significantly a much-needed vacation can help spike up your energy levels when you return to your daily life. Whether you go to Bermuda or take a stay-cation to clean up your home and catch up on reading, just taking some time off from your usual tasks, spoiling yourself, and switching up your routine can help you feel more happy and energetic about facing the day.


If you can’t afford a vacation, even a day or two off from work can make you feel less overwhelmed and more alert.

, Even the most focused, enthusiastic person needs to take a break every hour or hour and a half. Taking breaks, whether you’re taking a 15 minute walk, stepping outside to call home, or just switching gears and reading a few news stories, will make you feel reinvigorated and ready to tackle the tasks in front of you. Resting your mind a bit can give you more energy and will keep you from feeling burned out. Don’t skip that lunch break to get your work done faster; go out to lunch and return to your work with more energy.


Taking breaks can also be great for your eyes. Turn away from that computer and turn to a newspaper, look out a window, or even rake your Zen garden. Your eyes will get weary if you stare at a computer for eight hours straight without a break.

, If you feel your mind starting to drift off and start gearing up for a nap, then it may be time to hang out with your friends. When you’re feeling tired and sleepy, the last thing you may want to do is hang out with a bunch of people, but that’s precisely the thing that will make you more energized. Talking to a close friend or hanging out in a big group can make you feel more energized because you’ll be talking to other people and engaging in a fun, active conversation instead of just sitting there getting tired.


So, the next time you need more energy, call up a friend and make plans to hang out. You’ll feel energetic again in no time.

Return to simplicity.,
Enjoy the simple things in life.,
Change things up.,
Make time for what you love.,
Drop unwanted commitments.,
Focus on what matters.,
Let go.,
Embrace your inner geek.,
Be grateful.,
Reassess your priorities.",How to Bring out the Awesomeness in Life," Simplification is about de-cluttering your life. It’s not just de-cluttering our homes and spaces though, it’s simplifying our mental and emotional realms. It’s shedding the baggage of self-limiting beliefs and constant mental chatter. It’s finding some quietude in your life.;
, This goes along with quieting our minds as well. The next time you eat a piece of fruit or enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, simply enjoy it. Sounds like a pretty obvious suggestion right? Well it is, but most of the time we do exactly the opposite. We’re not just eating or drinking, we’re thinking about all sorts of things. We’re thinking about the next item of action; taking out the dog to use the bathroom, the mail we need to take to the post office, etc. The next time you eat or drink, just do that. You will experience the flavors and tastes at if it were the first time.

, Try something new. Do something you’ve always wanted to do, but have never gotten around to. If you’ve always wanted to learn to play tennis, go out and buy a tennis racket and a ball. If you don’t have a partner, you can always play the wall.

, We often get burnt out because we’re busy working and attending to obligations. If we are not doing anything we’re excited about, we’ll likely start resenting our lives. It’s important to make time every day doing things you really enjoy.

, Just as we need to make time for doing things we love, we also need to prune the things we aren’t passionate about. Some things aren’t really negotiable. If you don’t pay your electricity bill, you will be eating by candlelight. But other so-called obligations aren’t really necessary. A good test is to ask yourself if your commitment is something that’s really adding to your life. Is it enhancing your life, or is it just adding more stress? Sometimes quitting is the best answer when simplifying your life.

, Most of us have a tendency to want everything to be perfect.You have the option to not care about things being less than perfect too. Realize that your return on investment decreases rapidly. Studying for 8 hours a week might get you a 3.8 GPA, while studying for 20 hours might earn you a 4.0. Is that extra .2 really worth it? Focus on what matters and stop stressing so much that you’re no longer enjoying life.

, Relaxation is possible. The thought of not obsessing over all the things that haven't been done today is often terrifying. But it’s okay. There will always be tomorrow. On your deathbed do you really think you’re going to be thinking about the to-do list you didn’t complete? You’ll probably be thinking about how you wished you would have had more fun, spent more time with your family and enjoyed life more.

, We’re all geeky about certain things. Think about what really makes you geek out. A good indicator is that it’s something you get super excited about that makes other people give you strange looks.Work on the field that you are good at and make your life more awesome.

, Just being grateful to be alive is a powerful thing. You never know when you’re going to leave this world. You never know if you’ll have another chance to write that novel you have been meaning to, run that marathon or tell your lover how you feel about her.

, Are you living for today, or solely for the achievement of your next project? Do you stress out about what’s on your to-do list more than living in the moment? We have to find a balance in achievement and contentment. Sometimes it’s not about getting what you want, but wanting what you have. It’s not about achieving the completion of a project, but enjoying the process of creativity.

Eat breakfast every day.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Snack on nuts like almonds and cashews.,
Add whole grains to your diet.,
Eat healthy fats.,
Stay hydrated.,
Drink electrolyte-packed lemon juice.,
Take a magnesium supplement if you are feeling low-energy.",How to Boost Energy Naturally1," Breakfast means breaking the fast that you went through while you slept. On waking, your body needs an energy boost to function and perform your routine activities. Of course, try not to miss any meals, as this can deprive your body of the energy boost that food can give you.


However, do not overeat, as stuffing yourself can decrease your energy levels because it makes you feel lethargic.;
, Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of energy. The natural sugar content in fruit and vegetables can boost your energy levels without causing a sudden drop in energy that you can experience when eating sugary cakes or energy drinks. This is because the natural sugar in fruits and vegetables is easily absorbed by the body.Energy-boosting fruits include: Bananas, oranges, grapes, apples, papayas, lemons, cherries, watermelons, and blueberries.
Energy-boosting vegetables include: Carrots, broccoli, sweet potatoes, spinach, and cucumbers.

, Nuts have protein, which is a good source of energy. Coenzyme Q10, a nutrient present in nuts aids your cells in producing energy. Nuts are also good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which boost your energy. Energy-boosting nuts include:


Almonds.
Cashews.
Walnuts.
Pistachios.
Hazelnuts.

, Whole grains keep you energized for longer. They have a low glycemic index, which means that they take longer to be absorbed by your body, allowing you to have energy from your meal for longer. Whole grains are also high in fiber and protein, both of which boost your metabolism and energy. Energy-boosting whole grains include:


Oats.
Brown rice.
Whole wheat.
Barley.

, Your body uses fats as a backup source of energy that can help to raise your metabolic rate. However, there are only certain kinds of fat that are good for an energy boost. Fat from junk foods should be avoided. In particular, eat:


Foods with Omega 3 fatty acids like fish, walnuts, flax seeds, and canola oil.
Monounsaturated fats like olive oil, avocados, olives, almonds, and peanut butter.
Polyunsaturated fats like soybean oil, flax seeds, soymilk, and tofu.

, Poor water intake leads to dehydration which causes fatigue. To boost your energy levels, it is essential to hydrate your body. The best way to hydrate the body is by drinking plenty of water every day. Consume at least one and half to two liters of water each day.


When you exercise, remember to sip water every 15 minutes to replenish your water stores that you lose when you exercise.
Increase the amount of water you drink when the weather gets hotter.

, Lemon juice is packed with electrolytes like magnesium and potassium, which are essential for energy production. Squeeze juice out of half a lemon and add it to 150 ml of warm water. Add a pinch of salt and drink it first thing in the morning to start your day off with an energy boost.

, Magnesium deficiency can lead to low energy levels. You can take a magnesium supplement each day, or you can eat foods that are rich in magnesium. Good sources of magnesium are:


Nuts like almonds, cashews, hazelnuts.
Bran muffins, pumpkin seeds, barley, and buckwheat flour.
Halibut.
Soybeans.
Spinach.

Consider your life story.,
Reevaluate your core beliefs.,
Seek honest feedback about yourself.,
Take responsibility for your behavior, thoughts, and feelings.,
Practice self care.",How to Be More Mentally Aware2," Whether consciously or not, everyone lives by a narrative. The story you tell yourself about your life and experiences matters when it comes to mental awareness. Your understanding of your personal narrative has an impact on your current actions and future goals.Personal mental narratives can be constricting in some ways. For example, you may learn to see yourself as a victim of circumstance. Inaccurate feelings of helplessness and hopelessness can result. In order to become more mentally aware, periodically reevaluate your mental narrative.Look back on your earliest memories. What people, events, and experiences had the greatest impact on you? Why? How do you frame setback in your life narrative? What times in your life did you feel most emotionally and mentally stimulated? Answering these questions can help you see places where negative thought patterns may be tied to an inaccurate view of your life story., Everyone has core beliefs that they try to live by. Core beliefs are developed both by yourself and by your circumstances. How you behave is often linked to your belief system. Evaluating your belief system can help you become more mentally aware of your own behavior.Identify your core beliefs. Try to write down a list of five values you live by. Then, write down assumptions you also believe. For example, what do you think of other people? Do you feel you can be trusting of others? Why or why not? Think about abstract values. What do you think it means to be a good person? A bad person? Do you react to people in a particular way because they defy your core belief system?Look for examples of black and white thinking in your core beliefs. These types of thought patterns can subtly affect how you interact with other people. You may be unaware of the impact you have on others as a result. Maybe you believe lying is wrong, regardless of the situation. You may then have a tendency to overreact to white lies told to spare your feelings. You may also be too blunt around other people, giving them your version of the truth instead of modifying your response to be more tactful.Look for black and white core beliefs about yourself. Oftentimes, people do not try new things or push themselves hard enough enough to succeed because of inaccurate and self-defeating thoughts. For example, maybe a big rejection earlier in life has led you to convince yourself you'll never find romantic love. You may feel you're not lovable in that way and have stopped dating or seeking out companionship. Therefore, your core belief about yourself becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy., People who are most self aware do not fear criticism. In fact, they seek out honest feedback in order to improve themselves and their behavior. If you want to increase your level of self awareness, seek to do the same.


Everyone has blind spots, that is traits others see in them but they do not see in themselves. Ask trusted friends and family members to be honest about your blind spots. What traits about yourself are you largely unaware of? How do these traits affect your behavior?Many people become defensive when confronting blind spots, especially when blinds spots challenge are inherent sense of identity or force us to confront negative behavioral patterns. Try to let go of your inclination to go on the defense when seeking feedback. Remember, you are striving to become a more mature, mentally aware person. Even if parts of the journey are hard, it will be worth it., One trait of mentally aware people is their ability to accept realistic responsibility for their actions. Try to take responsibility for your own thoughts, behaviors, and feelings.


No one is going to make things better for you. If you want to improve a situation, you must take responsibility and do so yourself. Mentally aware people have long since accepted this fact. Be willing to admit to your mistakes and shortcomings.Keep in mind mentally aware people accept reasonable responsibility. Just as it can be bad to refuse to acknowledge your ability to change a situation, you need to make peace with the fact some things cannot be changed by your actions alone. Let go of inevitable setbacks and unavoidable circumstances that temporarily alter your path. If it rains all day and you want to go for a run, for example, accept that you'll have to catch up on your workout tomorrow., Mentally aware people understand the need for self care. In order to be mentally aware of yourself and your surroundings, you need to care for your body and mind.


Self care involves engaging in simple rituals that are often overlooked during the course of a busy day. Get enough sleep at night. Eat three meals a day. Make time for exercise.Make time for leisure. Relaxation is important to your mental well-being. Incorporate an hour of you time into your daily schedule. Take a warm bath. Go for a long walk. Spend time with your pets. Read a book."
"
Do not take things personally.,
Stop forecasting.,
Let go of the past.",How to Be More Mentally Aware3," Personalizing setbacks can result in feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. People who are mentally aware tend to accept the things they cannot change. Strive to do so yourself.


Unconsciously, you probably personalize circumstances quite a bit. Try to catch yourself personalizing throughout the day. For example, say you get to the office early one morning and a normally chatty co-worker gives you a hasty ""Hello"" without stopping to make small talk. You may immediately start blaming yourself. Did you do something wrong? Does this person not like you? You are personalizing a situation that may have nothing to do with you.When you catch yourself in these moments, try to pull yourself out of your head for a moment. Ask yourself, ""In all likelihood, does this have anything to do with me?"" Take the co-worker example. Maybe she was running late for a meeting. Maybe she isn't feeling well. Maybe there's something going on in her personal life that's causing her stress. Chances are, her quiet nature this morning has nothing to do with you., Without realizing it, people often make predictions about the future. Mentally aware people are able to accept they have no way of knowing what the future holds.


Keep in mind you cannot control what is yet to come. The only moments you have control over are those that occur in the present. Try to keep your mind focused on the present moment and do not let your mind wander in ""What if?"" scenarios.When your mind lingers in the future, you'll end up making critical mistakes in the present. If you spend your work day daydreaming about how you'll one day run the company, you're not engaged with the work at hand. You'll end up doing a sloppy job at work and your dream of success will not come into fruition., Holding onto the past can result in disengaging from the present reality. If you're wishing things could go back to a former state, let go of this wish. Accept and be aware of the present moment instead.


Mentally aware people understand the past, however great it may have been, no longer exists. They do not waste time longing for times gone by but instead strive to make the best of the present moment, even if the situation is not ideal.Reminiscing about the good times can be fun. However, keep in mind that you may miss positive aspects of the present moment by romanticizing the past. Appreciate your memories but do not let them tether you."

Write expressively.,
Surround yourself with supportive people.,
Accept feelings, positive and negative.,
Learn to live with uncertainty.",How to Be More Mentally Aware4," Mentally aware people are capable of getting out of their head and appreciating the world around them. One way to do so is writing expressively. Purging your inner thoughts on the page can help you engage in the outer world.


Keep a diary. Make a nightly ritual of writing down any thoughts, fears, or hopes you have about your life at the moment. Be honest and use as much detail as possible.By practicing expressive writing on a regular basis, many people are able to disengage with troubling or persistent thought patterns. This can help you become mentally aware and appreciative of the present., Mental awareness is not something you can achieve solely on your own. Surround yourself with people that are self aware, strong, and supportive. Seek out the company of friends and family members that give good advice and seem content with their lives., Mentally aware people accept things they cannot change, including feelings. Acknowledge that sometimes life will be painful and stressful. Accept that both negative and positive feelings are a normal part of life.


Avoidance can be appealing when we're feeling down. However, certain habits people use to disengage in negative thoughts can be more harmful than helpful. Things like drinking and drug use, for example, should not be used to avoid negativity.Instead of trying to cope through avoidance, try to take a moment to acknowledge the feeling the next time you're sad, in pain, or stressed. Say to yourself, ""I am not feeling good right now, but this is a normal part of life and it will pass over soon."" Mentally aware people embrace their emotions on all levels, positive and negative., Mentally aware people accept they do not always have all the answers. Sometimes, acknowledging that you don't understand a situation, feeling, or person is better than seeking an inaccurate explanation or assumption. Accept that life is sometimes confusing and answers are not always apparent.People often engage in behaviors to try to avoid dealing with uncertainty. These include seeking excessive reassurance from others, list-making, double-checking, procrastination, and avoiding situations. Keep a diary of how you avoid coping with uncertainty head on. Write down any activities you engaged to avoid uncertainty.Once you have an idea of how you avoid uncertainty, try engaging in behaviors that allow you to practice living with uncertainty. For example, if you excessively double check e-mails before sending them out, try sending a few e-mails out each day without re-reading them before hitting ""send."" Leave your house without double checking to make sure you locked the door.Keep up with your diary. Write down how you felt about, say, sending an e-mail without reading it over. Writing about your feelings can help you cope with them.Keep practicing. It can take awhile to feel comfortable with uncertain aspects of life. Move from small stakes activities, like leaving without double checking the door is locked, to activities that are more difficult for you. For example say you dislike going to parties as you're uncertain about what precisely will occur in social situations. Force yourself to go to a party by yourself or attend a social gathering you would normally avoid."

Get more exercise.,
Stretch out your body.,
Get enough rest.,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Try taking supplements.,
Use herbal remedies.",How to Boost Energy Levels2," Physical activity is a known energy booster, and can also help you get a better night's sleep.If you're feeling fatigued and low on energy, a vigorous workout every day or several times each week can help you feel more energetic and get better, more restful sleep.


Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day or follow the guidelines here.Opt for cardio workouts like walking, running, and biking.Talk to your doctor before beginning a workout routine.

, Whether you're lounging at home or tied to your desk at work, stretching can help give you a noticeable boost in energy.Stretch your arms and hands above your head as high as you can reach, and hold them for 10 to 15 seconds.With your arms outstretched to the side, lower your torso to one side so that one set of hands touches the floor and the other set of hands points upward. Hold this for 10 to 15 seconds, then reverse to the other side.
Touch your toes while your legs are as straight as possible., If you're constantly feeling low on energy, you may not be getting enough sleep, or you may be getting poor quality sleep.Teenagers typically need between eight and 10 hours of sleep each night.Adults ages 18 to 64 typically need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night.Older adults ages 65 and up typically need between seven to eight hours of sleep each night.Limit caffeine and stimulants to help ensure a good night's sleep.Turn off all electronics at least 30 minutes before bed to ensure a better night's sleep., Stress has been recognized as a trigger for worsening symptoms associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as general problems with sleeping and getting adequate rest.Take deep breaths from your diaphragm to help lower your heart rate and reduce stress.Try progressive muscle relaxation to unwind. Slowly tense each major muscle group in your body, focusing on one part of the body at a time. Hold that tense pose for about five seconds, then release the tension and relax for 30 seconds before moving on to the next muscle group.Take a vacation or work on issues that are adding to your daily stress, such as relationship issues, to help relieve stress.Consider taking added steps to address your stress and help you to relax such as participating in classes for meditation, mindfulness, or yoga., If you're experiencing consistently low energy levels, your doctor may recommend that you take supplements to help. Always consult your doctor before beginning any supplement regimen.


Examples of supplements used to boost energy include 300 mg to 1000 mg of magnesium, sometimes combined with malic acid, and omega 3s and 6s, taken cautiously to avoid interactions with existing meds.Some doctors recommend taking NADH at a dose of 5 mg to 20 mg per day, DHEA, dosed at 50 mg to 200 mg per day, vitamin B12 by injection, dosed at 2500 mcg to 5000 mcg every two to three days for several weeks, and beta-carotine, 50,000 IU each day to strengthen the immune system.Other supplements include L-carnitine, 500 mg to 1000 mg three times day for eight weeks, vitamin D at a dose of 600 to 1000 IU each day, and melatonin, 0.5 mg to 3 mg nightly about 8 hours before bedtime., Some people find that certain herbal treatments help boost energy levels and fight fatigue. However, herbal treatments can cause problems with existing medical conditions and prescribed medications.Do not take any herbal remedies without consulting your doctor.


Herbs that may prove helpful with treating chronic fatigue syndrome include ginseng and echinacea. Both have been shown to be possibly helpful in increasing the immune response in people with chronic fatigue syndrome.Essential oils including jasmine, peppermint, and rosemary oil may possibly be helpful with reducing stress associated with this syndrome. You can use the essential oils as aromatherapy by applying the oil to a cotton ball, by adding a few drops in a warm bath, or by using a unit that disperses aromas within the room."

Review your medications with your doctor.,
Learn symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.",How to Boost Energy Levels3," If you are following a healthy diet, increasing your exercise, and making changes in your daily routine with no improvement, there may be a medical condition or medication that is causing the problem.If you believe you may have a medical condition causing chronic fatigue, it's important to talk to your doctor about how to identify and treat your condition.

Get plenty of sleep each night.,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Try to exercise each day.,
Spend some time in the sun.,
Take a break from your routine every once in a while.,
Try meditating each day.,
Increase your sexual activity.",How to Boost Energy Naturally2," While you sleep, your body repairs itself and the brain restores its energy supply so that you can wake up in the morning feeling ready for the day. Depriving yourself of sleep can drain your body because sleep acts like a charger that charges your brain cells and replenishes your energy levels. The amount of sleep you should get depends on your personal lifestyle, but rough outlines include:


Less than 2 months of age: 12-18 hours.
Between 3 and 11 months of age: 14-15 hours.
Between 1 and 3 years: 12-14 hours.
Between 3 and 5 years: 11-13 hours.
Between 5 and 10 years: 10-11 hours.
Between 11 and 17 years: 8-9 hours.
Above 17 years: 7-9 hours.

, Stress, worry, and anxiety can all lead to both mental and physical fatigue. A lot of energy is used dealing with these emotions, so if you lower your stress levels, you can put that energy towards other activities. To lower your stress levels:


Confront the thing that is making you stress and try your hardest to change it.
Practice breathing exercises that you can do when you feel stressed. A common breathing exercise is to slowly breathe in for 10 seconds, hold your breath for a moment, and then slowly release your breath for another 10 seconds.
Try meditating and practicing yoga (See Method Four).
Exercise. Exercising releases endorphins that can combat stress.

, To boost energy, exercising is a must. Exercising or any physical activity releases ‘happy hormones’ called endorphins. These help in strengthening the immune system, in elevating the mood and regulation of your appetite. All of these things can help to boost your energy levels.


Try to exercise for at least 30 minutes each day.You should try to do both cardiovascular exercises and strengthening exercises. Cardio exercises include walking, running, biking, and swimming. Strength exercises include weightlifting, resistance training, stretching, and yoga (see Method Four for more on yoga).

, Early morning sun exposure can boost your energy levels. Sunlight helps your body to produce vitamin D, which the body needs to help keep your bones healthy. Sun exposure also helps your body to release certain essential enzymes in your body that act as mood elevators, which in turn can increase your energy levels., It need not be always ‘All work and no play’.

Find out if your employer offers a policy.,
Decide the level and type of coverage you need.,
Assess your finances.,
Evaluate different providers.,
Get quotes.,
Choose your policy.",How to Apply for Long Term Care Insurance1," Some employers offer long-term care insurance at group rates.


Employer-sponsored plans typically have lower rates than individual policies, and you may not have to meet the same medical requirements you would if you purchased an individual policy.Long-term care insurance also may be available through a professional or service organization to which you belong.;
, Although it may be difficult to determine if you're looking for a policy decades before you anticipate needing it, you need to look at the types of long-term care available in your area and which you prefer.


Consider the support you may have from your family and friends. If you can reasonably expect significant assistance from them, you may require lesser levels of coverage.The level of coverage for which you are eligible may depend on whether you have any pre-existing conditions that would increase the likelihood that you need long-term care later in life.Keep in mind that long-term care can cost between $200 and $300 for a private room in a nursing home or assisted living facility, and at least $20 per hour for in-home care., Your finances will affect not only the premiums you can afford but also the amount of benefit you'll need and how soon it will take effect after you require long-term care.Keep in mind that premiums often increase over time, and your income may decrease as you get older. If you have to drop your policy because you can no longer afford the premiums, you will lose the benefits it offers as well as all the money you've already paid into it.You may want to speak with a lawyer or financial advisor about your retirement savings and other ways to cover future long-term care expenses before you choose to apply for long-term care insurance., Once you have a good idea of the type of policy you need, you should research companies that offer those types of policies.


Insurance agencies should be licensed to sell insurance in your state, and the agent with whom you work should have additional training and experience in long-term care insurance.You can check with your state's insurance department to find out the status of a particular provider's license and whether any complaints have been filed against them.You also might check consumer boards and organizations such as the Better Business Bureau to assess the company's reputation.
You also should review the overall stability of the company and its history with long-term care insurance.You don't want to purchase a long-term care insurance policy with a company that has a significant risk of going belly-up.
Keep in mind that some companies may require you to use certain services or health-care providers rather than giving you a choice. Having a good understanding of the types of long-term care with which you would be comfortable can help you narrow down the policies offered by various companies.For example, one company may not cover in-home long-term care. If you know that you would prefer to stay in your home rather than being moved to a nursing home or assisted living facility, you should make sure in-home care will be covered by the policies you consider buying.
If the insurance company requires use only of particular services or long-term care companies, you also should make sure that company operates in the area where you live.Understanding that your premium may increase over time, you can ask each company to provide information regarding the rate history for its premiums, or look into anti-inflation protection for your policy., When you're ready to buy your policy, you should get quotes from at least three reputable insurers so you can pick the one that best suits your needs and your budget.


The company may provide an informal review before offering you a quote, to determine if you are eligible for the policies it offers.Make sure you get a written copy of the policy so you can review it carefully. If there are any terms you don't understand, you might consider discussing it with an attorney or financial advisor.To determine how useful a policy will be to you, compare the amount of the benefits to your financial projections regarding the money you'll have available to cover long-term care as well as familial or other support you have.You also should compare the offered benefits to the average cost of care in your area.If the policy won't cover care for you, it won't be of much value for you to pay into it.
When you're choosing among policies, look at how each one defines the events that trigger when you become eligible for benefits. Generally, you qualify for benefits when you cannot complete two or three basic activities of daily life such as bathing, eating, or using the toilet without assistance. However, some insurance companies require you to be physically unable to complete those activities, rather than have mental difficulties due to an illness such as Alzheimer's disease.Check whether the policy has a nonforfeiture provision. This provision allows you to receive a lesser benefit amount even if you can no longer afford the premiums, based on how long you have paid into the policy. These provisions are required in some states but not everywhere.When evaluating possible policies, make sure you understand each policy's waiting or elimination period, the daily benefits that will be provided, what must happen to trigger benefits, and what conditions are excluded., Once you've decided which policy you want to buy, it's typically just a matter of signing some paperwork and paying your premium.


Typically even after you've signed your policy you have a period of 30 days or so during which you can review your policy and return it for a full refund with no questions asked if you change your mind about your purchase or decide to go with another company.Average long-term care insurance policies in the U.S. cost between $2,000 and $3,000 a year. That amount purchases a comprehensive policy that covers both in-home and facility care for around five years, paying between $100 and $200 a day.Make sure you pay your premiums when due or you risk losing your policy and any benefits in which you've invested.
You typically have the ability to choose the waiting or elimination period for your policy. This period begins when you need long-term care. Think of this period as similar to a deductible on your auto insurance policy – the shorter the waiting period, the higher your premiums will be."

Ask them for advice.,

Ask them about their family.,
Look at old photo albums with them.,

They have likely encountered struggles similar to the ones you are dealing with presently. Take some time to ask your loved one for advice about a situation you are in, whether it is big or small. Doing so will help remind them of the ways that they have overcome obstacles and will help them feel useful in their daily life as they help you with your own.


For instance, you may be dealing with problems in your relationship. You may ask your loved one something like “I’ve been fighting a lot lately with my partner about money. Did you ever have fights like that?”
An example of a less serious issue could relate to cooking. If your loved one had been a great cook in the past, you might ask them for help in perfecting one of your own recipes.;
, Another way to help build confidence in your loved one is to ask them about the story of their life. This will signal to them that you are interested in learning more about them and will subsequently boost their self esteem. Most people, in general, enjoy talking about themselves when invited to or when asked questions.


Ask them about their career, if they had one, or about their childhood experiences.

, Perhaps your loved one collected cars in their past or enjoyed quilting. Give them the opportunity to discuss these old hobbies with you. Your loved one will likely enjoy reminiscing positively on the things they used to do in their past.


If any of these old hobbies are of interest to you, consider picking them up. Your loved one will feel a sense of pride knowing that their interest sparked your own and they will feel that they have been able to “pass down” something to a younger generation.

, Elderly people often enjoy talking about their families very much, from their own grandchildren and back to their great grandparents. People often have a great deal of pride in talking about their family. Take some time to talk about your loved one’s family tree. Remember that the elderly person’s family is their legacy, so this topic will hold a great deal of weight and importance with them.


Ask them questions about their parents and siblings, how they met their spouse, or why they gave their children the names they choose.
Many elderly people keep family records, so you could look over these as well to spark conversation.

, Allow your loved one to reminisce visually on their life as a whole. An elderly person may feel down sometimes about their life, but reminding them of all of the experiences they have had, people they’ve known, and places they visited will show them the true extent and richness of their experiences. There are likely many times and memories that they have forgotten.


As you are looking through these photos, tell them which experiences you would like to have as well. For instance, if your loved one once travelled to Hawaii and you would also like to visit, tell them. This will help them see the value and uniqueness in their experiences.

, Ask them about present day social or political issues to learn more about their viewpoints. If they feel that someone values their ideas, their confidence will be boosted.


One way to begin talking about these issues is to watch the news or read the newspaper together.

, Take some time to pick your loved one up to take a day trip. Whether you stay in town and take a drive, have lunch, or go check out a movie, your loved one will very much appreciate the chance to get out of the house for a while.


Set up weekly or biweekly outings, if possible. Your loved one will look forward to it and will have a renewed interest in life.

, Many of your elderly loved one’s new experiences as of late are likely overwhelmingly negative, like regular doctor’s appointments or being prescribed many new medications. Take some time to introduce some positive newness in their life by trying something new together. Having new experiences will invigorate them and make them feel more positively about their lives, increasing their confidence.


Some examples could include painting, playing bingo, water aerobics, or even reading a new book together.

, Often times in their old age, the elderly become increasingly disconnected from their social supports. Perhaps they have a sister who moved away years ago or an old friend from work who they often think of. See if you can connect with these people to coordinate a visit or a phone call. Talking to those from their past will often fill them with positive memories and boost their confidence, particularly if the relationship progresses beyond an initial phone call or visit.


Ask your loved one for their permission first before you reach out. You do not want to overstep your boundaries.
Other social supports include book clubs, church groups, or clubs like the Kiwanis.

, These groups can provide them with a support that you may be unable to and will also relieve you of some of the burden of care. Confidence in your love one will bolster as they find new ways to cope with and work through their problems.


Care.com provides a comprehensive list of support groups for the elderly that may be useful to you., Perhaps your loved one had to let go of a hobby that they once enjoyed due to their age or worsening health. Consider brainstorming ways that you can still allow them to enjoy these hobbies in other ways. Your loved one will feel a renewed joy for life and a boost in confidence because of it.


For example, if your loved one formerly collected cars a hobby, you could consider taking them to a car show. Or, if your loved one was a musician, you could take them to a symphony or other show where musical talent is displayed.

, Your elderly loved one may be in hospital care or may be unable to leave their homes. In these instances, you have to be a bit more creative. Your loved one deserves to feel special and confident regardless of their mobility. Be creative through establishing a fun atmosphere in home by playing games with your loved one, singing songs, or watching films they enjoy together.


This will make them feel loved and wanted and will boost their confidence, even if they are unable to leave home.
Your loved one likely has very little autonomy if they cannot leave their homes, so allow them their choice of games, movies, TV shows, or songs.

, Many times, the elderly are given very little options in relation to their life. If they live in a nursing home, they are give little choice in what to eat, doctors give them little choice in what medications to take, and so on and so forth. Allow your loved one as much choice as possible in their lives, particularly in relation to their medical careAllow them to choose the doctors they go to and their appointment times, if possible.
If you are cooking dinner or taking them out, let them choose what you have or where you go.

, Through certain tweaks to the home, you can prolong their independence, making them feel more confident in their abilities. Though their age or physical abilities may prevent them from doing certain things alone or quickly, accommodations can be made to make life easier for them.


For example, you can purchase a toilet seat adapter to make using the restroom easier for them. These seats are relatively inexpensive and may be provided by your insurance free of charge. They attach to your current toilet seat to prevent your loved one from having to stoop so low to use the restroom. This will allow them to go to the bathroom without assistance, as this tends to be one of the more humiliating aspects of old age.
Another item that can be purchased is a “helping hand” tool to allow the elderly to reach things that are up high or on shelves.

, Sometimes, we get so caught up in helping our elderly loved one that we forget that they are capable of many tasks. Let them do all that they can for themselves. Even though it's faster for you to do things and you may think that you're helping, you are actually removing some of their autonomy from them.


Don’t complain about the pace or method they use to complete the task, but step in when necessary. For instance, if your loved ones hands are trembling as they are trying to cut an apple, it is necessary to step in so that they don’t cut their hands. In cases like this, you could purchase them a specialized fruit cutter to avoid accidents when you are not present.

, The healthier they are, the more independent they will be able to be. Also, we tend to feel more confident when our bodies are healthy and when we are feeling great. Encourage your loved one to eat healthier meals or take a workout class designed for the elderly, like water aerobics.Helping them to stay active can also help them to stay healthy. Try asking them for help with simple safe tasks that they can handle. For example, folding laundry, simple dinner preparation tasks, having them help you with grocery shopping, organizing cabinets or drawers, and making simple lists of 'To Do's'. This productiveness will help to increase their feelings of self-empowerment.

, Remember that their limitations can be a big source of self-consciousness for them. Don't make a big deal out of them, and pretend that you don't mind it at all.


However, if they want to discuss their age or illness with you, have the conversation. Sometimes, talking about it can make them feel much better.

, They have lived a whole world longer than you and have had more experiences than you have had at your age. Remember that even though they're old, they're still people. They still have feelings, fears, worries, hopes and dreams, just like you. Recognize and respect their status as elders.

Get a professional membership with the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers (NAPGCM).,
Start your own elder care consulting practice.",How to Become an Elder Care Consultant," This experience will allow you to see if you can deal with the challenges of elder care. Working with seniors can be mentally taxing because you must deal with memory loss, death and health issues on a daily basis.;
, If you know that you want to be a geriatric manager, it is a good idea to opt for 4-year degree, because you may want to get a higher degree in the future. These degree programs will help you to work in the elder care field.


The geriatric care degree is popular among certified nurses assistants (CNA) because you can complete it by adding a semester to your CNA certification. If you want to work as a home health aid, a physical therapy aid or a patient care technician, this is a good educational path to take. You will need to complete a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training course and show proof of your high school diploma or equivalency in order to begin an associate's degree in geriatric care.

, You can work in a wide variety of jobs, including hospital and clinic tech or assistant, RN, CNA, nursing home/assisted living aid, personal care assistant, at-home nurse or assisted living or hospital administration or customer service.


The value of your experience is in the diversity of issues in which you become knowledgeable. 2 years in which someone learns how to handle legal, financial, medical, dementia and therapy issues may be more valuable than handling 1 of those issues for 5 years.
2 to 5 years of experience handling a family member's geriatric planning is very valuable experience. You can become well-versed in understanding how a family will respond to the many issues that arise. If you have been a carer, you may want to volunteer or work in an institution for at least a year before becoming a consultant, in order to better understand the health care system.

, The coursework in this degree features financial planning, legal planning, the physiology of aging, ethnicity and aging, death and bereavement, health policy and practicum. Once you have this diverse training you can be billed as an elder care expert.


If you do not want to get a master's degree in this field, consider finding and taking classes in senior financial planning, legal planning, bereavement, elder health policies and more. You should be able to advise a family on all of these issues to be an elder care consultant.

, Many hospitals, clinics and assisted living facilities are hiring people to advise their patients on senior planning. If you are not ready to start your own consulting business, you can apply for salaried jobs at a health facility.

, You will get access to courses, industry news and be able to list your services on their site. Anything you can do to give your practice more professionalism will be helpful to your business.

, Once you have all the credentials and applicable experience, you can start up a website, home or outside office and begin offering people services. The following things should be considered when starting an elder care consultancy:


Create a professional website. This website should be modeled after legal or medical websites, with extra attention given to your services, credentials and appointment scheduling. Consider having a review board where people can give testimonials about your services.
Create connections with local nursing homes, clinics, hospitals and health care professionals. Many facilities cannot afford to hire a geriatric care manager. If they see a family that needs help with elder care issues, a good connection will afford you a referral.
Research competition and price your services accordingly. You may consider giving a free consulting session at first, in order to show people what you can provide in person.
Make customer service your first priority. Most business is likely to come from referrals, from satisfied customers or health care professionals. You will need to ensure you don't over promise, you provide excellent value and you contact the family frequently to encourage these referrals.

Think about what job you want and how advanced you want your career to be.,
Know requirements for your schooling.,
Go into administrative gerontology.,
Be an academic gerontologist.,
Consider a career in applied gerontology.",How to Become a Gerontologist1," This will take some research on your part, because the discipline of gerontology is huge and varied – your options are almost limitless! Ask yourself, “What do I want to do everyday to work with or for the elderly?” If someone has the job you want, ask them about their career path. You can say something like, “What kind of degree did you have to get for this job?” or, “What did you major in?”


Once you have an idea of what kind of job you’d like to have, start to consider how advanced you want your job to be – this will influence how much school you need to do. Try to pinpoint your desired field and level of work responsibility, so you know what degree to pursue.;
, Talk to peers, friends, and people who work in the field to get a good idea of what school or program is a good fit for you. Decide what degree to pursue, and check with the program to see what is required of you to get in. You will probably need a high school diploma or GED to get started, and there may be other requirements. When deciding on a degree, keep in mind generally how much time goes into it:


Getting your Associate’s in a field related to gerontology (nursing, psychology, social work) will likely qualify you to work in entry-level positions.You can usually get an Associate’s degree in 2 years, and programs are available at local Community Colleges.
Most people who become gerontologists get a Bachelor’s degree in psychology, social work, or nursing.Other possible majors are biology, sociology, or a health-related field.Bachelor’s degrees usually take 4 years to earn. Some colleges and universities do offer specific Bachelor’s degrees in gerontology, but it’s not very common – check with your school to see if you can at least minor in it.
To get your Master’s, you have to first complete a Bachelor’s degree and then do another 2 years of school on average. Some colleges and universities offer programs that are dual Bachelor’s and Master’s at the same time, but that varies by school.
Get your Doctorate if you want to do research or teach.A PhD usually takes about 8 years to earn – 4 years getting a Bachelor’s degree, and then another 4 years to obtain your Doctorate. You will also have to write a long thesis paper or do a major project.
Consider a Graduate Certificate if you already have a Master’s degree and are just switching fields.A Graduate Certificate usually takes 1-2 years to get., There are three main branches of gerontology, and choosing one to pursue will give you a good idea of where to start: administrative, academic, and applied. Administrative gerontologists work on programs for the elderly. You can help to plan, enact, and monitor such programs.Be an administrative gerontologist if you’re interested in program development, such as in a care center, nursing home, or hospital.You probably need a Bachelor’s degree to get an entry- to mid-level position such as a Program Coordinator or Case Manager.Getting a Doctorate degree may enable you to work in a high-level position in administration, like Program Director., Gerontology researchers can focus on medical issues, such as diseases that affect older adults, social questions, like how to prevent depression during aging, questions about the physical process of getting older, how having an aging population affects society, and much more.Academic gerontologists might also teach at the university level, and be responsible for writing grant proposals.You may be able to work or intern with a research facility with an Associate’s or Bachelor’s degree, as part of a research team. You may also be able to be a Teacher’s Aide.
With a Master’s degree, you can probably become an Academic Researcher.To be the Principle Researcher on a project, you will likely need a Doctorate degree. With a PhD, you can also teach at a University level., An applied gerontologist, or practitioner, works directly with older adults and interacts with them on a daily basis.You may work in a care center or nursing home helping prepare meals, transporting the elderly, and tending to daily needs.Applied gerontologists can also be nurses, psychiatrists, counselors, or therapists.


You can also be a Senior Advocate, linking older adults to the world by assisting them with health insurance and medical care, helping with paperwork, aiding them in getting jobs or doing volunteer work, and getting them involved in the community and activities.With an Associate’s degree, you can probably get an entry-level position as a Nurse’s Assistant or Healthcare Aide, for example.You will probably need a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree to be a Social Worker.
Get your Master’s degree to get jobs like Program Planner or Geriatric Care Manager.You can also be a Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner in geriatrics with the right Master’s degree.
You’ll need a Doctorate (MD) to be a psychiatrist or Geriatric Doctor.

, Brushing helps remove food and plaque on both natural teeth and dentures. It also helps prevent development of permanent stains.

, If you are having trouble reaching all areas of your mouth when brushing, look into obtaining a special toothbrush that is able to clean hard-to-reach areas. When brushing dentures, use a brush with soft bristles that is specifically designed for cleaning dentures.

, These are the areas where where your toothbrush can’t reach.

, If you wear full or partial dentures, be sure they fit properly and that you are using the correct amount of denture cream. If you experience discomfort, or if you are using more than one tube of denture cream every three weeks, your dentures may not fit properly and should be evaluated. Visit your dentist to see if they need to be adjusted.

, Tell your dentist about any medical conditions, recent operations, allergies, and medications you may be taking, or changes to your medications. This will avoid the potential for adverse interactions with the medications that your dentist may prescribe.

, Check for red, swollen, bleeding gums when you brush. If you have these symptoms, see a dentist; these maybe signs of gingivitis.

, These are signs of oral cancer that should be quickly examined by your dentist.

It's well established that smoking damages nearly every organ of the body and causes many diseases, including all sorts of cardiovascular related problems, which contribute significantly to premature death.Smoking is estimated to increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke due to atherosclerosis by up to 4x compared to non-smokers.Cigarettes contain a variety of toxic compounds that damage blood vessels and poison tissues.


Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States, which is about one in five deaths.Smoking is also the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of the lungs and lung cancer.
Use nicotine patches or gum to help wean yourself off cigarettes.
Try following the mnemonic START to help you get quit:S= Set a quit Date.
T= Tell family and friends that you plan to quit.
A= Anticipate and plan ahead for hard times.

T= Talk to your doctor about smoking cessation

;
, High blood pressure (hypertension) is often referred to as the ""silent killer"" because it doesn't often cause noticeable symptoms until it's too late.High blood pressure puts strain on the heart and damages the insides of arteries over time, which promotes atherosclerosis or clogged arteries. It also promotes stroke and kidney disease. Blood pressure can be reduced with medication, although some people experience significant side effects from it. Natural ways of reducing blood pressure include losing weight if you are overweight, eating a healthy diet based on lots of fresh produce, cutting back on salt (sodium) consumption, daily exercise and controlling your stress via meditation, deep breathing techniques, yoga and/or tai chi.


Hypertension is defined as having blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg on a regular basis.
The DASH diet is often recommended for hypertension and it emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, lean fish and low-fat dairy foods.
Get plenty of potassium, which can help prevent and control hypertension, but limit your sodium intake to less than 1,500 mg daily., Although eating fat, even saturated fat, is healthy in moderation — after all, fatty acids are needed to make all cell membranes in the body — too much ""bad fat"" is damaging to cardiovascular health. Although saturated fat (the kind found in animal products) is often touted as unhealthy, the kind that really causes problems is trans fat, which is an artificially made hydrogenated vegetable oil found in most fried foods, margarine, cookies and chips.Trans fats raises the ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and lowers the ""good"" HDL cholesterol in your blood, which increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.


Normal total cholesterol levels in the blood should be less than 200 mg/dL.
LDL cholesterol should be less than 100 mg/dL, whereas HDL levels should be above 60 mg/dL for optimal protection against cardiovascular disease.The healthiest fats are often considered to be monounsaturated and polyunsaturated plant-based fats. Foods rich in polyunsaturated fat include safflower, sesame and sunflower seeds, corn oil and soybeans; whereas great sources of monounsaturated fat include avocados, canola, olive and peanut oils., Another important factor in reducing your risk of dying prematurely from cardiovascular disease is getting regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight.Obesity puts lots of strain on the heart and blood vessels, which leads to dysfunction eventually. Only 30 minutes of mild-to-moderate cardiovascular exercise each day on a regular basis is linked to better health and longevity, as it can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as trigger gradual weight loss.Start with walking around your neighborhood, if weather permits, then transition to more difficult terrain, tread mills and/or cycling.


Avoid vigorous exercise to start with, or if you have a known heart condition. Vigorous exercise (such as marathon running) temporarily increases blood pressure and strain on the heart, which may trigger a heart attack.
Thirty minutes of daily exercise is good for your health and an hour is even better, but much beyond that amount isn't proven to be significantly more beneficial.
Recommendations for exercise include the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition.These recommendation include doing 150 minutes (2 ½ hours) of moderate intensity exercise every week. Types of moderate intensity exercise include ballroom dancing, biking slowly, gardening, using your manual wheelchair, walking, and water aerobics. More vigorous activities are biking up hills, basketball, swimming laps, and running.

, Based on extensive research, there is a strong association between alcohol drinking and several types of cancer, especially of the mouth, throat, breast, liver and large intestine.Ethanol, the type of alcohol commonly consumed, is a known human carcinogen. In essence, the more alcohol a person consumes regularly over time, the higher the risk of developing cancer and dying prematurely. As such, either stop drinking alcohol or limit your consumption to no more than one alcoholic beverage in a 24-hour period. Alcohol is known to ""thin"" the blood, which can be helpful for reducing the risk of atherosclerosis, but the net effect of ethanol on health is clearly negative.


The least harmful alcoholic beverage is thought to be red wine because of its antioxidants (resveratrol); however, human research does not provide evidence that resveratrol is effective in preventing or treating cancers.A significant proportion of people who regularly consume alcohol also habitually smoke tobacco. Smoking is a leading cause of many cancers, but the risks greatly increase when combined with drinking alcohol, particularly for cancers of the mouth, throat and esophagus., Antioxidants are compounds (mostly from plants, fruits and veggies) that prohibit or even prevent the oxidation of other molecules in the body.While oxygen is obviously needed in the body, oxidation of certain compounds is often a bad thing because it produces havoc-wreaking ""free radicals,"" which can damage surrounding tissue and even alter its DNA. Consequently, free radicals are linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease and premature aging. Preservatives, which are found in almost all prepared foods found on the shelves of grocery stores, are also damaging to the body due to free radical formation and general toxicity. As such, focusing on consuming lots of antioxidants is a good strategy to prevent cancer.


Compounds that act as strong antioxidants include vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, selenium, glutathione, coenzyme Q10, lipoic acid, flavonoids and phenols, among many others.Foods particularly rich in antioxidants include: all dark colored berries, strawberries, apples, cherries, artichokes, kidney beans and pinto beans.
Other foods considered protective against cancer include broccoli, tomatoes, walnuts and garlic.

, Sun exposure is needed for all life to thrive, but overdoing it (especially if you're constantly getting sunburned) dramatically increases the risk of skin cancer. In moderate amounts, particularly during the summer months, sunlight triggers vitamin D production in the skin, which has many known benefits including stimulating immunity and regulating mood; however, the ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight (also in many tanning beds) damages skin cells, sometimes on a DNA level, which leads to mutations and cancer development. As such, don't avoid the sun, but limit your direct exposure to no more than an hour per day. If you plan on being outside longer, then cover-up with a hat and light-weight breathable cotton clothes, or use natural forms of sunblock and sunscreen.


The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a sunscreen that is SPF 30 or greater with broad spectrum coverage for UVA and UVB rays. If you are outside or at the pool make sure that the sunscreen is water resistant.
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer, accounting for about 3.5 million cases a year in the U.S.Basal and squamous cell skin cancers are most common, but melanoma is the most deadly.
Major risk factors for skin cancer include: pale skin, severe sunburns in the past, many or unusual looking moles, older age and weakened immune systems.
Chronic exposure to coal tar, paraffin, and most hydrocarbon-based products also commonly cause skin cancer.

, Fatal accidents are another common cause of premature death in the U.S., with motor vehicle crashes leading to about 2.2 million Americans being treated in ER departments in 2012.Although modern air bags are a great safety feature and contribute to saving lives, seat belts are still considered an essential injury prevention tool because they prevent people from being thrown from their vehicles. It's estimated that seat belt use reduces serious crash-related injuries and deaths by about 50%.As such, buckle up every time you enter a vehicle if you want to reduce the risk of premature death from injury.


Teenagers between the ages of 13–20 years are the least likely group to wear seat belts, and therefore, tend to suffer more fatal injuries.
Men are about 10% less likely to wear seat belts compared to women.
Another way of reducing fatal injuries in car accidents is to drive a large vehicle because they tend to ride higher and are heavier, which are both protective factors.

, Another simple way of preventing fatal trauma, particularly to the head, is wearing a helmet while on a motorcycle or bicycle. In 2010, about 42% of motorcyclists who were fatally injured were not wearing helmets.In that same year, it's estimated that helmets saved over 1,500 riders’ lives, but some states don't require their use so some riders prefer to legally go without. The human skull feels pretty strong, but the brain is very susceptible to injury because it bounces around inside the skull in response to trauma. High speeds or severe impacts are not needed to damage the brain and cause death. This explains why bicyclists can die from head injuries, but rarely anything else. Helmets don't protect from whiplash-like trauma, but they are great at deflecting or dispersing blunt trauma.


On average, U.S. states with universal helmet laws save eight times more riders’ lives each year compared to states without any helmet laws.It's not enough just to wear a helmet — make sure it's fastened tightly to your head.

, It should be clear that drinking alcohol does not mix with driving a car or operating heavy equipment, yet many people continue to do it because alcohol distorts a person's judgement and ability to think clearly. In the U.S., an estimated 32% of fatal car accidents involve an intoxicated driver (or pedestrian).In addition to poor judgement, driving intoxicated is dangerous because alcohol reduces reaction times, decision making and coordination.


Approximately 13,000 Americans are killed each year in alcohol-related accidents.All U.S. states have adopted .08% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level as the legal limit for driving a car (aged 21 years or older), although most accidents occur with .10% BAC levels.
In addition to not drinking, avoid talking on a cell phone or texting while driving (even with a hands-free set) as it takes your attention off the road.

, Another combination that doesn't mix is drinking alcohol while taking drugs (illicit, prescription or even over-the-counter types). The by-products of alcohol and all drugs are metabolized in the liver, and sometimes when certain compounds are mixed together a toxic reaction occurs that can severely injure or completely shut down the liver, leading quickly to death. As little as a couple of pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, mixed with a glass a wine can potentially lead to liver failure. In addition, combining alcohol with drugs often leads to dramatic changes in perception, behavior, mood, breathing rate, blood pressure and other parameters, which can all increase the risk of dying prematurely.As such, never combine the two at the same time.


It takes hours for most drugs to be processed by the liver, so make sure to time the addition of alcohol safely — at least three hours later as a general rule and sometimes as long as six hours.
Sometimes drugs are taken because of the effects of alcohol (such as an aspirin for a hangover-type headache). Thus, quitting drinking may remove the need to take certain medications altogether.

Addiction related problems.
High-blood pressure.
Depression.
Anxiety.
Obesity.
Cancer.;
, Schedule regular times to do things that attend to your needs and no one else's. Since you as a caregiver are at risk for many serious health conditions, schedule regular times to exercise, visit your doctor, and take breaks.It's easy to put yourself last when there are so many other competing responsibilities, so go ahead and make a list of folks who can come to provide some relief from your care giving duties, including friends, family, and paid help.Note times when each are available and tasks that they are comfortable performing, so you can maximize your self-care time.

, You need to let folks know what you will and won't do. This goes for work and for your dependent, since they both demand so much of your time.Tell your employer what times you are available and what times you aren't. Make it clear to them that if they call you when you aren't available, they won't get an answer.
Let your dependent (or your co-caretaker) know that in order to be the most effective caretaker that you can be, you need time to recuperate and you need time to work. One person can't be everything for everyone, and although there might be some adjustment, they will understand that sooner or later.

, The circumstances which accompany the assumption of care giving responsibilities can be tragic, as with end of life care, or joyous, as with the birth of a child. While you don't have to share every detail about your caregiving experience with your employers, it helps to let people know what's going on.Your employers are people too, and they have the same human sympathies that we all have. If they know what types of extenuating circumstances are happening with your dependent, they are more likely to be understanding if you come in on Mondays a little less rested than you used to be.

, Although this is one of the easiest steps to overlook, it can also be one of the most beneficial. Make a list of daily responsibilities, weekly responsibilities, and monthly or irregular responsibilities.Daily responsibilities include things like dressing, feeding, or cooking dinner for a loved one. You may even have to do some or all of the driving for your loved one.
Weekly responsibilities include grocery shopping, doing laundry, and paying bills.
Monthly responsibilities and irregular responsibilities include doctor’s visits, filling prescriptions, or physical therapy.

, Even if you are the only regular caretaker for your dependent, other people can often help. Look to your siblings, your spouse, and neighbors for help with irregular tasks or regular task that require minimal effort.


For example, if you take care of a parent, a nearby sibling might be able to give rides, while a distant sibling could help manage other responsibilities, like scheduling doctor’s visits, filling prescriptions, or paying bills.

, With a booming elderly population, caregiving by loved ones and family members is becoming much more common. However, many in-home care assistants can be employed on a part time basis, so be sure to investigate those options locally.


Look for adult day care centers in your community, or senior centers that have day programs. These can be relatively affordable and can take a lot off your plate.
Don’t forget about neighbors. They can be an extremely helpful resource that costs little or nothing. Ask neighbors whether they would be willing to pick up prescriptions, call or visit to give reminders to take medications, or even just check in. They can help you not rely on outside services for many things. However, you should only make these arrangements with reliable people so that you can depend on them fully to follow through with the arrangement.

, Start with your employee handbook. Many employers offer benefits plans and services that go above and beyond what is legally required for them to offer. Take a diligent accounting of any type of benefit that might better help you to manage your caregiving and work responsibilities. These include:


Flex-time. Flex-time policies often allow employees to use sick leave to care for others, split shifts, Or work longer hours from home. Some companies even offer leave sharing, where employees can donate unused leave time to other employees Some employers offer “cafeteria style” employee benefits, which allow employees to select different benefits based on their individual needs.For example, your employer may allow you to tack on supplemental dependent care coverage to reimburse costs for different types of health care..
An even larger share of employers offer Employee Assistance Programs, which help employees locate suitable care outlets within their own communities.

, All public-sector employees and private-sector employees in the US who work for a company which employs 50 or more people within 75 miles of your worksite must offer Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) benefits. Each employee who works for a covered employer for at least 1250 hours in a 12 month period is eligible to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in order to care for themselves or a dependent with a serious condition.Some states mandate that employers offer Paid Family Leave, or PFL, which is similar to the leave offered nationwide under the FMLA, except that it is paid rather than unpaid.The specifics of each state’s PFL policy will be different, so be sure to research the laws in your jurisdiction.
The Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, prohibits job discrimination based on the caregiving responsibilities that an employee may have. This is applicable in all 50 US states., Once you are aware of your employer-based benefits and legal rights, speak with your supervisor or HR manager about which policies are right for you, and which you intend to take advantage of.

, In order to make a long-term plan, you need to do your best to anticipate what may come in the future. This means thinking dispassionately about the future progression of your dependent’s condition.


Ask yourself if the condition is likely to worsen, and to what degree it is likely to worsen. Do your own research to find out what the worst-case scenario for the progression of the condition is, and how likely it is that the worst-case scenario will come to pass, but also be sure to consult with your dependent's doctor.

, As best you can, plan for the worst case scenario. Ask yourself how it will affect you, your family, and your relationship with your employer. Take into account:


What the financial impact of a worst-case scenario will be. Decide if that impact is a burden you can shoulder, and if not, what you can do to mitigate the financial burden. Try to develop contingency plans for worst, intermediate, and best-case scenarios.
Ask yourself how your employer is likely to respond to your worst-case scenario. Do the benefits at your current job cover you in the event that you will have to act on the worst possible outcome? If not, investigate how you can respond accordingly. Look for outside insurance policies that might cover long-term care. If that is financially out of reach, see what you can do to find an employer who can offer you the benefits package you need.Strained familial relationships. If you forecast that an intensive-care situation is likely or inevitable, make a plan for how you can help compensate for the lost time with your other family members. Your family needs to be your support, and not your antagonists. Set special time aside for your other family members to insure that those relationships stay strong. , Once you have evaluated the likely course of your dependent’s condition and their treatment regimen, planned for the worst-case scenarios financially, filially, and with your employer, see what you can do to find long-term treatment options in your area. You can make a much stronger treatment plan when you have taken stock of outside resources.For example, you may have a preference that your dependent receive in-home care right now, and you may be able to afford it. However, if your long term forecast suggests that your dependent is likely to need much more intensive care in the future which you will not be able to afford, an adult-day care or a care at a local senior center might be the best way to save money now so you have it in the future.
Be on the lookout for resources like adult day centers, informal arrangements, Meals-on-Wheels, in-home care subsidized through Medicare and/or Medicaid, geriatric care managers, and free transportation programs. You can find a listing of these kinds of resources at the National Eldercare Locator, at http://www.eldercare.gov/Eldercare.NET/Public/Index.aspx and at the Caregiver’s Alliance, located at: https://www.caregiver.org/family-care-navigator."

Get a job in gerontology.,
Join a professional organization.,
Seek out continuing education opportunities to stay current.,
Gain experience with an internship.,
Volunteer your services with agencies in the field.",How to Become a Gerontologist2," There’s no single right way to get the job you want in gerontology, since the field is so varied. If you know someone with the job that you want, talk to them about where they went to school, what they majored in, what degree they have, and if they have any suggestions for pursuing a job like theirs. Look on job websites like Indeed.com or CareerBuilder. Check with local hospitals, nursing homes, or care centers to see if they have job postings.


Often the university you go to will offer career services for alumni.
Join a professional organization to network and have access to their career services, as well.
Take advantage of gerontology newsletters, which often contain job postings.

, Professional organizations offer opportunities for more training and education, credentials for getting better and higher paying jobs, and the access to publications and resources pertinent to the field of gerontology.


The largest gerontology association in the United States is the Gerontological Society of America (GSA). National Conferences for gerontologists are held annually through this organization. Membership costs $185 yearly and you get access to online publications, career services, and other professional help. Gerontology students get a reduced membership rate ($87) to join GSA and have access to mentoring, networking and career services.The National Association for Professional Gerontologists (NAPG) offers continuing education courses for members. Credentials are renewed biannually with the completion of 20 hours of approved activities such as presentations, meetings, conferences or classes.You can also find professional organizations by your specific field in gerontology, like the National Gerontological Nursing Association (NGNA) or the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), or by your region, such as the Oregon Gerontology Association or the Massachusetts Gerontology Association (MGA).

, Continuing education is a popular option for students looking for just a few specific classes on a given topic in gerontology. It's less expensive than a certificate or other full-program in gerontology, and you get to take only the classes that apply for the job you want. Once you graduate and have a job, many positions may request or require that you obtain continuing education in order to stay current with training.


You can likely get these through your professional organization.

, Often required in educational programs, these opportunities can sometimes lead to permanent employment. You can also seek out internships before you start school to help you decide which field you’re interested in, or once you graduate to trial different realms of gerontology. Most internships are unpaid but can be great learning opportunities.

, Not only can volunteer work lead to paid positions, it can also provide valuable networking opportunities for your job search. Even if you’re already working in the field, you can gain knowledge about other realms of gerontology while contributing to society.


These agencies can include your local state department of aging, housing agencies for low-income senior citizens, and wellness centers for the elderly. You can also volunteer at retirement homes, senior centers, and geriatric offices.
As a student, you can also check into the possibility of volunteering for a faculty member's research projects to gain experience and knowledge.

Consider in-home care.,
Negotiate long-term care costs.,
Relocate your loved one.,
Qualify for a Reverse Mortgage.",How to Finance Nursing Home Care1," Long-term nursing home care costs between $6,000 and 9,000 a month and many people cannot afford this option. To save money, you may want to consider in-home care, which costs approximately $21 an hour for a care assistant. This option is not only less expensive but it allows your elderly or disabled family member to reside in his or her home for as long as possible., If you are paying out-of-pocket for long-term nursing care, you should negotiate the overall cost with the nursing home. While some nursing homes may refuse to negotiate, others would prefer to take a lower private care rate because it still pays more than state-sponsored Medicaid programs. , The cost of nursing home care varies greatly from state to state and even from locality to locality. If your loved one has family members who live in different states, you should determine which state has the lowest cost for nursing home care. Nursing home care in Texas, Utah and Alabama can cost less than half of nursing home care in states in the Northeast., A reverse mortgage is a loan that a homeowner gets from a bank against the value of their home. The loan converts the home's equity into cash and the homeowner receives either a cash sum, regular payments, or a line of credit equal to the equity in the home. After the owner's death, the bank may foreclose on the home (get ownership without further liability to the home owner) or members of the estate may sell the home and pay off the loan.In order to qualify for a reverse mortgage, each homeowner must be at least 62 years old and live in the home where the reverse mortgage was taken.A reverse mortgage may be a good solution if you are in good health. You can use the proceeds from the reverse mortgage to pay for long-term care insurance or to make your home more accessible so that you can remain in the house as long as possible.
If you are in need of care but do not require nursing home care yet, you can use a reverse mortgage to pay for in-home caregiver services. This provides seniors with the ability to stay in their home for a fraction of the cost of a nursing home.
If you are a married couple and one of you need nursing home care, a reverse mortgage can pay for nursing home care and allow the healthy spouse to remain in the family home. If the spouse needing care dies, the surviving spouse can stay in the home so long as they can continue to pay for property taxes and insurance."

Apply soap and lather your hands by rubbing them together. Be sure to cover all parts of your hands, including the backs, between your fingers, and your fingernails.
Scrub your hands for 20 seconds. Popular timekeeping tricks are humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice, or singing the ABC's.
Rinse your hands under clean, running water. Make sure to avoid touching the faucet with your hands when you turn the water off, if you can. Use your forearm or elbow instead.
Dry your hands with a clean, dry towel or allow them to air dry.
If soap and water is unavailable, use hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. Apply the amount suggested by the label to your hands and rub them until they are dry.;
, If you're suffering from a minor cut or scrape, bleeding should be minimal and stop on its own. If not, you can elevate the wound and apply light pressure with a sterile bandage until the bleeding stops.If the wound continues bleeding after 10 minutes, seek medical help. Your cut may be more serious than you originally thought.
If the blood flow is profuse or spurting, you may have a severed artery. This is a medical emergency and you should go to the hospital or call emergency services immediately. Common places for severed arteries are the inside of the thigh, the inside of the upper arm, and the neck.To perform first aid on a spurting cut while you wait for emergency services to arrive, apply a pressure bandage. Cover your wound with a rolling bandage or cloth and wrap it firmly around the wound. Don’t wrap so tightly that you cut off circulation, though. Seek medical help immediately., To avoid infection, you'll have to remove as much debris and bacteria as possible. Do this before applying any kind of bandage to avoid trapping bacteria in the wound.Rinse the wound under clean water. The running water should remove much of the debris that may be in the wound.
Wash around the wound with soap. Avoid getting soap directly into the cut- this can cause irritation and inflammation.
If debris remains in the wound after rinsing, use tweezers cleaned with alcohol to remove it.
See your doctor if there is more dirt or debris that you can't get out.

, These products will help keep the wound free of infection and prevent complications that could hamper the healing process. Brands like Bacitracin, Neosporin, and Eucerin are easily available at drug stores in the first aid aisle.Be sure to check the labels of these products before using them to ensure that you aren't allergic to any of the ingredients.
If a rash or irritation occurs, stop use and contact your doctor.
If you do not have antibacterial or antibiotic cream, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly. This will help form a barrier between the wound and bacteria.

, Leaving your cut uncovered will attract dirt and bacteria to it and could lead to infection. Use a sterile, nonstick bandage or band-aid to cover the cut. Make sure that the dressing you are using fully covers the wound.If no bandages are readily available, you can cover the wound with a clean tissue or paper towel until you get a hold of a proper bandage.
For very shallow cuts that are not bleeding heavily, you may use liquid skin bandage. This product helps seal the wound against infection and is usually water-resistant for several days. Apply this product directly to the skin after cleaning and drying the wound., Superficial cuts probably won't need medical attention unless you get an infection. There are a number of circumstances, however, where you should seek appropriate medical care after cleaning and dressing the wound. If any of the following applies to you or your wound, waste no time in getting to the doctor or hospital.


The cut is on a child less than one year old. Any cut on an infant less than a year old should receive medical attention to make sure no infection or scarring occurs.The wound is deep. A cut that goes 0.25” or more into the skin is considered a deep wound. In a very deep cut you may see fat, muscle, or bone exposed. These wounds will usually need stitches to heal properly and prevent infection.The wound is long. A cut that is longer than 0.5” will likely need stitches.The wound is very dirty or has debris that you cannot remove. To prevent infection, you should seek medical attention if you cannot fully clean the wound.
The wound is on a joint and gapes open when the joint is moved. This kind of wound will also require stitches to close properly.The cut keeps bleeding after 10 minutes of direct pressure. This could signify that the cut has struck a vein or artery. You'll need medical attention to treat this wound..The wound came from an animal. Unless you are aware of the animal's immunization history, there is a risk of rabies. The wound will need to be thoroughly cleaned and you may need a round of rabies shots to prevent the disease.You have diabetes. Diabetics are prone to wound complications due to poor circulation and nerve performance. Small cuts can get seriously infected or take a long time to heal. If you are diabetic, you should always see a doctor if you receive a cut of any size.It has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot. While doctors recommend tetanus shots every 10 years, boosters are often given if you receive a deep puncture wound, a laceration from an animal bite, or any cut from a rusty piece of metal. See your doctor if it's been more than 5 years since your last shot to decrease your risk of contracting tetanus.The cut is on your face. Stitches or other treatments may be beneficial to help cosmetic healing., Blood and bacteria from your cut will soil the old bandage, and it needs to be changed at least once a day to avoid infection. Also change the bandage anytime it gets wet or dirty., Even though cleaning your wound thoroughly and keeping it covered helps prevent infections, they can still occur. Keep an eye out for these signs and talk to your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms.Increased pain around the area.
Redness, swelling, or warmth around the cut.
Drainage of pus from the wound.
A foul smell.
A fever of 100 degrees or more for over 4 hours.

, Cuts usually take 3-7 days to heal, or up to 2 weeks for more serious wounds. If your wound is taking too long to heal, there may be an infection or some other problem. If a week has gone by and your wound doesn't seem to be healing, see your doctor., Antibiotic ointment isn't only useful for preventing infections- it also helps lock moisture into the cut. This is beneficial because dry wounds heal more slowly, so moisture will expedite healing. Apply ointment every time you wrap the wound. Even when you've stopped covering the cut, apply a dab of ointment to lock in moisture and help the healing process., Scabs sometimes form over cuts or scrapes. These help protect the area while it heals. Accordingly, you shouldn't pick at scabs or try to remove them. This will uncover the cut and your body will have to start healing itself all over again, slowing the healing process.Scabs sometimes get rubbed off accidentally and the cut starts bleeding again. If this happens, clean and dress it like any other cut.

, While we're often told that ripping band-aids off quickly is best, this can actually make your wound heal slower. Pulling a band-aid off too fast can rip scabs and reopen wounds, setting back the healing process. Instead, peel the band-aid off slowly. To help make this easier, you can soak the area in warm water to loosen the band-aid and make removal less painful., Alcohol, peroxide, iodine, and harsh soaps irritate and inflame the wound, which can slow the healing process and even cause scarring. For minor cuts and scrapes, all you need is clean water, mild soap, and antibiotic ointment., The body repairs itself while sleeping. If you don't sleep enough, the wound can take much longer to heal. Sleep is also essential for a healthy immune system to prevent infections while your wound heals. Commit to getting a full night's sleep to help your wound heal quickly and efficiently., Protein is a necessary ingredient for skin and tissue growth. Eating 2 to 3 servings per day will stimulate wound healing. Some good sources of protein are:Meats and poultry
Beans
Eggs
Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt, especially Greek yogurt
Soy protein products

, Fats are needed for the formation of cells, so you'll need plenty to make your wound heal quickly and efficiently. Make sure the fats you're getting are polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, or ""good fats."" Saturated fats from junk foods won't help you heal and can cause other health problems.Sources of ""good fats"" that will help you heal are lean meats, vegetable oils such as sunflower or olive, and dairy products., Carbohydrates are important because your body uses them for energy. Without them, your body will break down nutrients like protein to get its energy. This can slow the healing process because protein and fats will be diverted from healing your wound. Prevent this by eating cereal, bread, rice, and pasta daily.Go for complex carbohydrates over simple carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly by your body, meaning they are less likely to spike your blood sugar. Foods containing complex carbs, such as whole grain breads, cereals, and pastas, sweet potatoes, and whole oats, also generally contain more fiber and protein., They also fight infection while the cut is still healing.Sources of vitamin A include sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots, herring, salmon, eggs, and dairy products.
Sources of vitamin C include oranges, yellow peppers, dark green vegetables, and berries.

, Zinc helps synthesize proteins and develop collagen, helping your wounds heal. Eat red meats, fortified cereals, and shellfish to get enough zinc in your diet., Keep your fluid intake up to help improve circulation, which bring essential nutrients to your wound. Water also helps your body flush out toxins, which will help prevent infection."

Determine whether you qualify for Medicaid.,
Qualify for Medicaid.,
Reduce your assets.,
Set up a Medicaid Asset Trust.",How to Finance Nursing Home Care2," Medicaid is a state and federal government program that assists low-income individuals with a variety of medical care, including nursing home care. You can only qualify for Medicaid if you fall below the monthly income and asset limits set by your state.You can determine whether you meet the eligibility requirements for your state at: https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/getting-medicaid-chip/

If you qualify for Medicaid, you can apply online at https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/getting-medicaid-chip/ or check the website for the address of your state Medicaid office and apply in person.

, If your assets are currently too high to qualify for Medicaid and you want to protect your personal assets from nursing home expenses, you can consider legally reducing your assets in order to qualify for Medicaid.


Before attempting to reduce or transfer your assets, you should speak with an elder law attorney. Medicaid has very strict rules about what assets can be transferred and what purchases are allowable to reduce your income. If you improperly reduce your assets, Medicaid can penalize you for months to years and prohibit your qualification for the program.The National Association of Elder Law Attorneys has information about elder law specialists on its website at: https://www.naela.org. The American Bar Association also provides attorney referral information at: http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/findlegalhelp/home.cfm.

, In order to qualify for Medicaid, you can reduce your assets by:


Paying off debt, such as a mortgage, student loans or credit cards;
Paying for in-home medical care;
Paying for necessary home repairs, such as a new roof or furnace; Transfer funds to your spouse for his or her benefit; or
Transfer funds or set up a trust for your blind or disabled child or for a disabled person under the age of 65., With a Medicaid Asset Trust, you transfer all of your assets into a trust and give up control over those assets. Any funds placed in the trust do not count towards the Medicaid asset limits. However, if you transfer funds into the trust within 5 years of applying for Medicaid, you may be subject to Medicaid’s “lookback provision.” Under this provision, Medicaid may penalize any person that it determines conducted a non-exempt transfer under the Medicaid regulations. If you are penalized, you may not be able to qualify for Medicaid for months or even years."
"
Purchase long-term health insurance.,
Cash in your life insurance.,
Check Medicare benefits.",How to Finance Nursing Home Care3," Unlike regular health insurance, long-term health insurance is designed to pay for long-term care, which may include nursing home care, in-home care or medical equipment. When evaluating long-term health insurance polices, you should carefully select a policy that covers nursing home care if you reasonably believe that you will not have someone to care for you at home should you fall ill and become unable to care for yourself.It is best to acquire long-term health insurance when you are younger and in good health. As you get older, long-term health insurance becomes much more expensive and many seniors are either unable to afford or qualify for a policy., Another way to pay for nursing home care is to cash in your whole life insurance policy. Certain policies allow policyholders to cash in their insurance policy for 50 to 75 percent of the face value of the policy.


Keep in mind that this is only an option for whole life policies, not term life policies where there is no cash value.
Depending on your individual life insurance policy, there are two ways that you can cash in your policy: accelerated benefit or life settlement.
If you qualify for an accelerated benefit, the insurance company will pay between 60 and 80 percent of the face value of the policy. Under certain policies, you may have to be suffering from a terminal illness in order to qualify for an accelerated benefit.
A life settlement is a policy payout that you negotiate with an outside company not the insurance company that issued the policy. These settlement companies look at the value of your policy, your age, and your health and pay you between 40 and 75 percent of the face value of the policy. Depending on the health and age of an individual, it may be possible to sell some term policies.
Before negotiating a life settlement, you should speak with an elder law attorney as there may be tax and Medicaid implications from receiving the proceeds of the policy through a settlement company. , While Medicare does not pay the cost of long-term nursing home care, you may qualify for a certain portion of the stay if you were transferred to a nursing home within several days of a hospital stay and you require skilled nursing or rehabilitative care. If you go to a Medicare-approved facility, your stay may be covered for up to 100 days.


Medicare will also pay for in-home care for a certain period as well. This coverage may help if you are trying to reduce assets or do not physically require full nursing-home care. "

Wear sunscreen.,
Develop a skin-care regimen.,
Stop smoking.,
Plan for life after retirement.",How to Age Gracefully1," All the time. You've heard it so many times that it seems clichéd, but it's true: protecting your skin from the sun is absolutely essential to looking and feeling good as you get older. Studies have shown that roughly 90% of skin problems associated with aging (wrinkles, blotchiness, dryness, sagging) are cause by sun damage.Apply sunscreen every single day, even when it's overcast and cloudy.To maximize protection, look for broad spectrum, waterproof sunscreens with a minimum SPF 30.You can buy moisturizers or even makeup with SPF. Make sure it's broad spectrum and at least SPF 30.Find a cute, wide-brimmed hat to help shade your face from the sun.
Prevention is key: it is much easier to take a few seconds every day and apply sunscreen than it is to try and undo a lifetime of skin damage when you're older.;
, Maintaining healthy skin well into old age requires more than just staying out of the sun. Moisturize your skin daily. Wash your face twice a day with warm water and a mild cleanser (soap can be harsh and dry out your skin).If you supplement your skin care ritual with anti-aging products, look for products created for your skin type (dry, oily, sensitive), that are hypoallergenic, and doesn't cause acne (non-comedogenic or non-acnegenic).Don't assume the most expensive product is also the most effective. There are plenty of affordable anti-aging products that work just as well or better than the ones that break the bank.Exfoliate twice a week to remove dead skin cells. Don't scrub your face when you do this--use a gentle, circular motion with your fingers.Use an eye cream or serum to tighten and de-puff the delicate skin around your eyes. Be careful not to pull on this skin--gently work it into your skin with the tips of your fingers.Don't forget the skin on your lips. Use a moisturizing lip balm with SPF.See a dermatologist for professional advice on how to best care for your skin., Smoking actually speeds up the aging process by depriving your skin of oxygen and essential vitamins which leads to premature wrinkles.It also damages collagen and elastin, causing your skin to sag.Smoking is linked to serious health problems that can shorten and impair your life, like heart disease, lung disease, and cancer.

, It is easy to let your work define you, but what happens when you finally retire? To prevent withdrawing and becoming depressed, inactive, and disconnected from others, think about meaningful ways to fill your golden years. You can focus on whatever passions and interests took a back-seat to your job.Consider traveling, spending time with family, developing your spiritual life, and discovering new interests that will keep you engaged and challenged."
"
Embrace your age.,
Stop stressing.,
Be optimistic.",How to Age Gracefully2," Aging gracefully is not about trying to recapture your 20's or look like a teenager. People who age gracefully accept that the aging process is natural and normal. They take pride in the fact that they're survivors. They don't apologize for their age: they own it., Stress can make you look ten years older.Stress can impair your immune systemand lead to depression, anxiety, weight gain, heart disease, digestive problems, and more.Stress is also unavoidable. The key is to reduce stress where you can--like agonizing over the aging process--


Holding on to hurt feelings and harboring grudges can be a major cause of stress, leading to emotional and physical problems. Work on practicing empathy and healing those old wounds so you can make the most of today.Meditation can greatly reduce stress and anxiety. Take a class or just practice breathing on your own to experience the benefits., Having a positive attitude is linked to longevity and better physical and mental health.Those who age with optimism (not getting angry or obsessing about the process, but accepting it as natural and fine) are less likely to need assisted living and can stay independent longer."
"
Exercise moderately and consistently.,
Eat a healthy diet that supports your goals and lifestyle.,
Turn off the TV.,
Take care of your teeth.",How to Age Gracefully3," Exercise is one of the most important factors in staying healthy as you age--both for your body and your mind. You don't have to run marathons or climb mountains--simply walking for 20-30 minutes a day can benefit your heart, help you lose weight, strengthen your bones, keep your mind sharp, prevent constipation, increase blood flow, and much more., Look for diets that are low in sugar and rich in vitamins. As we age, our bodies can have trouble creating essential vitamins or we may begin needing more vitamins to maintain our health.Vitamin E is found in nuts and seeds, leafy greens, and vegetable oils. It repairs free radicals that damage your cells and can lower your risk of stroke and heart attack.Vitamin C repairs free radicals and increases Vitamin E production. It can also repair collagen and may reduce your odds of developing cancer, cataracts, and cardiovascular disease. Get your dose from citrus and potatoes.Vitamin D helps maintain healthy bones and we need more as we get older. You can get Vitamin D from the sun, but if you need to stay in the shade, you can get it from milk and yogurt., Studies have found that watching excessive amounts of TV can be just as harmful to your health as smoking or lack of exercise and can actually shave years off your life.You don't necessarily have to jump off the couch and onto the treadmill: simply going from inactive (sitting and watching TV) to slightly active (getting up off the couch and doing something else) can make a positive impact on your health., Neglecting your teeth and gums can have dire consequences. A receding gum line or dry mouth can increase chances of decay and infection, which can spread if untreated. Cavities and gum disease can even cause your teeth to fall out. Keep up with dentist appointments, and continue to floss and brush.False teeth should be cleaned and maintained with just as much care. Your mouth may change shape as you age, so be sure to have your dentures refitted if necessary."
"
Stay social.,
Challenge your mind with novel experiences.,
Get a good night's sleep.",How to Age Gracefully4," Not only will it help prevent isolation and depression, remaining social and engaging with others can actually keep your mind nimble.Keeping up with a conversation and formulating responses makes your brain work and keeps neural connections from weakening.It's not enough to just go to activities and events. Actively cultivate relationships new and old to reap the emotional and mental rewards., The more you test and push the limits of your brain, the better it performs.A new experience in particular causes your brain to create new neural pathways and strengthen old connections. Without use, those pathways degenerate and connections are lost.


Even slight changes--like taking a different route while driving, trying a new cooking technique with a favorite recipe, or using your less dominant hand to do something--can have a positive effect.

, As people age, they can have more difficulty falling or staying asleep. Lack of or poor sleep can lead to depression and, difficulty making and recalling memories, and impair judgment .Try to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night."
"
Wear minimal make up.,
Don't go overboard with surgery.,
Stay fabulous.",How to Age Gracefully5," Though you may be feeling the pressure to hide your wrinkles under powder and foundation, these products will actually make lines more obvious.The idea isn't to disguise your age with tons of makeup and product, but rather to enhance your best features and minimize the less flattering. You should accept your wrinkles, but you don't have to highlight them.Instead of applying blush to the apples of the cheeks, apply to the highest point of your cheekbones and sweep up.Avoid using mascara or liner on your lower eyelid, as this can draw attention to crows feet and dark circles. Curling your lashes and wearing black mascara will make your eyes look larger and the whites whiter.Wear a lip liner to keep your lipstick in place. You can even find invisible liners that do the job without color, so you can use them with any shade of lipstick., There's no shame in nipping and tucking, but part of aging gracefully is to embrace the aging process. If you opt for plastic surgery, don't try (or expect) to look like a 20-year-old. Talk to your surgeon about looking natural and enhancing your individual beauty and character., Do you love your long hair? Keep it long. Do you think your gray hair looks amazing? Don't dye it. Prefer to be blonde? Then dye it! Stay true to who you are and the things that make you feel your best. Remember that getting older doesn't mean you can no longer be fashionable, have interests, be sexual, or experience new adventures. It doesn't mean you have to trade in your heels for fuzzy slippers--unless you want to!

Communicate with your elderly roommate.,
Define boundaries.,
Figure out finances.,
Give the person respect as an individual.,
Give the person privacy.,
Support the older person's autonomy.,
Appreciate their wisdom and life experiences.,
Make sure the house is accessible.,
Keep the house organized and uncluttered.,
Make sure the house has HVAC, telephone, and even an emergency panic system.,
Understand their abilities and limitations.,
Consider the level of assistance you and your family can provide.,
Keep records for them if they are not able to.,
Know what medications they’re taking.,
Help the person with keeping their basic grooming presentable.,
Watch out for scammers and frauds.,
Understand their dietary needs, including sugar or salt intake.",How to Live with an Elderly Person," Communication is the most important element of any relationship. If you don’t communicate, you won’t know each other’s problems and concerns. As a result, you won’t be able to form a relationship that is respecting of both of your unique qualities.;
, Both parties need to define boundaries and come to a mutual agreement about each other’s space, independence, and autonomy. You need to understand what your elderly person is comfortable with when it comes to being assisted or being subtly monitored to make sure they are okay.


Talk to them them about their expectations about your relationship. What do they expect of you in terms of assistance and interaction?
Discuss use of shared space like the bathroom, kitchen, or living room.
Come to an agreement about under what circumstances family or friends will visit.
Discuss use of each other's personal belongings, like dishes, appliances, and even food.

, Figure out who pays for what ahead of time. Having finances decided and agreed upon ahead of time could save you from a headache or even legal fees in the future. Records will make a big difference here, so if you start out knowing who pays for what, and have it written down, you are ahead of the game. Also, consider the following:


Include relatives in discussions about money. If you’re going to be living with an elderly family member, make sure to speak with your other relatives to be transparent about your financial agreement. Be open to their feedback, especially if they will be contributing to the cost. This will help you avoid problems and resentment in the future.
Consider the cost. If you will be covering the cost of your elderly relative, be informed about the costs. One recent study found that caregivers spend about $5,500 per year caring for elderly relatives. Another study concluded that caregivers spent almost $15,000 a year caring for their elderly relative., Avoid treating the person like a child. Older people have experienced life much more deeply than we often appreciate, and have many more life experiences. Ask your elderly person questions about their life, what they think, and what they care about.

, When possible, they should have as much privacy and personal space as it is practical to allow. Don’t turn yourself into a caregiver or a nurse without need or invitation and don't violate their personal space. Always communicate first if you are concerned about your elderly roommate.

, Let him or her make their own choices and do not substitute your own judgement for theirs. Every adult has the capacity to make at least some, if not all, of his or her own decisions, so help enhance the person's capacity to do and choose as much as possible for himself or herself. Don't assume merely because of advanced age that people cannot manage their own affairs, even if you do not agree with them.

, You’re the younger person with less experience. Your elderly roommate probably has wisdom and experience well beyond your own. Talk to them and ask them for guidance on issues that pertain to both of you.

, Depending on the older person’s physical condition, you will need to consider several things in order to make your home accessible.


Install mobility aids if the person needs them. Consider grab bars at the toilet and bath tub. Also consider a shower seat. In addition, consider a wheelchair ramp or an electric wheelchair lift.
Protect the person from the potential dangers of stairs. Think about this if the older person is needs to access any areas that are not on the main level of a home.
Equip your home with handicap accessible features. Is the bathroom big enough to handle a wheelchair or walker if necessary? For a wheelchair, the doorway needs to be at least 32 inches wide, and preferably 36 inches.

, Your house should be organized and uncluttered, especially in a situation where the person has limited mobility, uses a walker, wheelchair, or other mobility assistance, or their eyesight is poor. After all, you want your elderly roommate to be able to move around without tripping or bumping into things.If hoarding is a problem for your elderly housemate, then you may need to discuss this with them and encourage them to find help for their hoarding.

, Heating, ventilation, and a cooling system are extremely important for older people who might have chronic conditions or are more sensitive to the elements. In addition, you should have a telephone and possibly a panic system so that your roommate can call for help or contact emergency response workers if there is some sort of accident.

, As different people have different problems and abilities as they age, you need to quickly determine what kind of abilities and/or assistance they will need. If they have decreased abilities and physical or mental limitations, there are several factors you need to consider:


What is the person's physical and mental condition and what chronic illness does the person have? If so, you need to take these into account and prepare for them.
Is the person of sound mind? If your elderly roommate has or is developing dementia or Alzheimer’s, you need to seriously consider what you are going to do to keep that person safe. Visit the Alzheimer’s Association website at http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp for more information.
Is the person physically able to take care of themselves? If not, make sure the elderly person always has someone around to look after them. If you work outside the home, then the day may come where you have to hire some in-home help to care for the older person., You need to know what help and how much time you can commit to possibly assisting an elderly person that you live with. If you will have to provide a lot of assistance, this may create unanticipated stresses in your life.Be realistic about the level of help your elderly roommate might need. This might increase over time.
Know your limits and your comfort with helping the person with basic things like dressing, bathing, and going to the bathroom.
Think about your schedule. Consider this if you have a full-time career and children., If the person is not a family member, you should have their family’s contact information. If the person is comfortable with this, you should also have their emergency medical information, and know where their important documents are in case of emergency. This way, you'll have all the information you need in the event of an emergency.

, If the person needs the help, familiarize yourself with what medications they take in case there is an accident or medical emergency. Also be aware of drug interaction warnings, and instructions for taking medicine which requires either fasting, or taking with food.

, Often elderly people cannot trim finger and toenails, comb or brush their hair, or put on and tie shoes. This is an important thing in order to make sure someone stays confident and ready to interact with others. If you want, help them if they have trouble, but only if they consent.

, Unfortunately, there are people who take advantage of and prey on older people, including con-men, salespeople, and people claiming to represent religious organizations. Such people will solicit money from older people by taking advantage of their good nature or lack of proper information.


Turning these people away at the door, or simply asking your elderly roommate about their daily interactions over dinner might prevent this. This will not just protect your elderly roommate from financial disaster, but it will also save you a headache in dealing with the repercussions.

, Older people are often on restricted diets, and are tempted just like the rest of us. If your elderly roommate is suffering from memory problems, they might even forget about their own dietary needs. But remember, don't nag or be overly aggressive when it comes to this. Respect their choices, while watching out for their welfare.

If you suspect you or a loved one has suffered a trauma involving the brain, see a doctor immediately. Not only does the potential brain injury demand immediate medical attention, but there may also be multiple other traumatic injuries for which the person should be evaluated. If there's reason for the doctor to be concerned, as with a concussion, or if the injury is severe (resulting in a coma, for example), the patient will likely be admitted to the hospital. Some TBIs will result in surgery, but most of the recovery happens in rehabilitative therapies.TBIs can lead to secondary complications that can be life threatening, such as pneumonia. Always see a doctor to be sure there's no danger or this.
Some TBIs will result in surgery, but most of the recovery happens in rehabilitative therapies.
A patient may be released from the hospital the same day if the TBI is very minor; however, patients in comas or vegetative states may be in a medical facility indefinitely.;
, There are different types of traumatic brain injuries and different levels of severity, from mild to severe.The doctor will be able to determine the type of injury you or your loved one has experienced and work with a team to help facilitate rehabilitation and recovery. Be aware, too, that a person may experience several different types of injuries and in multiple areas of the brain. TBIs include:Concussion — The most common type of brain injury, a concussion may or may not result in a loss of consciousness, and may be caused by many things, from a blow to the head to whiplash. A person with a concussion may feel dazed and may have temporary or permanent damage. In some cases, a concussion may result in a blood clot, which may be fatal.
Contusion — Usually the result of a direct blow to the head, a contusion is a bruise, or bleeding, on the brain.
Coup-contrecoup — This is when there is a contusion at the site of impact to the head as well as one on the opposite side of the brain. This is caused when the impact is strong enough to cause the brain to slam against the opposite side of the skull.
Diffuse axonal — This includes Shaken Baby Syndrome and injuries caused by a strong rotational force, like a car accident. The shaking causes the brain to tear, which can cause the brain to release chemicals that cause further damage. This can lead to temporary or permanent damage, coma, or even death.
Penetration — This is when a force, such as a bullet or a knife, penetrates the skull and brain. This drives the object into the brain, as well as hair, skin, bones, and possibly other debris into the brain.

, Treatment will depend on the type and severity of the TBI, but usually acute treatment focuses on minimizing any secondary injury and stabilizing the patient. This may be done using devices used to control swelling and pressure, such as mechanical ventilation. Medications may be used to sedate the patient, control any seizures, and sometimes to induce a coma., Brain injuries are complicated, and recovery is almost always multifaceted. Whether the injury was a simple concussion or a much more severe injury, the patient will likely have a team of specialists working together to make sure the recovery goes smoothly. Get the names and phone numbers of each member of the team, as well the location of their individual offices, if they have them. These specialists may include:A physiatrist, a doctor specializing in rehabilitation
A neuropsychologist, who tracks changes in the patient’s behavior
A rehabilitation nurse, who provides care for the patient
A physical therapist, who helps the patient regain physical capacities such as balance and posture
An occupational therapist, who helps assess the patient’s ability to perform daily functions such as budgeting and cooking

, Patients being treated for a TBI often become agitated easily and without notice. If you’re a family member or caregiver, prepare yourself for this. Remember to be patient with the person and speak slowly whenever addressing her.Touch can sometimes be soothing, but can also be very irritating to a person recovering from a TBI. Use the patient’s response to touch as your guide.
If the patient’s response is confusing or upsetting to you, speak to the doctor privately for insight about what may be going on with the patient at the moment.

, This is important for both the patient and his loved ones. Someone recovering from a TBI may be confused much of the time, and dealing with many changes and emotions that are difficult to deal with. If he becomes angry or irritated, or a loved one becomes frustrated while caring for him, the patient should be gently given some time alone to calm down.Be clear with the patient that he is being given some time and space for himself. Try to communicate that he is not being punished, or that his loved one isn’t mad at him.

, A trauma social worker will help the family make a plan for handling long-term recovery. She can help the family figure out the amount of care the patient will need, and who will be responsible for it.The trauma social worker can help the family understand and plan for the financial aspect of dealing with the patient’s recovery.
The trauma social worker will also aid the family in planning for the patient’s discharge from medical and rehabilitation facilities.

, Depending on the severity of the TBI, this could happen a day or two after the injury, or weeks or months afterward. Patients may be sent directly home from the hospital, or may transition to a rehabilitation facility first.The doctors and rehabilitation team will determine when the patient is ready to transition out, based on his health and progress.
Be patient. Spending lots of time in the hospital can be trying, but it’s important that the patient remain under medical care and supervision until it’s definitely safe for him to return home.

, Recovery from a TBI is the fastest and most visible in the first six to nine months after the injury. After that, progress can slow significantly, become less apparent, or even stagnate. It can be exciting and encouraging whenever the patient exhibits signs of progress, but don’t be surprised if he sometimes regresses.Sometimes things that seem like signs of progress can simply be flukes, such as involuntary muscle contractions.
The patient may be working extremely hard to recover motor skills or speech. He may have the energy to do something once or twice, but then seem to regress when he becomes fatigued from the effort it takes.
Be encouraging and patient. The patient will likely get frustrated with the pace of his recovery. Loved ones should be gentle and let him know he is doing well and that the pace of his recovery is natural. If possible, the patient should aim to be patient with himself, too, and accept that the road to recovery may be slow., A TBI can radically change a person’s natural sleep cycle. Someone who was always a heavy sleeper may suddenly be a very light sleeper. Many TBI patients wake up in the middle of the night or experience other sleep problems.Practice going to bed at the same time each night in a dark, quiet room. This may help sleep come more easily.
Sleeping pills are generally to be avoided when recovering from a TBI; however, the patient’s doctor may prescribe mild antidepressants or other medications to help ease severe sleep problems.

, For loved ones caring for someone in a long recovery, a support group can be a significant source of solace. Being someone’s sole or primary caregiver can be exhausting and very stressful. Likewise, recovering from and living with a brain injury can feel frustrating and difficult to describe to those who haven’t experienced it. Seek out a local or online support group to connect with others in your position.There are specific support groups for caregivers, family members, and TBI sufferers.
Your rehabilitation center or team can likely connect you with a group if you have trouble finding one.

, Depending on the severity of the injury, the patient may have trouble forming words, or recalling the right words for a situation. This can be one of the most frustrating parts of a patient’s recovery, as it limits her ability to communicate her needs and experiences.Make sure a speech therapist is on the rehabilitation team if speech has become a problem for the patient.
Speech therapy can be very exhausting, even though it isn’t physically tiring. Don’t ever push a patient to practice beyond her capacity. It may make her irritated or discouraged.

, Occupational therapy helps a patient regain the skills he needs to live independently or at least with minimal care. It can cover things such as cooking, shopping, and taking care of other daily tasks.For a moderate to severe brain injury, an occupational therapist will likely be part of the rehabilitation team.
Depending on the severity of the injury and the patient’s prospects for recovery, he may not be able to recover certain capacities. For example, he may require 24 hour care because he is no longer able to feed himself, drive or take public transportation, answer the phone, or do other things that allow a person to live independently.

, This can be the most difficult part of recovery from a TBI. Of course, both the patient and her loved ones would like a complete recovery, and for it to happen quickly; however, after the initial nine months of recovery, it’s time to adjust to the way life will likely be from now on.If the patient has lost a significant amount of capacity or independence, both she and her family may feel it as a difficult loss, and experience the seven stages of grief.
Doctors are still unable to predict with certainty what the length or scope of a TBI patient’s recovery will be; however, factors such as age, IQ, academic performance in school, and the location and severity of the injury are often good indicators.
Children and teenagers often have greater prospects for long-term recovery, as their brains are more malleable and resilient than those of adults.

, Once the patient and his family have accepted the degree to which the patient is likely to recover, long-term strategies should be put in place. This may mean having the patient move in with family, hiring full time caregivers, or finding the patient a home in an assisted living facility. In cases where the patient has fully or almost fully recovered, he may simply need occasional assistance but be able to continue living independently.Cost, geography, and the ability for the family to dedicate time to the patient will all influence what the most viable long-term strategy should be.
When possible, let the patient determine what his long-term plan will be. Begin by finding out what his personal preference is, and try to see how that might be possible.

, The patient may benefit from technologies such as a wheelchair, or a specialized keyboard. These things may not be absolutely necessary, but may make life significantly easier on the patient. For example, she may have regained the ability to walk, but the fatigue it causes her may not be worth the effort.Ask your rehabilitation team what assistive technologies might be appropriate for long-term recovery.

Try to stay calm.,
If the accident is minor and both cars are still functioning, move them off the road or to the side of the road.,
Check for injuries.,
Call the police to avoid fines.,
If you were in the hit car, a police report can be beneficial to you when it comes time to determine liability.,
Exchange insurance information with the other driver.",How to Manage a Car Accident," After you’ve been in a car accident, it may seem difficult to stay calm, but it is important to keep your wits about you. Your top priority right after an accident is to maintain the safety of everyone involved and to take actions to prevent more accidents or injuries.;
, If the cars are not functioning and it is clear they will have to be towed, turn on your hazard lights, and exit the vehicle when it is safe to do so. If you have flares or a warning triangle in your emergency car kit, now is the time to use them. Put them out as a heads-up to other drivers so no one else crashes into the pile-up.

, Ask every passenger in your car if they’re all right, then check on the driver and passengers of the other vehicle involved in the accident. If needed, call for an ambulance.

, Depending on what state you're in, for accidents involving injury, death or property damage above a certain amount (for example, $1,500 in Utah), you're required to call law enforcement as soon as possible. If you’re not sure how much property damage has been caused, don’t try to be the judge; describe the accident to the police dispatcher and they will decide whether to send officers to the scene. If not, they may just tell you to file an accident report at a local station or online.

, The insurance companies of each of the drivers work together to determine liability and one of the most credible documents the insurers will use is an official police report. If you were the one responsible for the accident, it is still a good idea to call the police because it could be that the driver you hit contributed to the accident, or there may have been factors beyond your control that reduce your responsibility.

, If you are injured and want to make sure you get a fair settlement it is a good idea to contact a personal injury lawyer sooner rather than later.

Clean and dry your knee.,
Lie with your knee relaxed and slightly bent.,
Cover your kneecap with a low irritant tape.,
Mark your kneecap's boundaries on the underwrap.,
Cut a strip of adhesive rigid sports tape.,
Use the tape to gently push your kneecap inward.,
Pull the skin on the inside of the leg toward the kneecap.,
Apply a second strip to secure the hold.,
Make sure you see some wrinkling of the skin.,
Keep the tape on for up to 48 hours.,
Place pressure on the skin as you remove the tape.,
Remove the tape promptly if you experience adverse symptoms.",How to McConnell Tape Your Knee," Wipe your knee with a damp washcloth and, if necessary, a mild soap. Wash away grease, sweat, and any soap residue, then dry your knee thoroughly.Making sure your knee is clean and dry will help prevent irritation. You can also shave the area 12 hours prior to taping if it will be taped repeatedly. This will help reduce pain when the tape is removed.;
, Lie with your back propped up or supported and legs outstretched in front of you. Your knees should be completely relaxed and slightly bent. To help keep your knee bent and relaxed, place a rolled towel under it., You’ll use rigid sports tape to perform the actual McConnell technique. However, sports tape can be irritating and uncomfortable, so you should first cover your entire knee with a strip of low irritant, hypoallergenic tape.A permeable, breathable white cotton tape is a good underwrap option., Use a marker or pen to gently trace all four sides of your kneecap. This will define your work surface on the underwrap layer.It’ll be easier to apply the sports tape properly if you can actually see the kneecap’s boundaries.

, Use non-stretch adhesive sports tape for the McConnell technique. Cut a two to three inch (five to eight cm) strip, or enough tape to cover your knee from outer to inner edges.


Sports tape with a width of 38 mm (1.5 inches) is the best size for knee taping., Apply one end of the tape to the outer edge of your kneecap so the tape is vertically centered with the knee. Adhere the tape to your skin in a downward direction toward the lower inside corner of your knee, and use your thumb to gently push the kneecap toward the inside of the leg., While moving the kneecap and applying the tape, use your fingers to carefully pull the skin on the inside of your leg toward the kneecap. Your goal is to push the kneecap toward the inside of your leg, wrinkle the skin there so it meets the kneecap, and use the tape to hold them tightly together., Place one edge of the second strip of tape on the outer edge of your knee and, again, make sure it’s vertically centered with your kneecap. Secure the tape to your skin in a straight, horizontal motion. The tape should make a straight line from the outside of your knee to the inside.Apply one to three more layers of tape until you feel your desired level of tightness and support., Make sure you’ve created skin wrinkles on the inside part of your knee. These wrinkles should run vertically, or up and down, and you should be able to see them through the underlay.Wrinkling of the skin results when you pull the kneecap inward and secure it to the skin on the inside of the leg.

, Wear the tape during physical activity as directed by your physical therapist or another medical professional. In general, you should remove the tape within 48 hours of application.As strength, range of motion, and balance improve, keep the knee taped for shorter periods of time during general activities. Work towards taping it only for higher risk activities, like sports.

, Hold your kneecap as you slowly peel off the tape to prevent worsening an injury. Place your fingers as close as you can to the tape’s line of attachment, or where it meets your skin. Follow the line with your fingers as you pull the strip of tape to guide it off of your skin.Pulling too fast can cause skin irritation or abruptly force the kneecap out of position.

, Remove the tape immediately if it worsens your pain. Take the tape off if you experience discoloration, pins and needles, or swelling after applying the tape. Tell your physical therapist or other medical professional about these or any other adverse symptoms that result from taping.It’s best to consult a medical professional before taping, especially if you have circulatory problems, a knee fracture, or are allergic to sports tape.

Use an official form if one is available.,
Be complete.,
Stick to the facts.,
Get witness identifications.,
Provide a description of the environment.,
File the report as required.",How to Make an Accident Report1," In most jurisdictions, the local police will have an official motor vehicle accident reporting form. You should find out if such a form exists, and use it to make your report. Using the form will prompt you to provide a complete report with all the necessary information.For example, in Oregon, you must use the Oregon Traffic Accident and Insurance Report form if any vehicle sustained over $1,500 in damage or if any person was injured or killed. The report form is available online, from the police or at the DMV.
Most other jurisdictions have similar reporting requirements and report forms. Look for the one that applies in your area.;
, The official forms are used because they will encourage you to provide all the necessary information. If you fill in the form completely, you will have a report that provides the police and insurance companies all the information they will need.For example, the Oregon Traffic Accident and Insurance Report form has sections that ask for the parties’ identification, witnesses’ identification, description of the accident, weather conditions, road surface, description of damage, and others.

, While it is understandable that you may be emotional after being involved in an accident, you should complete the report as objectively as you can. Do not get emotional or include conclusions about the fault of the accident. If you believe the other driver was at fault, the facts that you report should show that. But any sentences you include that say, “The other driver caused the accident” will serve no purpose., The best witnesses are those who will be seen as impartial. If someone was riding with you in your car, that person can certainly provide a witness statement. But if you see someone walking down the street who witnessed the accident, that person will be more valuable because he or she has no connection to you and is more likely to be deemed fair and impartial.


Get the name and contact information for any witness who saw what happened. If possible, before you leave the scene, ask the witness(es), “Can you tell me what you saw?”, Most official accident report forms will prompt you to provide a description of the scene, in case any environmental factors may have caused the accident. You should provide this information as factually and as completely as possible. If you are using an official form, complete these sections fully. If you are writing your own accident report, include descriptions of the following:Location
Cross streets
Traffic
Weather conditions
Road surface (dry, wet, snowy, gravel)
Light conditions (daylight, dawn, dusk, darkness)
Visibility (foggy, overcast, smog, clear)

, Your state DMV or insurance agency probably has requirements about filing accident reports promptly. In most jurisdictions, an accident report should be filed within 3 days following the accident. Check with your insurance company, the DMV, or the local police about the filing requirements in your jurisdiction.


For example, in Oregon you must submit the completed report within 72 hours. You are instructed to make a copy for your own records, and then submit the original by mail to Accident Reporting Unit, DMV, 1905 Lana Ave NE, Salem OR 97314 or FAX to (503) 945- 5267, or deliver it to any DMV office."

Realize that you'll have to remove the cast.,
Open a tube of medical stockinette.,
Cut the ends of the stockinette with scissors.,
Affix the cast padding.,
Soak the plaster rolls.,
Apply the first roll of plaster casting.,
Apply the second roll of plaster casting.,
Allow 24 hours for the cast to dry completely.,
Ask a friend to help cut off the cast.",How to Make a Plaster Cast of an Arm1," If you are making your own plaster cast, you'll have to be able to remove the cast yourself. Removing a plaster cast requires having access to either plaster shears or an electric cutter. It's highly dangerous to do this process yourself, so have a friend ready to help you.Plaster shears are safer than electric cutters. Plaster shears are available at medical supply companies.
Never use another tool, such as an electric carving knife, to remove a plaster cast from a human arm.;
, The stockinette will be placed between the skin and the cast to protect the arm. The stockinette should be 2 inches (5 cm) wide.Unroll the stockinette the length of your forearm.
Placing both your arm and the stockinette roll on a table is the easiest way to do this.

, The strip should begin 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the elbow and end 1 inch (2.5 cm) past the knuckles of your hand.Cut 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) into the stockinette for your thumb.
Make the cut at a 45-degree angle for best results.
When you're finished, slide your arm into the stockinette, and your thumb through the 1/2-inch (1.3-cm) hole. You can wear this while you work on the remainder of the cast.

, Begin unrolling the 3-inch (7.6-cm) cast padding at your wrist. Wrap your wrist one time with the padding. As you wrap your wrist, hold the beginning end of the padding in place so it doesn't move, twist or slide.Wrap the padding around the hand two times. Do not wrap the fingers. Cut the padding to go over the thumb if the padding bunches.
Wrap the padding around the wrist, moving up the arm towards the elbow with each rotation of the wrap. Ensure that each new pass around the arm overlaps approximately 30% of the pass made before it. Keep the padding smooth as you wrap the arm.
Stop wrapping below the elbow. The wrap should end below the elbow with a space about as wide as two horizontal fingers between the wrap and the elbow.
Wrap the padding back down the arm. Stop at the wrist.
Cut off the remainder of the padding with scissors.

, Place 2 rolls of 3-inch (7.6-cm) plaster casting and a roll of 4-inch (10.2-cm) plaster casting into a basin filled with warm water. The edges of the rolls should face upwards. Soak the plaster right before you apply it to the arm, so that the plaster will not dry out.Remove the plaster when it has softened all the way through.
Wring out the plaster gently.

, With your free hand, wrap the plaster casting around your forearm. Place the end of the 3-inch (7.6-cm) plaster approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) below the top of the padding on the hand. Wrap the plaster around the hand twice.Continue to wrap the arm, moving down towards the elbow. Do not pull on the plaster.
Flatten the applied plaster with your hand as you wrap. Ensure that each new pass of the plaster overlaps the one before it.
Stop wrapping the plaster 1 inch (3 cm) before the edge of the padding near the elbow.

, Continue to wrap your arm in the same manner, pressing each layer of plaster close to the one below so that it creates a solid, unified substance. Place the end of the 4-inch (10.2-cm) plaster casting near the elbow, where the 3-inch (7.6-cm) plaster casting ends. Wrap the casting around the arm, moving towards the hand. Do not pull on the plaster. Gently press the applied plaster with your hand to smooth it.Stop wrapping underneath the thumb.
Fold the leftover padding down over the cast, and wrap the last part of the plaster over the padding to secure the padding.

, You can speed up the drying process somewhat by holding it to a hand dryer, but for best results wait a full day before considering it finished.Don't allow your cast to get wet. Take baths, rather than showers, while wearing your plaster cast.
Make sure your cast is covered when you're outside in the rain.

, Snip the stockinette so that the shears can be placed in between the plaster and the padding. Try to cut straight down along the length of the cast. As your friend cuts, the shears should be removed and cleaned every 4-6 cuts.This step should be planned prior to creating your plaster cast.
If you've neglected to plan for this step, you should make an appointment at your local medical office and ask them to help you.

Talk to the person whose driving concerns you.,

Reduce the need for the person to drive.,

Find or create alternatives to driving.,

Take steps to make sure that whatever driving a person is still doing is as safe as possible.,
Recognize the hazards of age-related effects while driving, and ask the person to do the same.,
Evaluate the person's driving objectively.,

Get the opinion of a doctor, optometrist, or other medical professional, and get it in writing.,
Ask for an evaluation from somebody who is an expert on driving, and agree in advance to follow their recommendation.,

Approach the department of motor vehicles, or whatever agency issues driver's licenses.,
Force the issue.",How to Help an Elderly Person to Drive Less," Be as gentle and understanding as you can, but also be clear and firm. Allow plenty of time to have the conversation. This process will be easiest if the person agrees voluntarily to let you help, and to reduce the amount of driving or, if necessary, to give up driving. Present your reasons for concern as a question of ability or condition rather than of age . Be specific regarding what concerns you. Explain that you are concerned because you care about their safety and the safety of others.
, The transition from driving to not driving as much (or at all) will be easier the more of the person's lifestyle and independence you can help to preserve.
Many cities now have delivery available for groceries or take-out.
Stop by regularly with supplies, companionship and whatever else you can offer.
If you take over shopping for somebody, make sure to get their input and bring them what they want. You will only make a mess if you bring too much or too little, or choose all the wrong things.
Find out what other outings and activities are a regular part of their routine and work towards accommodating them.
Be aware that even simple trips to the store may provide the person with an opportunity to get out and be social. Keep in mind that your objective is to keep them as safe as possible, not to isolate them.

, Transportation is required to get groceries, to visit the doctor, to attend social events, and to carry on the adult lives to which we all become accustomed.
Find out whether public transportation is available to the person and help them learn to use it. Many public transportation options offer discounts to senior citizens. Keep in mind though, that walking to a bus stop may be difficult now, too.
Help with cab fare if you don't live close by or can't be there each day.
Arrange transportation with neighbors who live nearby, offering to help pay for time and fuel. If the older person's finances are tight, he or she can offer neighbors other assistance, such as babysitting for children.
Find out if the town or city offers senior shuttles or other transportation assistance.
If you live close enough, help with transportation yourself.
Take advantage of transportation time to spend more time with the person. He or she may feel isolated or alone, especially with less driving.

, Driving need not be an all or nothing proposition. A person may still be able to drive safely with certain extra precautions. Vision problems are made worse in low light.

Avoid driving at night, dawn, or dusk. Low light makes it even harder for someone with reduced vision to see well and react. Remember to time the trip so that both the trip out and the trip back will have plenty of daylight.
Avoid driving in bad weather. Besides reducing visibility, wet or icy roads are slippery and require an extra measure of caution and judgment.
Reduce the number, duration, and frequency of trips.
Avoid driving to places that are unfamiliar. Focusing on navigation or unfamiliar surroundings may mean not focusing as much on driving, itself.
Avoid driving alone.
Avoid freeways, rush hour, and other busy or difficult driving situations.
Avoid difficult intersections and left turns. It is safer to take a longer route.
Allow plenty of time for trips. A wrong turn is less likely to cause panic if there is plenty of time to correct.
Remove distractions while driving.
Arrange alternatives for longer trips, night trips, and trips to unfamiliar places.
Look for classes for senior drivers. Many insurance companies offer incentives to senior drivers who take a class in defensive driving or senior driving. The AARP also offers a program to help mature drivers stay safe. Make adaptations. Make sure that the eyeglasses prescription is up to date, for example.




 Check tire inflation and fluids regularly.

Check that the vehicle is in good repair. Help the person to check tire inflation and fluids regularly and stay on top of oil changes and other regular maintenance.
Keep aware of the person's condition and abilities. You may have to revisit the question or make additional changes later on.

, Older drivers may have difficulty with vision or hearing, increased reaction time, loss of strength or flexibility or loss of focus and concentration. Taken together, these factors can lead to injury and even fatal accidents. If the person can help to decide when to stop driving, it may be less of a shock and it will certainly be less of an argument. , If you think that driving at all has become unsafe, ride along with the person and look for specific signs that his or her driving might no longer be safe. Also watch how they behave off the road. Tell the person what you have seen and why you are concerned, and ask that they stop driving or change their habits.:




 Read about medications or ask a doctor or pharmacist.

Conditions or medications that may reduce reaction times, alter judgment, or induce drowsiness.
Driving at inappropriate speeds, either too fast or too slow. Ask specifically whether this practice creates a hazard, since driving at a moderate pace where it is appropriate to do so can be much safer than driving too fast.
Discomfort or nervousness about driving from the driver, concerns from passengers, or honking or anger from other drivers.
An increase in traffic citations or warnings.
Dents or scrapes on the vehicle or on curbs, garage doors, and other surroundings.
Accidents or ""close calls"".
Difficulty staying focused on the act of driving.
Difficulty staying within the lane; hitting curbs or crossing lane markers.
Failure to notice or inappropriate reactions to road signs, traffic signals, pedestrians, breaks in traffic, or other cues while driving.
Difficulty seeing to the sides or behind the vehicle or reliance on passengers to check whether a turn or other action will be safe.
Difficulty turning to look behind when backing up or changing lanes.
Getting lost, especially in areas that should be familiar.

, For some people, a letter from somebody who is an authority (and who is neutral or not a family member) may convince them not to drive. If the written opinion isn't enough to be convincing, it can give you grounds for taking stronger measures should you need to., Ask the person to retest with the agency that issues driver's licenses or contact driving schools and ask about getting an evaluation. Again, get the result in writing., It may be illegal for the person to continue driving. Even if the official response is only a letter, it may help convince them to stop., If other approaches have failed and driving is definitely no longer safe, it may be necessary to take away the keys or disable or take away the vehicle. Exhaust all other options first, and think ahead to what the person might do in this case.
Make sure your method is effective. Many people can reconnect a battery, dig out spare keys, or call roadside assistance. On the other hand, ""losing"" the keys may be an effective short term measure to keep someone from driving without it being ""your fault"".
If you choose to take the car or the car keys, have grounds for doing so first. Be prepared to justify your actions if they call the police.

Opt for short sleeves.,
Wear your sling under your clothing.,
Alternatively, use legwarmers to keep exposed arms warm.,
Avoid irritating your injury.,
Stick to your usual ""look"".",How to Look Good in a Sling," If you have to wear a cast or a splint of any kind, short sleeves, tank tops or camisoles might be your best bet. This is especially true if it's warm enough to wear short sleeves comfortably. It's easier to put on these light garments with an arm injury than it is to put on long-sleeved clothes, so, if you need to wear a sling, just slip on your short-sleeved shirt before putting your sling on each morning.;
, Forget the hassle of trying to feed your arm in and out of your sleeve. If it's cold outside and short sleeves just won't do, simply wear your sling underneath your outerwear. You may need to wear your coat or jacket loosely to accommodate your sling - for instance, try draping a suit jacket over your shoulders without putting either arm into the sleeves. This look will keep you warm and is also plenty stylish in its own right!


You can also put your ""good"" arm in your coat's sleeve and tuck the other unused sleeve into the coat pocket.

, If it's too cold for short sleeves, you can always try an unconventional solution - leg warmers! Go to a dance supply store and buy a pair of legwarmers in your favorite color. Put one over your sling or cast and then wear whatever you can that will keep you warm. You can also Make Leg Warmers from Old Sweaters.

, Which ever solution you pick, try to stick to soft fabrics that won't irritate your skin or rub against your injured arm in an uncomfortable way. Make sure that if you have a jacket, cardigan or suit coat that you can easily put it on and take it off without aggravating your injury. If it's difficult for you to don a coat, you might be better off without one.

, Try to adhere as much as you can to your usual style while allowing yourself more convenience and comfort than you normally might. Remember that people don't care about your sling, they care about you. There's no reason to be self-conscious.

Get immediate medical attention as needed.,
Check with your employer for an official report form.,
Complete form as much as possible.,
Include any witnesses.,
Describe environmental conditions.,
Do not accept responsibility for accident.",How to Make an Accident Report2," If you have an accident at work, you probably have an internal policy for dealing with accidents. The first step should be to take care of yourself medically. If you have a nurse or clinic on site, you should go get checked out. If the injury is serious, you may need to go to a hospital. If it is minor, get whatever first aid you need.An accident report form should be submitted as soon as possible. You can tend to an accident report as soon as your condition is stable, but do not let it wait. In most cases, you should file it within two to three days.

, Most work places will have a specific form that you should use for reporting any accident, with or without a personal injury. If you are injured, your employer will need to know, in order to submit papers for workers compensation., Your employer should have an official form for you to submit, which will help to report the accident for workers’ compensation. Be sure to fill in the form completely. Usually, such a form will include sections for the following information:Your identification
Your job status
Any pre-existing medical conditions
Time and location of the incident
Description of what happened
Description of any injury you sustained
Identification of any witnesses.

, If anyone was present when the accident happened, ask them if they saw it, and ask if they can describe what they saw. Some people may be present but not actually observe what happened. In either case, you should include their names and contact information in the “Witness” section of the accident report. Even if the witness is also an employee of the company, you should provide contact information, because people outside the company may be working with the report form., If the weather or other environmental conditions were relevant to the accident, be sure to include those details in your report. Provide information about snow, ice, floor conditions, or anything else that may have been a factor., Even if you feel that you may have been careless or played a role in the accident, do not include statements to that effect in the incident report. Be factual and stick to details about what happened. Any investigation into fault or responsibility can happen later."
"
Be accurate and specific.,
Report facts and not conclusions.,
Be complete but also concise.,
Be objective.,
Focus on direct observations.,
Use good grammar and full sentences.",How to Make an Accident Report3," If you are taking notes and writing an incident report that you expect may be used as evidence in a court proceeding, you must develop strong credibility. Anything you write will need to stand up to cross-examination., Whether you are writing an incident report based on your own observations or based on witness testimony, you will need to remain factual. You need to limit the written report to facts, so the conclusions can be made in court.As an example, a factual observation would be to say that the driver of the red Honda crossed the center line into oncoming traffic. It would be a conclusion to say that the driver of the red car caused the accident.

, It is important for your report to include everything that is necessary for the reader to understand what happened. However, you should limit what you say to only the important facts. Avoid unnecessary narration or description., A good, objective report should be fair and impartial, without slanting in favor of either party involved. If your report is going to be accepted in court, it should be as fairly objective as you can make it.A fair, objective statement would be to say, “Mr. Smith appeared to be approximately six feet tall.”
A subjective, slanted statement would be to say, “Mr. Smith was a big bully.”

, Do not include statements of hearsay or assumption in your report. Any such statements would only be challenged if the report is presented in court. Limit your report to things that you, or the witness you are writing for, actually observed.For example, if you are writing a report of a motor vehicle accident scene, when you did not directly observe the accident, you may write, “The rear panel of the Honda was severely dented, and the front end of the pickup truck was crumpled.” You should not write, “The pickup truck rear-ended the Honda,” unless you were actually there to see it happen.

, The credibility of your report will be judged not only on the content but also on your style of writing. It is important to use complete sentences, standard punctuation and grammar, and to proofread your report before signing and submitting it.Something as simple as comma usage can change the meaning of your report. For example, consider these two sentences:

”The second patient who was transported to the hospital died from injuries sustained in the accident.” (This suggests that at least two patients were transported to the hospital, and the second one died.)
”The second patient, who was transported to the hospital, died from injuries sustained in the accident.” (This sentence suggests that only the second patient was transported to the hospital.)

Use Modroc to make a cast for a doll.,
Fill a plastic container with warm water.,
Wrap the damp strips of Modroc around the doll's arm.,
Allow cast to dry.,
Cut cast off using scissors.",How to Make a Plaster Cast of an Arm2," Modroc should never be used on humans, but can be a good substitute for plaster if you want to teach your child to make casts for her dolls. Modroc is very easy for children to work with, and does not require the length of drying time that plaster needs.Modroc is basically gauze, purchased in rolls, lightly layered with plaster, which can be wrapped and molded when wet.
Modroc can be found in many craft stores on online.

, Open your Modroc rolls, and cut short strips out to use for your casts. Your strips shouldn't be longer than your container, so make sure your container is at least 4 inches long.If you are doing this activity with a child, you may wish to do the cutting yourself to avoid accidents with the scissors.
The water is only for dampening the Modroc bandage. If you leave it in too long, all the plaster will fall off. Remove it from the water after about 5 seconds.

, Build up the layers one by one, pressing smoothly so that each strip molds itself to the one below. If your strips start to feel dry, dip your fingers into the water and touch the casting material with your wet fingers.Apply strips until the area appears properly covered.
Teaching your child to bandage her doll can help her learn physical knowledge, 1st aid basics and empathy.

, A Modroc cast should only require 30-60 minutes to dry completely. This is a good opportunity to teach your child about resting while waiting for an injury to heal. Put the doll in a ""recovery bedroom"" while the cast is drying.Be careful that your child doesn't put any of this cast material in her mouth.
You can easily wash any residual plaster off your fingers.

, Start at the lower end of the bandage, and cut a vertical line to the top. The two halves of the cast should fall off the doll.Modroc should be easy to cut with household scissors, and any excess can be cleaned up with a damp cloth.
Any Modroc that has spilled into your counter or table can be easily wiped up.

Go to the emergency room if any bones are visible or protruding from the injured ankle.,
Head to the emergency room if the injured ankle is numb, it cannot bear weight, or there is a tingling sensation.,
Only apply ice to an injured ankle if it is swollen, and 24 hours after the injury occurred.,
Explain the procedure to the injured person.,
Wash your hands with antibacterial soap and clean water.,
Assess the person’s ankle injury.,
Prepare the necessary materials.,
Have the injured person sit or lie comfortably in an open area.,
Elevate the injured ankle.,
Place the ice pack or ice wrapped in cloth on the injured ankle.,
Hold the ice pack in place for 5 to 20 minutes or until the person’s skin feels numb.,
Remove the ice pack once the person tells you the injured area is numb.,
Wash your hands with antibacterial soap and clean water after each application.,
Keep the injured ankle elevated as it recovers.,
Allow the person to use their injured ankle after two days.,
Consult with a doctor if the injury does not improve after 2 to 3 days.,
Be aware that an injury to the ankle means the tendons and ligaments have become disrupted or torn.,
Understand how applying an ice pack to the area reduces swelling.,
If you have blood circulation issues, talk to your doctor before applying an ice pack to your injury.",How to Ice an Injured Ankle," This means bones have been broken in the ankle as a result of the extreme force applied to it.This level of injury is serious and will require surgical repair of the bones in the ankle to return it in its normal position.;
, These are symptoms that the injured area is not getting enough blood and oxygen. This can also indicate nerve damage, such as a torn ligament.Applying ice to the injured area will only aggravate the condition as the cold temperature will constrict blood vessels and limit blood flow to the area.

, Waiting 24 hours to put ice on the injury will allow the body to supply more blood, oxygen and nutrients to the injured area to facilitate healing.If ice application is done within the first 24 hours, healing of the area will be compromised.

, This will help to establish trust and cooperation on their part.


Let them know the ice application will help to lessen the pain in their ankle, and that they will have to keep the ice pack on for at least 15-20 minutes.

, This will prevent the transmission of harmful microorganisms.

, Make sure it can be treated at home and does not have any symptoms of a serious injury that needs immediate medical attention.


Ask the person about the date and time of the ankle injury so you can confirm you are icing it 24 hours after the injury occurred.

, You will need a cold ice pack and a clean cloth. If you don’t have an ice pack, you can take a handful of ice and wrap it in a plastic bag or a clean cloth. You can also use a bag of frozen peas, in a pinch.


Do not apply the ice pack directly to the skin as it can cause cold burns, or skin damage from extremely cold temperature that can leave blisters or damage to the underlying skin tissue., Put a clean towel below their injured foot so the ice application will not make a mess.

, You want to ensure the person won’t put any force on their injury. So, have them put their injured ankle on an object that is higher than the level of their hips, while sitting.


Make sure they do not bend their leg so there is no added pressure on the ankle.

, Tell the person that the application may cause a little discomfort but will subside after the ice is removed.

, During the ice application, talk to the person and ask them if their skin starts to feel numb. This way, you can assess if it is time to remove the ice.A numb sensation can be described as inability to feel anything. Usually, upon application of ice, the person can still feel the cold temperature. But as time passes, the person starts to feel nothing at all.

, Reapply the ice pack every 2 to 4 hours daily on their ankle until the swelling subsides.


Never leave the ice pack on the person’s ankle unattended as this can cause further injury, such as cold burns.
Repeat the ice application for the next 48 hours. During the first 48 hours the person’s injured ankle will be very swollen, so the ice will help to lessen this swelling.

, This will prevent the transmission of harmful microorganisms.

, Have the person lay down on their back and place their injured ankle on a chair or an object that is 2-3 feet high. The leg with the injured ankle should always be higher than the level of the heart., The person should try to walk slowly, though they may need assistance at first.There should be gradual progressive improvement of the injury.
Pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be very helpful in relieving their pain during the healing process.

, The doctor will ask questions about how the injury occurred and examine the injured ankle. The doctor may also take X-rays of the ankle to make sure it is not a bone fracture.Keep in mind if the injury is mild, there may not be much pain or swelling. The severity of the injury depends on how badly the ligaments are stretched or torn in the ankle.
It’s important to go see a doctor if the injured ankle has already been injured before., Whether you are playing contact sports or doing a work-related task, injuries to the ankles means the tendons (soft tissue connecting muscle to the bone) and the ligaments (tissue connecting two bones) of the ankle have been affected.


As a result, the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to these tissues also get torn and leak blood into the surrounding tissues, resulting in bruising on the injured area.
Substances called prostaglandins also accumulate in the damaged area. These substances stimulate the pain receptors to send pain signals to your brain and to cause swelling in the area by dilating the blood vessels to increase blood flow.The more blood flowing to the injured area, the more swelling occurs.

, Your body will send send blood to the injured area, resulting in swelling, as a way to protect itself by supplying sufficient oxygen and nutrients to facilitate healing.Cold applications such as an ice pack cause the blood vessels to constrict and to limit blood flow to the injured area, which minimizes swelling.


An ice application to the injured ankle has an added benefit of providing pain relief by numbing the nerve endings in the area., Blood circulation issues and disorders such as diabetes, peripheral arterial disease (narrowing of arteries that supply blood to the legs) and Buerger's disease (narrowing of blood vessels in the arms and legs), can get worse due to a cold application.

Ice the bruise.,
Apply a warm compress after day two.,
Elevate the bruise.,
Do not exercise heavily.,
Massage the bruised area gently.,
Expose the bruise to sunlight.",How to Make a Bruise Go Away Faster1," Ice your bruise for about 15 minutes every few hours for the first few days after incurring a bruise. Icing reduces inflammation and swelling, helping the bruise heal quickly.;
, After reducing inflammation with ice, you can apply a warm compress (not hot) directly to the bruise. This will increase blood flow to the tissue and speed up the healing process.

, If your bruise is on an area that you can elevate such as one of your limbs, be sure to lift the bruise above your heart to reduce the blood flow to the bruise. Doing so will reduce swelling and discourage more blood from rushing to the bruise site and causing further discoloration. Elevation works best when performed immediately after incurring a bruise.

, For the first day or two after receiving a bad bruise, refrain from performing heavy exercise that causes blood to pump throughout your body. The more blood that flows to the bruise, the worse it will become.

, Use your thumb to gently massage around the outer edge of the bruise. Do not press hard or attempt to massage the center of the bruise, as doing so can be painful. Be sure to massage in a small circular motion. Doing so activates the lymphatic process so that your body naturally starts to get rid of the bruise on its own.

, If you can get 10 to 15 minutes of direct sunlight on your bruise per day, the UV radiation will begin to break down bilirubin, which is what causes a bruise to yellow. Getting sunlight will help speed up this process and make your bruise disappear quicker.

The first thing to do is stop your car. Switch on your hazard lights to alert other drivers to the accident. If signs are posted that state to do so, pull out of the lane of traffic onto the shoulder or emergency lane.Evaluate yourself for any injuries that might have been caused by the crash. Try to keep calm and think about the safety of yourself and the passengers in your the car.


After checking yourself over, look around the car and talk to your passengers to see if anybody is hurt.
If you or any of your passengers are injured, call the emergency services immediately. This means both the police and an ambulance.;
, If nobody in your car is hurt and it is safe for you to get out of your car, you can go and check on the other car involved in the accident. The first priority should be safety so you need to assess the situation carefully.If it is safe to check the other car, and you discover that somebody is hurt, you should call the emergency services immediately.


If the road is blocked by your car or the other car involved in the accident you should call the police so they can come and close the road and avoid any further accidents.
Do not in any circumstances keep driving or leave the scene of the accident before everything is taken care of.In many countries, if you fail to stop after an accident you may be charged with an offence., You should always prioritise the health and safety of the people involved in the accident before you start thinking about your car and your insurance.Once you are satisfied everyone is okay and safe, you can start evaluating the damage to the vehicles involved. The extent of the damage will determine whether you need to call the police immediately or if you can call them a little later. The law varies by state, but if you are in doubt make the call and explain that it is not an emergency.You should always report an accident to the police within 24 hours, but if it is not an emergency and doesn't require the police to attend, you do not have to call from the scene of the accident.If the value of the damage is above around $1000 you should call the police from the scene to report the accident immediately.A minor dent or scratch will not require immediate police involvement.Nevertheless, it's best to call the police when your memory of the incident is fresh. You are likely to forget details if you try to fill in a police report later., If the accident is minor, nobody is hurt, and the driver from the other has stopped his car and is cooperating and sharing his name, address, licence number and insurance details you will not need to call the police. Nevertheless, it is always the best idea to call the police for your own protection and for insurance purposes.Definitely contact the police if:


The driver doesn't stop or drives away without giving you the information you need.The driver appears intoxicated or was driving dangerously.
The driver threatens you in any way, or is aggressive and confrontational.

, When you are talking to the other driver it's important that you keep calm and get all the information you need. Do not admit culpability, or blame the other person for the accident. Dispassionately gather all the personal and insurance details.You should record the name, address and contact details of the other driver.
Write down the driver's licence number, licence plate number, the make and model of his car, and his insurance company., Thanks to the miracle of mobile phones, almost everyone now has a camera with them at all times. Take immediate notes of what you think happened, and snap some photos of the damage to your car and to the other car. This will be very useful for filing your insurance claim later.It will also be helpful if the other driver decides to file a case against you or claim that the accident caused more damage than it really did. Take photos from as many angles as you can.

, If anybody is hurt, there is serious damage to the car, or the other driver does not cooperate, then you definitely need to call the police to report the situation and get some assistance.

Adjust your expectations of recovery to provide support for your child.,
Write down the positives to remind yourself and your child of their abilities.,
Learn about TBI to best help your child.,
Talk to other parents to find a feeling of solidarity.",How to Help Students with Traumatic Brain Injuries1," After the TBI, your child will almost certainly be different in one way or another. In severe cases, there can be great changes in your child's emotions, problem-solving skills, and memory, depending on where the injury is. Often, your child will remember how they were before the injury, and their inability to reach that state again can cause a lot of emotional trauma and frustration.


Just picture being a straight-A student, who just “gets” everything really quickly and is very socially adaptable, and then waking up one day to find out that you simply cannot function the same way anymore.
It can also be difficult for family members, friends and school faculty to accept the new ways in which your child behaves – they might expect him or her to go back to “normal” and be disappointed when that does not happen.
Although they may not say it, this disappointment is almost always noticed by children and makes them feel even worse about themselves.
That is why it is essential to adjust your expectations and come to terms with the fact that now there is a new “normal” which is not bad, just different.
If you are able to believe this yourself, your child will sense it and his or her self-esteem will be boosted.;
, Write down, in a very positive manner, all the good things that your child currently enjoys.


For example, try writing down that the injury is not that severe, that there are many things that your child can still do, etc.
It might be easier to write all these positive statements down somewhere private, and read them whenever you are feeling doubtful or sad.
Having things written down makes you look at them more seriously.
Remember, your child can sense your disposition and is almost always much affected by it, so you can influence the way he or she views the injury.

, If you know nothing about your child’s injury, you will likely be so scared of the situation, that you can't deal with it appropriately.


However, if you go the extra mile and learn about TBI, you will find that there will still be many positive things in your child’s life.
Also, by learning about the injury, you can educate yourself regarding suitable behaviors and learning techniques, which can be crucial for your child's recovery.
There are many books and information sources on TBI, but if you want to get the best, you should consult your child’s healthcare team. A
Your child’s healthcare team has experience helping parents and students cope with TBI, so they will be able to tell you which information sources will be most helpful for your specific situation.

, It can help you deal with the trauma of your child's TBI to know that there are other people who are experiencing the same thing.


Talking to other parents with children suffering from TBI can make you feel less alone, less stressed, and more supported by society.
Chances are, even if their child has different problems than yours, parents of children with TBI have experience and knowledge that can help you deal with situations when you are worried about a certain part of your child’s life.
A really good thing about joining a support group for TBI parents is that you will learn about teaching techniques that will help your child excel in school.
In addition, seeing that other people are dealing with the same problems as you can make you and your child feel less “different”.

Peel a banana.",How to Make a Bruise Go Away Faster2," Mix vinegar with warm water and rub it over the injured area. Vinegar increases the blood flow to the skin's surface, encouraging the bruised area to heal quicker.

, Pineapple and papaya contain a digestive enzyme called bromelain that breaks down the proteins that can trap blood and fluids in your tissues. Eat as much pineapple as you want to absorb the bromelain and help your body flush away the bruise.

,


First, make sure you are eating enough vitamin C by consuming foods such as oranges, mangoes, broccoli, peppers, and sweet potatoes. You can also take a vitamin C supplement to ensure that you get your daily value.
Crush up vitamin C pills and mix with a little bit of water to create a paste. Rub it directly on the affected area and allow it to dry before removing gently with water.

, Bilberry extract contains anthocyanosides, potent antioxidants that can reduce the appearance of a bruise by stabilizing the collagen and strengthening capillaries. You can find bilberry extract in pill form at most health food stores.

, Parsley may contain anti-inflammatory properties that can help a bruise disappear quicker.

, Just like parsley, ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and acts as a good support for your immune system. Chop up ginger and steep it in hot water for a few minutes before drinking. You can also take ginger capsules or crush up ginger and rub it directly on the bruise.

, Rub the mixture over the bruised area and allow it to sit for several hours. Simply wipe it off with a tissue when necessary. Apply once per day until the bruise disappears.

, Grind comfrey root and add a little bit of water to create a paste or soak a cotton ball in comfrey root tea. Apply the paste or the cotton ball to the affected area once per day until the bruise is gone.

, Witch hazel can speed up the healing process and is thought to reduce inflammation. Apply the oil and allow it to sit on the affected area for several hours. Repeat at least once per day until the bruise is gone.

, Use the inside of the peel to rub over the bruise. Eat the banana (just because it's nice).

, Arnica is an herb that reduces inflammation and can help reduce the appearance of bruises quickly. It is available in cream or gel form at most drug stores. Apply a coating to the affected area twice daily until the bruise goes away.

, If you have the stomach for it, and you can find a holistic medicine supply store that sells live leeches, you can place a live leech directly on the bruise. It will suck the blood off the top layer of the bruise immediately. Because the leech's saliva is somewhat numbing, you won't feel any discomfort during this process.

Understand that the student may need to relearn skills and that you should develop his curriculum around those skills.,
Help the student to develop his ability to make eye contact.,
Work to increase the student’s ability to pay attention.,
Help the student to stay in his seat.,
Focus on building the student’s ability to be compliant.,
Be prepared to face behavioral issues.,
Remove negative stimuli and use ‘time-outs’ as a way to address behavioral issues.",How to Help Students with Traumatic Brain Injuries2," Following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) the student may need to relearn some of his skills. He might have been adept in these skills previously, but because of brain damage you may need to help him relearn them.


Closely monitor the student's behavior and take note of any special needs or changes in behavior. The student might look normal to you, but there are many underlying problems that can appear late in life.
Students with brain injuries should be given extra time for learning. They should not be punished or scolded for not completing their task in time. They may be feeling depressed or agitated, so it's important to assure them of your love and support.

, Develop the student's ability to make eye contact through direct eye contact exercises, games and other activities.


One of the most simple and effective techniques to develop eye contact with a child is to identify their favorite picture, object or toy and then place that object on a table where you can view it easily. Ask the child to find the reflection of the object in your eyeball. Many children make excellent eye contact in this way.
For very young children, peek-a-boo is a helpful game which you can modify in accordance with the age of the child. .
Another very interesting game is the “eye blink game”. Ask the child to look at you or any other child and ask them to recognize who blinked the eye first.
While performing any task, keep on telling the child to “look at me”. Positively reinforce any eye contact made with praise or rewards.

, Use attention building exercises like play therapy or story reading exercises. For play therapy choose a toy or real pet which the child likes.


You can ask the child to brush the pet if it has long hair, help the child play with it, care for it and interact with it. This tremendously increases the attention span of a child in a single activity.
Similarly, help the child listen to a recorded story or a video story. You can also read a picture book to the child, then ask him to re-tell you the story.

, A student with traumatic brain injury might be prone to hyperactivity and have difficulty staying in their seat. In this case positive reinforcement is the best option.


Praise the child for each positive behavior, such as standing near the seat, placing a hand on the seat or sitting on the seat for short periods of the time. The child will begin to connect sitting down with praise, encouraging them to do so.
For some extremely tantrum throwing, aggressive or hyper active child you can use holding therapy where the child is forcefully held in seat. This can be done through an enclosed chair from which the child cannot escape. You can also physical restrict the child onto the seat.

, Teach the child to comply with your requests through reinforcement and encouragement. Identify which types of positive reinforcement work best for the child.


You can use a star chart to help the child build compliance. When the child achieve a certain number of stars per week, you can give the child a tangible reinforce like a treat, or a sticker.
Similarly, you can use rewards like watching TV or cartoon video, but only if the child complies with your instructions.

, Many children with traumatic brain injuries display behavioral issues during the recovery and rehabilitation phase. Sometimes these behavioral issues are caused by medications, hormonal changes or the brain damage itself.


Understand that negative behavior always happens for a reason. For example the child might exhibit negative behaviors (such as tantrums or refusing to do what their told) in order to gain attention, to avoid learning a difficult task or as a response to frustration.

, Once you understand where the negative behaviors are coming from, try to omit the negative stimulus in order to calm the child down. If this doesn't work, you can use ""time-outs"" to teach the student about the behavior that's expected from them.


Students should be given time out for 5 to 15 minutes to regain control of their anger and return to normal.
Another way of dealing with negative behavior is just to ignore it.

Develop an individualized educational program (IEP) for the child.,
Determine the student’s strengths.,
Divide the student’s work up into small steps.,
Have the student write as much as possible.",How to Help Students with Traumatic Brain Injuries3," Address the individual needs of the child with TBI by developing an individualized educational program. This program may contain academic, social, cognitive, self-help and motor skill tasks.


There are different levels and different ages at which children achieve and acquire certain academic skills and concepts. Depending on the type of brain injury and the functioning of the child, you should alter the tasks accordingly.
Choose tasks that the child is not yet able to do, which are in accordance with his mental age. These skills can be accessed through various questionnaires and observation of the child.
It is important that you work together with the student’s teachers and healthcare team, in order to create the best IEP possible.
Even if the process takes a little longer than you had wanted or expected, remember that the most important thing is to achieve a curriculum that is best suited to your child and his particular needs.
If you rush the process, you might end up with a study plan that is too fast, too slow, or uses the wrong type of stimuli. Then you would have to go through the entire ordeal again.
The goal here is to encourage the student’s cognitive abilities in the best and most efficient way possible.

, Identify the strengths of the child and work along them. Even after the TBI, some areas of the student will still remain strong.


Some students might be good at verbal skills, or counting and mathematics or even narration. Use the skills the child is strong at to compensate for their weakness.
For example if he or she is good at coloring you can motivate the child to color a letter in order to make him learn the letter.

, Instead of asking the student to complete a huge task in a single sitting, divide the work into many small steps. Reinforce completion of each step. Assigning a child with TBI a large, complicated task that they cannot complete will make them feel worthless.


Remember that progress might be slow and the child may forget things frequently. Be patient and get the child to repeat each task or skill in a repetitive manner until they have grasped it fully.
Don’t force them to complete the task ASAP. Avoid negative reinforcement and also punishment. It only produces poor impact on brain with no progress.

, Those students who have significant memory problems should be encouraged to write important assignments, to make notes, and also to write about their behaviors, feelings and emotions.


Ask them to write their own autobiography. It will keep them busy and produce valuable content that they can share and enjoy with others.
It will also help them to recall lost memories. The student should write all important events of his life as soon as they occur to him, before he forgets any details. This is an effective brain exercise.

"
"
Give positive reinforcement often.,
Allow the student to rest or go home when needed when needed.,
Create a flexible schedule for your student.,
Allow the student to participate in leisure activities often.,
Make sure that the student has the ability to move around as needed.",How to Help Students with Traumatic Brain Injuries4," Positive reinforcement produces a pleasant impact on our brain. It motivates our brain to repeat the reinforced behavior in order to experience the pleasant feeling again. Positive reinforcement can be provided by a family member, a teacher and even by the student himself.

, Students with traumatic brain injuries get exhausted easily and need rest. Therefore, children with TBI should not be forced to stay in school for very long periods of time, like other students. They should be allowed to leave school earlier and should also be given plenty of breaks throughout the day.


The physical and mental abilities and capacities of a child might be limited initially during the rehabilitation phase, it is important to gradually increase the attendance at school instead of imposing strict attendance and difficult tasks initially.
Make the work given more home based and gradually increase the difficulty level. The assessment will reveal the current capacities and functioning level of the child. Plan and structure the environment accordingly.

, Teachers should be less demanding. The routine and assignments should be flexible. There should be no time limit for such students. They should be allowed to have rest many times a day and should be given separate place for getting relaxed and getting out of agitation.

, Patients with brain injuries should be allowed to spend most of their time in leisure activities. If they enjoy watching TV, playing games or passing time on internet; give them enough time to enjoy these activities. Take them to beach, to a park or to the cinema, they should be allowed to have as much fun and enjoyment as possible. Develop some new hobbies like gardening, walking, painting etc.

, Students with TBI often have problems in moving from one place to another. They should be given seat near teacher with some good student beside them. They should be given enough space for moving. They should also be helped while changing their class according to subject. Teacher should allow them to leave 5 minutes earlier for reaching other class without having difficulty or confusion.

Create a team to assess the student’s abilities and progress.,
Consult a special education provider for tips on how to best teach the student.,
Schedule regular meetings with everyone involved in the student’s education.,
Take the time to learn about the student’s specific disability.",How to Help Students with Traumatic Brain Injuries5," Once the child with TBI enters school environment, assessment is the first step. The school therapist, psychologist, behavior therapist, and physiotherapist team should all coordinate and compare assessments of the child. The usual problems that are seen after TBI include:


Motor disabilities, including both fine and gross motor skills.
Slow processing speed.
Cognitive impairment. For example, a child of average intelligence might lose cognitive skills and fall into the category of mild intellectual disability following the injury.
Behavioral problems caused by issues with recovery, suffering excessive pain and having difficulty adjusting to their new life..
Memory loss in the form of amnesia, or loss of memory of some events. Poor short term memory and forgetting issues.
Lack of attention and concentration.
Changes in personality (for example, a social child might become isolated).

, Some schools possess teachers that are experts in providing special education. If your child's school does not currently employ such a teacher, talk to the school authority and ask them to hire a special education expert.


Alternatively, you could consider sending your child to another school that has adequate facilities and staff to cope with his TBI.

, Intervention according to ongoing observation and assessment should be made by parents, doctors, teachers and other important figures around the patient. There should be regular meetings especially between parents and teachers. Special needs, improvements and requirements should be discussed. It is very important for the teachers to collaborate with the doctors, therapists, parents and other rehabilitation team working with the child.


You will have an idea about child’s present functioning, home environment and chances of improvement
It will give you an idea about the child’s progress.
Being a teacher you might find some deficit for example the child having difficulty with motor skills and may talk to the physiotherapist about it and device ways to manage.
This collaborative environment will also help all the team members along with the family to help out in rehabilitation in educational settings.

, The student himself, his parents and teachers should have enough knowledge about traumatic brain injuries. They should be encouraged to read many books and articles about TBI. They should also take the time to identify the specific symptoms related to the child's injury. This will enable them to deal with the problem more effectively. Some of the most common side effects of TBI include:



Dementia: People who suffer from dementia as a result of brain injury shows both memory problems and cognitive impairments. Their ability to think or reason is lost or significantly impaired. Their language skills are also greatly affected. They may even undergo personality changes. Most often they become worse with the passage of time. The patient may become increasingly aggressive.

Retrograde amnesia: People with retrograde amnesia do not remember their past. They forget what happened to them in the past. They may still show their abilities, but past memories of their life’s events is lost. They may not recognize their past friends or relatives. They may forget about how they got injured.

Anterograde Amnesia: This is more common and happens when the person can't remember ongoing events. The person forgets everything that happened to him from the time of head injury. He may not recognize new acquaintances and may need to resolve a [problem that was resolved the previous day.

Delirium: State of blurred consciousness where the sufferer has difficulty in concentrating, which results in misinterpretations, illusions and in severe cases, hallucinations.

Alzheimer’s disease: This begins with memory problems, lapses of attention and significant impairment in language and communication. In the later stage, the person might not even remember his name or be able to complete simple tasks.

Personality problems:Damage to certain brain areas (frontal lobes), causes major changes in personality. The person loses his ability to show appropriate emotions. He feels confused, indecisive and aggressive.

Calamine lotion is an anti-pruritic with zinc oxide and ferric oxide that is used the world over to treat itching.OTC hydrocortisone has small amounts of steroids (1% of the entire solution) that helps relieve itching.It is also widely used.

, With its anti-itch and anti-inflammatory properties, witch hazel is a plant that was widely used by the American Indians before it was marketed as an astringent.


Deodorant contains aluminum chloride, which is effective in stopping the pain and swelling associated with mosquito bites., Epsom salts are made of magnesium and sulfate, and offer a go-to remedy for many health ailments in addition to relaxing the mind.

Park your car to the side of the road.,
Remain calm.,
Look over the scene quickly.,
Call emergency services.,
Warn oncoming traffic.,
Check for danger.,
Ask the victim about assistance.,
Avoid moving the victim.,
Check the airway.,
Administer aid—as necessary.,
Treat shock.,
Comfort the victim.,
Turn over care to emergency personnel.",How to Help a Victim of a Car Accident," If you are the first responder to an accident or someone who can and/ or wants to provide assistance, pull your car to the side of the road. If the victim is in the road, use your car as a barrier. Make sure your car is safely out of traffic lanes and not blocking access to the scene or victim in any way.Turn off your car’s ignition. Turn on your emergency flashers to alert other drivers that you are stopped. Remember that your emergency flashers will work even if your car isn’t running.
Provide a barrier to victims in the road with your car and that of any other person on the scene. Make sure that barrier vehicles also have on four-way flashers to warn any oncoming vehicles.;
, It’s important to you and any victims that you remain calm. This will help you make informed and rational decisions to best deal with the accident. If you feel yourself panicking in any way, take a deep breath to refocus or delegate tasks to others at the scene.Avoid allowing any person panicking at the scene—be it a victim or bystander—to affect you. Staying calm and collected can prevent panic within the group as well as minimize any damage., Although your first instinct may be to call for help, taking a few seconds to quickly assess the situation can help you provide vital information to emergency services. In addition, it may also alert you to things that should be done before attending to victims.Notice things like how many cars are involved, how many victims there are, if there is a fire, smell of gas, or smoke. You may also want to see if there are any downed live wires or broken glass.You might also want to see if there are any children and remove them to a safe location if they are not injured.Make sure you are safe in the situation, too. You don’t want to be added to the list of casualties. For example, make sure there is no fire or smoke. If you are a smoker, put out your cigarette so that it doesn’t ignite any fluid draining from the car.

, Once you’ve made a quick assessment of the accident scene, call emergency services. Provide the person with whom you are speaking any information request to the best of your knowledge. Ask other witnesses and bystanders to call emergency services as well. These people may have additional information or noticed something about the accident and victim you didn’t. Remember that the more information emergency services has, the better they can respond to an accident.Give the operator information such as your location, the number of victims, and other details you noticed about the scene. Describe your specific location, including any landmarks, that can help responders find you. You’ll also want to tell the operator about any injuries that victims may have. Finally, let the dispatcher know if there are any traffic blockages that may hinder emergency services.Ask the person any questions you may have about securing the scene or administering first aid.
Be sure to stay on the line with the operator for as long as possible. This is true even if you have to momentarily put down the phone to secure the scene or help the victim.

, It’s important to let other drivers know that there is an accident that they need to avoid. Using flagmen, which are bystanders who warn traffic, or flares can alert oncoming traffic to slow down. In turn, this may alert other drivers that they need to stop and assist with the scene and any victims.Ignite flares if you have them and you are alone at the accident scene. If you don’t, make sure your emergency flashers are working. Set the flares a few hundred feet on either side of the accident. Only ignite flashers if there is no fuel leaking anywhere.
Tell other bystanders to alert oncoming traffic to slow down and avoid the accident scene. Make sure any flagmen stay out of the traffic lanes so that they don’t get injured. You may want to provide flagmen with reflective vests if available. Vests are a part of most car safety kits.

, Before you can approach an accident victim, it’s important to make sure the scene is safe for you, too. Check to see if you see fuel flowing, fire, smoke, or exposed wires. If this is the case, you may be better not providing aid and simply calling emergency services.Turn off the ignition switch of any car involved in the accident if the scene is safe. This can further protect any victims and you., If the accident victim is conscious, ask if the person wants assistance. This is an important step because not every accident victim may want help, even if it appears the person needs it. By not respecting a victim’s wishes, you could be subject to legal action under Good Samaritan laws.Ask the person “are you hurt and do you need assistance?” If the person responds yes, then provide the best aid you can. If the person says no, do not approach or provide aid to the person for any reason. Wait for professional help to arrive and let these people take over from there.
Make the best assessment you can if the person rejects help and then loses consciousness. In these cases, Good Samaritan laws will protect you. Good Samaritan laws protect volunteers who provide aid or assistance in emergencies from legal liability for injuries or damages.Remember to approach victims with caution even if they ask for assistance. The person could panic and hurt you, or something you do, such as moving the victim when you shouldn’t could hurt the victim even more.
Check to see if a victim is conscious by lightly shaking the person. If the person doesn’t respond, she is unconscious., Remember that many injuries are not visible on the skin. Unless the victim is in imminent danger from fire or something else, leave the person in place until emergency services arrive.Make sure to approach a victim you have to move by kneeling down to the person’s level. Not doing so can send someone into a panic and may cause further injury.
Remember that it’s better to move someone whose life is threatened by something like a possible explosion or fire than it is to leave them for fear of further injuring the victim. Consider the following phrase when making your decision “am I leaving the person better off than the way I found him?”, Breathing is an absolute necessity to any person’s life. If a person is unconscious or loses consciousness, it’s vital to check the victim’s airway to ensure the person is breathing properly. If not, you may need to give CPR to restart the circulatory and respiratory systems.Place your hand lightly on the victim’s forehead and very gently tilt back the head. Lift up the chin with two fingers and put your cheek by the victim’s mouth to see and feel if the person is breathing. You may also want to check the victim’s chest to see if it is rising and falling. If so, then the victim is breathing.Start CPR if the person is not breathing and you know how to perform it. If you do not know how to do CPR, do not attempt it. Instead, ask other bystanders if they are able or wait until emergency services arrives.
Roll the victim on to the person’s side to protect the airway. Make sure to support the person’s neck to protect or prevent injury.Make sure to let the emergency dispatcher know if the victim is breathing and/ or receiving CPR.

, Many advocates suggest providing first aid only if the victim has life threatening injuries. If the victim has injuries that require bandaging, splinting broken bones, or using other advanced first-aid techniques, it’s generally recommend to wait for professional help, especially if you know it is on the way.Keep the injured person as still as possible. Talking to a victim can go far in calming the person.Pack clothing or bandages around the spine or broken bones to prevent movement.
Stop any bleeding by applying direct pressure to the injury with bandages or clothing. Elevate the area bleeding to chest height if possible. If the victim is conscious, ask the person to apply pressure to help calm any shock., It’s common for car accident victims to be in or fall into shock from the accident. Shock can be life-threatening if not treated, so if you notice the most common symptom of shock—pale skin—then treat the person for it.Remember the phrase “if the face is pale, raise the tail.” A pale face is a good indicator of shock.
Loosen any tight clothing and put blankets, coats, or clothing over the victim to keep the person warm. If you are able, raise up the victim’s legs. Even resting the victims legs on your knees can help prevent or minimize shock. You may also want to shade the victim from the sun or falling rain to minimize shock., Chances are that the accident victim is scared and possibly hurt. Talking to and giving the victim encouraging words can help calm the person down until emergency services arrive.Offering encouraging words to the victim. For example, you could say “I know you’re hurting, but you’re strong and help is on the way. I’m going to stay with you as long as you need me.”
Hold the victim’s hand if you can. This can be a significant help for a person’s sense of survival.

, Once emergency services arrive, let the personnel take over the person’s care. These individuals are better trained to handle car accidents and any injuries.


Provide emergency services with any information they should know about care you’ve administered to the victim or other things you may have noticed. Ask if there is any way you can help them best do their job. In many cases, it will simply be speaking to the police when they arrive on the scene.

Use tepid or cool water on your scalp.,
Avoid shampoos with sulfates.,
Skip the blowdryer and straightener.,
Apply cold compresses.,
Moisturize the skin around the burn.,
Stay hydrated.,
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever.,
Avoid additional sun exposure.,
Leave blisters alone.",How to Deal with a Scalp Sunburn1," While lukewarm or tepid showers can be unpleasant, hot water on your damaged scalp will be even more unpleasant. Turn the water to a cooler temperature while washing your hair, which will be much more comfortable than hot water on your sunburnt skin.You can also apply a washcloth with cold water to your head while in the shower to help relieve the discomfort.;
, Your sunburned scalp needs plenty of moisture to help heal. Sulfates are salts found in many shampoos, which will dry out your scalp, doing even more damage. Read the ingredient label on your shampoo and avoid sulfates while your sunburn heals.Additionally, you should try to use shampoos and conditioners that contain 18-MEA, which will help provide moisture to your damaged scalp.Avoid conditioners that contain dimethicone as well, which is a form of silicone that can block pores and trap heat on your scalp, causing further damage and discomfort., Styling devices that use heat such as blowdryers and straightening irons will also cause unnecessary discomfort while your scalp is burnt.The heat radiating off the devices will also further dry and damage your scalp, so you should avoid them for roughly a week until your sunburn has healed.Most styling products contain chemicals that may irritate your sunburnt scalp as well. Try to minimize the hair products you use during this period.

, This may be more difficult for those with long, thick hair, but applying a cold compress to your scalp can also help cool your skin and soothe the discomfort.Using cold skim milk to soak the compress is a popular home remedy that some physicians also support.Proteins in the milk can help ease discomfort in addition to the cold soothing the pain.Though, you’ll probably want to rinse your hair quickly afterward.

, Moisturizers will help to cool and soothe your painful scalp as well. Topical moisturizers with aloe gel or hydrocortisone can help relieve any pain.Coconut oil is another safe moisturizer to help relieve sunburn pain.Choose products fortified with vitamins E and C, which will help limit the damage done to your scalp by the sunburn.You may have an easier time with coconut oil penetrating your hair to reach your scalp, but as an oil, it will give your hair a greasy look while you use it.
Skip after-sun products that contain lidocaine or benzocaine. They are common allergens, and you can find the same relief from these other moisturizers., Drinking plenty of water is another way to help moisturize your skin. Ensure you stay hydrated over the course of your sunburn by drinking at least eight glasses of water each day.The color of your urine is the easiest way to determine if you’re properly hydrated. It should be clear or very light yellow., An OTC painkiller such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen will also relieve pain from your sunburn.Take as directed and never exceed the recommended daily dosage.


If your child is the one with the sunburn, do not give your child a product containing aspirin due to the risk of a potentially life-threatening condition called Reye’s syndrome., You should keep your sunburnt scalp out of the sun as it heals.You may choose to wear a hat during this period, but pick something loose that doesn’t trap heat on your scalp or put pressure against your sunburn.

, If your sunburn is severe enough to form blisters on your scalp, do not pick or poke at them. Rupturing a blister from a sunburn is more likely to cause infection of the skin and eventual scarring.Keep your scalp dry and allow the blisters to heal without applying the moisturizing products directly to them."

Be aware of which essential oils work well with your skin (and skin type), as lavender oil, for example, may work wonders in treating mosquito bites but might also attract bees.


Tea tree oil is a great dermatological medicine. Not only does it help treat dandruff, athlete's foot, and acne, it also acts as an anti-inflammatory, itch-reliever, and contains antiviral properties that help ward off infection.Like tea tree oil, lavender oil can help treat swelling, reduce inflammation, and relieve the itching sensation associated with mosquito bites.Lavender oil, also like tea tree oil, may ward off other mosquitoes. Unlike tea tree oil, it may also attract bees.

, Peel a banana and save the banana for later. (You could eat it to keep your mind off of the bite!) Treat the area first with hand sanitizer, and then hold the inside (meat side) of the banana peel on the bite for 5-10 minutes, rubbing the peel onto the skin occasionally. The banana peel should relieve the itch and dry the skin out quickly., Mix one tablespoon of water with one tablespoon of dry meat tenderizer powder to make a paste. Apply the paste to affected areas.


Meat tenderizer powder, which contains papain or bromelain, helps draw out the venom of insect bites, or in this case, draw out the saliva from the mosquito bite, reducing the itching sensation.The enzymes that tenderize meat, papain or bromelain, can also be found in several natural ingredients: bromelain can be found in the juice and stem of pineapples,while papain can be found in papaya and mountain papaya.If you don't have meat tenderizer handy, but you are equipped with papaya or pineapple, cut out a piece of the meat of either fruit and apply to skin in a pinch.



, Place some clear nail polish on the mosquito bite and let dry for five minutes. Peel the nail polish off, reapplying if needed.

, Apple cider vinegar is a great itch-reliever of mosquito bites because of its acidity. The pH of cider vinegar is slightly less acidic, helping it ""balance out"" the pH of itchy red skin.There are two ways to apply the cider vinegar to the bite to relieve the itch:

To be comfortable, try lying in bed and propping your arm or leg up on a pile of pillows.
Stay in this position for at least 30 minutes to give the swelling time to go down.

, Insect bites itch because of the body's autoimmune reaction against the anticoagulants in the insect's saliva. This prevents your blood from clotting as the insect drinks. After the insect is gone, a small amount of the saliva remains in your skin.Use a pea-sized amount of an antihistamine cream and smear it into the bite until it is fully absorbed.
Take a non-sedating oral antihistamine such as 10 mg cetirizine once daily to help with symptoms. Use of both oral and topical antihistamines at the same time is not recommended.

, Hydrocortisone takes longer to start working, but once it does, the relief will last longer.1% hydrocortisone creams can be purchased over the counter and will reduce the inflammation.
Put a pea-sized amount on your finger and rub it into the bite until it soaks in completely.

, This will help draw out the fluids that have gathered under the skin making the bite puffy.Lotions that pramoxine will also help.


Reapply the lotion according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lotion will dry out the bite and remove any chemicals from the bugs saliva that are irritating your skin.

, If the bite is painful and swollen, pain medications should help.


Put a topical anesthetic on the bite to get immediate relief from the discomfort. A 2% Xylocaine Gel works well.If a topical pain reliever does not help, try an over the counter oral painkiller such as paracetamol (not available in the United States) or ibuprofen., If you were bitten by a mosquito, chances are you noticed immediately when it bit you, and squashed it then. However, some insects like ticks, secrete an anesthetic in their saliva so the animal or person they bite won't feel it, enabling them to feed longer. It is very important to remove ticks as soon as possible, because this reduces the chances of getting a tick borne disease.Use a tweezers to grip the tick as close as possible to your skin.Pull perpendicular to your skin with a steadily increasing pressure until the tick comes out. Don't twist or jerk the tick because this can cause the tick's body to break off from the head/mouth parts and leave them in your skin. You want to remove the whole tick.
If the head or mouth parts do remain in your skin, disinfect the tweezers with rubbing alcohol and remove them. If you cannot remove them yourself, have a doctor do it.
Do not apply nail polish, petroleum jelly, or a smouldering match to the tick and then wait for it to detach on its own. To minimize the risks of tick borne diseases, you should remove it yourself as soon as possible.

, This will clean the area, promote quick healing, and reduce the likelihood of it becoming infected.


Apply clean water and scrub the bite gently with a mild soap. This will prevent dirt and bacteria from getting into the wound and causing an infection.

, Put the disinfectant on a sterile cotton ball and then gently swab the bite. It may sting a little.The following chemicals have excellent germicidal properties and will work well.


Rubbing alcohol
Iodine scrub
Hydrogen peroxide, Triple antibiotic creams are available over the counter and are very effective. Always read and follow the instructions on the package. Consult a doctor before using these medications on infants or if you are pregnant.

, When you scratch you are irritating it and introducing bacteria into the bite with your fingers and fingernails. And, even worse, if you scratch it open, it will take longer to heal and is more likely to become infected.


If you have difficulty not scratching, try putting a band aid on it to cover it. This will remind you not to scratch and it will also prevent you from scratching in your sleep.

, Some insects carry serious diseases which have characteristic rashes.


A red donut or bull's eye around a tick bite is a symptom of Lyme Disease and must be treated as soon as possible with antibiotics.If you develop a fever with a red or black spotty rash, see a doctor to be screened for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

, Some insects carry diseases which do not produce rashes, but often come with flu-like symptoms. Insects carry different diseases in different parts of the world. So if you become sick after traveling and being bitten by insects, be sure to tell your doctor where you were traveling, that you were bitten, and what you symptoms are.See a doctor if you develop any of the following symptoms:Fever
Headache
Dizziness
Joint and muscle aches
Vomiting

, An epinephrine injection will be administered immediately. Symptoms include:Hives or rashes spreading beyond the site of the bite
Itching or swelling in other parts of your body besides where you were bitten
Difficulty breathing or wheezing
Difficulty swallowing
Dizziness
Vomiting
Racing heart

, By wearing long pants and long sleeves, you will reduce the amount of skin available to bite. While some insects like mosquitos can still bite through clothing, the number of bites you get will be reduced.

, This will protect you from ticks. After hiking, thoroughly check your entire body for ticks and promptly remove any you find.

, The most effective sprays contain DEET (N, N-diethylmeta-toluamide) or picaridin and are widely available.They will reduce mosquito, tick, and chigger bites.


Avoid getting the spray in your eyes and do not inhale it
Do not spray it into open wounds
Consult with a doctor before using bug repellants if you are pregnant
Consult with a doctor before using sprays on infants
Shower to wash the spray off your skin when you no longer need it.

, This will prevent you from getting bitten while you sleep.


Be sure to check the net for holes

, The protection should last through multiple washings., Be sure to check the collars regularly to prevent them from bringing fleas and ticks into the house. This can help keep pests out of your home.

, Mosquitos breed in standing water, so emptying them will reduce the mosquito population.

Try baking soda.,
Use honey.,
Apply apple cider vinegar to the area.,
Use fruit.,
Ice the bite.",How to Deal With a Mosquito Bite1," When a mosquito bites you, it injects some of its own saliva into your skin that released an enzyme which makes your blood easier to drink. Your body reacts to the proteins in the mosquito saliva and this causes an immunological reaction and inflammation. These cause an inflammatory response that leads to redness, bumps, and itching.Baking soda can neutralize the skin's response and provide release from itching.Some people gently dab baking soda into the area around the bite. You should only do this, however, if the bite is not irritated due to scratching as the baking soda can actually make symptoms worse in this case.Only do this if the bite is not irritated due to scratching, since the baking soda can cause further irritation in this case.;
, Raw honey possesses a variety of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.It is actually an ingredient in a many natural lotions and skin balms because of its potential to stop itch and skin irritation.A small dab of honey to the irritated portion of your skin can not only reduce itch but smooth out the bump.Honey's antibacterial properties also mean it can prevent the bite from becoming infected., The acidity in vinegar makes it a great choice when it comes to combating itch because it neutralizes the skin's response to histamines.Soak a cotton ball in vinegar and press it to the bite. If you want, you can put a band-aid over the cotton ball and leave it on. This could be helpful in reducing the temptation to itch in addition to providing relief from symptoms.There may be a mild burning sensation at first. Burning is particularly likely to occur if you already scratched the bite. This should diminish with time., There are some fruits that have been shown to reduce skin irritation and lessen the effects of a mosquito bite. This is mostly due to the strong antibacterial properties that can reduce your exposure to the histamines that cause itch.Use the pulpy inside layer of a banana. The oils of a banana can reduce itch. Apply the peel directly to the bite, rubbing the pulp into your skin.Lemon and lime are citrus fruits, making them anti-itch and anti-bacterial. Squeezing the juice from a lemon or lime into your skin can both reduce itch and prevent infection., Ice can reduce redness, swelling, and itching. It blocks histamines from getting deeper under the skin and increasing the severity of symptoms. Ice the bite shortly after you notice it. You can apply ice cubes directly on the skin or, if this is too intense of a cold for you, place them in a plastic bag and press that to your skin."

Get pain relief.",How to Cure a Small Bad Burn," Burns are categorized by depth and size and percent of total body surface area. A minor burn, typically called a first-degree burn, is characterized by redness to the outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis. With this type of burn, there is damage to this epithelial (top) layer without blistering. A minor burn should not cover more than 10% of your body surface.Identifiers of a first-degree burn include redness and pain. An example of such a burn is a sunburn.
A first-degree burn is typically painful but does not cover a large area (less than 10%) and is not life-threatening.;
, There are other burns, however, that are more serious and it's important that you know how to tell these apart from minor burns. Even if your burn is small, if it shows the following symptoms, this suggests that it is not a minor burn but a bad burn and should be seen by a doctor.



Second-degree burns: There are two types of second-degree burns, superficial and deep. With superficial burns, you'll experience redness and damage of the complete epithelial layer and into the second layer of your skin, the dermis. Other symptoms include blistering, pain, redness, and, potentially, bleeding. With deep burns, there is complete epithelial damage as well as deeper destruction of the dermis. The area will appear white, indicating damage to the blood vessels due to impaired circulation. This type of burn may not cause pain as the nerves may be damaged. There may or may not be blisters.Third-degree burn: This burn affects the the epidermis and dermis but also extends through to the subcutaneous tissue. This tissue will be dry and appear like leather. You must seek medical attention if you have a third-degree burn, and should go as soon as possible to the nearest emergency room as this type of burn will require surgical intervention.

, Consider the following factors as you determine whether to treat a small burn yourself or get medical assistance:



Degree — Most first-degree burns do not require medical attention, whereas deep second-degree and third-degree burns do need immediate medical attention. In addition, if you experience any blistering, even for a small burn, you should consult a physician for appropriate evaluation and antibiotic treatment.

Type — If you have experienced a chemical burn, seek medical attention after first irrigating the wound with flowing cool water to dilute the chemical agent.

Size — Consider how much of your body surface area (BSA) is affected by the burn(s). If you have burns over 10% of your BSA, you should seek medical attention. Follow the ""rule of nines,"" which breaks down the body as such: each leg represents 18%, each arm represents 9%, front and back of the trunk represent 18%, and the face represents 9% of total body surface area. You can use this formula to quickly add up how much surface area the burn covers.

Location — If you have experienced a burn in the genital region (even a first-degree burn), get medical assistance. Burns to the eyes should also be seen by a physician after copious irrigation with flowing cool water for at least five minutes. Further, burns on the hands, typically if they overlay a joint, often require medical attention.
Note that if you are ever uncertain or have questions about your burn, go the emergency room or consult your primary care physician.

, The first thing you want to do to treat a small burn is sooth the skin with cool (not cold) water to decrease its temperature. You can do this by running cool water over the burned area from a flowing source or soaking it in cool water. Allow for a least five minutes of soaking to decrease the temperature, so the skin will stop the burning process.Be sure to remove any rings or other tight items from the burned area, as the affected region will swell very quickly.
If the area is too large to be soaked, then go to the shower and run cool water over it for at least five minutes.
Rather than use flowing water, you could also place a clean towel soaked with cool tap water on the burn.

, Once the cooling has taken place, you will feel more comfortable and better able to examine and assess the burned area. You'll need to determine the degree of the burn as well as consider other factors, such as size, location, and type of burn. Assessing these factors will help you determine whether or not you can treat the burn yourself at home or whether you should seek medical attention.In most cases, if the wound is a small first-degree burn that is not on your genitals, hands, face, or joints, you can treat and care for the burn at home.

, Use a soft cloth and take care not to use anything abrasive. Be gentle and pat, don't rub, especially if there is any blistering or outer skin damage, as you don't want to pull off any of the skin.

, Once the affected area is dry, obtain an ointment and apply a generous amount so that you are covering the burn but not rubbing it in. The ointment can have antibiotics in it, but does not need to. Other options include petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel. If using aloe vera, make sure to use only 100% pure aloe vera gel and not a lotion or other formula.Neosporin is a good over-the-counter choice for an antibiotic ointment. If you are allergic to Neosporin, you can go to the doctor and obtain a prescription for bacitracin or bactroban.

, A protective dressing is a made from rolled gauze that you can purchase at any drugstore or pharmacy. After applying the antibiotic ointment, wrap the area in a circular fashion with the rolled gauze. Secure the dressing with surgical adhesive tape, also available at the drugstore.This protective dressing will do two functions. First, it will provide a protective barrier against re-injury. Second, the covering will also provide protection from infection, given that your skin’s natural barrier from infection has been compromised due to the burn.
This may not always be necessary, but keep it protected with dressings if you wish.

, Wash the wound daily with soap and water and re-apply neosporin and the gauze dressing. Continue to wash and change the dressing each day until the skin has healed. This is typically less than two weeks. Doing this routine every day can help prevent scarring of the burned tissue.Your skin may slough off, meaning it will cast or flake off. This is especially true for any blistered areas, and you should see the skin flake and cast itself off naturally. Do not pick at your skin or break blisters. This will only aggravate, irritate and further inflame the wounded area., If you notice any symptoms of infection, you should go to the emergency room or seek other immediate medical attention. If you are diabetic or on steroids or undertaking chemotherapy or have a weakened immune system for any reason, you are at risk for infection and should be especially vigilant in monitoring for these signs of infection. Signs that the wound has become infected include:Fever greater than 100°F or 38°C (orally).
Increasing erythema or redness of the wound site. Consider drawing a circle around the area of redness with a magic marker, if you are uncertain whether the redness is expanding. This can help you see whether an infection might be spreading.
Drainage of the wound. Look for any pus or greenish fluid seeping out of the wound.

, Simply apply petroleum jelly, 100% aloe vera gel, or antibiotic ointment or any prescription cream, such as Silvadene burn cream, that is prescribed specifically for you by your physician.If you are tempted to spray Solarcaine or any other topical numbing agent on the burned area, you should consult your physician before doing so. In general, small burns should not be very painful, unless it is infected or you have encountered some complication. Continuing pain is an indication that you should seek medical attention.

, If the pain of the burn is bothering you, you can take anti-inflammatory analgesic oral medication, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. Discuss these options with your doctor if you have any doubt about their usage and whether the medications are right for you.Ibuprofen (Advil) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. It also reduces hormones that trigger fever.
Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)is a drug that works as an analgesic, relieving pain by inhibiting pain signals in the brain. It is also an antipyretic, a drug that reduces fever.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safer than aspirin for children but has many of the same effects as aspirin.

Know what the symptoms of a sting are.,
Watch the sting closely.",How to Cure Insect Stings1," Go to a safe place, away from where you were stung, before treating any sting. Assess where and how many times you were stung.Leave the area quickly and calmly.;
, Carefully, use a fingernail or credit-card to scrape the stinger out of your skin. Avoid pulling the stinger out with tweezers, as this may release more venom.Stingers are usually barbed which is why they stick in the skin.
Wasps will not leave any stingers in your skin.

, Clean the wound gently with soap and water. Doing this will remove any potential bacteria and lower the risk of infection.Wash the area gently to avoid further agitation of the sting.

, Apply over-the-counter antihistamine creams to the affected area. Using a simple cold compress or putting ice on the area can bring relief as well.Avoid scratching the area, even if it itches. Scratching will only further irritate the sting.
Put an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream or ointment on the site twice a day for a few days. If the area is very itchy or swollen, take an oral antihistamine such as Benadryl or Zyrtec. Don't use both oral and topical antihistamines together.
For any pain, try using painkillers such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen.
Soak in cool water. Add a tablespoon of baking soda for every quart of water., Expect swelling, itchiness, or pain for a normal reaction to an insect sting. Severe reactions will bring about symptoms such as wheezing, nausea, hives, or difficulty swallowing or breathing.A normal reaction will be annoying but not life threatening.
A severe reaction will require emergency services.

, Monitor the sting for signs that it may be worsening.

Avoid areas populated by jellyfish.,
Recognize risky conditions.,
Heed warning signs.If you see a sign warning of jellyfish, it means that they have been spotted by officials.,
Watch for purple flags.,
Wear shoes when walking on the beach.Jellyfish and stray jellyfish tentacles can be very hard to see, and can remain venomous for a long time, even when washed ashore.,
Wear protective lotions.,
Wear a wetsuit.If you will be spending a lot of time in the water, or in deep waters, consider wearing more extensive coverage.The thick material of a wetsuit, and the fact that it will cover a large amount of your skin, makes it an effective deterrent to jellyfish stings.Clothing coated in petroleum jelly or similar substances is not a reliable protection against jellyfish stings.,
Do not touch jellyfish that have washed ashore.,
Swim near a lifeguard.Lifeguards are trained to help beachgoers in a variety of situations, including jellyfish attacks.,
Drive jellyfish away.,
Leave the water immediately if you see or suspect a jellyfish.",How to Avoid Getting Stung by Jellyfish," If at all possible, do not swim or spend time on the shore in areas known to be frequented by jellyfish. Choosing a lower-risk area is the easiest way to reduce your chances of being stung by a jellyfish.


You can ask lifeguards, beach officials, or local residents if you are unsure whether or not jellyfish are a danger in a given area.Learn what kinds, if any, are common, and how to treat stings.;
, Jellyfish may range near shore when there are strong winds.They can also appear in large numbers (known as a jellyfish blooms), so avoid the water when these occur., In areas were jellyfish are known to be a common threat, you may see permanent signs. Swim with caution in these areas, if at all.

, At many beaches, officials will fly purple flags during times that jellyfish or other dangerous marine animals are present.If you see these flags flying, this is a signal to stay out of the water to avoid getting stung.

, By wearing rubber-soled shoes when you walk on the beach, you will avoid accidentally stepping on them with your bare skin and getting stung., Some evidence shows that protective lotions such as Safe Sea may protect against jellyfish stings. Applying one of these lotions before you go in the water can be a good additional precaution.Look for protective lotions at pharmacies, and shops that sell diving and beach gear.

,
Some stores that sell diving equipment also carry special “stinger suits” that you can wear to prevent being stung by a jellyfish.Even if you wear a wetsuit, you should still practice caution and avoid jellyfish, as stings through wetsuits have been reported., Even if the jellyfish is dead, its poisonous cells can still cause a sting. Some varieties have very long tentacles (such as the Portuguese Man-of-War, that has tentacles up to fifty feet long), so it is best to stay far away from jellyfish.There are many different kinds and forms of jellyfish, and when they are washed ashore they may look like plastic bags or other debris. If you are not sure whether or not something is a jellyfish, it is best not to touch it at all.
Tell a lifeguard or other beach authority when you spot a jellyfish on the shore, so that it can be safely removed by someone trained to handle the creature.

, They will also be able to alert you when jellyfish are spotted.

, If you shuffle your feet when walking in shallow water, you may disturb and drive away some jellyfish or other creatures that have the potential to sting you., Often, you can see jellyfish in the water. They may look like a plastic bag or balloon floating at the surface of the water, and may come in groups.If you see a jellyfish in the water, calmly but quickly return to shore to avoid stings.


Tell a lifeguard or other beach authority when you spot a jellyfish in the water, so that a warning can be issued.

Apply aloe vera to the bite.,
Invest in Vick's Vapor Rub.,
Purchase corticosteroid creams.,
Use essential oils.",How to Deal With a Mosquito Bite2," Aloe vera, available at most supermarkets and drug stores, is one of the most popular methods for treating insect bites, burns, and other skin irritations.


Aloe vera has powerful anti-bacterial properties. It is 95% water and is otherwise comprised of a mix of essential oils, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, anti-inflammatory acids, and other components that make it effective at reducing swelling and itch.Apply dabs of aloe vera to the bite as long as symptoms persist. It will provide a relieving cooling sensation and also reduce itching, redness, and swelling., Vick's Vapor Rub is a popular topical ointment found at most drug stores and supermarkets and can be used to relieve symptoms of mosquito bites.


Menthol is one of the primary ingredients in Vick's Vapor Rub. Menthol aids the skin in two ways. It is oil rather than water soluble, so it can enter the nerves and muscles beneath the skin and diminish the spreading of pain and discomfort. It also stimulates the same receptors in the skin that respond to cold temperatures. This cools the bite, which relieves itch.Apply the recommended dosage to the infected area. Check the label for any warnings about allergies and other medications before applying.

, Corticosteroid creams are a variety of topical steroids, available at most drug stores, that reduce inflammation and swelling of the skin. They have been shown to effectively relieve symptoms of mosquito bites for some people.


Mometasone is the recommended option because it is medium strength and is not reabsorbed into the skin.Antibiotic treatment is not recommended for the early phase treatment in mosquito bites because it is unlikely that bacterial infections will develop that rapidly.
Corticosteroid creams take about 15 minutes to work. They reduce the skin's immune response to the bite, soothing the skin and eliminating changes to the skin.Another medication that works is a non-sedating H1 antihistamine such as Cetirizine.

, A variety of essential oils, available at some supermarkets and drug stores, can provide relief from symptoms associated with mosquito bites. Do not use too much, as this can further irritate your skin. A small dab, diluted with water, is all that is needed.


The cool agents in peppermint oil provide an instant cooling sensation. Relief from itch is quicker with peppermint oil than many other treatment options.Tea tree oil has many anti-inflammatory properties. It prevents itching and pain and also releases anti-bacterial agents into the skin that can reduce risk of infection.Lavender oil is another option. A small dab can reduce pain, itch, and prevent infections."
"
Try toothpaste.,
Go for items with high alcohol concentrations.",How to Deal With a Mosquito Bite3," Toothpaste works for many of the same reason Vick's Vapor Rub works. It contains menthol as a primary ingredient, which is very effective at reducing symptoms of a mosquito bite.Dab a small amount of toothpaste to the infected area and repeat as long as symptoms persist.
Make sure you are not allergic to any ingredients in the brand of toothpaste you use, paying particularly close attention to potential mint allergies. If you are allergic, applying toothpaste can make symptoms worse.

, Alcohol evaporates on the skin, a process that causes cooling. This reduces itch and also disinfects the bite. Grab items that list rubbing alcohol as a primary ingredient and apply them to the bite.


Most brands of mouthwash have a high concentration of alcohol.
If you do not use mouth wash, many hand sanitizers or hand soaps are alcohol-heavy.

Soak the wound in hot water.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatories.,
Get medical attention.,
Don't swim with stingrays.,
Shuffle your feet while you walk.,
Identify poisonous species.",How to Get Rid of a Stingray's Sting," Stingray stings are one of the most common significant injuries on tropical and warm water beaches and reefs.If you are stung, you'll very likely be in salt water, so it'll be easy to rinse the injury out before attempting anything else. The salt water will wash away any debris and help sanitize / clean your wound from any bacteria that may have been introduced into it or around it.


The pain from a stingray sting is sharp and excruciating, so it may be difficult to keep calm and think clearly. So before running out of the water, take a few seconds to clean around the puncture wound.
The most common areas to be stung by stingrays are the foot and lower leg.;
, Usually the stinger stays attached to the tail of a stingray when it attacks, but sometimes it will stay stuck in the wound. The size of stingers depends on the size of the stingray, but most are a little smaller and shorter than knitting needles — which is still a significant size to be punctured with. As long as the stinger isn't very large and stuck through an internal organ or major artery, it's best to quickly remove it with tweezers or by a steady hand while wearing thick rubber gloves.Most stingers produce poisonous venom, so be careful handling them.


Removing a stinger can be more painful in the short-term because of its serrated edges tearing tissue as you pull it out. However, removing it quickly may prevent more venom from getting into your wound, which is beneficial in the longer term.
Pulling out a stinger will also cause more blood to seep out of the wound for a few minutes, but it can help flush out any debris and bacteria. Be sure to rinse it in more sea water to help clean it.
Pulling out a stinger from an organ or major artery may trigger massive and fatal bleeding, so in these circumstances leave it in and seek medical attention as quick as you can.

, The most helpful thing you can do to combat the painful effects of the venom is to submerge your injury (preferably with the stinger removed) in hot water. The ideal temperature for the water is about 110 F or so, but soak the wound in water as hot as you can tolerate it without burning your skin.The hot water denatures (destroys) the protein in the venom, which renders it harmless, and the heat also helps to sanitize the wound. Soak your wound for between 30-90 minutes while maintaining the temperature of the water.Additional symptoms caused by the venom include: swollen lymph nodes near the wound, difficulty breathing, elevated heart rate, reduced blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, muscle cramps, headache, fainting and/or seizures.Be sure to test hot water for young children first before you soak their wounds in hot water.
The area around the puncture wound will swell and turn dark red, sometimes with a bluish tint.
Although the pain from the sting typically peaks in 1-2 hours, the symptoms from the venom can escalate over many hours.

, Some of the pain related to a stingray's sting is due to swelling of the puncture wound. Therefore, taking an OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), can be very helpful to reduce some discomfort in the short term.Painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol) can be used for the pain of stings too, but they don't impact the swelling.


Anti-inflammatories and analgesics (painkillers) should be considered short-term strategies for pain control while you get to the nearest hospital or walk-in clinic and recieve medical attention.
If you are bleeding profusely from the stingray's puncture wound, then take acetaminophen for some pain relief instead of NSAIDs because they tend to ""thin"" the blood and reduce your body's clotting ability.

, Although basic first aid, hot water and anti-inflammatories are certainly helpful, a wound from a stingray almost always needs medical attention.Before calling 9-1-1 or going to the emergency department, it's best to determine the person's age, weight and condition, as well as time of the sting, so the doctors can assess the potential seriousness of the situation. A smaller person (child) has a much greater risk of serious complications from the venom than a larger person.


For immediate pain control, the doctor will likely inject a local anesthetic into and around the wound. Nerve blocks can also be used.
Oral antibiotics may be given to prevent infection if the wound is deep or there is a significant delay in seeking treatment. Your doctor may also give opioids for severe pain.
The wound will be thoroughly cleaned, although stitches may not be applied until the doctor is confidant that there's great risk of infection. You also might get a tetanus shot.
If the stinger is venomous (not all are) antiserum medication will be given to reverse the side effects of the venom.
Your doctor also might want to do x-rays or another form of imaging to make sure that there are no barbs that are still stuck in your skin and to assess any internal damage that could have been done by penetrating barbs.

, Although stingrays tend to be non-aggressive creatures who try to avoid or escape from people, some larger species may confuse people as prey or as hostile threats.""Crocodile Hunter"" Steve Irwin died as a result of a stingray attack back in 2006, even though he thought he was safe. He was punctured multiple times through the lungs and heart and died shortly thereafter from the wounds. Thus, the best prevention for avoiding stings is to never knowingly swim with them and avoid areas / beaches that are considered their habitat.


Talk to local fishermen or surfers who are familiar with the coastlines and beaches about what areas to avoid.
Don't touch dead stingrays. The stingers obviously remain sharp after death, but venom can still be secreted from them also, so don't pick one up.

, If you have no intention of avoiding tropical and temperate beaches, then you should learn how to minimize the risk of stepping on a stingray. The best technique seems to be to slide or shuffle your feet through the sand instead of lifting your feet and taking steps.The stingrays detect this from a distance and swim away before you have a chance to accidentally step on them.


Stamping on the bottom as you slowly tread through murky water can also scare stingrays off from a distance.
Wearing footwear while in the water doesn't really make a difference in preventing a stingray injury. The stingers can easily penetrate rubber and nylon material.

, If you're scuba diving or snorkeling, learn to identify poisonous and/or aggressive species of stingrays (and other sea creatures) beforehand.The internet is full of information and colorful pictures to help you identify the different species of rays. Some, such as the manta ray for example, have no stinger and are harmless to people. Before going on a tropical beach holiday, prepare yourself and your family with this helpful info.


Learning the general habits of the local species while on vacation can keep you from getting into risky situations. Stingray injuries often occur in late summer and early fall, when they burrow in the sand in shallow surf.
Avoid going to remote areas that are isolated from medical help. The profuse bleeding and venom can be life threatening if medical help is delayed by more than a few hours.

Kill the black widow spider.",How to Avoid Getting Bitten by a Black Widow," Black widows enjoy cool areas and enjoy hanging in their web. Try to avoid looking under rocks or in woodpiles. If you ever see a black widow in its web, don't break or bother the spider. This will make the black widow feel threatened. As the saying goes, ""Don't hurt me and I won't hurt you."";
, If you will be working or digging outside, wear gloves to protect your hands from getting bitten. You might be going in areas wear black widows are trespassing and that won't be good. Insure you have good, quality leather gloves so your hands are protected enough.

, If you're outside, camping, or doing any other activity where black widows live it may be hard to avoid being bitten. Don't kill a black widow unless it is attacking you. Leave them alone if they are in their webs or are a few inches away. If you are sleeping outside, shake blankets, sleeping bags, pillows, clothes, and other products well.

, This can seem threatening to them and may cause them to attack. It may seem fun to you, but imagine someone destroying your house. Leave the spider's web alone, even if you don't see a black widow there.

, If you ever do see a black widow, don't hold, play, or feed it your food. Leave it alone and let it crawl away. If you have friends or family with you, tell them the same instructions.

, Spiders and bugs (including black widows) enjoy places that are dirty, thinking they're outside. This may give you a higher chance of getting bitten by a black widow. Clean your room every week, do the laundry, vacuum crumbs, mop the floor, and wash the dishes. This may make your house a safer atmosphere for you, your family, your friends, and your pets..

, Any black widow spiders may have landed in there without you noticing. Give them a good shake outside (a few inches away to avoid them coming back) and then bring them back inside.

, If you have old blankets, stuffed animals, quilts, clothes, pillows, and other soft items that have been sitting in a closet or attic for more than three weeks, wash them thoroughly with hot water and detergent. Plastic, hard items should be rinsed in the bathtub with hot water and (if safe) bleach.

, Food leads trails of dirt which may be attractive to black widows. After you eat, scrub the table with a soapy sponge or rag. Vacuum crumbs on the carpet or sweep them up.

, While it won't totally guarantee you're safe, washing your hands can be helpful to avoid poisoning from black widows or other bugs. Wash your hands after you eat, use the bathroom, visit a sick person, touch a pet, or take out the trash. Don't forget to use plenty of soup, warm water from the faucet isn't enough to kill germs.

, Black widows are found to move around and go to dark areas such as underneath the mattress, in the basement, or in the attic. Do not just let the spider live, black widows are dangerous and may even bite or kill you.

, If you're too afraid to kill the spider yourself, have someone else do it. Freaking out has no use and may cause everything to jumble up and be complicated. Ease yourself and try taking a deep breath to control yourself if you're getting really scared. Know that black widows rarely kill people if you're careful, and are more interested in eating other bugs for dinner.

, Hit the black widow with a spoon, broom, shoe, or anything else that can be hit with. Swap the spider harder and keep doing that till it's dead. However, be careful as it can run away fast like all spiders do. You can miss your swing, no matter how fast you are. If hitting doesn't work, try spraying aerosol pesticide at it the next time you see one.

Wear light-coloured clothing.,
Avoid perfumed soap and shampoo.,
Make sure your clothes and body are clean.,
Bees are most active during the warmest hours of the day.,
Swinging or swatting at an insect may cause it to sting.,
Do not run.,
Keep an eye on your food and drink.,
Do not burn scented candles or incense when eating or spending time outdoors.,
Leave wasp nests and bee hives well alone.,
Do not squash or crush wasps.",How to Avoid Bee or Wasp Stings," Bright floral colours attract bees and wasps.


Wear red. Insects cannot see red but are attracted to white and yellow.;
, Also avoid wearing perfume, cologne or aftershave. If you smell like a flower, the bee or wasp might think you are one.

, The smell of sweat seems to aggravate bees and make them more aggressive. It doesn't do much for humans either.

, Wasps are attracted to food, so don't leave food or sweet drinks out.

, Stay calm and move with gentle gestures.

, Calmly walk away without making a fuss or waving your hands about. Commotion will attract the insect, especially if it is a wasp.

, Wasps are attracted to food and sweet drinks. Bees will quite happily land on a sugary cake or cookie at your picnic.


Keep outdoor food inside containers before eating and after eating; less yummy odors to attract the insects.







, The scent will attract the insects.

, If someone knocks on your door, you are likely to want to see who. If that person starts punching, tearing or kicking your house, you're likely to get angry. Wasps and bees are no different and they'll defend their home. Keep well away!


Wasp nests often look like papery constructions.







, The odor that is released will attract all of its buddies to defend (or avenge) and that is something nobody wants to bring down on themselves.

Get a safe distance away.,
Elevate the area and remove any tight-fitting clothing.,
Ice the area.,
Apply vinegar to the sting.,
Take an antihistamine (Benadryl) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).,
Keep it clean to prevent infection.,
If the person stung is having an allergic reaction, call the Emergency Services or your local emergency services.,
Use toothpaste.,
If you're in a real pinch, slather on some honey.,
Consider pharmaceuticals, but don't depend on them.",How to Treat a Wasp or Hornet Sting," Unlike bees, wasps and hornets do not die after stinging, and they will not leave their stinger in your flesh. They can, however, sting multiple times. Before treating the sting, make sure you are no longer near the wasp or hornet.
, If the sting is on your legs, arms, hands, or feet, you'll want to remove any tight clothes, shoes, or jewelry immediately. Swelling will occur, in which case it'll be very hard to remove these items later.


The arm or leg should be elevated for this purpose as well. The less it swells, the better you'll feel, so keep those limbs elevated. If it's on your leg, lay down as soon as you can.

, The best thing you can do for this sting is to ice it. Don't bother with the pharmaceuticals, don't bother with the old wives' tales of other remedies -- just place ice in a wrap of some sort and keep it on the area for 10 minutes. Remove it when it's getting too cold (you'll definitely know when that is), and repeat it in 10 minute increments. The pain and itchiness will subside almost immediately.


Use an ice pack, ice cubes wrapped in a towel, or whatever you have lying around. You probably don't want the ice directly on your skin, so be sure to wrap it up.

, Dab a cotton ball or paper towel into white vinegar, and wipe it over the sting. Wasp and hornet stings are alkaline, which means that they can be neutralized by an acidic substance like vinegar. You may need to do this every few minutes since vinegar dries quickly.

You can also soak a bandage in vinegar and place it onto the affected area. Change the bandage every few hours or as needed. This will keep vinegar on the wound at all times.

, These agents help the wasp or hornet sting by relieving the itching and burning sensation (antihistamine) and pain (acetaminophen). Symptoms will probably last 2-5 days; follow the instructions on the label for dosage.For those under 18, aspirin is not advised., Be sure to regularly clean the wound with soap and water. A sting is nothing to worry about unless it gets infected (or if you're allergic); by keeping it clean, you drastically reduce your chances of anything becoming serious.

, If the victim is having a bad reaction, they may be experiencing anaphylaxis. Call for immediate emergency medical assistance if you notice the following symptoms:Difficulty breathing or wheezing
Tightness in the throat
Trouble speaking
Nausea or vomiting
Fast heartbeat or pulse
Skin that severely itches, tingles, swells, or turns red
Anxiety or dizziness
Loss of consciousness

If an anaphylaxis action plan has been established and an Epipen is available, don't wait; inject it. Do not worry about harming the other person. The less time wasted, the better.



, The remedy second to the miracle powers of ice is toothpaste. The texture and bite somehow fool the brain into feeling like the area is being scratched, so there's psychological satisfaction as well.Dab a bit on the area, wait a few minutes, and the symptoms will subside.


You'll need to reapply in about 5 hours or so -- or whenever the symptoms wear off. That's probably enough to find (or make) ice, though -- probably a preferable option.

, It's not the best home remedy, but it can lessen your symptoms and get you feeling a bit better, albeit very temporarily (probably around half an hour). Just enough time to get a hold of a better cure.


You may have read about using a tea bag or tobacco on the area. Don't bother - neither ""remedy"" will not help your sting., There are a number of products out there on the market for stings, but none of them is as good as an old-fashioned bag of ice. But if you're curious, here are some details.Skeeter Stik or Survivor Gel Stick are basically tubes of ""travel-relief"" when camping or otherwise away from the amenities of everyday life. It's a great idea in theory, but not very effective. Some may contain ammonia, which can irritate your skin.
Caladryl can help. However, most creams, like Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream, are just okay. You might have relief for a few minutes. Hydrocortisone cream is better, but caladryl is best.

Avoid spots where chiggers are commonly found.,
Sit strategically.,
Plan activities when chiggers are least active.,
Dress to prevent chigger bites.,
Use a bug repellent as a barrier.,
Apply sulfur.,
Shower after exposure.,
Keep outdoor areas well-groomed.,
Treat your lawn with a mild insecticide.,
Discourage rodents.",How to Avoid Chigger Bites," In the United States, chiggers are most common in the humidity of the Southeast and the Midwest. Chiggers thrive on warmth and moisture. Avoid walking through brush, tall grass, and weeds. Avoid marshes, swamps, and wooded habitats with rotting leaves and stick piles.


Chiggers often wait in the underbrush and low shrubs to attach to small animals, which are their natural hosts. Stay away from bushes and vines that might brush against your body and deposit chiggers.Chiggers rarely move very far from the sites where they hatch, resulting in patches of chiggers in damp and warm areas.;
, Avoid sitting or lying directly on the ground during the summer months. Instead, bring a folding chair or blanket to spread beneath you. Avoid perching on stumps or logs. Instead, sit on an object that is dry and hot, such as a rock that is warm from the sun.

, Chiggers are most likely to bite in the afternoons of the spring and summer, when the ground temperature is between 77–86 °F (25–30 °C). They become inactive below 60 °F (15.6 °C), and die when the temperature drops below 42 °F (5.6 °C). During chigger season, plan outdoor excursions when the weather is cool or dry.

, Wear long pants and shirts with long sleeves when in a chigger habitat. Tightly woven fabric with minimal openings provide the most protection. Tuck your shirt into your pants to keep your skin from being exposed, as chiggers often target the waistband area.Chiggers also target the thin skin on your ankles, around your crotch, under your arms, and behind your knees, so keep those areas covered.


Wear shoes and socks to avoid chigger bites on the feet and ankles. If you will be in a particularly high-risk area for chigger bites, such as a marsh or swamp, tuck your pants into a pair of high socks to prevent chiggers crawling onto the ankle.

, Buy an insect repellent containing diethyl meta-toluamide (DEET) or Permethrin at any store that sells camping supplies. Spray an insect repellent that contains DEET around the tops of your socks, your waist, and at your ankles to keep chiggers from getting under your clothes.DEET may be applied to clothing or skin, but should be washed from the skin as soon as possible. Spray a repellent that contains Permethrin on your clothes only.
Carefully follow the instructions when using Permethrin and DEET. Permethrin can cause burning or itching if it comes into contact with your skin, and DEET can do the same if left on the skin for hours. DEET and Permethrin are not classified as carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic to humans.Look for lotions and sprays that advertise repelling chiggers or red bugs specifically, in addition to ticks and mosquitoes.

, If you are wary of the chemicals in DEET and Permethrin, you can try dusting your clothing with sulfur powder. It will, however, smell like rotten eggs. Powdered sulfur can be purchased at any pharmacy, nursery, or feed store., Take a warm shower or bath soon after having been in a potential chigger habitat to wash off any chiggers that may have attached to your body. Contrary to popular belief, chiggers do not burrow under the skin, and can be easily brushed or washed off the body. Thoroughly rubbing your skin with a towel also helps dislodge chiggers.


Wash your clothing after tromping through chigger territory. You will want to clean any lingering mites off your clothing, as well as any repellent you have applied.

, Mow long grass to cut down on chigger-infested foliage. Keeping your grass short allows sun to penetrate your lawn, drying out the grass and dirt. Chiggers thrive in moisture and avoid high heat., Apply a few ounces of dish soap in a gallon of water to areas near bushes to curb the populations of chiggers and other pest populations. Use chemical pesticides containing permethrin, cyfluthrin, diazinon,and carbaryl sparingly, as they may wipe out healthy insect and animal populations., Chiggers live on rodents and small animals that live in brush and woodpiles. Remove any brush and wood debris from your yard. Use gardening gloves and wash your skin with soapy water after working. Put up a fence if you have a serious chigger-host problem.Secure the lids of your trash cans to discourage visits from small animals."

Choose an aloe plant with mature leaves growing near the base of the plant. If there are no leaves growing at the root of the plant, then it is not ready for harvesting.


Aloe vera plants are inexpensive and don't require much care. They are a type of succulent, which need lots of light, but little water. Aloe vera plants can last for years if well cared for.;
, You'll need to cut, not tear, the leaves. Choose healthy green leaves near the base of the plant and cut at an angle., Leave the plant for 10 to 15 minutes. The gel will slowly leak from the leaf into your container.


If you cut too many aloe leaves and need to store them, simply wrap the leaves in foil or place in a sandwich bag. Refrigerate them for up to five days., Using a sharp knife, cut off the tip and rough sides of the leaf. Then slice lengthwise through the leaf.

Consult your physician.",How to Treat Bed Bug Bites," Bedbug bites commonly resemble other insect bites, including mosquito bites. They typically involve a raised, reddish bump but can also appear as a blister. Bedbug bites are very difficult to distinguish from other insect bites; even a clinical physician cannot usually diagnose bites simply by looking at them.Bedbugs do, however, have a unique bite pattern. Although some bites may appear alone, most bites occur in a row of three to five bites (termed ""breakfast, lunch, and dinner"") or in a cluster of red bumps (a rash called bedbug dermatitis). The bites often appear in a zig-zag formation, but may appear in a straight line if the bugs bite you in the morning.
Bites tend to occur on exposed areas of the body, such as the neck, face, feet, and arms. In contrast to mosquito bites, bedbug bites rarely occur on the back of the knees or in the folds of the skin.
The bumps or the rash typically resolve themselves within one two weeks. However, although an individual bite or set of bites may heal, if you have not eradicated the problem through pest extermination, then you may continue to get bitten. As long as there are bedbugs, they will try to get at you.;
, Consider, for example, if you notice the bites after waking up when previously you hadn't noticed them. However, this can also be difficult to determine because each person's reaction time can vary significantly. Symptoms that result from the bite can manifest at any point from a couple of hours to more than a week after the bite occurred.


Bedbug bites can have a long incubation period. Visible signs of the bite (a red, itchy bump) can appear up to 10 days after you were initially bitten.

, Start with where you sleep. Bedbugs want to be where people are so they can get the warm blood of humans. A telling sign is red spots on the sheets. These may come from a bedbug that was squashed after feeding, or from the bites left on you when the bug finished feeding on you.Inspect your entire mattress, including the lining and seams. Look for sleeping bedbugs, carcasses, empty skins (their exoskeletons) and feces (this will look like little black spots or smudges). Check your sheets, pillow cases, and pillows as well.
It is very difficult to see and catch a living bedbug. They are tiny brownish insects with broad, oval-shaped bodies. are very good at hiding. However, finding a bedbug is the only way to confirm that that is indeed what bit you., You can also see a doctor for diagnosis if you do not find signs of bedbugs in your bed and cannot identify the source of the bites or rash. However, there is a very good chance that your physician will not be able to firmly diagnose that you have been bitten by a bedbug because the symptoms look so similar to those that result from other insect bites and skin conditions. Nevertheless, you may feel comforted by going to see your doctor, who can confirm for you that bedbugs pose little physical threat to humans.


Your doctor may prescribe a topical corticosteroid ointment to help relieve itching and inflammation. These ointments are stronger than the ones you can buy over the counter.

, This is the surest way to confirm that you have been bitten by a bedbug. An exterminator will search your home and be able to confirm whether or not you have an infestation on your hands.


An exterminator will know what to look for and can also then treat your home to remove the bedbugs and prevent future bites from occurring.
Home foggers and and bug sprays will not usually kill a bedbug infestation.To make sure you eradicate bedbugs from your home, go with a professional exterminator.

, Wash the area with mild soap and water; use a bar of soap and enough water to wet surface of your hands. Work the soap in your hands into thick, soapy lather. Rub the lather over the affected area liberally. Repeat until the entire area is covered. Leave on and do not rinse. Allow the soap lather to dry over the bitten areas. You should experience immediate relief from itching.Washing the bites with soapy water can help alleviate itchiness and prevent a skin infection.

, You can try a number of the following remedies to relieve the itching associated with the bites. These all use products you probably already have on hand.


Make a paste of baking soda and water. Slowly add small amounts of water to the baking soda and stir until you have a thick paste. Apply a thick coat of the paste to your bedbug bites. Allow the paste to dry and stay on the rash for an hour or more before washing it off with warm water.
Saturate a cotton ball with lemon juice, St. John's Wort or witch hazel, all of which are natural astringents. Dab at the rash with the cotton ball to help dry it out and control the itch.
Apply the gel from an aloe plant to bedbug bites. Use pure 100% aloe vera gel. Aloe contains both antibiotic and anti-fungal properties, which can help prevent against a secondary infection due to scratching.

, A cream that contains hydrocortisone or cortisone, such as Cortaid, can reduce inflammation and itching. You can buy a 1% hydrocortisone cream from any drugstore or pharmacy. Your doctor can tell you which cream and brand is ideal for you.Follow the package's directions to apply the cream correctly. The cream is very mild and does not cause side effects if used for a short period of time, like a week.
You can also get a stronger corticosteroid cream with a doctor's prescription.

, When applied to the bites, calamine lotion may provide some symptomatic relief from the itching. It will also help to dry the rash and protect the skin as it heals., Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can help control the allergic reaction (the swelling and rash) associated with the bites.Follow package instructions for proper dosages.
Be aware that Benadryl can cause drowsiness and you should avoid driving while taking it.
You could also try an OTC antihistamine cream that you apply topically to the affected area.

, If the bites are causing you any discomfort or pain, you can take OTC anti-inflammatory analgesic oral medication, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. Discuss these options with your doctor if you have any doubt about their usage and whether these medications are right for you.Ibuprofen (Advil) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. It also reduces hormones that trigger fever.
Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)is a drug that works as an analgesic, relieving pain by inhibiting pain signals in the brain. It is also an antipyretic, a drug that reduces fever. Do not give to children, however.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safer than aspirin for children and has many of the same effects as aspirin. It is not a NSAID, however, and will not reduce inflammation.

, See your doctor if your bite does not clear up within the natural course of a bedbug bite (one to two weeks). You should also see a doctor for treatment if you have any of the following:Multiple bites
Blisters
Signs of skin infection (tenderness or oozing discharge)
An allergic skin reaction (reddened, swollen skin or hives).
Bedbug bites, like all insect bites, can become infected through excessive scratching, as underneath the fingernails lies a host of bacterial pathogens. If your bites become infected, they will appear red and swollen, feel tender and may drain pus. Typically there will not be a fever unless a substantial area of the skin is involved. If you experience any of these symptoms, you must seek medical attention as it points to a secondary infection. Your physician may prescribe antibiotic therapy or, if the infection is mild, an antiseptic medication that you can buy without a prescription.If you experience a severe allergic reaction, your doctor may want to give you an injection of an antihistamine, corticosteroid, or epinephrine (adrenaline)."

Engage in regular exercise.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Drink caffeine in moderation.,
Ensure you get all the necessary vitamins and minerals.,
Get enough sleep.,
Practice yoga.",How to Be Energetic and Fun Loving1," Exercise helps improve your overall health, makes you stronger, and makes your body work more efficiently. All these combined will make you more energetic.


Choose exercise activities that you enjoy. Some people associate exercising with going to the gym or physical education class, but that is only a small fraction of what exercise can be. You can go walking, hiking, dancing, bicycling, or jogging, or you can play tennis, golf, racquetball, or some other sport.
Not only will exercise improve your health and make you feel more energetic, it also helps you to become happier, more positive, and less anxious.
Engage in some form of physical exercise at least 3-4 times or 150 minutes per week.;
, Our bodies need fuel for energy; that fuel is food. Build your diet around healthy non-processed foods that provide all the necessary nutrients and help raise your energy levels.Avoid foods high in sugar and low in nutrition (called empty-calorie foods), such as pre-packaged meals, chips, sodas, and candy bars. These foods actually decrease energy levels after providing a very short energy boost.An ideal mix of ingredients to eat includes foods that provide complex carbohydrates, are low in fat, and contain moderate amount of protein.
Spread your daily calories evenly and avoid skipping a meal only to have a huge meal later. If possible, eat five meals a day, keeping the amount of calories in a day where you want.
Do not skip any meals. This will cause a loss of energy. Your body needs food to keep going in the same way a vehicle needs gas to keep going.
Also, drink plenty of water. Dehydration leads to low energy. Drink 8-9 glasses of water each day.

, Consuming caffeine can have a positive effect on your energy levels. In addition to boosting your mental and physical energy, caffeine also increases your fat oxidation and metabolic rate.Caution: caffeine is known to cause sleeplessness and jitteriness. The amount of caffeine you would need to consume to experience these effects differs from person to person and depends on your sensitivity to caffeine.
The majority of healthy adults can safely consume caffeine in the amount of 400 milligrams (mg) a day.

, B vitamins and iron are important micronutrients that help support your energy levels. If you are deficient in these nutrients, you can experience lowered energy levels.B vitamins and iron are extremely important for your body’s ability to create and use energy. Vitamin 12, vitamin 6, thiamine, niacin, and folic acid support your body’s energy metabolism, while iron is needed for healthy red blood cells that are responsible for carrying oxygen.
Deficiency in B vitamins and iron can lead to anemia and fatigue.If you are not getting enough of these and other micronutrients in your diet, consider taking a multivitamin with iron and essential B vitamins.

, If you suffer from lack of energy, it might be because you are not getting enough sleep. According to the Sleep Foundation, adults should get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night.Make sure you get enough sleep. Set a regular bedtime and stick to it every night, even during the weekends. If you need to adjust your bedtime, make small daily increments (15 min earlier every night) until you achieve the target bedtime. Also, wake up the same time every morning.Avoid heavy meals and too much alcohol just before bedtime as these might make sleeping more difficult.
If you suffer from insomnia or sleep disturbances, it can lead to fatigue and lack of motivation. However, fatigue can also be a sign of a more serious health condition. If you don't get energized by getting enough sleep and good nutrition, you should get evaluated by your doctor., Practicing yoga can help reduce fatigue and boost your energy levels in addition to the other health benefits it has to your muscles and cardiovascular system.During yoga poses, breathe deeply to bring fresh oxygen to your blood. This will stimulate your nervous system and make you feel more energetic.Try the following breathing exercise: sit on the floor with your spine straight. Breathe in through your nose and count to four. Then exhale while counting to eight. Repeat.
Try the Uttanasana yoga pose, which is an energizing forward bend: start by standing and bending forward and down. Keep your knees slightly bent and allow your upper body to hang toward the toes. Breathe deeply, while allowing your spine to lengthen."

Have realistic expectations.,
Try to relax.,
Avoid denial.,
Redefine attractiveness.,
Embrace your past, but don't try to relive it.,
Be proud and grateful.",How to Accept That You're Getting Older1," Our culture encourages people to think they can be young forever if they just use the right creams and take the right supplements. The fact is, this just isn't true. As you enter your later years, try to develop realistic (not pessimistic) expectations of what getting older will actually be like.Don't expect the worst--having a negative view of the future can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Likewise though, don't expect to be able to do everything you did in your 20s. If you have realistic expectations about what you will and will not be able to do, the transition to this period of life will be easier.
Even the most youthful 90 year old, for example, usually won't be found skateboarding or deep sea diving. In fact, most people who live to this age will need help with tasks like getting groceries from the store. This doesn't mean, however, that you won't be able to take a stroll in the park with friends or play your favorite instrument.;
, Many people panic when they realize they are getting older. The result is a ""fight or flight"" response that causes people to frantically look for a solution, rushing out to buy the latest miracle cure. Try to stay calm and take things in stride.Being calm allows for more sober reflection on the situation. Thinking clearly allows us to come to terms with reality sooner. This, in turn, makes it possible to start accepting the changes that aging brings and finding happiness in this new stage of life.

, There's nothing wrong with doing what you can to look and feel your best in later years. However, accepting you are getting older means you shouldn't try to mask or hide your age from others (or yourself).


If you putting on a mask of honey and yogurt makes your skin feel better or smoother or slows wrinkling, great. Healthy activities that help you look your best are fine. Don't try to do things to ""cover up"" your age though. It might be time, for example, to ditch the super-tight cut offs or toupee.Clinging to illusions of physical youth keeps us dependent on the validation of others, rather than helping us accept ourselves for who we now are.Think carefully before getting plastic surgery. The jury is out on the extent to which it actually makes people feel more attractive. What is clear is that sometimes when you get work done in one area, it only serves highlight wrinkles in another. This can start you down a path of one procedure after another, after another. Before you get one of these procedures, think about whether this might be the start of a road you don't really want to go down. It is often better to accept yourself for who you are., To extent you are able, try to rethink what attractiveness means, focusing on the whole person rather than a youthful physique. You are never going to look like a 20 year old again, but being attractive in your 40s, 50s, and 60s means something different than it did when you were in your 20s.Being self-assured and healthy is a different, more mature kind of beauty that you can aspire to. It will give you a sense of self-worth and attractiveness that trying (unsuccessfully) to look like your former self will not achieve.This may mean you have to argue with your inner voice. Because of the culture we live in, there's probably going to be a voice in your head saying ""I look so old"" or ""I'm getting fat."" Speak up against that inner voice, and counter it with positive statements like ""I am healthy and loved."", Your past is a huge part of who you are. Reflecting on where you've been can help you become a more mature person, and reflecting on the changes you've gone through before can help you accept the changes you are experiencing now. Trying to relive the past as a way to cling to your youth, however, only delays acceptance of who you are now.A certain amount of nostalgia is inevitable and normal, but resist the temptation to try to recreate the past. For example, if you want to play football again to recapture some of the joy you experienced when you were younger, then keep in mind that you may not be able to play as hard or as long as you used to. You will probably need to start slow and build up your strength and endurance. You may also want to check with your doctor first to ensure that you are healthy enough to play.

, The fact that you are getting older means you survived. Not everyone does.Further, the life experiences you have had have taught you lessons and, hopefully, granted you a wisdom younger people don't have.Be proud of what you have achieved and grateful for your life experience.


Your perspective can be an advantage. You may know things about life that many people do not. Reflect on your life and see what lessons you can find there. Think about how you can make this wisdom valuable to others.
Try keeping a gratitude journal to help you keep track of all of the things you feel grateful for. Keeping a gratitude journal or even just telling a loved one about a few things you feel grateful for each day can increase your happiness and well-being.For example, you might note that you feel grateful for your friends, a beautiful sunset, or even just a good cup of coffee. Keep adding items to your list every day and check it from time to time to remind yourself about what makes you feel grateful.

Spread your food across the day.",How to Protect Your Mind With Brain Foods1," Fish is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, vitamins A and D, phosphorous, magnesium, and iodine (if saltwater), many of which are important for brain health. Fish oil is the richest source of fat vital to brain development in unborn babies and infants, and it helps maintain the brain throughout life.Eat about 14 ounces of fish a week or three servings that are about the size of your fist. Fish oil is available in food supplements. You can find it fortified with DHA, as well. It is also sold as Omega 3 Oil in its own separate supplements. This is especially important for continued brain and cardiovascular health;
, Dark, leafy greens such as kale and spinach are essential for a healthy mind and body. These contain high levels of vitamin E and folate.Vitamin E likely helps protect your brain's neurons,while the relationship between folate and brain health isn't as clear. It's likely that it helps keep down levels of homocysteine in the brain, as this amino acid may lead to nerve cell death if the levels are too high.You can also try avocado for a good source of vitamin E, as well as sunflower seeds., Blueberries have been shown to help with short term memory loss in some studies, so eat them a few times a week.Other berries have brain-boosting benefits, too, such as strawberries and acai berries., Tomatoes, which can contain high levels of lycopene, help protect against free radical cell damage, which in turn, may help protect against dementia., Nuts contain alpha linolenic acid (ALA), and they have anti-inflammatory properties. These qualities help increase blood flow, which makes your brain happy with more oxygen.They are also high in vitamin E., Ginger, along with other foods such as berries, soy products, and teas, help protect your glial cells. These cells likely remove toxins from the brain, protecting you from diseases such as Alzheimer's.Try ginger tea, or add ginger to a stir fry for extra spice.

, The theanine(an amino acid) in green tea may help to improve memory and attention span.Drink one to three cups of green tea daily., Whole grains are a part of an overall healthy diet that will improve your general health. The healthier your body is, the healthier your brain is. They can also help lower your risk for high blood pressure, which keeps your brain healthier.If you're over age 9, you should be getting at least 3 to 5 servings of whole grains per day, up to 6 or 7 servings as an adult. To get your servings in, try oatmeal, whole wheat bread, quinoa, brown rice, or whole wheat pasta., Eating small meals throughout the day, as opposed to one large meal, can help with brain health. It keeps your blood sugar level throughout the day, providing the energy your brain needs. Try four to six meals instead of three to five."

Slow the spread of venom.",How to Treat Spider Bites2," Brazilian Wandering spiders are large, aggressive nocturnal spiders found in South America. They build no webs, roam at night, and can be found in banana clusters or hiding in a dark environment. Their bites produce localized swelling and pain that radiates toward the torso, and may be accompanied by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hypertension, breathing difficulties and, in males, an erection. Anti-venoms exist to help relieve symptoms; deaths are rare.

, It's important to get immediate treatment, especially for children.

Slow the venom's spread.",How to Treat Spider Bites3," Black widows and brown recluses are the only two types of dangerously poisonous spiders in the US. They both reside in warm climates and prefer dark, dry places like closets and wood piles. Here's what to look for:Black widows are large, glossy black spiders with a red hourglass shape on their belly. They are found throughout North America. The bite may feel like a pinprick, and the site of the bite will be slightly red and swollen. Within thirty minutes to a few hours, however, intense pain and stiffness will begin. Severe abdominal pain, nausea, fever or chills may develop. Black widow bites are generally not fatal to healthy adults, and an anti-venom exists to relieve symptoms. Brown recluse spiders can be many different shades of brown, but they have a violin-shaped marking on their back and long, spindly legs. Their bite initially stings, then deepens into intense pain over the next eight hours. A fluid-filled blister that turns into a steadily-enlarging open sore appears, and permanent tissue damage is preceded by a blue and red “target sign” around the wound site. Other symptoms include a fever, rash, and nausea. Brown recluse spider bites can produce scarring, but have caused no deaths in the United States. There is no anti-venom, but treatments of bite lesions exist via surgery and antibiotics.

, See a medical professional immediately for treatment. Move as little as possible to further slow the spread of venom.

, This will help prevent infection.

, This will help slow the spread of the venom and bring down the swelling.

, If the bite is on an arm or a leg, elevate the limb and tie a snug bandage above the bite. Be careful not to cut off circulation!

If you suspect that you were bitten by a dangerous spider, go to the sub-sections below to confirm identity and administer proper first aid. Sometimes identification is not possible, but knowing what species of spider bit you can be helpful to a medical professional when determining treatment.


Try to save the specimen, even if it's squashed. Rubbing alcohol can be used to preserve a spider.
If you cannot find the spider, move on to cleaning and examining the bite area.

,, This will ease the pain of the bite and help the swelling go down for 20 to 30 min.

, This is helpful for reducing inflammation and swelling.

, Children or teenagers recovering from chickenpox or who have flu-like symptoms should not take Aspirin. , Within a few days, the swelling should go down and the bitten area should feel less painful. Call the poison control center or see a doctor if symptoms don't improve.

, In some cases, a bite from a normally non-dangerous spider can cause an allergic reaction. Call emergency medical services immediately if the person with the spider bite has the following symptoms:

Control your stress.,
Deal with sadness.,
Find an activity that makes you happy.,
Learn to think more positively.,
Honor and respect yourself.,
Break out of your comfort zone.",How to Be Energetic and Fun Loving2," Stress can be a debilitating condition associated with emotional and physical tension, and anxiety. In order to bring your fun-loving side up, try to reduce or eliminate stress in your life.Stress can result from both the negative (such as trouble at work or school) and positive (planning a friend's birthday party) events in your life.
Nobody is a stranger to stress; however, if you experience stress long-term, it can negatively impact your health.
Take steps to control stress and allow yourself to be more fun loving. Stress can be controlled by exercising regularly, resting and relaxing enough, eating a healthy diet, and treating yourself to something special.

, Like stress, sadness or feeling blue can also affect your emotional and physical well being and dampen your fun-loving side.


If you are sad, you may also suffer from low enthusiasm, lethargy, and/or low self-esteem. If you are feeling low in energy, drive, and hope, it is more challenging to be fun-lovingSometimes beating sadness can be as easy as leaving the house and diverting your sadness to something positive and fun.
When you are feeling blue you might keep yourself isolated and avoid spending time with others. If you find yourself spending all your time alone at home, force yourself out of the house.
You can go shopping, walking, or catch a funny movie at the theater. Anything that gets you out of the house and spend time with your friends and family will do.
The hardest step is to leave the house, but once you do it and are out, you can often find yourself forgetting the sadness and enjoying life.
If you cannot beat your sadness, consider seeking medical attention to determine if you may suffer from depression. Your doctor can prescribe antidepressants to treat depression.
Seasonal depression is a common condition; an estimated 6.7% of U.S. population suffered from at least one depressive episode in 2013.Caution: serious, untreated depression can lead to suicidal thoughts. If you or someone you know suffer from depression or a depressive episode, seek help immediately.

, If you feel that you are not fun-loving because you never do anything that is fun, then the only way to fix that is to find an activity that makes you happy and excited.


The activity that makes you happy can differ tremendously depending what type of person you are. Extroverts can find their happiness by seeking crowds and being in the center of attention, while introverts may find their energy in solitude. Whatever the activity, you need to figure it out yourself and then just do it.If you love the outdoors and enjoy the nature, go hiking, skiing, running, swimming, or bicycling. These are easy-to-do activities that require little planning and equipment and you can easily do by yourself.
Or try something new and go horseback riding, rock climbing, parasailing, backpacking, etc. You may surprise yourself and find an inner happiness you never knew existed.
If you are the type that requires company and/or encouragement to try new things, ask your friend or spouse to come along. Finding a new hobby to do together can be a great way to bring your fun-loving side up too.

, Negative thoughts and feelings have the capability to bring you down and lower your self-esteem. Learning to see the positive side in life can have a transforming effect and allow you to release your fun-loving side..


You may not always be able to control your external environment, but you can control your inner thoughts. Even in tough situations, thinking positively can help you overcome barriers and release your fun-loving side.
Seek situations that bring out the best in you and then learn to transfer that feeling to situations that might not bring out the best in you. This way you can learn to think positively even in situations that might normally bring out negative thoughts.
Focus on what is good in your life and write it down on a paper. Then carry that paper with you. When you find yourself down or unhappy, read through that list and try to change your negative thoughts to positive thoughts (e.g., the glass is half full, not half empty).
You can also break free from negative thoughts by telling yourself “I can” and not allowing disrespectful people or bad situations bring you down.

, Being able to be more fun-loving means you need to honor and love yourself first. Honoring yourself means to honor your life and what you have accomplished and created. This includes friendships, family, children, and even strangers that you have connected with..


In order to honor yourself, you need to accept yourself for who you are. Only when you understand who you are and can embrace that person, can you bring your fun-loving side up.
To learn to honor yourself, list your biggest achievements on a paper (e.g., graduated from school, had children, bought a house, climbed a mountain, achieved a personal goal, etc). Then, focus on those achievements and allow yourself to gain respect for yourself through them.

, Sometimes being more fun loving means you need to allow yourself to try new things instead of only doing things you have become comfortable or accustomed with.


Often times we keep ourselves contained in a zone where we are comfortable, but that does not mean that is the place we are happiest.
Allow yourself to try new things, take chances, and have fun. However, there are limitations to what you can and what you should do and you should never try or do things that cause harm to you or others.
To break out, first understand your comfort zone and how you tend to stay in it naturally. Once you understand your comfort zone, change your normal way of thinking and acting and slowly break out of it.For example, start by making a list of all the things that you do to avoid uncertainty (e.g., are there situations that you avoid, do you check on your kids constantly, do you suffer from lack of trust).Once you have your list, start by picking the small items that you can do to break out of the cycle (e.g., go to a place you have never visited before, seek situations you normally avoid, allow yourself to be more trusting).
Keep a record of all the times you succeeded in your goal and what happened (e.g., what happened when you visited a new place or pursued an unfamiliar situation).

Keep learning.,
Try new things.,
Keep doing what you're good at.,
Stay social.,
Find a purpose.",How to Accept That You're Getting Older2," Continuing to have an active, fulfilling life will make acceptance of your aging easier. Even if you've reached a point where you are physically unable to do a lot of things you might like to do, you can keep learning new things.


Read books and watch documentaries. Keep learning things and explore multiple perspectives on the world you live in. Seeing and finding out about new things will keep life interesting and help give you a sense that you haven't seen it all yet.
Research has shown that people who keep learning throughout life are happier and retain their mental capacities better than those who do not.Keep your mind sharp and stay curious. Life will be better, and you'll keep feeling a sense of potential as you age.

, Similarly, keep developing new skills. Take up a new hobby. Learn to play an instrument or take a music class. Take up chess. Learn to cook. Doing new things makes life feel more promising and keeps your mind sharp.Challenge yourself mentally. Even doing crosswords or other brain-teaser puzzles can help you maintain your mental facilities and stave off dementia.Knowing that your mind is still sharp and that you can still do new things in life will help you accept the fact that you are aging.

, Aging isn't all about decline. Experience can mean you've honed certain skills to a level that younger people have not. In addition to trying new things, keep doing things you excel at.You may be an expert in a certain field of knowledge, or maybe you've developed an artistic talent or technical skill over many years of practice. Such expertise is valuable to others, so keep using it!
You might consider delaying retirement, if your job gives you satisfaction. If you want to retire or already have, you might looking for a way to use your expertise in retired life. Maybe you could teach a class at a local community center, or use your skills in a volunteer capacity. Explore your options.

, Many older people allow themselves to become isolated and solitary. This doesn't make for a fulfilling life and also can hasten mental decline.Talk often with friends and family. Stay in touch with old friends, and look for opportunities to make new ones.
Community engagement is a great way to stay social and give your life a sense of value. Consider volunteering at a soup kitchen or some other organization doing community service. This will give you a network of people socialize with and a task that feels worth doing.

, However you decide to occupy your time, make sure it feels purposeful. Many people, post retirement, find that they feel cast adrift and don't have anything to live for. Find something that gives your life a sense of meaning or value.


This could be volunteering, an artistic pursuit, or finding some way to share your knowledge and perspective with others. Whatever you opt to pursue, having a sense that your life has meaning will make it easier to accept aging.
Research shows that people with a sense of purpose often live longer! Not only will it make it easier for you to accept the stage of life you are in, it may give you some extra years to enjoy, too."

Familiarizing yourself with aging may help to dispel some of your fears about aging, and talking to people who are older than you is a good way to do this. Spend some time talking with an elderly relative or friend once per week. Ask about his or her experiences and listen to what he or she has to share.By spending time with someone who is older than you, you may start to find it easier to imagine an older version of yourself. Spending time with someone who is older than you may also start to demystify the aging process a bit and make it easier to accept.

, Staying physically active can make your body and mind feel better and can help promote a longer, healthier life. Staying active means you will be more able to keep doing things that make you happy.If you aren't physically active now, start small and work your way up. Start with easily achievable goals. Park farther away from the store and walk a little. Take the stairs instead of the elevator if you're only going up a couple of floors. Then, slowly start building more exercise into your routine.
Stretching and yoga can help you stay flexible and maintain range of motion. This can help you maintain your ability to do other things you enjoy., As you get older, eating the right foods becomes increasingly important in ensuring the good health you need to retain a satisfying quality of life. Pay close attention to what you eat. Specifically:Make sure you get enough protein to help keep your muscles strong.
Limit fat intake, and eat healthy fats like those found in fish and avocado.
Drink plenty of water.
Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Consider dietary supplements. Talk to your doctor or a dietician about which one(s) might be most beneficial for you.

, Everyone knows cigarettes are bad for your health. They are bad for your skin and lungs and can cause cancer. Cigarettes have also been linked to faster mental decline in elderly people.If you already smoke, try to quit. Even if you have smoked for years, quitting may have a positive effect. If you don't smoke, don't start.

, Daily meditation can help you deal with physical discomfort that might come with aging, and can also help with the anxiety and depression you might experience if you are struggling to accept aging.Try to clear your mind of all thoughts and focus on your breathing for several minutes. If thoughts begin to creep in, let them pass through your mind and return your focus to your breathing.

, To make sure your health stays good, see your doctor regularly. Catching problems early can help you deal with them before they become serious.


Be your own advocate and ask good questions when you go see the doctor. Bring your health history, and be assertive about asking questions about any concerns you may have.If this stressful for you, remember that it's okay to bring a friend of loved one with you.

Eat selenium-rich foods.,
Increase your zinc.,
Consume foods rich in antioxidants.,
Improve your omega-3 intake.",How to Protect Your Mind With Brain Foods2," Selenium is a trace mineral that has an essential role in ensuring good brain health, particularly as an antioxidant.Studies have found that depleted levels of selenium result in poor memory, bad moods, and decreased cognitive function, while increasing selenium improves mood, clarity of thinking, and energy levels.You need to get at least 55 micrograms daily. Try foods such as whole grain bread, tuna, and Brazil nuts., One great source of zinc is pumpkin seeds. Zinc is helpful for improving brain power,and just a 1/4 cup provides almost 20 percent of your daily value.Other good sources include spinach, beef, and kidney beans.


Try eating a small handful of pumpkin seeds as an afternoon snack, or sprinkle them over salad or oatmeal for added texture.

, Many of the foods already listed here are high in antioxidants, such as berries and leafy greens. However, certain drinks are high in antioxidants, too, including tea and coffee.Green tea is particularly beneficial for the brain. Try drinking a cup of tea or two a day.Antioxidants help block free radicals, which can destroy brain cells over time., Omega 3 is excellent brain food, providing a good source of EPA and DHA fatty acids and helping to protect your brain from deterioration. Not getting enough of these fatty acids in your diet can increase your chances of getting Alzheimer's or dementia. Oily fish (e.g., salmon, sardines, herring, tuna), fish oil, walnuts, and flax seeds (linseed) are all good sources of omega-3. Try chia seeds, which are loaded with ALA and EHA omega-3. They are easy to sprinkle over everything from cereal to salads, as they are flavorless."

Try gingko biloba.,
Take B-vitamins.,
Supplement with citicocline.,
Try Vitamin D.Being low on vitamin D can lead to disorders such as seasonal affective disorder and depression.People can usually get most of the vitamin D they need through sunlight, but some people's bodies - especially dark-skinned people and the elderly - can have trouble converting sunlight to vitamin D, and in the winter, it can be difficult for anyone to get enough sun.",How to Protect Your Mind With Brain Foods3," Studies are showing that gingko biloba can help with certain brain disorders, such as cerebral inefficiency and dementia.It is also helpful for fighting memory loss.


Before beginning this supplement ensure it has no interactions with any current medications.The dosages varied by study, anywhere from 120 milligrams to 640 milligrams per day. Talk to your doctor about an appropriate amount for you., These vitamins help your body create fuel from glucose. They're also essential in helping protect against dementia. If you aren't getting enough B-vitamins from your diet, find a supplement that includes folate, B6 and B12, niacin, and thiamin., This supplement can help with memory function and recall, as well as help those with declining mental abilities.It is a chemical already present in your brain, and you can take up to 1,000 milligrams per day.,


Research has been done on dosages anywhere from 528 to 9,000 international units of vitamin D2 or D3. Check with your doctor for an appropriate dosage for you."

Ask for help.",How to Keep a Sharp Mind and Good Attitude," Exercise has a whole host of benefits for your mental and physical health, including warding off depression and bolstering the immune system.But physical fitness also has been shown to increase mental sharpness as people age.Especially past the age of 40, daily exercise helps maintain acuity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. In one study, elderly men who were aerobically fit were able to outperform men who were unfit in decision making tasks.;
, Brain and heart health may be key to maintaining memory stores as we age, and might even contribute to warding off dementia.Avoid saturated and trans fats, which damage brain blood vessels, and be sure your diet includes:


Healthy fats, such as olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish like salmon.Antioxidants, which contribute to optimal brain functioning; even dark chocolate counts!Plenty of fruits, veggies, and whole grains, which can help reduce your risk for a stroke.A moderate amount of alcohol. You heard that right: for adults, a small amount of alcohol can help fight off dementia by maintaining healthy cholesterol and insulin levels in the blood.But be careful to keep the alcohol to a moderate amount: too much alcohol has the opposite effect, and can even lead to a loss of memory (known as a ""blackout"")., The fog of exhaustion will cloud your mental ability, but a well-rested mind is able to perform at its optimal ability.


Our brains store daily memories while we sleep, so you need rest in order to remember even mundane details of daily life.You might even consider taking a short nap after learning something new or important, to help store it in your long-term memory., Math helps strengthen reasoning and problem solving skills, and you can easily practice, especially simple things that you can easily total up in your head or on a piece of paper. Many people haven't done long division since grade school; give it a try sometime.


When you are in the grocery store, try keeping a running total of the items in your cart. You don't have to add the exact amount; round each price up to the nearest dollar. When you get to the check-out you'll find out how close you were!

, A study out of Harvard found that advanced education is associated with stronger memory as a person ages.Even if you didn't go to college, you can continue your education yourself throughout your life.


Go to your local library to gain more knowledge. It is a great place to relax, gather thoughts, and focus on studying. If you have any spare time, carry a book over to the park or stop in at a family restaurant. It all aids in building a sharper better mind, and improves your attitude.
Take a class at a local community college. The best courses are those that are both mentally and socially demanding, such as photography or quilting.You will also have the added benefit of meeting new people and forming new friendships!

, You can improve your mental ability in domains such as logic, problem solving, mental orientation and corrective thought process by working puzzles and doing difficult mental tasks. Challenging yourself mentally can help increase your rational thinking skills, giving you more confidence problem solving in a given situation.


Try crossword puzzles.Older people who do crossword puzzles have better scores on a variety of cognitive tests than those who don't. Although researchers aren't sure if the puzzles cause better mental ability or if people with better mental ability just tend to do puzzles more because they can, it can't hurt to try!Try computer games. In one study out of Harvard, a game called NeuroRacer was found to improve elderly participants' ability to multitask, retain working memory, and maintain attention., Scientists have found that using all of your senses activates different parts of your brain, which can help you retain a memory. In one study, people were shown images presented with or without a smell, and were found to be able to recall the images with a smell better than those without.In practical application, this might mean using mindfulness techniques to notice the sights, smells, tastes, feelings, and sounds around you in a given situation, to help recall the event more clearly later.
You can also try sucking on peppermint candy, as peppermint oil has been shown to help aid recall and alertness.Pop a mint in your mouth when you're reading new information or learning something you want to remember later.

, This can be a real challenge, especially if you attempt writing and printing, but it is a great way to force yourself to focus while engaging both sides of your brain.


Sit down and start writing on a piece of paper using your off hand. It will probably start out like scrawl, but you will become more aware of your tense shoulders and gain more control with time. This exercise is also used for epileptic patients., No matter what your stage in life, everyone can learn something new and develop a talent or skill. Developing new skills helps to bolster your self-confidence.Try a sport like skiing or golfing, or join a choral group or amateur comedy club. Relax your expectations and don't strive for perfection; just have fun and meet people while giving it your best shot.Some skills, such as learning a foreign language or computer coding, are also great for bolstering your mental sharpness., Creativity has more than one advantage when it comes to keeping your mind sharp and keeping a positive attitude: creativity forces you to think and flex your mental muscles, and the results of your hard work can reinforce your self-confidence and help you enjoy your daily life.


Try your hand at writing poetry, sewing, taking up a musical instrument, gardening, or painting. If you don't feel artistic or creative, baking or writing in a journal are also great ways to express yourself requiring less technical skill.
Try applying creative approaches to daily tasks like shopping on a budget or creating a new recipe with dietary restrictions or limited ingredients. Keep a good attitude about your ability to find solutions in every-day situations., Especially as you age, giving back to your community can give you a sense of purpose and identity that contributes to a positive outlook on life and a good attitude toward the aging process.Try serving meals at a homeless shelter, volunteering at a senior center to write letters for residents, or working with youth or children at your local faith-based organization. Having a regularly scheduled volunteer job can help you make friends and help others.

, It is true that as you age, you will not be able to do everything you could do when you were younger. But instead of seeing those as failures, reframe them as natural, and refocus on things you can do.Reframing involves looking at your current situation with fresh eyes. In many ways, attitude is everything: you can reframe a negative thought or experience to make it positive. For example, you may not be able to recall things as well as you used to, but instead of seeing that as a personal failure or an embarrassment, recognize it as a natural effect of a life well lived., Scientists have done hundreds of studies on the benefits of a grateful attitude, which include boosting your happiness and life satisfaction.There are several strategies you can try to increase gratitude:


Write a letter of thanks to someone who has made a difference in your life, and deliver it to them with a gift.Spend time writing. Every day for a week (or more), write down at least three things that you experienced that you're grateful for. They can be big or small. Write how it made you feel. Making this a daily practice, perhaps writing every night before bed, can help you cultivate a grateful attitude., Since you can't (and don't need to) remember everything, you should prioritize your mental space and use shortcuts to help you remember things you don't need to memorize.Writing things down is an important way to ensure that you don't miss appointments, forget medications, or other important things that you can't risk forgetting.


Try keeping Post-it notes or a white board in the office with daily tasks and reminders.Use a calendar or planner to keep track of important upcoming events and deadlines, and keep a running shopping list to take to the grocery store.

, Repeating things you are told can help to fire pathways in your brain to ensure that you can remember it better later.When you meet someone new and they introduce themselves, repeat their name right then, and again at the end of the conversation. You can do it casually: in the beginning of the conversation, say, ""It's so nice to meet you, John."" Repeat again at the end of your conversation, ""It was great talking to you, John.""
Repeat important instructions from your doctor, and if needed, write them down to ensure you remember accurately.

, By learning to calm your mind and focus your attention, you can improve your mental clarity which has positive effects on your memory and attention span.In one study, participants who practiced mindfulness for 20-30 minutes daily scored better on standardized memory tests than those who took a nutrition class.
Mindfulness is a meditative practice that involves sitting and breathing slowly while focusing on physical sensations such as your breath moving in and out. Try to meditate twice a day for 10-20 minutes at a time., As we age, our mental abilities will decline whether or not we try to maintain a sharp mind: it's just a fact of life. It is important to surround yourself with people you trust so that as you age, you can trust them to make important decisions for you should the need arise.


As people age, they are more likely to remember events that did not actually occur. Having a younger person that you have known for a long time, like a grown child, can help you supplement your memory if you need to recall an event from years past., Before you need one, decide who will serve as your guardian when and if your mental abilities decline. You should hire a lawyer to file appropriate documentation when the time comes.If you do not assign a guardian, the courts will usually appoint your nearest relative, which could be a brother, sister, spouse, or child. If you have troubled relationships with anyone near you (which is very common), it makes sense to appoint your own so that this important decision is not left up to the court.
Write a will indicating your final wishes for your property and end of life care. If you should lose mental functioning, your will ensures that no one makes decisions that go against what you hoped for your future and keeps you in control., You can make big decisions about your future health and care now and put them in writing so that you’re your guardian will have to keep your preferences in mind.Your lawyer will help you navigate the process, but will most likely recommend an Advance Directive, which includes a Living Will, Power of Attorney or Proxy (generally, but not necessarily, your guardian), and your preferences for resuscitation and intubation (such as a Do Not Resuscitate order)., If you think you might be experiencing a neurological condition such as Alzheimer's or dementia, reach out to those you love and ask for help. There are treatment plans and healthcare options for you to help you if you are battling these conditions.


Symptoms of Alzheimer's can start at any time, but before age 65 it is known as ""younger onset Alzheimer's.""It is normal to feel anxiety, fear, or worry if you are experiencing increasing memory loss. But talking to your children or loved ones now can help you ensure that your future is secure. You can lead a productive and fulfilling life even after a diagnosis."

For example, if you have a hard time remembering that JFK was the president involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion, just picture the handsome president swimming in an ocean surrounded by happy, oinking pigs. This is absolutely silly, but this concrete image in your mind will forever help you link the president with this event.By creating a visual, your brain can fixate on a single, easy-to-identify piece of information. When you recall that single symbol, you can also recall the larger strand of information you assigned to it. For example, as you place your car keys in your purse, imagine your purse suddenly growing wheels and speeding away. Since the image is such a strange one, you're more likely to remember it later, which will also help you remember that your car keys are inside it.
The more unique or unusual the image is, the easier it will be for your brain to remember it., Let's say you keep forgetting your student ID every time you need to use it again. Just break down the number into smaller chunks and create images associated with those chunks. Let's say the number is 12-7575-23. Find a way to make these numbers meaningful. Let's say ""12"" happens to be your house number, ""75"" happens to be your grandmother's age, and the number ""23"" is Michael Jordan's jersey number. Here's what you can visualize to remember the number:


Picture your house with two copies of your grandmother standing to the right, showing that the house comes first. Then imagine Michael Jordan standing to the right of your grandmothers. There you have it -- 12 (your house), 7575 (double-dose of Grandma) and 23, the basketball star.

, Chunking is a way of grouping things together to help you memorize them. Random lists of things (a shopping list, for example) can be especially difficult to remember. To make it easier, try categorizing the individual things from the list. For example, list all of the fruits together, the dairy products together, and the bread products together. Alternatively, you can chunk your list by the starting letter of each item; you need to pick up eggs, bread, bacon, coffee, and cheese from the grocery store, remember one E, two B's, and two C's. As long as you remember the correct numbers, you should be able to recall the items in each letter group. This will not only help you memorize the list, but it'll make your shopping experience much faster.If you can remember that, among other things, you wanted to buy four different kinds of vegetables, you’ll find it easier to remember all four.
Chunking is what we do when we list a phone number with dashes. Which looks easier to memorize, 8564359820, or 856-435-9820?
You probably won't remember 17761812184818651898, but try putting a space after every fourth number. Now you can see that those numbers are years, and you can pick key events from each year to help you remember the string of numbers (such as the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Mexican-American War, Civil War, and Spanish-American War).

, Using a variety of common and silly rhymes can help you recall basic information. For example, if you're trying to figure out if April has 30 or 31 days, just say the old rhyme aloud: ""Thirty days has September, April, June, and November."" Then you'll remember that April does indeed have 30 days. Here are some other rhymes to use as memory tools:


""In fourteen-hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.""
A child can learn the alphabet by singing it to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"" which makes the letters rhyme.

, Acronyms are another wonderful tool for remembering a variety of things, from the names of the five Great Lakes to the words used as conjunctions. You can use a popular acronym, or create one for yourself. For example, if you're going to the store and know you only need Butter, Lettuce, Bread, and Unagi, then just create a word out of the first letter of each term: ""BULB"" -- Butter, Unagi, Lettuce, and Bread. Here are some popular acronyms to use:


HOMES. This one is used for remembering the Great Lakes: Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior.
ROY G. BIV. This man's name can help you remember the colors of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.
FOIL. This will help you remember how to multiply two binomial terms: First, Outer, Inner, Last.
FANBOYS. This acronym can help you remember simple coordinating conjunctions: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So.

, Acrostics are similar to acronyms, except instead of just remembering the acronym, you can remember a new sentence made out of the first letters of a set of words that you have to memorize in a certain order. For example, you can say, ""My very eager mother just sent us noodles."" to learn the order of the planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. You can also make up acrostics of your own. Here are a few more popular acrostics:Every Good Boy Does Fine. This is used for memorizing the lines on the treble music staff: EGBDF.
Never Eat Sour Watermelons. This is used for remembering the points of a compass in clockwise order: North, East, South, and West. Another good example is Never Eat Shredded Wheat which also rhymes too.
King Philip Can Only Find His Green Slippers. Use this to memorize the order of the classification system: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.
Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. Use this to remember the order of operations in mathematics: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.

, This method has been used since the time of Ancient Greece. This technique requires you to associate things in terms of place or location to help you remember the full set of information. To use this method, simply imagine placing the items you want to remember along a route you're very familiar with, or in specific locations in a familiar room or building. First, pick a familiar path; then, picture the things you want to do or memorize along that path. If you needed to memorize the acronyms HOMES, FANBOYS, and FOIL, you can picture a miniature home, on your front porch, a loud group of fan boys cheering on your stairs, and some foil wrapped around your bed.
When you organize a list of information by saying, ""in the first place,"" ""in the second place,"" and so on, you are using a basic version of the method of loci.

, Convince yourself that you do have a good memory that will improve. Too many people get stuck here and convince themselves their memory is bad, that they are just not good with names, that numbers just slip out of their minds for some reason. Erase those thoughts and vow to improve your memory. Celebrate even little achievements to keep yourself motivated.

, Regularly ""exercising"" the brain keeps it growing and spurs the development of new nerve connections that can help improve memory. By developing new mental skills -- especially complex ones such as learning a new language or learning to play a new musical instrument -- and challenging your brain with puzzles and games, you can keep your brain active and improve its physiological functioning.


Try some fun puzzle exercises everyday such as crosswords, Sudoku, and other games which are easy enough for anyone.
Get out of your comfort zone and pick something that is new and challenging, which makes you flex your brain muscles. Try to play chess or a fast-paced board game.
A large portion of your brain is activated when it learns a new skill. Learning new information is also helpful, but since skills require both the intake and output of information, they exercise a larger portion of your brain.

, Memories are very fragile in the short-term, and distractions can make you quickly forget something as simple as a phone number. The key to avoid losing memories before you can even form them is to be able to focus on the thing to be remembered for a while without thinking about other things, so when you’re trying to remember something, avoid distractions and complicated tasks for a few minutes.

, Often we forget things not because our memory is bad, but rather because our observational skills need work. One common situation where this occurs (and which almost everyone can relate to) is meeting new people. Often we don’t really learn people’s names at first because we aren’t really concentrating on remembering them. You’ll find that if you make a conscious effort to remember such things, you’ll do much better.


One way to train yourself to be more observant is to look at an unfamiliar photograph for a few seconds and then turn the photograph over and describe or write down as many details as you can about the photograph. Try closing your eyes and picturing the photo in your mind. Use a new photograph each time you try this exercise, and with regular practice you will find you’re able to remember more details with even shorter glimpses of the photos.

, You can stimulate more parts of your brain by using as many senses as possible when memorizing information. When a larger part of your brain is active, your ability to trigger your memory banks will increase.

Write it out. The process of writing information by hand stimulates your brain and makes it easier to remember the information later. Typing is far less effective, however.
When you do type out information, use a strange font. When you finish, read it back. When something is a struggle to read, you need to concentrate on it more, which can help fix it into your memory more firmly.
Rehearse or relate the information. Tell yourself or tell another person the information. Hearing yourself recite the information will involve your sense of hearing. If you need to explain the information to the other person so that he or she can understand it, as well, your memory and understanding will be enhanced even further.

, Change the normal location of things to remember to do something. If you need to remember to take your multivitamins every morning, then put the toaster on its side, and only put it back in its normal place after you've taken your vitamins. Seeing the toaster out of place will remind you that something is off and that there's something you need to remember.If you need to remember something important, such as a person's birthday, just wear your wristwatch on your other wrist. You'll remember that there was something important you had to do when you see that the watch is out of position.
The trick is to focus on what you want to remember as you alter the object being used. If you are not focused on the piece of information, you may not be able to associate it with the change later on.

, Flash cards are especially useful for studying. It's essentially a card with a question on one side and the answer on the other. (You can also put two things you want to associate on opposite sides of a flashcard.) In the course of learning a topic, you would have a stack of cards and would go through them testing yourself. Those that you got right you would put to one side and review a few days later.


Place the terms you remembered in one pile, and the ones you need to know in another. Keep going until all of the cards are in the ""know"" pile, even if you need to take breaks.
Go back to your flash cards the next day and see if you've still memorized the terms on them.

, Cramming only works to put information in your short-term memory. You may remember the information for your exam the next day, but you will barely recall the unit when it's time to take the final. Spacing out your studying is important because it gives your brain time to encode the information and store it in your long-term memory.

, If you have trouble remembering whether you took your medication every morning, just say, ""I just took my medication!"" right after you took it, to reinforce this idea in your mind. Saying this aloud will help you remember that you did indeed take your medication.


This also works if you're meeting a new person and don't want to forget his name. Just repeat the name naturally after you learn it: ""Hi, Sarah, it's nice to meet you.""
This also works to remember an address or a meeting time. Just repeat it aloud to the person who invited you: ""The Grand Tavern at 7? That sounds perfect.""

, When it's time to study or remember something new, switch your breathing pattern to be slower and deeper. Deeper and slower breathing actually changes the way your brain works, by inducing the brain's electrical pulses to switch to Theta waves, which normally occur in your brain in hypnogogic sleep.


To activate your Theta waves, switch your breathing to your lower abdomen - in other words, start breathing deeply from your stomach. Consciously slow your rate of breathing too.
After a few moments, you should feel calmer, the Theta waves should be flowing in your brain, and you should be more receptive to remembering new information.

, Use a popular trick out of FDR's playbook for memorizing a person's name. When a person introduces themselves to you, picture them with their name written on their forehead. This will associate the image of that person with their name.

, Some studies suggest that squeezing a stress ball or making a fist with your hand can help you remember a piece of information later.Before memorizing the information, squeeze the stress ball in your dominant hand. For a right-handed person, this would be your right hand.
When you need to remember the information, squeeze the stress ball in your opposite hand for at least 45 seconds. This simple action might be enough to help you remember.

, This simple act can stimulate the brain and improve your concentration, especially if you need to remember information for 30 minutes or more.

Some studies have suggested that visual and auditory memory improves when a person chews gum by keeping the individual more focused.
When you need to remember something for less than 30 minutes, though, it is actually better not to chew anything.

, Studies show that moving your eyes from side to side for just 30 seconds once a day will align the two parts of your brain and make your memory work more smoothly. Try this trick when you wake up in the morning., Studies show that smelling rosemary can improve your recall. Carry around a sprig of rosemary or smell rosemary oil once a day. The Ancient Greeks even put a spring of rosemary behind their ears on exam days to help them boost their memories., Begin by memorizing this list of ten words. It's simple - because each word rhymes with its number in the list. When you have to remember a lot of things, use these rhyme-number patterns. For example, you have to remember to clean your glasses. The singular for 'glasses' is 'glass', so just remember this. If this is the first thing on your list, picture a gun, which rhymes with one, shooting the glass. By association the original activity should pop back into your head. The list is enclosed below:

Gun
Shoe
Flea
Door
Dive
Sticks
Heaven
Date
Blind
Pen

, Keep items that you frequently need, such as keys and eyeglasses, in the same place every time. Use an electronic organizer or daily planner to keep track of appointments, due dates for bills, and other tasks. Keep phone numbers and addresses in an address book or enter them into your computer or cell phone. Improved organization can help free up your powers of concentration so that you can remember less routine things.


Even if being organized doesn’t improve your memory, you’ll receive a lot of the same benefits (i.e. you won’t have to search for your keys anymore).

, Multitasking may seem like it allows you to get things done faster, but research suggests that it actually causes the brain to slow down overall. Mindfulness allows you to increase your focus, which improves your memory and speeds the brain up.

You need about eight seconds of focus to commit something to memory. When you multitask, you tend to set information aside faster than eight seconds, so you're more likely to forget it.
To practice mindfulness, all you really need to do is improve your concentration and spend more time focusing on one task at a time. When you really want to remember a specific piece of information, spend at least eight seconds focusing on that information alone.

, Regular aerobic exercise improves circulation and efficiency throughout the body -- including the brain -- and can help ward off the memory loss that comes with aging. Exercise also makes you more alert and relaxed, and can thereby improve your memory uptake, allowing you to take better mental ""pictures"".


Even just walking for 30 minutes a day is a fantastic form of exercise.
Nerve cells release neurotropic factors during exercise, and these proteins trigger other chemicals that promote brain health.
Exercise also improves blood flow to the brain, which increases the amount of oxygen your brain receives.
Some studies suggest that regular exercise, whether moderate or vigorous, can increase the brain's memory center by one or two percent each year. Without exercise, the memory center will remain stable or may decrease in capacity.

, Chronic stress does in fact physically damage the brain, it can make remembering much more difficult. After prolonged stress, the brain will start to become affected and deteriorate. Stress may never be completely eliminated from one's life, but it definitely can be controlled. Even temporary stresses can make it more difficult to effectively focus on concepts and observe things. Chronic stress can also cause long-term damage to the hippocampus, which is where memories are stored.


Try to relax, regularly practice yoga or other stretching exercises, and see a doctor if you have severe chronic stress as soon as possible.

Meditate for at least 15 minutes a day. This will help you slow down your breathing and relax, and it can improve your focus.
Reduce your caffeine intake. Caffeine can make you feel more anxious and stressed.
Give yourself a massage or get one from a friend. This will help your body loosen up.
Reduce stress by spending more time being social with your friends. Being a more social creature and talking to people more will also improve your memory.

Laughing becomes even more beneficial when others are involved. Some studies suggest that socializing with friends, close relatives, and even pets can slow your overall rate of memory decline as you age.

, There are a lot of herbal supplements on the market that claim to improve memory, but none have yet been shown to be effective in clinical tests. A healthy diet, however, contributes to a healthy brain, and foods containing antioxidants -- broccoli, blueberries, spinach, and berries, for example -- and Omega-3 fatty acids appear to promote healthy brain functioning.Feed your brain with such supplements as Thiamine, Niacin and Vitamin B-6.
Some of the suggested foods for your brain are green tea, curry, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, walnuts, crab, chickpeas, red meat, blueberries, and healthy fats (including organic butter, olive oil, coconut oil, nuts, avocado, and salmon or other fatty fish). Each of these foods contains antioxidants that may protect your brain and encourage the production of new brain cells.
Increase the amount omega-3 fatty acid you consume but decrease omega-6 fats. Omega-3 fats are usually found in salmon and similar animal sources, while omega-6 fats are typically found in processed vegetable oils.
You should also avoid sugars and grain carbohydrates since these foods can negatively affect your brain. Saturated fats and high-calorie foods are similarly believed to hinder your memory, especially in the long term.
Red wine may improve your memory when consumed in moderation. If you consume more than one glass a day as a woman or two glasses as a man, the alcohol can begin to impair your memory. In small amounts, though, the resveratrol flavonoid in wine can increase blood and oxygen flow to the brain. Grape juice, cranberry juice, fresh berries, and peanuts are said to provide a similar effect.
Grazing, or eating 5 or 6 small meals throughout the day instead of 3 large meals, also seems to improve mental functioning (including memory) by limiting dips in blood sugar, which may negatively affect the brain. Make sure it's healthy stuff.

, Studies suggest that low vitamin D may be associated with decreased cognitive performance.When vitamin D receptors in your brain are activated, the nerve growth in your brain increases. Some of the metabolic pathways for vitamin D are located in areas of the brain responsible for forming new memories.

While too much sunlight can cause skin damage, a moderate amount can provide all the vitamin D needed by the average adult.
Vitamin D3 supplements are other alternative methods of getting adequate vitamin D.

, Sleeping improves your neuroplasticity—your brain's ability to grow—which enhances the brain's ability to control behavior and memory. The amount of sleep we get affects the brain's ability to recall recently learned information. Getting a good night's sleep -- a minimum of seven hours a night -- may improve your short-term memory and long-term relational memory, according to recent studies conducted at the Harvard Medical School.


Try to get anywhere from 7 to 10 hours of sleep each night. The ideal for most healthy adults is eight hours.
Go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time every night. This will make you feel much more rested.
Spend at least half an hour reading in bed and winding down before you go to bed. Shut off the TV, your computer, and any other visual stimulants at least an hour before bed.
Take catnaps during the day. They can help you recharge your batteries and boost your memory.
Your brain also consolidates information into your long-term memory bank during sleep. If you stay awake, this process won't be able to happen.
