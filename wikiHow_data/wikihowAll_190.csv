Measure and mark where the shelves will go.,
Line your shelving brackets to the wall and make pilot holes.,
Screw fixed brackets into the wall.,
Place a wooden plank on top of the brackets.",How to Create Open Kitchen Storage2," The first part in determining where you should put the shelves is determined by where your wall studs are located. Use a stud finder to find the studs or the wooden planks that you can screw your shelf mounts into. Mark where the studs are with a pencil, then use a level to draw a straight horizontal line where your shelving will go.You can purchase a stud finder at hardware stores.
Keep pencil marks off your wall by laying down a strip of painters tape, then drawing your lines onto the tape rather than the wall.

, Fixed brackets typically look like a triangle and screw into the wall. These brackets can support a wooden plank that serves as a shelf. Drilling pilot holes first will make it easier to screw in the shelving brackets. Determine the size of the screws you'll be using on your brackets and drill holes that are slightly smaller than the size of those screws.


You can find shelving brackets at most hardware stores.

, Line your shelving brackets up with the pilot holes that you made earlier and drill screws through the holes in your bracket and into the wall. Start by drilling the screws halfway before moving onto another screw. Screw them in just enough so that the bracket stays in place on the wall. Once your screws are half way in, you can tighten up all of the screws.If you tighten your screws before putting them halfway in, it'll be harder to line up your brackets to the pilot holes.

, Choose a sturdy piece of wood that is the size you want your shelves to be. It's always smarter to purchase a larger piece of wood and cut it down, rather than not having enough. If you want your shelving unit to be even more secure, you can screw the shelf to the brackets for extra stability.


Make sure that there is at least an inch of overlap over the shelving brackets.

Measure the space that the rack will take up.,
Cut your pipe according to your measurements.,
Connect elbow connectors to the ends of your pipe.,
Attach copper pipes to flanges, pipe hangers, or bell hangers.,
Connect your wall flanges to the wall.,
Hang pots and pans on the wall using S hooks.",How to Create Open Kitchen Storage3," Before you start to construct your pipe racks, you'll need to know how big your pipe rack has to be, and how much space in your kitchen that you have to accommodate it.Measure the area with a tape measure and write down your wall measurements on a piece of paper. Use a level when measuring horizontal lines so that your rack will also be level.


If you have more pots and pans, you'll need a larger pipe or you'll need to have multiple pipe racks on your wall.
If you have no wall space available, consider putting the pipe rack on the ceiling.

, Lay the pieces out on a flat table and separate the pieces that you need to cut. Use a tape measure and a marker to mark lines where you need to cut. After you've created the layout and have measured all the pieces, it's time that you cut the pipe to fit the space in your kitchen. Proceed to cut your pipe down with a pipe cutter. Make sure to take into account the connector pieces, as well as the size of your wall flanges or pipe hangers when measuring out your pipe.


You can purchase copper or galvanized piping at most hardware stores.Use either a 3/4-inch (1.9 cm) thick or 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) thick copper pipe for this project.You can use a hacksaw or a pipe slice instead of a pipe cutter to cut down your pipe., These elbow connectors will fit into whatever is mounting your pipe to the wall. You can usually just slide the elbow connectors over your copper pipe if you've bought all the pieces together. If not, you may have to solder your copper pipe over male threaded pipe pieces to keep the pipe together. In this case, use your soldering gun to heat the copper pipe to the threaded pipe and elbow connector.

, Now that you have your layout and pipe cut, you'll need a way to connect it to your wall or ceiling. For this, you can use a variety of pieces that you can purchase at most hardware stores. Attach the elbow connectors that you have on both sides of your pipe to wall flanges or hangers that you can screw into the wall.


Wall flanges are larger and often square or circular pieces of metal that screw into the wall.
Pipe and bell hangers are smaller and made specifically for copper tubing.

, Connect your finished copper rack to the wall. Line up the wall flanges to the wall, over where you made your marks. Use a screwdriver or drill to safely fasten the hangers to the wall in the spaces that you marked earlier with a pencil.


It's best not to use pilot holes until you have the length of your pipe rack exact. If your measurements are off, you'll have to screw another set of holes.

, You can purchase S hooks at the hardware store, or you can create your own by bending thin copper rods into an S shape. Use pliers to bend the rod before hanging the rods onto your copper tube rack.If you bought metallic colored S hooks, you can use a copper spray paint to make them match the pipe rack."

Designate kitchen drawers for oft-used items.,
Place cleaning supplies under the sink.",How to Organize Kitchen Cabinets," It’s easiest to tackle an organization project when you’re starting with a clean slate, and organizing kitchen cabinets is no exception. Go ahead and take out every last bit of kitchenware – your plates, glasses, mugs, pots, pans, and anything else you have stored in your cabinets. Lay everything out on your kitchen table so you can assess what you’ve got and what you need.;
, You might have a collection of plastic cups you’ve picked up from restaurants, a dwindling pile of paper plates, an old coffee maker that no longer works, and so on. Now is the time to pare down your kitchen items to the items that you actually use. Getting rid of clutter will make it much easier to stay organized.


If you discover that you actually need something, go ahead and buy it before you organize your cabinets. If you wait, it will be more difficult to find a good place for it later.
Consider donating old kitchen supplies to a donation center, or having a yard sale to unload your wares. Knowing that your old items are going to a new home instead of a landfill may make it easier to get rid of the stuff you no longer need.

, Gather some good cleaning supplies and prepare to scrub every nook and cranny as well as wiping down the cabinet doors. Clean out all the crumbs, dried splashes and dust to get your cabinets ready for your dishes and other kitchen supplies. Cleaning your cabinets thoroughly will prevent bugs from taking up residence and keep your kitchen items fresh.


If you prefer not to use a chemical cleaner, try using a solution of white vinegar diluted with a little water. This natural cleaning agent works well to clean kitchen cabinets. If you need a scrubbing agent, baking soda does the trick.
If your cabinets are made from unpainted wood, take care to use cleaning supplies that won’t damage them.

, Fresh cabinet linings will help eliminate old odors and create a nice space for your kitchen supplies. You can choose among paper, vinyl, or rubber liners that come in a myriad of textures and patterns.


Measure your cabinet floors and cut the liners to size, then insert them in the bottom of the cabinets.
Some liners come with adhesive backings to help them stay in place on the cabinet floors.

, Scented sachets are useful to keep your cabinets smelling nice. Pick out a few of your favorite dried herbs and spices, such as lavender, rose petals or cinnamon sticks. Place the herbs and spices in small cloth bags tied or sewn securely at the top. Replace the sachets every few months, when their scent is no longer as fresh.


Certain herbs and spices can be used to deter insects. Try sachets scented with eucalyptus, tea tree oil, or lemon oil to keep pests away.
If you want to absorb bad odors without using a fragrance, place sachets filled with baking soda in your cabinet corners.

, Now that your cabinets are clean and lined, it’s time to think about how you might want to organize your items inside the cabinets. It’s not completely necessary to buy organizers, but if you have a lot of little kitchen gadgets they can help to reduce clutter and keep things in their place. Consider buying the following items for your cabinets:


A utensil organizer. Some kitchen drawers have built-in organizers for utensils, but many don’t. If your drawer doesn’t have one, it’s worth picking one up for a few dollars.
Teacup or coffee cup hooks. Many people install hooks under cabinets that overhang countertops as a way to store coffee cups, mugs, or teacups. Consider this option if you’re a big coffee drinker and you want to have your cups easily accessible. This is also a nice idea if you have a pretty set of cups you want to put on display.
Canisters for dry goods and other items. If you store flour, sugar, spices, and other food items in your kitchen cabinets (as opposed to using a separate pantry), you might want sturdy food containers. Choose containers with tight-fitting lids to keep insects and airflow out.

, Arrange everything in stacks according to type. When you organize your kitchen cabinets, it makes sense to group like items together. That way everything is easier to locate, and you know how many clean items you have left and when you’re getting low on a particular item.


Group your glassware together, including water glasses, juice glasses, and other everyday glasses.
Group your stemware together, including wine and champagne glasses. You might also want to store tumblers in the same space.
Group your plates and bowls. Many people stack their salad plates on top of their dinner plates to save a little space. Group your bowls together as well.
Separate fine china and seasonal items.
If you have cabinets with glass faces, consider which dishes you want to store so they are visible. Your dishes can be both decorative and functional.

, Assess which items you use on a daily basis and pick a large, accessible cabinet to store them in. You probably want to choose a cabinet that is located over the counter, rather than below it, so you won’t have to bend over to reach the dishes you need most often. If your cabinets have multiple shelves, place your frequently used items on the bottom.


Your dinner plates, salad plates, and cereal bowls probably fall into the “daily use” category. Go ahead and stack them neatly in the cabinet you have chosen.
If you don’t have room for large plates, you can use a dish drying rack as a plate rack on your counter.
In a separate accessible cabinet, store your water glasses, coffee cups, mugs, and other items you use every day.

, Upper cabinets or top shelves of cabinets are the place to store items you want to keep safe. Your nicer china, stemware, fragile casserole and serving dishes, and other such items should be carefully arranged higher up, out of easy reach.

, Everyone’s kitchen is different, but in many cases the lower cabinets (below the counters) are perfect for pot and pan storage. These items are often heavy and clumsy to stack, so it makes sense to store them slightly more out of the way and in a place where you won’t have to lift them too high. Place the pots and pans you use most often in the lower cabinets that are easiest to reach. Place pots and pans you use less often on the lowest shelves or toward the back of the cabinets.


You might find it easier to organize your pots using a pot rack you can hang on the wall next to your cabinets. This prevents you from having to stack them.
Some people place pots on top of the cabinets themselves. If your cabinets don’t reach the ceiling, you can consider the cabinet tops a suitable storage area.

, Place your utensil organizer in one of the wide, flat kitchen drawers that is most easily accessible. Arrange your utensils so that the forks, spoons and knives are each kept separate.

, Appliances you use every day should probably be kept on the kitchen counter, but you may have other occasionally-used items – a waffle iron, a juicer, a food processor, and so on - that you need to store in a cabinet. Place them in an out-of-the-way shelf or on top of the cabinets. You’ll be able to get them when you need them, but they won’t be in your way.

, If you plan to have a food and spice cabinet, choose a space that’s slightly separate from the rest of your kitchen supplies. It wouldn’t do to have cereal and spices spilling out onto clean dishes, so you want to make sure food items have their own designated area.


You could also have a separate spice cabinet. Extracts, herbs, and other small items also have a place here. It all depends on what you like to use when you cook, and what you prefer to have within easy reach.
You may choose instead to have a spice drawer. If this is the case, line the drawer well with a disposable liner that you can switch out when it gets soiled with stray spices. Set up your spice containers inside the drawer.

, Most kitchen cabinetry sets have a row of drawers for storing supplies that don’t belong in the cabinets. Every home cook uses these drawers differently. Take a look at your kitchen supplies and decide how you can put your drawers to best use.


Kitchen essentials like can openers, potato peelers, microplanes, and garlic presses are usually stored together in the same drawer.
If you bake a lot, you might want to have a drawer just for measuring cups, measuring spoons, and other baking supplies.
Consider designating a drawer for kitchen towels and oven mitts.
You may need a drawer for food storage containers and other items like aluminum foil and plastic wrap.
You might want to make a “junk drawer” for the odds and ends that don’t fit anywhere else – stray pens, rubber bands, coupons, recipe cut-outs, and other useful things.

, The area under the sink is a convenient place to store everything you need to keep your kitchen spotless. Trash bags, cleaning solutions, rubber gloves, extra dish soap and detergent, extra sponges, and so on can be found in this spot in many people’s homes. Don’t use this area for food or kitchenware storage if you’re also storing cleaning supplies there.

Empty the drawer or cabinet where you normally keep your containers.,
Recycle any containers you can't or don't use.,

Remove anything that's not a food storage container and either discard it or store it somewhere else.,

Get a matched set.,
Choose a suitable drawer or cabinet.,

Nest and stack.,

File the lids.,

Corral the small stuff.,

Give containers with long-term jobs permanent homes elsewhere.,

Make a habit of re-stacking containers back where they go every time you put away dishes.",How to Organize Empty Food Storage Containers and Lids," Sweep, vacuum, or wipe out the crumbs and put down fresh shelf paper or drawer lining, if you wish. Take a good look at your containers while they're spread out on a counter or table.
, Discarding is always a good first step toward organizing because it means you will have fewer left over to organize and store, and because items you can't or don't use aren't in the way of the ones you do.




 One of these things is not like the others.

Sort through your set and recycle any lids or containers that don't have mates. Put them together, if it helps, so you can see exactly where something comes up short.
Recycle any containers that are broken, split, stained, smelly, or melted beyond the point of usability.
Recycle anything you don't use. If it's too small for your regular portions, too big for the lunch box or the shelf in the fridge, let it go.
Decide how many containers you really need, and how many containers you need in any given size. Chances are, your supply of food containers never runs down to zero. If you have a stack of ten identical boxes, do you ever see the bottom two or three? Your answer might be yes if your family of five packs lunches in them each day; otherwise you may not want to keep all ten.

, Measuring cups, mixing bowls, and drinking glasses (even the plastic ones) should all go in some other, appropriate place. Put them with other items that function similarly., If your budget and space permit, consider getting containers that are all the same type, with multiples of commonly used sizes. Often a matched set will stack more compactly and more easily than assorted, unmatched containers.

If you can, try out how the containers stack in the store before you buy them. Do they nest snugly, or do they sit up with lots of space in between?
If you do replace your containers as part of the organizing process, be sure to get rid of the old, unmatched ones.

, A large drawer works well, if you have one. Regardless of which area you choose, dedicate a specific area and make sure the space is ample for the contents., For the containers, nest them in stacks that are as tall as your space. Start with the largest on the bottom and work upwards to the smallest. Make multiple stacks as necessary, keeping round containers with round, square with square, and so on., Make one or two stacks of lids at the side of the space. If you can place them vertically, as you would with papers in a filing cabinet. Place them in order at least roughly by size. Freezer bags (like Ziploc or Glad) are also an easy way to keep lids together and in order. Another really effective way to store them is in a rectangular basket screwed on the back of the cabinet door. This way, they stay vertical and won't get in the way of the containers., If you like to use miniature containers for leftover dabs or for single-serving portions of toppings or trail mix in a lunch box, put them all in one larger container., If a particular container is the one you always use to store flour in the pantry or cheese in the fridge, you might never need to store it with your other containers. Let it have its normal place in the pantry even if you're out of flour., If you start sticking ""just one thing"" in edgewise, it will all be chaos again soon. Get your family's help, too. If others do the dishes, explain the new organization system and ask that they replace items in the stacks you have arranged."

Since the alarm may go off too easily if it is in the middle of the kitchen, it is best to put it just outside., It should be easily accessible from anywhere in the kitchen but not too close to the stove or other appliances where a kitchen fire could start, such as a microwave. You don’t want to have to reach through the fire to get the extinguisher.If you don’t know how to use a fire extinguisher, you should sign up for a workshop with your local fire department., Cabinets above your stove are common in many small apartments, but can pose a fire hazard. First, if there is no range hood or exhaust above the stove, you could get grease build up underneath the cabinets. This will increase the fire risk. Second, you may reach for something in the cabinet while you are cooking and inadvertently allow your clothing to catch fire., Since many solvents and cleaning products are flammable, it is not advisable to store them anywhere near your stove., To avoid your oven mitts and pot holders catching fire on the stove, you should store them away from the stove. Instead, you could put them in a drawer or on a hook near your fridge., If you have a container with a bunch of wood utensils in your kitchen, you should keep it at least three feet away from your stove., Flammables such as paper and plastics should be kept a good distance away from your stove. You could put them in a kitchen drawer, cabinet or other secure location.All flammables should be kept a minimum of three feet away from the stove., If you live in an old house, you may want to get your kitchen wiring checked. Faulty kitchen wiring is a serious fire risk. Phone your electrician and make an appointment to address any kitchen wiring issues.If you are constantly blowing a fuse in the kitchen, you may have a wiring problem.
If you get shocked plugging in appliances, you may have a wiring problem.

, If you are renovating your kitchen, you should ask your contractor to follow fire safety guidelines and use fire resistant materials. For instance, you can purchase fire resistant drywall and fire retardant poly sheeting. You can also design the kitchen so that it is easily accessible to the front and back door of your house. And you can minimize any obstacles such as interior walls or kitchen islands, so that your family can easily exit the house in the event of a fire."

, Carefully screw the hook into the ceiling. You should either screw your hook directly into the wood of a rafter, or use an anchor. You don't want pots falling on your head!


You can use dry wall anchors and anchor screws to make your rack secure. You need your hook screwed into something solid enough to hold a little weight - which sheetrock and plaster alone are not. Consider using 4 spaced hooks, rather than one, it will give your finished product much better stability, and you can use smaller hooks.

, You should keep your kitchen appliances such as stove, microwave, fridge and dishwasher regularly serviced.You should also replace your kitchen appliances in a timely manner. Finally, you should make sure your appliance power cords are not frayed or splintered, which is a serious fire risk.You should also consider whether any of your major kitchen appliances need to be replaced:Refrigerators last about fifteen years before you need to replace them. If you want to save energy, you might want to replace them sooner.
Ovens and stoves last ten to fifteen years before you need to replace them.
Dishwashers need to be replaced every eight to ten years.

, Small appliances like toasters and coffee makers will draw energy whenever they are plugged in, even if you are not using them.

To mitigate the risk of a fire starting under your range hood, you should clean it regularly., Small appliances like toasters and microwaves are often the start of kitchen fires. Crumbs gather at the bottom of your toaster. If the toaster is left on for too long or is defective, the crumbs could catch fire. To mitigate this risk, you should regularly clean these appliances., If you let grease and grime build up on your kitchen stove and then start cooking, you are increasing the risk of a fire. As such, it is important to regularly clean your stovetop., You should always stay in the kitchen when the stove is turned on, since many fires start when a stove is left on without anyone watching it. You should also follow stove guidelines when lighting the pilot light on your stove. When you are using grease, avoid very hot temperatures and avoid filling pots and pans too full with hot grease.

Get ready.,
Designate spaces for a few piles.,
Begin to sort.,
Organize what you're left with.,
Make a plan to keep the clutter at bay in the future.,
Enjoy your decluttered space.

",How to Reduce Paper Clutter," Clear off the table or another space and bring out all the magazines, bills, letters, and other papers. This way you can see what you have to deal with, and you'll be able to see your progress as time goes on, as well. It will also be helpful to have a recycling bin and paper shredder on hand.;
, Useless papers can go straight into the recycling bin and old documents can go right into the shredder. For papers that don't fit either category, make a few areas for stacking: ""Important"" (for bills and documents), ""Helpful"" (recipes, addresses, and phone numbers, for instance), ""To be reviewed"" (papers you aren't sure about; you can look at them more closely later), and ""Other"" (for irregular papers, like ones that belong to other people).

, Start taking papers from the mess, looking them over, and putting them in their place. In the case of the piles, be sure to stack neatly.


Be ruthless. You want to have far less paper on your hands by the time you're done, so be sparing when putting papers on the stacks.
Take breaks if you like, especially if you have mountains of papers to deal with.

, Once you only have the stacks sitting in front of you, move on to organize them. This is the time to look through the ""to be reviewed"" papers and decide which to keep and which to throw out. After finishing that, move to the important papers. Get some file folders together and put the papers into them appropriately. Put the ""Helpful"" papers in places that make sense (coupons in your purse, recipes in the kitchen, etc.) and figure out what to do with any ""Other"" papers.

, Resolve yourself to put things away in their proper places, toss what you don't need, and swiftly clear up any clutter that appears.

File folder: If you have a job and cashed or deposited your paycheck, you may want to put any pay stubs in this folder when you get home to file later. This can also be useful if you have any receipts to keep you more organized.
School folder: Have your kids use this folder to insert anything that needs parent signatures, such as field trip forms. You can also have two school folders labeled ""School: Drop Off/For Home"" and ""School: To Return"". Kids can put permission slips in the ""Drop Off"" folder for you to sign, and can look into the ""To Return"" folder to return the signed form(s) to school in the morning.

, It does not need to be elegant nor professional looking, but a simple container with separators is perfect. These can hold a variety of things, including a stapler, paper clips, pens, and a pad of sticky notes. Use these office supplies to your advantage and as a key to organization.

, It doesn't have to be a kitchen or office sized one, but merely something to toss any junk mail as you walk in, so it doesn't become a burden later on. Unsubscribing to catalogs or other subscriptions that you have no interest to or didn't sign up with in the beginning should be a ""do now"" than later.


Purchase a paper shredder. Some to many paper shredders have the ability to latch onto the rim of trash cans, so all the paper flows right into the trash bag.

, Make it a motivation chore for yourself. If the folder(s) aren't kept up, you may miss a bill or an important notice.

, Never throw things away; always recycle. Kids tend to have projects where they have to make magazine collages, so if the magazine is old or you don't care for it any more, allow them to cut their pictures out from there.

Arrange one large sorting area.,
Put all the paper in one place.,
Take one paper after the other, breathe deeply and remind yourself to relax if you get tense or anxious.,
If it can be trashed, create a trash pile or bin and add other papers to it as they come along.

,
If it requires action, put it in an action pile and stick a post-it on it with the required action or any prerequisite steps.

,
If it should be filed, file it, unless there's no folder that has this category in it yet.,
Add papers to the existing piles.,
Check if your filing system is still up-to-date.,
Create Folders for the categories that are still missing from your system.,

Create a system to tackle new incoming paper.

",How to Conquer Your Paper Piles," It could be your desk, though you might have to remove everything from its surface. It could also be your bed or dinner table, or even the kitchen counters if they are clean.;
, If you are sure the piles are already sorted, you can keep them separate. Otherwise don't bother and put them all in one big pile.

, Decide if it requires action, has to be filed or can be thrown away.

,,, In that case, choose a category for the paper, write it on a post-it and put both on your sorting surface.

, When you have sorted everything, have a look at the piles that are too big to go into one folder. Can you break them up into sub-categories?

, Think about retrieval. What will you be looking for and where? Is it all in a sensible place? Don't skimp on folders and indices. Buy new ones if necessary. It's too frustrating to look for the ""car""-files in all folders because you can't remember where you added it to.

, Write indices.

, Mark boxes, TRASH, and FILE and begin sorting just on these two categories.

, Put the bill in the file folder and label the tab Unpaid Bills and set it in the file box.

, These could be anything you think is important to keep: birthday cards, car information, checking account, dental, home loan information, home maintenance, insurance, medical, unpaid bills, utilities, etc.


The best place to file something is where it is most obvious to you. Put things where you think they should go and it will be easiest for you to find them later.

,, Either file it or throw it out.

, After you file your papers you might want to make files within files that are close to the same subject. For example, you could divide car information into car insurance, recalls/warranties, repairs,and copies of titles and registrations. This way you have all the info when you need it.

, When you get your mail out of your mailbox, go through right away and toss the junk. When you get into the house, make it a point to place it near your file cabinet. Choose a specific time that fits your schedule to open your mail and sort it on a daily basis. You could put unpaid bills in a folder in the front of the file box to help you to remember to pay them. File the important things and toss the rest in the trash can located next to your file cabinet.

, Does a particular piece of paper require action or attendance at a later date? Write it in your calendar, then file the paper. You can even write where you filed the paper.

Collect old sheets, old clothing or fabric yardage.,
Snip into the edge of your fabric with sharp scissors.,
Grasp the fabric on either side of the snip and pull it apart.,
Tear the fabric to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the opposite edge.,
Turn the fabric around and make another snip to start a new tear, 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches (1.25 to 3.75 cm) away from the previous tear.,
Grasp both sides of the snip you just made and tear again.,
Make another snip in the far side of the fabric, the same width away from the last tear as the one before that.

,
Continue ripping back and forth across the fabric, stopping about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge with each tear you make.,
Wrap 1 end of the long rag strip you created around your fingers 8 to 10 times.

,
Slide the loops you just wrapped off your fingers.,
Alter the directions of your wraps as the ball begins to take shape.,
Tuck the end of the yarn wrap under 1 of the previous loops to secure it.

,
Store your rag balls in a basket for a Southern-style decoration, until you're ready to use them.

",How to Make Rag Balls," You'll need 1 to 2 yards (0.9 to 1.8 m) of fabric per rag ball.;
,


Always snip in line with the grain of your fabric. In other words, look carefully at the fabric, determine which way the fibers run, and cut in the same direction. This ensures that your fabric will tear easily and evenly.

, Cotton, in particular, will tear easily along the grain.

,


You can tear all the way through the edge of the fabric, but you'll end up with a pile of strips that you have to knot or sew together. If you stop 1 inch away from the edge, you can create 1 long strip of fabric from any square or rectangular piece.

,


The heavier your fabric is, the wider the strips you should tear.

, Use even, controlled force to make a smooth tear, and stop 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the far side of the fabric (this is the edge you first started tearing from).

,, The result is 1 long, continuous zig-zag piece of fabric.


Once you've cut the entire sheet, rag or piece of fabric into strips you're ready to roll it into a ball, just like you'd roll a ball of yarn.

,, Pinch them together and continue wrapping the long rag strip around the loops, this time perpendicular to the original wraps.

, As long as you do an equal number of horizontal, vertical and diagonal wraps, you should end up with a reasonably round rag ball.

Make separate piles for vital documents, legal documents, bank statements, and tax forms. Separate urgent and temporary documents from the other piles. Reserve these for your document trays.
To remind yourself of which stack contains which documents, place a sticky note on each stack. Put the sticky end of the note on the edge of the paper, and write the name of the pile (such as taxes or contracts) on the edge that sticks out of the stack.;
, Tabbed manila folders make handy filing systems. Write the name of the file on each tab. Use a left-tabbed folder for the first file, a center-tabbed folder for the second, a right-tabbed folder for third, and so on. This will make files easier to spot in a pinch. Buy file folders in any office supply or big box store.


Color-code your files. You can choose to do this with colored file or hanging folders, stick-on tabs, or colored file labels on your computer operating system. Color-coded files can help you to quickly spot the file you need.

, If you’re dealing with proper names, alphabetize folders by people’s last names or businesses’ first names. If the name of a business starts with “A,” “An,” or “The,” alphabetize by the first important word.Depending on the size of the topics your business covers or clients your business has, you can label each file folder by a single letter of a range of letters. For example, you could:


Separate businesses and individuals into separate hanging folders.
Organize people’s names in orders such as “Brown, John” before “Smith, Ann.” Organize businesses in orders such as “The Dew Drop Inn” before “A Slice of Heaven Pizza Parlor.”
To alphabetize by a range of letters, place a file called “Doe, Jane” into a folder labeled D-F. Place a file called “Acme, Inc.” into the A-C file.

To make your scanned documents more user-friendly, save them as searchable PDFs.

As an alternative, you can photograph your documents. However, you should only do this if your camera has sharp enough resolution to capture the fine print.

, Choose a password that you can remember but would be difficult for a hacker to crack. Avoid birthdates, anniversaries, or the names of children or pets. Choose passwords that contain capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Think about numbers or symbols that can replace letters. For example, “1” can replace a capital I, or “@” can replace a lowercase a.


For added security, change your password every three to six months.

, You can buy external hard drives at any store that sells computers, such as Simply Mac or Staples. Most external hard drives are compatible with Windows or Mac but are not interchangeable. If you store your Mac files on an external drive, you can’t use it for a Windows PC or vice versa.


Store your hard drive in a fireproof safe when you’re finished backing up your files.

",How to Make Flowers Out of Baby Socks," If using used socks, clean them first.


If making a bouquet of baby socks for a gift, choose colors that look good together.;
,, Then start to roll the sock up one roll. Don't make it too tight or too loose.


The toe end should stick out over the edge of the sock as you roll.

, Three rolls should be enough to form the flower shape from a small baby sock, but judge it from the size of the sock you're working with. There should be a small amount of sock fabric between the last roll and the opening of the sock.


Again, don't roll either too tightly or too loosely.

, Now open up the sock, and as you do so, curl it around the rolled portion of the baby sock. The sock opening should swallow up the rolled portion until about halfway, with the top half of the rolls peaking out, resembling flower petals emerging from the bud.

, This will give the flower more height. Proportion it properly by making adjustments.

, Capture the end of the rolled portion. Wrap around several times to keep it in place.


It is important to push the wire high and wrap around a good base portion of the rolled part of the flower; otherwise, the rolls will fall out of shape.
Be careful not to catch the sock fabric as you wind the wire in place.

, Wrap from the sock base downward, covering all of the wire stem length you have chosen. (Alternatively, use a green pipe cleaner for the stem portion and attach with the florist's wire; that way, you only have to take the florist's tape over the wire and joined onto the pipe cleaner.)

, You will probably find that this has taken you a while to perfect. Practice on a few more before deciding whether you want to put in the effort to make a whole bunch. If you do, proceed to the next stage.

, For a decent bundle, a dozen is probably a good amount to make; that is six pairs of socks, plenty for a decent gift for the baby shower.

, This might be in a vase, stuck in a foam square, sitting on top of a bundle of wrapped diapers, etc.


If you select a pretty vase, this can be a keepsake for the parents, while a more simple option, such as a gift box, could be covered beautifully and serve as a storage box for the socks when in use. You could even print ""socks"" on the side of the box.

, Arrange neatly to appear like a bunch of flowers. You may need to use wire, ribbon, etc to hold them in place, or you could even use florist's foam and slide them into that to stand in place firmly.


Colored glass balls or marbles can be used to hold the stems inside a container such as a vase; match them to the sock flower colors.
Add real greenery as well, if wished. Baby's breath, fern leaves, pussy willows, etc., look wonderful interspersed with the baby sock flowers.
An alternative option to placing in a container is to wrap the stems in a receiving/baby blanket to look like the paper florist's use to wrap around flowers. Be sure to add a bow to finish the look and hold the folded blanket in place.

, Finish with a bow or similar embellishment.

Consider getting some dyed wool!;
, Make sure that the fibers are all going in the same direction. You do not have to cover the entire baking sheet; an 8 by 8 inch (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters) square will be plenty., For example, if all the tufts were going up-and-down in the first layer, make all the tufts go side-to-side in this layer. You can also experiment with using a different color of wool for this layer. Be sure to use a color that complements the first one, however, or you might get a muddy result.

, Remember to alternate the direction in which the fibers are going with each layer. Two layers is perfectly fine for a thin piece of felt, but if you'd like something thicker, aim for three or four layers total.Consider adding some pieces of loose-weave fabric or bits of Merino yarn on top for color and texture., This will help keep the fibers in place during the felting process. The fabric needs to be big enough to cover the entire wool sheet.

, Keep the rest of the felting solution handy to refill the bottle as needed. You will need 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 1 quart (950 milliliters) of hot water.Don't shake the bottle, or you will create too many suds.The hotter the water is, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that it is uncomfortable to work with, however.

, Don't be tempted to pour the water onto the wool. This will cause the fibers to move around too much. Instead, spray it down with your hot, soapy water until it is completely saturated (but not dripping). Ball up some bubble wrap, rub it over a piece of bar soap, then gently massage the felt using small, circular motions.If you accidentally soaked the wool, use a small sponge to mop up the excess water., Pour the water off as it cools, and spray more hot, soapy water onto it.Be sure to tuck in any loose or stray fibers as you work. This will make the edges of your sheet a little more even.

, You can tell if the wool is ready by doing a simple pinch test. Pinch a piece of the wool between your thumb and forefinger. If it stays in place and doesn't come off, you can move on the to the next step. If it lifts away, then continue pressing the wool.


The bubble wrap needs to be textured side up.

, Start by folding an inch (2.54 centimeters) of so of bubble wrap over the bottom edge of the felted wool to create a seam. Next, roll the wool up as tightly as you can along with the bubble wrap, starting from the bottom. Press down as you roll the wool to drain off any excess water.

, Roll it gently at first, then with increasing pressure later on. Don't over-felt or over-work your wool., The cold water rinse will help set the fibers. Gently press down onto the felt sheet to squeeze out the excess water. Do not wring or twist it.Consider adding a splash of white vinegar to the water.This will remove excess soap and restore the natural pH of the wool; it will brighten the wool's colors and help it last longer.

, The wool will have shrunk and thickened during the felting process. It may also shrink a little bit more while it dries. This is completely natural.

, You can cut it into squares and sew it onto a bag to make patches. You can also cut it into circles to make coasters. The possibilities are endless!

Pull apart some raw wool into tufts.,
Fill a small tub with hot water and add some liquid dish soap into it.,
Gather a few tufts into a ball, then roll them between your palms.,
Soak the ball in the hot, soapy water.,
Roll the ball between your palms until it becomes firm.,
When the wool is firm, rinse it off with cold water.,
Gently press the ball in a towel to remove excess water.,
Allow the felt ball to air dry.,
Consider threading the balls onto some twine to make a garland.Poke a hole through each ball using a darning needle, and pull some heavy thread through it.",How to Make Felt2," Do not cut the tufts. If you cut them, you will get sharp edges that will be harder to felt. You can use natural, uncolored wool, or wool that has been dyed bright colors. The size of the tufts doesn't really matter, but a 4 to 5-inch long (10 to 12 centimeters) tuft will give you a bead about the size of a cherry., You will need 2 tablespoons of dish soap for every 3 cups (700 milliliters) of water.Gently swish the water to mix, but not so much to create suds.


The hotter the water, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that you can't handle it, however.

, Don't worry about forming a firm ball just yet. You can use all one color of wool, or several different colors for a more interesting felt ball.

, Hold the ball between your fingers, then dip it into the hot, soapy water. Don't worry if the ball starts to lose its shape and sag. You will reshape it in the next step.

, The ball will be loose at first, but then it will start to become more firm. This will take about 10 minutes.Be careful not to squeeze it too much. If you are making multiple beads, the water may cool down while you work. When that happens, replace the tub with more hot, soapy water., This will get rid of the soap and help set the fibers.If you'd like, you can then soak it in some water with a splash of white vinegar in it. This will help remove the rest of the soap and brighten the wool's color.

, Be careful not to squeeze too hard, of you may distort the ball.

, This will take about 24 hours. Remember, just because the ball is dry on the outside does not necessarily mean that it is dry on the inside., You may need to use needle nose pliers to help pull the needle through, especially of the felt balls are firm.Hang the garland wherever you like when you are done.

Take a pair of old jeans.,
Cut the jeans 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the pocket line.,
Cut right at the zipper along the front of your jeans until you reach the side seam.,
Place the apron around your waist so that the pockets are in front.",How to Make an Apron from Old Jeans1," You should choose jeans that currently fit you, because you will be using the waistband and button.;
, Use sharp fabric scissors. You should be cutting through the inseam, so that your apron will be straight at the bottom.

, You will need to do this on both sides. Cut along the side seams and discard the front piece.


If you want to sew a hem on the jeans, cut 2 or 3 (5 to 7.6 cm) inches below the inseam. You will need to fold up and pin the hem.
If you do want to sew the bottom edge, you should cut 2 or 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) below the inseam on the back. You will need to fold up and pin the hem. Sew along the bottom and back stitch on the ends. If you do not sew the bottom, it will gently fray over time as you wash it.

, Button the apron in back. Place cooking, gardening or craft supplies in the pockets.


You can embellish your apron by sewing ribbons around the pockets or waistband. Pin the ribbons in place and sew them with a sewing machine or by hand.

Take a pair of old jeans.,
Cut the legs off in a straight line just below the inseam.,
Use a seam ripper to open the side seam on the leg.,
Keep the leg folded in half.,
Place bias tape along the top and bottom edges of the apron.,
Cut approximately 20 inches (51 cm) of bias tape in a loop for the neck.,
Stitch the bias tape or ribbon onto the edges of the denim, taking out pins as you go along.,
Cut out the pockets on the back of the jeans.,
Stitch the pocket and any extra embellishments, such as buttons, ribbons, tulle or ruffles, onto the denim apron.

",How to Make an Apron from Old Jeans2," The bigger the jean legs are, the bigger the apron can be.

, Cut the back with the pockets apart from the front along the side seams. You can set aside 1 of the legs for another project.

, Cut off the hem at the ankle portion of the leg. This will be the top, or bib, of the apron.

, Cut out a slight inward curve at the top to make a narrower bib. Cut a slight outward curve at the bottom so that the apron is lower in front and tapered at the sides.

, You should choose bias tape in a color or pattern of your liking, so that it makes an attractive apron. Pin the bias tape onto the apron.


You can use ribbon instead of bias tape for the embellishments and ties of your apron. Bias tape allows you to place the denim inside a pre-pressed fold, so it is easy to use in this case.

, Cut approximately 15 inches (38 cm) of bias tape for each tie on the side of your apron. Measure the same point on both sides of the apron and then pin the tape in place.

, Use a complimentary color of thread. Make sure to back stitch where the ties are affixed for extra strength.

, Sew matching bias tape around the perimeter of the pocket. Affix the pocket to the front of the apron with pins, leaving an extra gap in the pocket that will hold ingredients or tools.

Make candle holders.,
Create a lamp.,
Create liquid dispensers.",How to Upcycle Wine Bottles1," Candle holders are one of the simplest things you can create from wine bottles. This is because wine bottles come in a variety of shapes and colors that you can choose to meet your tastes.


Remove the label from the bottle.
Insert the candle.
If you want, cut the bottle to different sizes. You can choose to use the top half for a candle holder or the bottom. Just sand it once you’re done cutting.
If you cut out the bottom of a bottle, you’ll be able to place it over candles.;
, Wine bottles are great resources to create a lamp from. This is true because the bottle itself will serve as the body of the lamp. All you’ll need to do is purchase the cord, lamp socket, and nipple. To create your lamp:


Drill a hole in the bottom side of the lamp for the cord to come out of. Use a drill press if you have it. Otherwise, keep the RPMs on your drill low and use cutting oil on your bit.
Create a hole in the cork large enough so you can slide the lamp nipple through it. The screw threads for the lamp socket should protrude between a half an inch to an inch from the cork.
Run your electrical cord through the bottom of the bottle, into the cork.
Connect the electrical cable to the lamp socket.
Place the cork into the top of the bottle and screw in a lightbulb.
Pick a shade of your choice., Wine bottles are also uniquely suited to create dispensers for household liquids. All you’ll have to do is purchase a pouring spout or similar top and secure it to the top of the bottle.


You can use your new dispenser to pour soap, oil, vinegar, and more.
Experiment with different dispensing tops, as you may find new uses for your dispenser."
"
Use them to make plant waterers.,
Make wine bottles into herb planters.,
Turn wine bottles into vases.",How to Upcycle Wine Bottles2," Wine bottles are perfectly designed to make sure your plants get enough water when you’re not around. All you’ll have to do is fill the bottle with water and stick it upside down into the soil in your planter or garden.


If your soil is compacted, you may need to dig out a little hole to stick the bottle’s neck into.
You can also attach a terra cotta spike to the top of the bottle, which will help it penetrate the soil and stay in place., With a little bit of work, you’ll be able to turn wine bottles into an herb garden to keep in your kitchen or sunroom. You’ll simply have to cut the bottle in half and sand its edges. From there:


Flip the top of the bottle upside down and rest it in the bottom of the bottle.
Fill the bottle up with water so about an inch or two of the bottle’s stem has water.
Fill the top half of the water with soil or peat moss and plant an herb of your choice., Wine bottles also make excellent and natural flower vases. You can store water in the bottom and stick flowers or other plants down through the neck.


Feel free to take off the label, if you want.
Make sure to properly clean and rinse the bottle before putting flowers into it. Use soap and hot water to remove wine residue. Then, rinse it several times to make sure any soap has been rinsed out.
If you want a wide-neck vase, feel free to cut the top off and then sand it down."
"
Sketch a circle on the glass.,
Protect yourself.,
Score the glass.,
Break the glass by using boiling water.,
Sand down the edge of the bottle.",How to Upcycle Wine Bottles3," Before actually cutting the glass, you’ll have to sketch a circle around the bottle so when you score it, your cut will be straight around the bottle.


Take a string and tie it around the bottle.
Use a permanent marker and draw a line around the bottle following just below the string.
Make sure your circle is straight.
Make sure you draw your line on the glass, not on the bottle’s label. If you have to (or want to) remove the label, you can., Whenever you work with sharp objects and glass, you need to properly protect yourself. Without protection you may injure yourself or someone else.


Use thick gloves that protect you up to your forearms.
Make sure to wear safety glasses to protect yourself from shattering glass.
Secure and handle knives properly. For instance, close or put away your knives or scoring tools once you’ve used them.

, Scoring is the process by which you create a noticeable division or break in the surface of glass. This encourages the glass, when broken, to break along the scored line. Use a tool of your choice scratch the outside of the glass.


Don’t push the tool too hard, you don’t want to penetrate or break the glass.
Make sure your hand is steady and you cut the glass evenly.
Try to make the cut in one rotation, rather than several.
A scoring tool is best, but you can also use glass drill bits, or a bottle cutting kit., After you score the glass, you’ll need to heat it so it can break along the score line you already cut. However, there are a few steps you need to take before you do this.


Soak the bottle in ice cold water for a few minutes.
Remove it and dump boiling water where you scored it.
Rotate the bottle as you pour the boiling water on it.
Submerge the bottle in ice cold water. The bottle should break in two.
You may need to repeat this process if the bottle does not break the first time., After you’ve successfully cut the glass, you’ll need to sand down the edges of the bottle. This is important, as the bottle could have jagged edges or other pieces that could cut you or someone else. Use a piece of sand paper to do this.


Allow the bottle to return to room temperature
Rub the cut area gently with a piece of sand paper.
Repeat the sanding process until the edge is smooth or round – whatever you prefer."

Use a ruler or tape measure to measure out the size and shape needed for the pillow.,
Cut along the marked measurements using a sharp pair of scissors.,
Decorate the fabric.,
Pin the two pieces of fabric together.,
Sew the fabric together.,
Snip excess fabric from the corners of the fabric if desired.,
Remove the pins and turn the pillow cover right side out.,
Stuff the pillow.,
Close the pillow.",How to Make Cute Pillows out of Your Old Clothes," Dig through your closet and find articles of clothing that you no longer wear and that would make for a great color or design for a pillow. You want to select clothing that is relatively intact, as you will be repurposing the fabric.


Clothing items that are well suited to this refashioning include denim jackets, flannel shirts, and long skirts or dresses that feature lots of fabric.
Look for clothing items that have interesting designs or patterns on them, such as floral arrangements or plaid. These designs can help spice up your pillow design.
Buckles, zippers and buttons that are on the clothing can be incorporated into the pillow as well. If you choose to highlight these items, cut your fabric appropriately.
If you're missing that one color that will complete your design, consider visiting a thrift shop, or ask your neighbors if they have any clothing they no longer want.;
, There are a variety of pillow designs out there, so think about the purpose of the pillow.


Will the pillow be for decorative purposes? In this case, the size, shape and fabric are entirely up to your own liking. Decorative pillows are rarely sat upon, so comfort doesn't need to be a factor.
Will the pillow be used as a cushion? For example, will people be lying against the pillow on the couch, or will the pillow be used as a sleeping pillow? If so, size, shape, fabric and stuffing will all play an important part in the comfort level of the pillow.
Common throw pillow sizes are square in shape and range in size from 12""x12"" to 24""x24"".Common bed pillows sizes are more rectangular in shape and start at 20""x26""., Once you have identified the purpose of the pillow, select the fabric you wish to use from the old clothing you gathered earlier.


Review your materials carefully. If you want to make a larger pillow but only have a small amount of the fabric needed, you may have to change your plan.
Choose clothing with softer fabrics such as satin, silk, cotton or flannel if you are making a pillow that demands comfort, such as a bed pillow.
Tougher fabrics, such as polyester or linen, are great to use as decorative pillows, as their sturdy composition helps the pillows maintain shape and last longer.
Tougher fabrics are also useful if you need to make a sturdy cushion for kids or pets., Choosing the right stuffing for your pillow goes hand in hand with the fabric selection to create the perfect pillow for your needs. Different stuffing lends itself well to different purposes.


Materials such as cotton, wool, and duck or goose down and feathers are among the softest types of pillow stuffing and are great for sleeping pillows. Take care when selecting; some stuffing, such as down, cannot be washed, as the feathers will not dry.
Synthetic materials such as polyester, foam and microbeads tend to be cheaper than natural materials, and can range in their levels of firmness.
Seeds and herbs like buckwheat, millet, flaxseed and lavender can also be used as pillow stuffing if you're making a decorative pillow. Note that this stuffing is harder than other types of stuffing and often a bit noisy. However, certain seeds and herbs give off a pleasant aroma, which can help enhance a decorative pillow’s purpose., Choose a hard surface, such as a work table or a hardwood floor. Turn the clothing inside out and smooth it free of wrinkles. You may want to iron the fabric before you begin working.

, Make sure you add 1 inch to the intended size of your pillow to allow for proper leeway for seams. Trace along this measurement with chalk to give yourself a guide when cutting.


If your article of clothing is identical on both its front and back side, and you are confident in your cutting ability, you can trace just one measurement with chalk and use it to cut both pieces of fabric at once.
You may also mark both sides of the fabric with chalk if you like. This will be necessary if you are using two different articles of clothing for your pillow.

, If possible, cut the front and the back of the clothing at the same time to get two symmetrical pieces of fabric. If you plan on using two different styles of fabric for the pillow, you need only cut one piece from each garment of the appropriate measurement.

, You can embroider the fabric, add ribbon, affix rhinestones or sequins, or even paint the surface of the fabric to make the design entirely yours.


If you are painting or gluing decorations to the fabric, make sure that the paint or glue is appropriate for the fabric in question and will not damage the material. You may also want to choose washable paint or glue.
Allow the paint or glue plenty of time to dry before continuing to work on your pillow.

, Lay the fabric pieces on top of one another so that when you sew the fabric pieces together, the pillowcase will be inside out. Place pins along the edges of the fabric to hold the shape of the pillow in place. Make sure the pieces are perfectly aligned. If you're using fabric with a pattern, be sure the pattern won't look crooked once you sew the pillow.
Leave one edge of the pillow unpinned, so you'll have room to stuff the pillow once it is sewn.

, This can either be done by hand or by using a sewing machine. Sew the three pinned sides of the pillow case, making sure the seam is 1/4 to 1/2 inch away from the cut edge of the fabric.


Consider using a slip stitch method to hide the threading on the pillow, if desired.
The distance between the seam and the cut edge of the fabric will affect the tautness of the pillow and the amount of stuffing able to be placed inside. A larger seam allowance (1/2"") means you will be able to place less stuffing inside of the pillow. The opposite is true for smaller seam allowances (1/4"").
Partially sew the fourth side of the pillow. Leave enough space on the fourth side so that you can easily fit your hand into the pillow case.

, A gentle tapering of 1/2"" on the corners of the fabric will help reduce sharp points on the pillow, giving it a rounder, softer look.


Don't snip past the seam line!

, The edges of the fabric will be hidden inside of the pillow, resulting in a smooth appearance.

, Use the opening left in the case to insert the stuffing you have chosen for your pillow. Use more or less stuffing according to preference. To achieve even and leveled stuffing:


Pull apart and fluff softer stuffing materials such as cotton or down. You are ensuring softness while removing hard clumps.
Begin stuffing with small portions into the corner of the pillow farthest from the opening. Be gentle, but firm. You may use your hand or a spoon or rod to help stuff the pillow.
Stuff the following corners in the same fashion. Slowly work your way toward the pillow opening.
Keep an eye on the outside of the pillow as you stuff. Irregularities or divots visible on the outside of the pillow should be addressed with the redistribution or addition of stuffing.
Once the pillow is mostly stuffed, give it a gentle squeeze. If the pillow is too firm, remove stuffing to your liking. If too soft, add more stuffing.Hard stuffing such as microbeads or seed should not be packed too tightly in the pillow. Fill the pillow 3/4 of the way full with harder stuffing and then test the firmness.
Hard stuffing can also be mixed with other, softer stuffing to help balance firmness. Seed and flower petals, for example, can make for an aromatic and texturally pleasing combination.Sew over the seams of your pillow to create a tighter seam if you are unsatisfied with the level of stuffing possible in your pillow. A tighter seam will create a tighter, compact environment for the stuffing., Hand stitch the opening used for stuffing when you are satisfied with the pillow's appearance. If you are interested in retaining the ability to open the pillow, close the pillow by sewing a zipper into the opening. This will allow you to easily open the pillow to change the stuffing in the future.


Make sure you're happy with way your pillow has been stuffed before closing the pillow.
If you're using a piece of clothing with a zipper, you can align the zipper with the edge of the pillow so you can use it to open and close the pillow when desired.

If you don't have any ideas, you can get a ton from photo-sharing websites and social media sites like Pinterest or Instagram. You can also search for bloggers who specialize in DIY and upcycling projects.
Do a Google Image search. If you already have an item in mind to upcycle, type in the item that you have that you want to change, and the word ""upcycle."" For example, ""sweatshirt upcycle"" or ""jeans upcycle."";
, Besides the internet, there are resources in your own community that can fill your head with great ideas for upcycling projects!


Head to a second hand store. If you don't own anything that you're ready to cut apart, experiment on items from a second hand store or garage sale.
Try somewhere unconventional. You might take a trip to a junk yard, estate sale, or old garage or barn.

, The first step to upcycling is to know what you're going to do. This will help you plan what materials and supplies you will need and how much time to plan for.


Most upcycling projects take an old item and make it into something that is functionally the same but with new style-- for example, you can turn an old baggy shirt into a more modern style. But you can also take an old item and change it into something completely different, like using an old door as a headboard for a bed or making a sculpture out of old silverware. You can start with items you have and then try to develop ideas, or get ideas and then look for materials.
If you're clueless about how to begin to choose an upcycling project, try rummaging through your drawers, cabinets, or closet for things that you no longer use. When you find something interesting, start brainstorming ideas for a new use or new look for that item.
Rely on skills you already have when choosing your upcycling project (unless you have the time and supplies to learn a new skillset!). For example, if you don't know how to use a sewing machine or a needle and thread, don't choose a project that involves sewing.

, Decide what you would like to change and how you will do it. Choose where you will put things and how it will be laid out.


It’s a good idea to draw out your idea on paper in pencil before you start. Draw ""before"" and ""after"" diagrams, showing the item from both the front and back. Indicate what areas will be changed and how.
Your design is completely up to you! Make it stand out and give it personality.

, It can be anything from an old purse to a piece of furniture. Check to make sure the item is structurally sound and safe to work with.


For example, don't use an old piece of clothing that has compromised seams, holes, or stains in areas that will still be visible after the project.

, What you choose to work with is up to you. Make sure to have good fabric or craft glue and a nice pair of scissors.


Always have decorations and things that you can use, or that will just give you inspiration. Things like glitter, or markers, or even printed designs from the internet can come in handy.

, Working off your designs, make your creation. Make sure to wait however long is needed for your glue to dry before adding something new.


Don't be afraid to tweak the designs you find online or in books to better match your personality or just to improve on others' ideas!

, You will need an old painting or print from a thrift store, garage sale, or your own basement. (Please oh please, be sure that it is worthless before you begin your project!) The best candidates are large and with a color palette that you like, but not a design that you want to keep. The final project will hide most of the painting but the colors will peek through your letters.You will also need 2"" vinyl letter stickers in a bold font you like and that appears easy to cut out, such as Helvetica (available at craft stores or online); spray paint in white or silver (you can use other colors, but make sure it contrasts enough with the main palette on the art so that your letters will be visible); and sharp scissors., You can use lyrics from a song, a line from a poem, a verse of religious scripture, or just something catchy that you like. It needs to be short and sweet, though, so that it will fit on the canvas.


Choose your phrase depending on where you plan on displaying the painting. If it's for a family room, you might choose something like ""love lives here."" A kitchen might have something like ""season everything with love.""

, Use sharp scissors and make careful cuts to cut out every letter, spelling out your chosen phrase.


Keep in mind that if you make errors in cutting, it will show in the final product. Take your time and if you damage a letter in cutting, cut out a fresh one instead. You may end up needing more than one pack of stickers.

, You can arrange them in landscape or letter orientation on the painting, regardless of the original painting's orientation.


Arrange them before sticking them down permanently, to make sure they fit. You can justify them however you like (left, right, or centered)., Using your spray paint, spray over the entire canvas and the stickers with a coat of paint.


If you like the look of a sheerer layer, you can leave it that way. If you want a more opaque coat of color, let it dry and then spray it again. Just be sure that you don't let the paint become too thick, as it may peel up when you remove the stickers.

, After everything has dried, remove the stickers carefully. Go slowly to avoid peeling up the newly painted surface.

, Any old shirt will do, as long as the material is sturdy and not too worn. Remember that a bigger, adult-sized shirt will make a big bag, while a small, child-size shirt will make a small bag.


Keep in mind that a faded, vintage shirt will result in a faded, vintage bag. If that's not the look you're going for, a more crisp, newer shirt might be a better choice.

, It's a good idea to get everything in one place before you begin.


You will need a ruler or other straight edge (a book or box will work in a pinch), a washable marker, and sharp scissors. You might also want a large bowl, but it's optional.

, Using sharp scissors, cut around the inside of the seam that attaches the sleeve to the shirt. You will remove both sleeves as well as the seams. Don't take off any more than that.You can discard the sleeves or use them for another upcycling project, or even keep them to use as dust rags around the house.

, You can make a rounded or more oval opening at the top of the bag. This area will become your bag's handles.To make a rounded opening, use a large bowl (like a salad bowl) as a guide. Line the bowl up in the center of the shirt covering the neck hole, and then use your markers to trace the outline of the bowl edge. This should make a nice rounded guide for cutting, just under the seams around the neck of the shirt. After outlining in marker, remove the bowl and then cut through both layers of the shirt.To make a more oval opening, freehand a large ""U"" shaped outline that starts directly on either side of the shirt neck and goes a few inches down under the bottom of the seam. Try to be as symmetrical as possible; if you don't like the lines you make, try again (the marker will wash out). Cut it out, cutting through both the front and back of the shirt.

, Depending on how deep you decide, draw a straight line across the bottom of the shirt with your marker. The line should be at least three inches up from the bottom hem of the shirt, but could be more if you would prefer a more shallow bag.

, Starting at the bottom of the shirt, make slits upwards, stopping at the line you drew. Cut all the way through both layers of the shirt.


The slits should be about 3/4"" to 1"" apart. Complete the slits all the way across the bottom of the shirt. When you're done, you'll have what looks like a fringed tank top., Since this is a no-sew project, you will tie all the fringes together to reinforce the bottom of the bag (so nothing falls out when you use it!). You can choose at this point whether you'd like the fringe to be visible on the outside of the bag, or if you want it to look more like it has been sewn shut with no fringe visible.


For a fringey, boho look, keep the shirt right-side out and tie the fringe across the bottom.
For a more polished, no-fringe appearance, turn your shirt inside out before tying the fringes.
To tie the fringes (whether your bag is inside out or not), begin by tying the front and back sets of fringes in knots in pairs, all the way across the shirt. You will make two ties per set of fringes in order for it to knot and not come undone.Then, to close the gaps between the fringe knots, take one fringe from the first pair and tie it to one fringe from the second pair, tying twice to knot it. Repeat this across the entire shirt, tying every adjacent fringe pair to the one next to it. , You can use the bag instead of wasting paper or plastic bags at the grocery store, and also take it to farmer's markets to tote your produce. You can even take it to the library to tote books that you borrow.


Be sure to keep the bag clean, especially if you use it for raw meat, eggs, and/or produce. You can wash your bag between uses on a gentle cycle, and dry it on low. This will help prevent your knots from coming undone.

Take stock in what you have to create the mobile.,
Determine size and length of the mobile.,
Identify a base that will be used to hold the strands in place.,
Select strand material.",How to Use Broken Jewelry to Make a Mobile1," Sift through jewelry boxes or even troll antique stores or garage sales for pieces. Have an idea of how you’d like the mobile to be structured before selecting pieces so you can assign areas for appropriate items.


Consider integrating other found objects into your design. For example, you could anchor each mobile strand with antique doorknobs or oversize buttons. You don’t have to stick only to jewelry.
Look for opportunities to string the jewelry and other pieces. Some pieces may have loops or hoops that can be strung. In some cases you may need to drill a small hole through the jewelry or item so it can be strung.;
, For larger rooms you’ll want to go grander to make a statement and not have the mobile get lost in the room. However, smaller, two or three strand mobiles may be ideal.

, For example, you could use a beautiful Birch tree branch or even an antique hanger. Consider integrating an item that not only enhances your room but helps the mobile tell a story.


Make sure you have a mechanism that will allow you to hang the base in a room. If necessary add a hook or hanger to the top of the base.

, Mobiles can be made out of a variety of materials so choosing the strands that will hold your jewelry and hang from the mobile are extremely important. Consider fishing wire, ribbon, thread, yarn, clothing scraps and wire.

"
"
Prepare mobile base.,
String mobile strands.,
Tie mobile strands to the base.",How to Use Broken Jewelry to Make a Mobile2," Depending on how you plan to string your mobile you will either need to drill holes through the base or add small nails along the top so you can tie your strands.


If you are using a base found in nature, clean and/or sand the item so it can be maintained in the home. You may also want to add a clear coat of sealant to add a more polished appeal.

, Begin by stringing the smaller pieces first. Wind string either around or through the jewelry pieces depending on how the jewelry is constructed.

, String the strands either through the base and knot at the top or wind around the small nails that were adding during the prep phase.

Treat the pallet and line it with landscape fabric.,
Pack the pallet tightly with soil and plant up.,
Keep your vertical garden well-watered.,
Alternatively, make individual planting pockets with the landscape fabric.,
Use pallets to make a trellis for climbing plants.",How to Turn a Pallet Into a Garden1," Pallets can be used to make a basic vertical garden. Get a pallet and sand it down before treating with wood preservative or wood paint suitable for outdoors. Using a stable gun, cover the back, bottom and sides of the pallet with a double thickness of landscape fabric.;
, The best way to do this is to start planting up from the bottom row and do a row at a time going up the pallet.


The soil should be very firmly pushed into the available space and the plants should be fairly tightly packed together. It’s a good idea to leave the pallet flat for a few weeks.
This allows the plant roots to grow, enabling them to hold the soil in place better when you eventually lift the pallet to display on the vertical.

, Remember to water your vertical garden as they dry out quite quickly, especially at the bottom.


It may be easiest to lay it flat to water it. Be prepared for some soil to trickle out of the vertical planter after watering.
Also remember to use a water-soluble fertilizer regularly.

, Another way to plant inside a planter is to create individual pockets of landscape fabric in each row, behind each slat of your pallet. This is a bit fiddly to achieve but the soil is less likely to run out.

Measure up lengths of landscape fabric and put your hand inside the pallet to staple the fabric to the back wall behind the top slat.






Next bring the fabric through to the front and staple to the front of the next pallet slat down, so about a half inch of fabric is visible on the front slat of the pallet.







, Take 2 pallets and stand them against each other in a V-shape. They’ll need to be about 1.5 feet (0.5 m) apart.


Hammer two strips of wood to hold them in place in a tent shape. Put a grow bag at the base of each pallet and plant climbing plants such as trailing cucumber, beans or pumpkin.
Train these up the pallet trellis.

"
"
Fix up and paint the pallet.,
Wash a number of tin cans and make drainage holes in them.,
Nail the cans to the pallet then plant inside them.,
Decide how you want to display your pallet garden.",How to Turn a Pallet Into a Garden2," Get your pallet, check it over for rotting wood or any joins that are giving way. Do any necessary repairs to make it safe. Paint it in a bright color.

, Take some empty tin cans (enough to fill the base of the pallet). Give them a very good wash and rub with steel wool to roughen up the surface and help the paint to stick.


Using a hammer and nail, put several drainage holes into the bottom. Apply a metal primer such as Rust-oleum, then paint with several layers of acrylic paint.






Finish with a coat of clear acrylic sealer.







, When nailing the cans to the pallet, be very careful of any sharp edges (you may like to file these down). Then put 2 inches (5.1 cm) of crocks or gravel in the bottom of the cans before filling them with soil and planting up.

, These pallet gardens look best when propped against a fence or wall, rather than lying flat on the ground.


Alternatively you could hang up your pallet garden with chains to raise it vertically above the ground.






You could even attach plants to both sides and hang the pallet from a tree branch for visual interest on both sides.







"
"
Decide what kind of raised bed you want to achieve.,
Eliminate any weeds and close up the edges of the pallet.,
Lay the pallet on the ground and fill with compost.",How to Turn a Pallet Into a Garden3," You can use new, clean, heat-treated pallets to make simple, neat raised beds. You can take the pallet apart to make a deep raised bed from the timber, or just lay one on the ground to make a shallow raised bed.


Keep in mind that you won’t be able to raise the bed too high with just one pallet, but it’s a good start.
Raised bed gardening means you don’t need to bend down as much to tend plants, need to dig less and it really helps improve drainage.

, Ideally, you should start by eliminating weeds underneath where your raised bed will go. Try chemical controls, or lay down some newspaper or cardboard.


You’ll want to close up the edges of the pallet all round the narrow sides, to prevent weeds from poking through.
To do this, you can nail thin planks around the 4 edges, or use strips of weed control fabric.

, Plant it up through the slats and water well. Because you are raising the bed very little, this method will work best for shallow-rooted plants such as lettuce and strawberry.

"
"
Protect yourself from splinters.,
Look for pallets stamped with ‘HT”.,
Avoid using older pallets, as they may be contaminated.,
Check pallets carefully for signs of damage to the wood.",How to Turn a Pallet Into a Garden4," Old wooden pallets tend to be very rough and splintery. It’s important to use heavy work gloves when handling them. You may like to sand them down before using them. If you do this, use a face mask and eye protection.

, These are a bit harder to find. This means the wood was heat treated, not chemically treated, in order to preserve the wood when it was made. It’s important to use a new, unused HT pallet if growing edible plants.


This is important, as wood can absorb chemicals after manufacture, for example if the pallet came into contact with chemicals such as bitumen or petrol when in use. That’s why you want to use a new pallet for growing edible plants.

, When the wood gets wet it’s also a good breeding ground for bacteria such as salmonella, E. coli and Listeria.


For any kind of use, it may be best to avoid old pallets that you suspect may be contaminated with chemicals. Avoid bringing old pallets into the house.
You can mitigate the bacterial risk by scrubbing your pallet clean with soapy water and weakened bleach, or soaking in a disinfectant solution. Over time the bacteria may build up again though.

, Beware of protruding nails and the wood shattering into sharp pieces when you work with it. If you notice any obvious signs of damage, you should work with a different pallet instead.

Select a suitable background photo.",How to Turn a Broken Watch Into a Locket Bracelet1," Look for a photo that has character and will complement the style of the watch. If the photo is not already sized to fit the area, edit it in your photo program or take it to a professional print shop for proper sizing.;
"
"
Remove the watch face.,
Remove watch hands and any hardware holding these in place.,
Dust and/or clean the watch.",How to Turn a Broken Watch Into a Locket Bracelet2," Using the screwdriver, remove the watch face. You may be able to simply pop it from the watch using a dull kitchen knife too (depending upon the watch).

, Ensure there is nothing on the watch face that could puncture or compromise the photo once you mount it.

, Especially if the watch has not been cleaned in some time, you’ll want to make sure its free of debris and dirt. Use either a soft cloth or jewelry cleaner (depending upon the type of watch).


If you plan to cover the watch face area with a material, now is a good time to do so. Adhere material with a hot glue gun or super strength glue (depending upon the watch).







"
"
Mount the photo inside the watch face.,
Cover the watch glass face that you previously removed and put back in place.",How to Turn a Broken Watch Into a Locket Bracelet3," Add a few small dabs of glue to hold it in place. Avoid letting the glue ooze from the sides, while still ensuring the photo stays firmly in place.

, If you plan to cover the glass, be sure the material has been precisely sized to fit. However, if you plan to keep it clear, simply return the glass to the watch face and screw or pop in place. Your new locket bracelet is ready to wear.

Make double-brewed tea.,
Add flavor to food.,
Care for your garden.,
Disguise bad odors.",How to Reuse Tea Bags1," Some people use the term 'double-brewed' tea to refer to concentrated tea that has been steeped twice, but the phrase can also be used to mean tea that has been brewed with reused teabags. Simply leave the teabags in the water for 2-3 minutes longer than usual to account for the loss of effectiveness.


You should not reuse teabags in this manner more than once or twice.
If you are not planning on reusing them right away, put them in the refrigerator in enough water to keep them completely wet. Storing used teabags at room temperature or in dry conditions can cause mold growth and invite unwanted bacteria.;
, Old teabags can be reused quite easily during cooking. Experimenting with old teabags in the kitchen may impart color and flavor to foods. For instance, adding chamomile or jasmine tea to rice can infuse it with a delicate fragrance, and Chai or cinnamon tea can boost the flavors in a simple bowl of oatmeal.


Place old teabags in the water you are using to boil pasta or rice for added flavor.
Add old teabags to the water you have just used to boil eggs for added flavor and color.
Add tea to your meat smoker for tea-infused smoked meats., Mixing teabags into soil has a great number of beneficial effects, including increasing nitrogen and acidity levels, attracting good bacteria, lowering the pH level of the soil, and giving earthworms something good to eat. You can also add old teabags to your compost pile, as long as they are not made of plastic and you remove any metal staples first., Because teabags are absorbent and aromatic, they can be used to mitigate offensive smells. Peppermint and cinnamon flavored teas in particular have a very strong and pleasant aromas.


Place used teabags in the trashcan and refrigerator to dispel bad odors.
Scrub your hands with used teabags to remove unpleasant scents like those of garlic or fish.
Turn old teabags into air fresheners by waiting until they are completely dry and adding a couple of drops of essential oil, like lavender or peppermint."
"
Degrease stubborn dishes.,
Clean the very bottom of the toilet bowl.,
Shine your mirrors.,
Clean your carpet or rug.",How to Reuse Tea Bags2," Active compounds found in tea are a natural alternative to harsh chemicals commonly found in store-bought dish soaps. Help degrease especially problematic dirty dishes by adding old teabags to a sink full of warm water and soaking them for a while before trying your hand at scrubbing them again., Set two or three used teabags in your toilet and let them sit for several minutes. Flush the toilet, then scrub the bottom of the bowl to help remove pesky stains at the bottom. Be careful, though—leaving the tea in the toilet for too long can actually cause more staining due to the tannins, so it might be better to use a lighter-colored tea for this purpose., Wipe your mirrors down with wet used teabags and then buff them dry with a soft cloth. The natural, active compounds in the tea help to break down scum, and making sure to dry the mirror in circular motions will help you achieve a streak-free shine., Split open your used teabags and wait for the tea leaves to become mostly dry. Then, sprinkle them all over your carpet or rug and wait until they are completely dry. Vacuum up the tea leaves, and not only will you have a cleaner carpet but your vacuum cleaner will smell better, too!"
"
Treat minor injuries.,
Soothe tired eyes.,
Add them to your foot soak, face steam, or bath.",How to Reuse Tea Bags3," If you have a small problem area, like a mosquito bite or slight sunburn, the antioxidants in old teabags can potentially help you heal faster. The epigallocatechin-3-gallate or ECGC found in tea is also an anti-inflammatory. Polyphenols reduce redness, and tannins and theobromine reduce pain.Apply a wet used teabag to the problem area and let sit until dry to benefit from these particular properties.
If you are not yet satisfied with the results, you can re-wet the teabag and use it again in the exact same way.
Injuries or problem areas for which this is potentially helpful include blisters, razor burn, sunburn, poison ivy, recent injection sites, acne, plantar warts, bruises, cold sores, bug stings or bites and even gums which are still bleeding from a lost baby tooth., The caffeine found in tea can help shrink blood vessels around your eyes, reducing the appearance of dark circles, while the tannins help to improve your circulation. Refrigerate the used teabags for 20 minutes; the cooler temperature of the teabags will help reduce swelling. Make sure they are still damp, but not soaking wet, and apply them to your eyes for 15-20 minutes., Add a couple of lavender, peppermint, or chamomile teabags to a hot foot soak or face-steaming bowl and the antioxidants will soften your skin while the enticing aromas help deal with any problematic odors in the area.You can experience a similar effect over your entire body by adding a couple more of them to an entire bathtub full of hot water.
This can also improve the health of your hair and scalp by way of antioxidants and vitamins, like vitamins C and E.Picking a smell that you particularly enjoy can have aroma-therapeutic effects to boot.

Find a tank top to use as a template.,
Choose a t-shirt you won't mind cutting up and turn it inside out.,
Iron both shirts to remove any wrinkles.,
Place the tank top on top of the t-shirt, and align the shoulders.,
Pin the tank top to the t-shirt to keep it from moving.,
Cut the t-shirt, using the tank top's armholes and neckline as a guide.,
Unpin the tank top from the t-shirt and put it away.,
Cut the front neckline and armholes wider, if desired.,
Fold the cut edges down, pin them in place, and press them flat with an iron.,
Stitch the folded edges down using a ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters) seam allowance.,
Remove the pins, turn the tank right side out, and try it on.",How to Make a T Shirt a Tank Top1," Since you'll be using it as a model, make sure that the fit is just right and looks good on you.


If you don't have a tank top to use as a template, don't worry. You can still make a tank top.;
, The shirt does not need to fit well, unless you want a fitted tank top. If the shirt is a brand new shirt, wash and dry it first. Fabric tends to shrink after you wash it the first time, and you want the shirt to be the right size before you start working on it.








, Even if your shirts are already nice and smooth, it might be a good idea to do this. Ironing will smooth the fabric and make it easier to work with.








, Lay the t-shirt flat on a table, then lay the tank top over it. Make sure that the shoulders of the tank top are aligned with the shoulders of the t-shirt. Also, make sure that the front of both shirts is facing upwards.








, Place straight pins all along the edges of the tank top. Take care to pin all the way through all layers of both shirts. This will keep the shirts from moving, and make your cutting more even.








, If you'd like a finished hem around the armholes and neckline, leave a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. A finished hem is not a requirement for t-shirt tank tops, as the fabric does not fray. A finished hem will look nicer, however.









If you don't have a tank top to use as a guide, cut the sleeves and collar off of your t-shirt. Consider folding the shirt in half before cutting it, so that both sides will be even., Take the pins out and put the tank top away. Make sure that the t-shirt is still inside out at this point. You won't be turning it right side out until the very end.








, Some tank tops will have a lower neckline in the front than in the back. The same goes for the armholes. Don't trim too much off, if you plan on having finished hems; remember to leave a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance.








, Fold the edges down by ½-inch (1.27 centimeters). Secure the folds with straight pins, and press them flat with an iron. When folding, make sure that you are folding towards the outside, not the inside.









If you'd like the edges to be raw and un-hemmed, you can skip this step. T-shirts are made from jersey material, which does not fray.

, You can sew by hand or use a sewing machine for more professional, durable stitches.









If you are using a sewing machine, try to use a stitch intended for knit fabrics. It looks like a straight stitch, except that it is broken up by a V every few stitches.
When you are done sewing, remember to tie the ends of the threads off into tight knots, and to snip the excess tail ends off.

, The tank top will be a little loose, unless you used a fitted t-shirt or trimmed the sides down.

Start with a t-shirt you won't mind cutting up.,
Cut the sleeves off.,
Cut the hem off your shirt, then snip it to make a long strand.,
Trim the back of the armholes into a racerback shape.,
Cut a deep V-shape into the back of your shirt.,
Tie one end of the fabric strand to the bottom of the V-shape.,
Wrap the strand around the fabric moving downward.,
Wrap the strand back towards the top of the shirt and secure the end.,
Consider trimming the bottom of your tank top to give it a high-low look.,
Wear your racerback.",How to Make a T Shirt a Tank Top2," Make sure that the shirt is washed. If this is a brand-new shirt, throw it into the washer and wash it; be sure to dry it afterward. Brand new shirts may shrink a little bit after you wash them the first time. You want the t-shirt to fit you properly before you begin cutting it and turning it into a racerback.


A racerback tank top has wider armholes in the back, leaving a skinny band of fabric between the shoulder blades.

, Start from just under the armpits, then cut straight up towards the shoulders.








, Cut right along the bottom hem of your t-shirt, using the stitching as a guide. When you are done, you will end up with a large, fabric ring. Cut this ring apart, close to one of the side seams, so that you end up with a long, fabric strand. You will use this to decorate the back of your tank top.








, Turn the shirt over so that the back is facing you. Trim the back of the armholes further until there are only a few inches of fabric between them. Be careful not to cut the armholes on the front of the shirt.









Make sure that you cut the same amount from each side of the shirt.
Cut the armholes deep. They should be a few inches apart when you are done.

, Find the back center of the neckline, then cut a deep V-shape. Keep the point of the V-shape between the armholes. This will help keep the fabric from bunching up when you tie it up.








Do not cut the front of the shirt; you are only cutting the back. Racerbacks have a plain collar in the front.
If you prefer a plain racerback, you can skip this step, and wear your racerback. The next few steps will teach you how to make a fancier racerback.

, Find the bottom of the V-shape and measure up a few inches







, Try to wrap as tightly as you can, so that the fabric between the armholes turns into a ""rope."" Stop when you reach the bottom of the armholes.








, You can do this simply by tucking the end under the wound fabric. For extra security, tie the two ends of the strand together into a tight knot first.








, Spread the shirt down sideways, so that you see only the side seam, the armhole, and half of the front and back. Find the folded front side of the shirt. Measure up a few inches, then start cutting downwards towards the back of the shirt. When you are done, your shirt will be shorter in the front, and longer in the back., You do not need to worry about hemming, because t-shirt fabric does not fray. Racerback shirts are perfect for layering over bandeau tops and for working out.

Collect your supplies.,
Take out the painting from its frame.,
Plan the design you will add.,
Prepare to paint.,
Paint your base layer.,
Add accents to your design.,
Return the painting to its frame.",How to Upcycle Old Paintings1," Over the course of this project, you're going to paint changes onto an old painting to make it unique, new, and interesting. Any supplies that you don't have on hand can be purchased at a local general retailer, hobby store, or hardware store. You'll need:


Drop cloth (optional; recommended)
Old painting (or print)
Paint (acrylic recommended)
Paintbrush
Cup (for cleansing paintbrush)
Paper towel
Pencil
Palette (or paper plate)
Paper
Pliers (optional);
, In most cases, small fasteners will hold your picture in place in the frame. These can usually be released with your hand, but for especially old paintings or stubborn fasteners, you may need to use a tool, like a screwdriver, to remove the painting.


Frequently, you'll find a rigid piece of cardboard or card stock can be behind the painting, also held in place by the fasteners. Remove this as well, if necessary.
Some paintings may be nailed into the frame. Grasp these nails with pliers and twist while pulling gently to remove nails., Take stock of your painting. Look for spots where you might add a character, animal, or some other kind of embellishment. For example, you might add a pop culture image to your old painting, like a zombie, a character from a favorite TV show or movie, or something to this effect.You may want practice the image you plan on adding on a scrap piece of paper before modifying the painting.
If you're unsure of your freehand painting ability, you might want to make and use a stencil.

, You might want to lay down a drop cloth or newspaper on your work surface to prevent these from getting stained by drips or spatter. Fill your cup with water so you can easily cleanse your paintbrush of paint and switch to new colors. Pour the paint you will use on a palette or paper paint so it is accessible.

, Dip a clean paintbrush in your paint and wipe off excess paint on your palette or paper plate.Then, apply the base layer of paint, which will be the main color of your image. Then allow the paint to dry.Some examples of base layers include: brown for a brown dog, yellow for a giraffe, orange for a fox, black for a black cat, skin tone for a human, and so on.
If painting directly over top the old painting is daunting, you can trace your desired image, paint it separately, then glue it into place on the painting.
Depending on the kind of paint you are using, the drying time will vary. Check and follow your paint's label instructions for best results.

, Now that the base layer is dry, you can add detail to your image. However, less experienced painters might want to keep these simple to minimize errors. Cleanse your brush of paint by swirling it thoroughly in your cup of water, wipe excess moisture from the brush onto a piece of paper towel, reapply paint to the brush, and add your accents.Some details you might add include things like: eyes, nose(s), mouth(s), clothing, glasses, and so on.
Remember to cleanse your brush and remove excess moisture from it when you switch colors. Otherwise, the colors will mix and change.
Allow your detail work to dry completely before returning the picture to the frame. Check the label for best results, but generally, paint should be dry in 24 hours.

, Slide your modified painting back into its frame. If there is a rigid cardboard/card stock backing, replace this as well. Then close the fasteners to hold the painting in place. Your upcycled painting is ready to be hung.

Gather your materials.,
Prepare your work area.,
Remove your painting from its frame.,
Mix the chalkboard paint well.,
Paint your first coat on the old painting.,
Apply the second coat.,
Re-insert the painting in its frame.",How to Upcycle Old Paintings2," If you don't already have chalkboard paint, you can purchase this at most craft and hardware stores. Any other supplies you are lacking can be found at most general retailers or your local hardware store. For this project, you'll need:


Chalkboard paint
Drop cloth (optional; recommended)
Old painting (or print)
Paintbrush
Palette (or paper plate; optional)
Pliers (optional)
Screwdriver (optional)

, You'll be applying chalkboard paint to your old painting to transform it into a chalkboard, so you may want to lay down a drop cloth to cover your work surface with a drop cloth to catch drips or spatter. Work on a flat, level, sturdy surface.


When painting large pieces or multiple pieces at the same time with chalkboard paint, work in a room with good airflow to prevent the buildup of potentially dangerous fumes., Depending on the kind of frame your painting is in, you may have to adjust tabs holding the painting in the frame or remove fasteners with a screwdriver. In some cases, you may need to remove a hard backing, like cardboard, protecting the back of the painting.


When working with especially old paintings, the fasteners may have degraded, rusted, or become otherwise difficult to adjust. If this is your situation, you may have to replace the fasteners.
If your painting has been nailed to the frame, use pliers to remove these by pulling and gently twisting the nail free., For the best results, you should follow the label directions written on your paint to determine the best method for mixing. Generally, this involves closing the container and shaking the paint thoroughly., You may be able to dip a paintbrush straight into your paint container, but if not, pour some on a paper plate or artist's palette. Take your paintbrush and apply the paint in an even layer to the painted side of your painting.Use horizontal strokes (left to right, or vice versa) when painting your first layer of chalkboard paint.After your first layer is completely painted, wait several hours for the paint to dry before adding a second coat., Once your first coat is finished drying, add the second one in the same fashion as the first. However, this time use vertical (up and down, or vice versa) strokes with your brush.


When your second layer is completed, you'll need to let it cure for 24 hours to ensure a strong bond between the paint and painting.After curing, you should condition the paint so that it writes smoothly. Take a piece of chalk and rub its side gently against the paint until it is covered., Take your upcycled painting and return it to the frame, replace the backing if there is any, and refasten the fasteners to lock the upcycled painting in place. Hang the frame, and enjoy your new blackboard.

Replace the painting in its frame.",How to Upcycle Old Paintings3," To create your collage, you can use cutouts from magazines, fabric, or other sources as well. In the example provided, you'll use one of the prints/paintings to form the background, then cut features out from other prints/paintings to add to this background. Altogether, you'll need:


Old paintings (or prints; several)
Glue
Pliers (optional)
Screwdriver (optional)
Scissors

, Use your hands to release the fasteners holding each painting in the frame. If the fasteners are old and difficult to manipulate, you might need to use a tool, like a screwdriver to pry the fasteners open and remove the painting.


Some of your paintings may have a rigid protective backing made of cardboard or card stock. Remove this along with the painting, if necessary.
Use pliers to remove nails from paintings that are nailed into their frames. Do this by gently pulling and twisting the nails free with the pliers., The background you choose is purely a matter of taste. When deciding your background, however, think about what aspects of the other pictures you want to use, and how these might influence the end result.Unexpected combinations can really spice up peaceful paintings. For example, you might add army men or a killer robot to a pastoral scene., Take your scissors and cut out the images from other paintings that you wish to add to your background. Add a thin layer of glue to the back of the cut-outs, then stick them into place on your background.After cutting, arrange the images on the background to see how it looks before gluing.
Allow your glue to completely dry for the time indicated on its label. For many glues, this will only take a few hours.

, Slide your upcycled painting into the frame. If there is rigid backing, place this behind the painting. Close the fasteners on the back of the painting and hang your brand new, upcycled painting.

",How to Make a Sleeveless T Shirt from an Unused T Shirt," Pull out your favorite T-shirts, and decide which of them you might want to turn sleeveless. Try them on, and see which looks the best on you.;
, Roll up the sleeves as high as you can, or tuck them into the shirt around the seam to see if it looks good as a sleeveless T-shirt.








, There are two ways to go: leave the seam between the sleeve and the shirt in place, or cut it out.









Leaving the seam intact will keep your finished T-shirt from unravelling and looking shabby. It will also make a smaller armhole. For a baggy T-shirt, this is a good approach.
Cutting out the seam with the sleeve is a more casual look, and because the hole is larger, a little more comfortable as well.
If the armhole is going to be too deep, modify your cut. Instead of following the seam all the way around the sleeve, when you are about 2/3s down the sleeve, angle out into the bottom of the sleeve. When you reach the bottom seam of the sleeve, reverse the angle and cut back in towards the shirt seam, leaving a triangle of shirtsleeve at the bottom of the hole. Trim that to fit.

, If you’re cutting out the seam with the sleeve, mark where you are going to cut with chalk. If you’re going to keep the seam, poke your scissors into the sleeve about 1/8 inch (3mm) from the seam.








, If you’re keeping the seam, keep the cut close to it, about 1/8 inch (3mm) all the way around. Be careful not to cut too close to the seam, or it may unravel after a couple washings.









If you are cutting out the seam, follow your chalk lines, and cut as smoothly as you can to avoid a jagged look.
Repeat on the other sleeve.
Keep the sleeves for future projects.

, They will curl and soften with use, and help you keep your cool all summer long!

Find one or more interesting pillowcases.,
Know your needs.,
Gather your materials.",How to Make a Pillowcase Dress1," Look for interesting colours, print, textures and fabrics. You may find sexy satin ones, lacy trim, or wacky '70s prints. Vintage linens are especially fun, so hunt around at garage sales and thrift stores.









Of course, it's easiest to turn a pillowcase into a dress for a very young girl. Anything bright and flowery will do the trick.;
, Who you're making the dress for will greatly change the amount of fabric you need. If the dress is for a small girl, consider the following measuring guidelines:









6 - 12 mos: width - 15"", length - 18-19"", finished length - 14-15""
18 - 24 mos: width - 18"", length - 20-22"", finished length - 16-18""
Size 2 - 8: width - 22"", length - 24-31"", finished length - 20-27""
Determine the length you want and then add 3-4"" for a seam allowance. It should start from the collarbone and go to the knee.

, A pillowcase dress is one of the easiest types of dresses to make and requires minimal sewing. Designate your creating area, make a space wide enough to work in, and assemble your materials. You'll need:









Your pillowcase
Scissors
Ribbon
Bias binding (optional)

Size and length of pillowcase and ribbon determined by wearer's size



"
"
Cut open the closed end.,
Cut curved openings for the arms.,
Hem the curved openings.,
Sew a casing on the front and back of the dress.,
Pull a ribbon through each side of the casing.,
Tie the ribbons at the shoulders to make straps for the sun dress.,
Tie another ribbon or sash around the waist, if desired.",How to Make a Pillowcase Dress2," Use fabric scissors to start turning your potato sack/nun's habit into something much more fashionable.









Be diligent, but don't stress if your cut isn't perfect. You'll be hemming it anyway.
If your pillowcase needs to be shorter, cut the length to your needs.

, Do this on what was the closed end just a second ago.









Fold your pillowcase in half prior to sewing to cut mirrored openings.
Use another dress for reference or feel free to eyeball it, if you're confident!

, This dress is sleeveless, so don't hem the front and back together!









Use bias binding (if you have it) to give your dress a ""bordered"" feel.

, Use an iron to flatten the fabric prior to sewing to ensure a symmetrical casing for your ribbon.









Pin the casing in the front and back for extra guidance. In addition, it's a good idea to reverse at the edges as this is a stress point for the dress.

, It needs to be of a sufficient length to pull through the dress and tie easily at the shoulders.









Double the length of what it takes to cross the width of the dress, including the area of the shoulders, to make sure you have enough for a sturdy bow. Do this twice for ribbons of equal length.
Use a safety pin to guide your ribbon through the channel.

, Gather the dress depending on the size of the wearer.









When you decide on your ribbon length, it's a good idea to do a fixed bow so it doesn't unravel while wearing.

, It should wrap around the natural waistline--the smallest point of the torso.









For a young girl, this often isn't necessary. If given as a gift, however, include the sash just in case.

Cut open the closed end.,
Fold over and sew the casing.,
Pull a drawstring or elastic through the casing.,
Finished.",How to Make a Pillowcase Dress3," Make sure it fits over your head and around your hips. The open end is already hemmed for you!









Of course, you can always measure the pillowcase to your waist and hips before you begin.
If you need a larger waist than one pillowcase, find two matching pillowcases, open them both on the long side seam, and stitch them together. You can either cut them to size or gather the excess material.
If you need a smaller waist, try on the tube inside out and place pins to loosely contour your body. Iron and sew as need be.

, If you made the sundress, this follows the same practices. Fold over the cut end an inch or two (2.5-5 cm) to form a channel for your drawstring.









Leave a 1"" (2.5 cm) opening to be able to insert the elastic. You can either do this front and center or on your side. It also can be on the outside if you are opting for a matching ribbon that you are proud to display.

, Adjust it to your waist or the wearer's.









Attach a safety pin to the end of your string to easily guide it through the channel you've created.

, Add any embellishments you desire to make it your own signature style.

Smooth out any wrinkles with your hands. If your cotton tee is wrinkly, quickly go over it with an iron.Choose a cotton blend that does not fray when cut. This will help your completed halter top to appear less homemade.;
, Prior to cutting the t-shirt, it is recommended that you use a chalk pencil to draw the cut lines. Draw 1 chalk line at approximately a 45° angle from the right side seam, just below the armpit, to the collar. Draw a second diagonal chalk line from the left side seam, just below the armpit, to the collar.


The right and the left lines will not meet at the neck—the lines should be approximately 5 to 6 inches apart., Carefully cut along the right chalk line with a pair of fabric scissors. As you cut from the side seam through the collar, you will cut through both layers of the tee. Repeat this process on the other side. To cut off the remaining portion of the collar, carefully cut along the collar line., Fold the top layer of the shirt down onto itself. With your chalk pencil, draw a straight line on the inside back layer of the shirt. Place the line directly above the fold of the top layer and extend it from side seam to side seam. Cut off the top portion of the back layer along the chalk line., Unfold the front layer of the shirt. Flip over tee so that the front of the shirt is on the table. Unroll your length of rope and place it along the neckline. Place the rope and the neckline of the cotton tee between your thumbs and forefingers. Slowly roll the rope and neckline down so that the material wraps around the rope twice. Secure it in place with pins., To secure the rope in place, you will need to close the loop by hand. Thread your needle and proceed to top-stitch along the base of the loop, located on the inside of the shirt. When you reach the end of the neck, sew in a few knots to prevent the stitches from slipping., Before slipping on the halter top, you must decide how to finish off the ends of the rope. For a polished look, knot the ends of the rope. For a more natural look, fray the ends slightly and then knot the lines. Slip on your new halter and tie the rope to secure it in place."

Detach the straps from the back.,
Remove the hardware from the straps.,
Finish the ends of the straps.",How to Make a Halter Top2," To detach the spaghetti straps from the back of the tank, you can use a seam ripper or a pair of scissors. Seam rippers are designed to remove individual stitches. If you choose to use a seam ripper for this project, you will be able to remove the entire strap from the back of the tank top neatly. If you do not have a seam ripper, you may use a pair of scissors to cut the straps off the back of the t-shirt., Pull the hardware down to the end of each strap. This will loosen, or lengthen, both straps completely. Use a pair of scissors to cut the small loop as close to the end of the strap as possible. Slide off the hardware., To prevent the ends from fraying, you may finish the straps in one of two ways.


Tack down the ends of the straps. Fold over the end of one strap and secure it in place with a pin. Thread a needle and proceed to tack down the end of one strap. Repeat this process on the other strap. This application will leave your halter top looking looking polished.






Tie knots at the ends of the straps. To prevent the ends from fraying, tie one to two knots at the end of each strap. Secure the knot in place with a few stitches. This application is simpler. "

, Measure 20 centimeters down from the top of the triangle. Mark this distance with a chalk pencil. Place the top edge of a ruler on this mark so that it runs from one edge to the other edge of the scarf. Use your chalk pencil to draw a horizontal line along the top edge of the ruler from one edge to the other. Place four pins along the chalk line to secure the fabric in place., Thread your sewing machine or a needle. With your tool of choice, carefully stitch across the chalk line, removing the pins as you reach them. Flip the handkerchief right side out. Press the scarf with an iron set on low. The line of stitches you created in the scarf will now serve as the seam, or neckline.

Be sure that the pockets are left intact in their entirety. They will be where the stored items are placed.;
, Cut off any excess threads or fabric, if needed.

, The pockets should each be accessible when placed across the board in the form of a fabric collage. See the image for guidance.

, Use fabric glue to adhere the fabric pieces to the board. Overlap the edges and glue each fabric piece to the back of the board as well as onto the front of it; the image demonstrates what you need to do.

, Glue some yarn or thread to the back of the board in a loop or half circle shape. You will use this to hang the board if you need to hang it. (Or, you can simply lean it, that's up to you.)


A more substantial hanger can be made by drilling two holes into the top of the board and threading strong yarn or string through the holes to form a hanging loop. Knot well.

, Choose a selection of fabric paints to add color to the board.


While fabric paints are the best choice, you can use any liquid color you prefer because you won't need to wash the denim board. You can use gouache or acrylic.

, Trace around anything small and circular, such as a bottle lid.


You can use any shapes you like––polka dots are simply one suggestion because they look good and they're easy to paint.

,


It is recommended that you tuck paper inside the pockets when painting, so that the paint doesn't leach through to the board side and cause the pocket to stick together.

, For example, a small set of sticky notes. Glue the notepaper to the board for those quick jottings you will likely make in the future––if you hang the board in your kitchen, you can use the notes to write down your kitchen needs. Just take care not to glue the notepaper in any way that will obstruct using the pockets. Allow the glue to dry for at least 30 minutes, or for the time noted on the glue label.

, You can now fill it with pencils, pens, an eraser, reminders and anything else that's relevant.

Polyurethane is more easily cleaned than normal leather, and this is sufficient for daily care and lightly soiled surfaces., Whether dealing with a stain or dirt that’s been rubbed in, simple water might not be sufficient. Use unscented soap to ensure no chemicals or possible residue will affect the leather. Rub the bar on the tougher grime.You can also use liquid soap or a dish detergent for this step., Wipe thoroughly until the surface is completely clear of soap. Leaving the soap on the surface could damage it.

Pay extra attention to seams, where dirt often gathers.Microsuede is created to mimic the nap, or raised surface, of natural suede. It is not waterproof like PVC and must be treated carefully to maintain it.

, microsuede dyes fade very easily. This is especially important for microsuede furniture and clothing., Microsuede is water-resistant, so the sooner you can mop up liquid, the less likely it is to sink in and stain.Make sure not to rub the spill, as it could settle in the surface. Dab at the spill with your cloth until the liquid is cleared., Dish detergents are formulated to remove grease and water-based stains. Wet a cloth with the solution and rub it on the stain until it comes out.Use as little water as possible when cleaning microsuede. The water can sink into the lining or pads after prolonged wetness.

, Use a clean sponge, dipped in water, to rinse the stain.After rising, blow dry on a cool setting to prevent a water-ring from forming.

, This should return the nap to the surface. You may need to clean microsuede with upholstering cleaner every few months, since it is prone to staining and damage from the elements., You can find a spray on the Internet, supermarket or cleaning outlet. Look for an indication that it is safe for microsuede before using.

Change the location and use of old furniture.,
Bridge the gap between indoors and outdoors.,
Replace or add new hardware to an existing piece.,
Purchase slipcovers for old upholstered furniture.,
Saw old furniture into completely new shapes.,
Refinish old pieces of furniture.",How to Reuse Old Furniture," A quick and free way to update an old piece of furniture is to move it to a new location and use it for something else.


An old bookcase that looks unattractive in your living room may be the perfect piece for storing your bathroom essentials, for instance.
An unneeded wardrobe can be moved to the living room and used to hide away the cluttered cords of an entertainment system.;
, You can often update a piece of furniture by deliberately breaking the rules regarding indoor or outdoor use.


Your worn but durable patio chairs may give your kitchen a fresh, eclectic look when used as dining chairs.
An old nightstand might work well as a side table on a deck, for example.

, You may be surprised at how dramatic a change can result from swapping out the hardware on old, outdated furniture.


Handles and drawer pulls can be easily updated for a fresh look. This is also a quick way to update kitchen cabinets.
You can also consider adding new doors or shelves to an existing piece of furniture to hide or organize bothersome clutter.
Adding casters to a small nightstand or side table can allow you to create a rolling kitchen island for additional storage and prep space.

, If an old sofa or chair has become an eyesore due to stains, tears, or an outdated pattern, consider slipcovers for an inexpensive update.

, For a dramatic way to reuse old furniture, you can completely alter its shape and purpose using some basic tools.


Saw an old coffee table in half lengthwise. The cut edge can then be secured to a wall for a simple 2-leg console table, or you can even stack the 2 cut pieces to create multiple shelves.
You can also saw the legs of a dining table down so that it can be reused as a coffee table or a low play table for children.

, Most of the time, what makes a piece of furniture look outdated is its finish. You can freshen up the furniture's appearance by sanding or stripping away the existing finish and painting or staining it.


If you do not want to deal with chemical strippers or heavy scraping, consider using paint, which can be applied over an existing finish.
For furniture that will see heavy use, such as a dining table or any furniture subjected to wear by pets or small children, seal the finish with a durable sealant like polyurethane.

, The size of the jars makes them ideal to store such items as buttons, sequins, beads and other sewing baubles.

, Add nuts, bolts, screws, nails, washers and other small hardware items to the jars. If you're handy with wood, screw the lids into a piece of wood and mount the wood as a shelf. The jars simply screw or pop back into the lids and create a tidy storage space.

, Fill the jars with potpourri of choice. Cover the top of the jar with lace or other wide weave cloth to allow the scent to waft out. Finish up with a sweet ribbon bow tied around the jar to hold down the lace or other fabric.

, The jars are great for taking small amounts of food such as jam, pickles, sauce etc. along to a picnic or tailgate event instead of having to take along the entire large jar such items come in originally. Obviously, don't use the jars for storage of such items after the picnic; what has not been eaten should be discarded after the picnic.

Clean the jar with soap and water.,
Remove the label by soaking it in water and vinegar.,
Dry the jar with a towel.",How to Reuse a Jar1," If your jar used to contain food or other perishable items, be sure to thoroughly scrub the inside with soap and water to avoid bacterial or mold growth. Any residual odors can be removed by using baking soda and vinegar.Some odors, like sauerkraut or coffee, are more stubborn. If baking soda and vinegar did not work, you can also use soapy water combined with coarse sea salt to absorb the odor. Shake the jar vigorously for 30 seconds to abrasively clean the inside of the jar, then rinse and let the jar dry.;
, Most labels should be removable by using a combination of water and white vinegar or washing soda. Fill your sink or a tub with the solution and submerge the jar for around 10 minutes. Some labels can take up to half an hour, but feel free to check before then. Use a sponge or steel wool to scrub off any remaining adhesive.You can also use nail polish remover or mineral spirits to remove residue from particularly stubborn labels.
Another method for removing labels is to use a hair dryer and melt the adhesive behind the label with prolonged heat. This method has mixed results, however, and will only work on glass jars. This method is unsuitable for plastic containers as they would melt under the heat. , Future decorations like paint, tape, or glue have limited effectiveness when applied to a wet surface. You can either dry the jar with a towel or let it air dry in sunlight or overnight. If you choose to use a towel, pay special attention to the threads at the top where water is most likely to remain.


Drying a jar in sunlight has the added bonus of potentially removing any leftover odor that you missed."

Paint the jar with glass paint.,
Paint the lid.,
Decorate the exterior with ribbon and twine.,
Attach decorative objects with glue.",How to Reuse a Jar2," Glass is a tricky material, so some types of paint will work better than others. For best results use “glass paint” - also known as acrylic enamel paint.This type of paint will stick more strongly to glass than others and will also dry with a glossy sheen that resists scratching and peeling. Other paints will work fine, but multiple coats are advised to ensure that they stick and provide ample coverage.


Fully painted jars work best when you do not want or care to see the contents. When using a jar as a terrarium or flower pot, for example, you could paint over the dirt and make it so only the plants themselves are visible.
It is not recommended to paint jars that you intend to use with food. Most paints are harmful when consumed, though a few select brands are considered food-safe., If you want to decorate your jar but still see the contents, the lid is still fully customizable. If the lid is also made of glass, then use specifically designed glass paint. If the lid is made from metal, spray paint would stick to it best., Bows can be tied around the neck of the jar and glued in place so they do not move. You can also glue ribbon and twine all the way around a jar, spiraling up from the bottom to the top and cover the entire jar. This can be layered on top of an already painted jar to give a dimensional and decorative look.

, Depending on what you store inside of the jar, you could glue a sample piece to the lid as a visual representation of its contents. If the jar is purely for decoration, then you can attach whatever you think looks nice instead. Dried leaves, flowers, or glass beads can all be positioned and fixed in place with an adhesive like hot glue or super glue.


Some glues, like wood glue and Elmer’s glue, do not work on glass. For best results use hot glue, super glue, or epoxy.

Label your jars.,
Keep hardware organized and separated.,
Organize office supplies on your desk.,
Store sewing needles and thread.,
Save your spare change.,
Make a candle holder.,
Make a potpourri holder.",How to Reuse a Jar3," Whatever you choose to put in them, it is always a good idea to label the jars so you can remember what you repurposed them for. Labels can be purchased from an office supplies store, printed from a label maker, or you can simply make your own from paper and tape! If you intend to permanently label a jar, you can also use a stencil and paint your label on directly.

, Each jar can be used to hold a different type of hardware. For example, they could be used to separate woodscrews from bolts and keep different types of wire distinct from one another. These jars could be kept in a tray to prevent them from rolling around, though you could also attach them to the underside of a shelf.


To do so, just sink a nail or screw through the lid into the underside of the shelf and tightly secure it. When you are done using the jar, simply tighten the jar back onto the designated lid.

, Objects like pencils, pens, and paintbrushes can also be stored in jars, just without using the lid. The naturally heavy weight of glass jars makes them more ideal for this situation than a lighter container like a plastic cup. This method still runs the risk of tipping over and spilling the contents, but this can be avoided by either adding weight to the bottom of a jar or not storing too many items in it at a time.


Jars can also be used to store safety pins, thumbtacks, staples, paper clips, and similar supplies. The advantage to storing them in a jar is that, once sealed, they cannot spill or become mixed with other supplies.

, The inside of the jar can be dedicated for housing your many spools of thread while the lid can be repurposed into a pincushion. Mason jars are ideal for the pin cushion lid because the main part of the lid pops out and leaves only the rim. To make a pin cushion lid, you’ll need a large circle of fabric, some stuffing, and a small circle of cardboard traced from the inside of the Mason jar.


Run a needle and thread through the edges of your fabric circle. Then pull the two ends of the string like a drawstring and tighten the cloth around your stuffing. Glue your cardboard circle over the opening of your cloth bundle and then push it through the Mason jar lid from the underside. Once sealed onto the jar, this will hold your pin cushion in place and you can stick your sewing needles into the top.

, Instead of losing or throwing out your spare change, keep it in a jar instead. Dedicate the money saved to your date or movie fund and label the jar accordingly. It may take a while, but this idea will pay for itself.

, Candle holders are easy to make. Just situate the candle upright in the bottom of the jar and light it. Leave the lid off so that the candle has enough oxygen to continue burning. When you want the candle to stop burning, you can either blow the candle out or seal the jar and wait a few moments for the flame to run out of oxygen.

, Potpourri is made by combining dried flower petals, herbs, barks, spices, and fragrance oils. Combine the spices and oils together, then pour over the remaining ingredients in a bowl. After storing in a dark, dry place for 4-8 weeks, the potpourri is ready to be displayed. At that point, just pour the potpourri into a jar, arranging it in whatever fashion you find most appealing, then place wherever you want the scents to be strongest.

Use jars as serving and storage containers.,
Use jars to hold snacks.,
Use jars to preserve food.",How to Reuse a Jar4," Mason jars are well suited to being converted into drinking glasses, all you need to do is wash them! Larger jars like pickle jars are better suited to storing flour, rice, and other cooking ingredients. Smaller jars, like those used for baby food, can be converted into spice holders, though their varying sizes could be uncooperative to your existing spice rack.


Do not use jars to serve hot food. Unless the jar is made from tempered glass, which is very unlikely, it runs a high risk of cracking and shattering due to the sudden change in heat. Only use jars to serve or store food that is intended to stay at room temperature., You can also use jars to hold dry snacks like pretzels or chips that are not in risk of going bad. You can also store hard baked goods, like cookies or biscottis, in jars provided they will be consumed relatively soon. You should keep these jars sealed, however, to ensure that they stay dry and do not become stale.

, Mason and Ball jars can be reused to preserve food. If you have never canned food before, start off with a small batch of something simple like vegetables. Make sure that the food you choose is fresh and in good condition. Find a recipe and follow it, making sure to keep your hands clean throughout the process to avoid excess bacteria. Sterilize your jars by boiling them then fill the jars with your selected food and canning liquid. Place a softened seal on each jar and seal the lid on. After doing so, process them in a water or pressure canner according to the recipe.


Label your canned goods with the month, year, and their contents. According to the National Center for Home Food Preservation, home canned goods are safe to consume for a full year after they were canned, so remember to eat them before they expire. Commercial mayonnaise, pickle, and baby food jars should never be used for this process. "

Wear just the one earring.This is a recent trend in fashion that is free from ""meanings"" that might be attributed to single earring wearing.",How to Reuse a Lone Earring1," However, care must be taken to choose an earring that looks good on its own, so it might not be the best choice if the earring is tiny or doesn't dangle; if the earring is long and sweeps onto your shoulder, then you're good to go.It might be possible to build on your existing lone earring to make it longer and bigger; for example, you could add a hoop, feathers, a delicate chain, etc.

Another fashion idea is to make a new pair from two odd earrings for a unique set. This requires care to match size and like type though, to avoid it being too quirky. Think flower earring with another flower earring or a sapphire earring with a diamond earring.;

Mask stains on carpet by creating darker colored designs over the stain.

, Use upholstery paint on chairs or sofas to not only change the color, but freshen the fabric to make it look like new. Consider going with only a single, solid color for large furniture.


Add design touches by painting pillows or throws.

If you cannot think of any project to make immediately, at the very least add the lone earring to your craft or jewelry making supplies, for use later on. It's a good excuse to hang onto it, and you never know, the other one might even turn up in the interim. Along with more detailed suggestions following this step, some other ideas include:

Covering a CD player, computer monitor or other electronic device with various odd earrings to form a pretty design.
Incorporating the solo earring into a piece of artwork or sculpture; maybe it forms part of the picture or design or maybe it forms the inspiration from which new things can form.
Use the odd earring as a decorative element on a bag or box lock, attach to a notebook or journal, or attach to drawer knobs.
Use dangling earrings to jazz up zippers.

, If you enjoy making jewelry, there are several items you can repurpose the earring into, such as:

Making a brooch from the earring. Break the backing or post off the earring, then glue to a brooch back. Allow to fully dry before wearing, and be sure to check that it has set in place firmly.
Turning it into a hat pin embellishment. As with the brooch, break off the backing, then glue in place to the top of the hat pin. Allow to fully dry before using. For this idea, choose small and delicate earrings; avoid anything heavy or that dangles below the pin's length.
Adding the brooch to a necklace, bracelet or bangle design. Thread the earring onto a necklace or glue/attach to the bracelet or bangle.

,

Use duct tape or similar strong, smooth tape.
This is one-wear only; use it for a party or special event, then remove and add again when going to another special occasion.

, For earrings that you consider especially pretty, wearing them in your hair can add some sparkle or decorative interest. Here are some ways to turn solo earrings into hair accessories:

Use a hair comb or barrette back as the base. Decide whether you'll use just a single earring or a row of odd earrings to form a pattern on the comb or barrette; if using more than one, design a pretty order for them. Remove the backs and rough parts from one or more earrings. Glue to the comb top or barrette, either in the center for a single one or a row in the order of choice. Allow the earring backs to dry fully before wearing the decorative comb or barrette in your hair.
The same thing can also be tried with a strong, large hair elastic, by gluing a single earring to one place and allowing it to dry fully.
Use a hair bow that has already been made. Simply glue the earring into the center of the bow as an added decoration. Once fully dried, it's ready to wear.

, It might be suitable for the doll to wear as a brooch or necklace, or it could be turned into a belt buckle or headband decoration for a doll. Other uses might include turning the earring into a kitchenware item, wall picture or toy in the doll house. The uses will depend on the earring style, color, shape and size; use your imagination alongside seeking for online image suggestions for doll house items., This is both pretty and practical, as it makes it easier to locate the bookmark and while the book is sitting around, the earring dangling over the book adds a bit of style. To make the bookmark:Find or purchase some strong fabric, such as velvet, satin or linen. Cut into strips measuring approximately 22.5cm/9 inches in length and 5cm/2 inches across (or to the width of the ribbon clamp you have). To prevent fraying, you may need to sew the top of the bookmark (use a pretty stitch). (Or, you can use a ribbon clamp on each end of the book, remembering though that this will make the book bulge when one end sits inside of it.)
Attach a ribbon clamp on the base of the bookmark ribbon. Fix in place with flat-nose jewelry pliers.
Affix the orphaned earring using jump rings (again with the pliers). Done. You can now enjoy using your pretty new bookmark.

, If you want to make a whole name or word, you'll need a lot of orphaned earrings or other broken jewelry pieces. To make this:

Find a wooden initial at a craft store. This can be the initial of your first name or that of a family member or friend. The size of the letter is up to your needs; think about the end use, from adding to a small box as an embellishment, to placing on a bookshelf as a display item, the size will depend on this.
Prepare the initial. Paint it in a color of choice, using acrylic or similar paint. Match the color to the earrings being used or to the decor you'll display the end product in. Good colors include black, white and beige, as these colors will not overwhelm the earrings. Allow to dry completely before affixing the earrings.
Prepare the earrings. Remove their backings and any unwanted parts. Arrange in a design to see what looks best on the initial; take a digital photo of this to guide you or sketch it; if you have a good memory of where each piece goes, rely on that instead.
Glue the earring pieces onto the painted letter in the desired order. Allow to completely dry.
Done. The bejeweled initial is now ready for display or adding to an object of your choice.

If it needs shortening, use wire craft snips or tin snips to shorten it (be sure to measure first).

To use, pull the earring off the post, push the pin into the board where you wish to hold the paper or photo in place. For even safer keeping, you can replace the earring backing to the post on the back of the board, but only if there is space and easy access to do so.

, These are very easy to make––all you need to do is remove the backing from the lone earring and glue the earring to a small magnet. The magnets can be purchased from craft or dollar stores; choose a size that is appropriate for the lone earring.

Keep bulk kitchen ingredients in the coffee jars.,
Create flower vases from the coffee jars.,
Keep bathroom essentials handy in the glass coffee jars.,
Sprout seedlings in your glass coffee jars.,
Make a soap dispenser from a glass coffee jar.",How to Recycle a Glass Coffee Jar," After cleaning the glass jar and removing the label, you can place the jar on a desk and use it to keep pencils, pens, or markers ready at hand. The large size of many coffee jars makes this application ideal for storing a large collection of colored pencils for sketching.;
, After saving up several glass coffee jars, you can use them to store various crafting supplies like yarn, thread, sewing needles, buttons, and more. They can also be used to store small office supplies like paperclips, staples, and erasers. Lining the filled jars up next to each other on a shelf will create a tidy, uniform appearance.

, Glass jars work well for storing bulk ingredients in your kitchen such as pasta, rice, sugar, flour, and dried beans. You can even create decorative labels for the jars to make identification easier.

, Glass coffee jars are an ideal size for displaying small arrangements of cut flowers. You can either use the jars as-is or decorate them by wrapping fabric or ribbon around them. Consider using a coffee jar in conjunction with smaller glass jars to create a composed, varied arrangement.

, Bathroom drawers and medicine cabinets can quickly become messy vehicles for small essentials like cotton swabs and cotton balls. Instead, consider keeping these items in separate glass jars, which can be displayed attractively on your counter or mounted onto a wall.

, Large glass jars make excellent vessels for sprouting seeds or growing small plants like herbs. Fill the jars with potting mix and grow the plants just as you would in a clay pot., Instead of continually buying and discarding plastic soap dispensers, you can buy liquid soap in bulk and use the glass jar as a dispenser. Drilling a hole into the coffee jar lid will allow you to mount a soap pump into the lid.

Gather your supplies.,
Determine the number of spoons you'll need.,
Prepare your can.,
Paint the can.,
Cut off the handles of your spoons.,
Mix your paint.,
Paint your scoops.,
Glue your scoops to the can.",How to Make Recycled Crafts1," You're going to be painting the scoops of plastic spoons and attaching them to a large can to create a lovely vase with a scalloped exterior. The size of your can will determine the number of plastic spoons you need. A smaller can will require less spoons than a larger one. For this project, you'll need:


A large can (like a soup or stew can)
Scissors
A paper plate
Measuring spoons (½ teaspoon, teaspoon, ½ tablespoon, etc.)
A paintbrush
Hot glue gun (and glue)
White primer spray paint
Paintbrush
Plastic spoons
Blue acrylic paint (or another color)
White acrylic paint.;
, Take one plastic spoon and use your scissors to cut the scoop free of the handle. You're going to want your spoon scoops to encircle your can in rows. To determine how many spoons you'll need, use your single scoop to estimate this number by measuring the can's perimeter with it.


The number of spoons you'll need will depend on the size of the can, but you can generally expect to use approximately four rows of spoons with seven spoons in each row.

, Remove any remaining glue or label from your can. In some cases, the label might pull free easily. Other cans, however, might require you to soak them in warm, soapy water to break up the glue or completely remove the label. Allow your can to dry completely afterwards.


Glue can cause your scoops to have a less uniform appearance in the finished product, making your vase look less appealing.
Bits of label may cause your glue to adhere less efficiently..

, Use your white primer spray paint to coat your can. This will give your can a regular appearance. If there are any gaps in the scoops that circle your can, the primer will hide the metal of the can, making it look more polished.Allow sufficient time for your primer to dry. Drying time can vary, so you should check the directions on your spray paint for best results.
Regular spray paint primer may be sufficient, but you may have better results with a spray primer intended for metal.

, You may want to do this while your primer is drying to be most efficient with your time. Now that you know how many spoons you'll need, take your spoons and use your scissors to cut off their handles.


You can throw away your spoon handles, but you may want to keep one to stir your paint.

, For each row, measure out a one tablespoon of blue paint onto a paper plate, keeping each row's paint separate. If you're using a large can and have many rows, you may need a second plate. Now you're going to add white to some of your paint to create a softening effect in the color of your rows so each row's color gets lighter ascendingly.Your first (bottom) row's paint receives no white paint.
Your second row's paint should receive a ½ teaspoon of white paint.
Your third row's paint should receive 1 teaspoon of white paint.
Your fourth row's paint should receive 1½ teaspoons of white paint.
Mix the blue and white paint using a leftover plastic spoon handle.

, You may want to lay out some newspaper or parchment paper to prevent paint from getting onto the surface where you are working. Then, use a paintbrush to apply paint the part of the scoop that arches outwards.


Use the pure blue paint for the first row's scoops, the ½ teaspoon white mixed blue for your second row's scoops, and so on. Allow sufficient time for your paint to dry.
Generally, acrylic paint dries relatively quickly. In most cases, your spoons should be ready in 10 - 15 minutes., Now that your scoops have dried, apply hot glue to the rim of the scoop at the front and back of its arched in side. Starting from the bottom, press each spoon into place around the can's perimeter in rows with the scoop arching outwards. Each row should be uniform in color, and the colors ascend darkest to lightest.The top row of spoons should extend above the lip of the can.
The spoons should overlap slightly. Continue gluing the spoons until the entire can is covered to complete your vase.

Create the traditional, inspiring wine bottle candle.,
Use wine bottles to hold spices, rices and pastas.,
Design a lit centerpiece for your table.,
Smash and create mosaic art.",How to Recycle Wine Bottles," This old time favorite is easy to create and always fun to enjoy. You even don’t have to be a crafty person--just someone who craves ambiance.


Select a wine bottle with either character and/or meaning. This bottle will be possibly used as a centerpiece or be on display in your home so find a bottle you love.
Drink the wine (responsibly) and clean out bottle. Fill the bottle with warm water and mild dish soap. Allow it to soak and then rinse and air dry.
Choose a long taper candle. Check the bottom of the candle to make sure it fits snuggly inside the top of your wine bottle. You may also want to color coordinate your bottle with your candle.
Wrap double sided, invisible tape around the bottom of the candle so it adheres to the top. Even if the candle fits nicely inside the bottle top, wrap a ring of double sided tape around the bottom of the candle for insurance. The last thing you want is for the lit candle to tumble from the bottle opening onto your floor or table.
Place candle in the top of the bottle, pushing down gently, but firmly to ensure it fits snuggly. Don’t be too aggressive as you could break the candle.
Light candle and allow the drippings to fall down the sides of the bottle. Consider placing a coaster or small plate underneath the bottle to avoid having hot wax drip on your furniture.;
, You can also use it as an olive oil or hand soap dispenser as well.


Imbibe wine and then clean bottle with warm water and mild dish detergent. Make sure bottle is completely dry before using as you will be filling it with dried goods. Clean and then save the cork or screw top.
Create labels for each bottle or you could paint a large square on the front of the bottle with chalk board paint to generate the label du jour. If you prefer to create a hand-crafted label, visit the office supply store for different types of labels that you could use in your printer or for hand writing. You may also want to purchase self-adhesive laminate to cover the label after you’ve created it for bottles filled with a liquid (like hand soap or olive oil).
Fill bottle with desired spice or dried good. Make sure you can easily pour or retrieve the spice or dried good once the bottle has been filled (through pouring etc.).
Cork the top or screw on the lid. Make sure the lid or cork has been cleaned and dried so you don’t mingle wine with new food.
Consider using a stout bottle to hold bulk rice etc. Luckily wine bottles come in a variety of shapes and sizes--this may mean you will need to try different wines to retain the bottle.

, Out of ideas for a cool, illuminated centerpiece? Invite an old, previously enjoyed bottle of wine to the table filled with lights.


Empty and clean two or three different sized wine bottles. If you want to create an off-beat tablescape consider using multiple bottles of various colors too.
Purchase enough sets of battery powered LED holiday lights to fill each bottle. Although you may have the holiday lights that plug into a wall socket, consider stepping it up by springing for the battery powered lights. That way you won’t have a cord strewn across your table and dangling by your guest’s feet.
Drop light sets into each bottle. Don’t stuff lights tightly, but instead allow them to descend on their own, creating a light pattern. Make sure the “on/off” switch is easy to access at the top of the bottle.
Arrange on the center of a table, along with other pieces such as candles or other decorative items. Light each wine bottle for a glowy effect.

, This will require some finesse and lots of adult supervision (if you are a kid), but could provide the perfect outlet for the inner-artist inside you.


Assemble your collection of clean, empty wine bottles. Don't choose bottles that hold meaning or sentimental value as you will be breaking and smashing them.
Find an area outside where you can break the glass. Preferably away from children or pets, find an area that will allow you to carefully break the glass without having it get lost in furniture or within cracks in the floor. For example, while you may think doing this project in a grassy area might be a good notion, it may be tougher to find errant pieces of glass in the grass.
Lay out painter’s tarp, don safety glasses and heavy gloves. Be sure you are also wearing shoes, preferably closed toe work boots.
Use a ball pin hammer to lightly tap the first bottle. Don’t smash the bottles like an insane person as you will most likely just make a huge mess, with glass flying everywhere. Tap the middle of the bottle until it begins to break and then forcefully pull the pieces apart.
Repeat this step until all bottles have been broken. Try to keep order to your smash process to avoid having glass fly throughout the area, making clean up a tough job.
Prepare your surface, canvass or area. Clean the surface if you plan to place pieces on top of an outdoor table or wall, for example,
Lay out your design using broken glass pieces. Continue to wear your work gloves so you don’t cut your hands.
Brush clear glass adhesive on the back of each piece of glass and affix it to the surface.
Brush at least one coat of clear epoxy over the finished piece to ensure smoothness and to seal your artwork.

Gather your supplies.,
Clean your yogurt cups.,
Attach the first row of cups.,
Attach the second row of cups.,
Attach the third row of cups, if applicable.,
Paint the wreath.",How to Make Recycled Crafts2," This craft uses a straw wreath and painted yogurt cups to make a modern looking wreath for your home. Straw wreaths can be purchased at craft stores or in the home and garden section of general retailers, like Walmart and Target. In all, you'll need:


36 yogurt cups (larger wreaths may take more cups, smaller wreaths fewer)
Spray paint (for plastic)
A straw wreath
A hot glue gun (and glue), Leftover bits of food in your yogurt cups could turn your lovely wreath into a smelly, bug attracting mess. Rinse each cup thoroughly with warm, soapy water, and remove any remaining bits of foil as you do so. After cleaning, lay your cups out to air dry.

, Once your cups are dry, use hot glue to attach the lip of the cups to the wreath’s outer rim so the cups are sticking off to the sides. Repeat this process until there are 12 yogurt cups evenly positioned around the perimeter of the straw wreath.Hold each cup in place for 30 seconds to allow the glue to fully set.
You can alternate the angle of your cups on the outer edge to create interesting designs. For example, you might switch back and forth between cups sticking straight out to the sides and cups angled slightly forward.
When you're finished, the outer edge of the wreath should be entirely covered in cups, but the front of the wreath should still be bare.

, Apply hot glue to the lip of a cup, then hold it against the front of the wreath to attach it. Continue doing this until you create a second ring of yogurt cups.You can stagger this ring of cups in a slight zigzag to create variation in your design.

, Smaller wreaths may only be able to accommodate two rows of cups. If you have space for a third, use your hot glue in the same fashion you did previously to attach the mouth of the cup to the wreath.To give your wreath a 3-D effect, you should orient this row of cups to face directly forwards.
Allow the wreath to dry for an hour so the glue completely sets before painting.

, Take your spray paint and spray your wreath to give it color and uniformity. Be sure you spray thoroughly, as missed spots may make your wreath look less professional.After allowing the paint to dry, you may notice that your wreath needs a second coat. In this case, spray your wreath once more.

Gather your supplies.,
Clean your milk jug.,
Paint and cut the jug.,
Line the cut edges with washi tape.,
Insert a divider.",How to Make Recycled Crafts3," This is a fairly simple craft that your kids can use to carry their school supplies. You'll be using washi tape, which often comes in interesting patterns, to blunt the edges of the milk jug. To make this you'll need:


Spray paint (for plastic)
A 1 gallon milk jug
A utility knife
Washi tape (available at most craft stores)
A ruler
Foam board
A pencil
A chalkboard label., You'll want to clean out your milk jug with soapy water first and allow it enough time to dry. In some cases, your milk jug might still have a lingering odor. To eliminate this smell, you may want to soak the jug in soapy water.


You can also try to remove odors by leaving some baking soda in the dry milk jug overnight.

, Apply your spray paint to completely coat your jug. After it dries, you'll likely want another layer or two to ensure a thick coating and rich color. After the jug is dry, use your utility knife to remove the face of the jug (the top half of the front), leaving the handle of the jug attached.You can adjust the cut in your jug as you see fit, but a 5"" (12.7 cm) long opening may make it easier to retrieve items from the jug.
The cut out portion of your jug can be thrown out or recycled

, Raw cut edges of plastic can be sharp or pointy, so you'll want to cover the edges you've cut with washi tape. This will create a decorative barrier to the sharp, cut edges.


If washi tape is not available and appearance isn't a priority, you can use duct tape or electrical tape as a substitute.
Some kinds of duct tape come in interesting patterns. These can be used with roughly the same effect as washi tape.

, A divider will help keep pens, pencils, and markers separate in the jug. Use your utility knife to cut a 5 ½"" (17 cm) square out of the foam board. Then cut a ¼"" wide, 1 ¾"" deep notch at the midpoint of the top of your square. After that:Place the foam board notch side up into the jug.
Cut another piece of foam board the same size as the first with notch that is ¼"" wide and 1¾"" deep notch in the bottom edge of the square.
Align the notches so the rectangles lock together.
Depending on the size and shape of your milk jug, you may need to adjust these measurements.

Gather your supplies.,
Clean out your can.,
Attach the rope to your can.,
Make the top of the can.",How to Make Recycled Crafts4," This is a simple way to turn used cans into rustic looking storage containers. You'll do this by gluing sisal rope, which can be purchased at most hardware stores, around your cans and their lids. For this project, you're going to need:


An empty soup or bean can
A hot glue gun (and glue)
Sisal rope
Scissors
A lid (at least ½” larger than the mouth of your can)
Wooden knobs, You'll want to be sure your can is clean and no odor remains from its previous contents. In most cases, soapy water should be good enough, but for stubborn odors, try leaving baking soda in the dry can overnight.


Leftover odors can transfer to the new contents of your cans.

, A little bit at a time, apply your hot glue to the perimeter of the can in a circular pattern from the bottom up, sticking your rope to the can with the glue as you do so. This will give your can the appearance of being wound in rope. You'll likely need to hold your rope in place for a few moments so the glue can set.Once the hot glue is applied, you'll have to work quickly. Hot glue hardens fast.
Continue to glue and wind the rope around the perimeter of the can until the can is completely covered by rope.
When you reach the top of the can, cut the rope and glue the loose end to the can.

, Apply hot glue around the edge of your lid to attach the rope to it. After you've lined the edge in rope, cut free any excess and glue the loose end to the lid. Then use your hot glue to adhere your rope to the top of the lid in a coil pattern.Glue a wooden knob to the center of the lid. Allow the lid to dry completely.

Embellishments such as zippers, studs, and glitter can jazz up a tired shirt or skirt and turn it into something new.If the hems of your pants are frayed, but they still fit you well, try cropping them into shorts. You could also turn a long skirt into a shorter skirt or a T-shirt to a crop-top.Dye can add some vibrancy to a tired garment. Try a new hue to liven up your look.
Sew a contrasting pocket on an old T-shirt for an update.;
, Make a completely new garment out of the fabric of your old clothes. If you’re going to do this, it’s best to start with an item like a dress or large T-shirt where more fabric will be available to begin with. Use your imagination to cut and sew yourself something new, for example a belt, tube top or skirt. There are many patterns available on the internet for people who are new to sewing., Use the fabric from your old clothes to cover a cloth headband, for example, or use thin strips of multiple fabrics to braid a bracelet or necklace. Turning an old T-shirt into a stylish tote bag is easy, too.

, Patches can be both functional and stylish. Use your old clothes to create patches for clothes you’d like to hang onto. You can even use a patch in a purely stylistic way to add a splash of color or complementary pattern.If you have many smaller pieces, you could try making a full patchwork garment.

, A memory board is a great place to display concert bracelets, ticket stubs and photos. Use a large piece of fabric from your old clothes to cover the front and sides of a normal office corkboard. Secure the fabric in place with fabric glue around the perimeter on the backside.You can add mementos and rearrange your board by attaching items with pushpins.

, You can create a teddy bear for child out of old clothes. This can be particularly poignant if you use baby clothes or another cherished garment from the child’s early years. Use an online template for a polished look. You can even stuff the bear with fabric scraps of other old clothes.


You can use buttons from old garments to sew eyes and a nose onto your keepsake bear.
If a bear feels too ambitious, old socks actually make great dresses for dolls. Cut off the tube portion of a tall sock. (Frilly or patterned socks work best.) Then thread a ribbon through each corner of the top to create straps. Children may be able to tackle this project with supervision., Use an online pattern to turn your old duds into a quilt. You can incorporate many different pieces of clothes into your design to create an item full of happy memories.


If you’re not particularly crafty but would still enjoy a quilt, there are many websites that will create a patchwork quilt out of your old clothes for you, such as Project Repeat or retailers on Etsy. You simply send your old clothes to them.

, You can use a piece of cardboard, fabric glue and an old garment to create a completely custom picture frame. This works particularly well if you have a photo of unusual size, as you can tailor-make the frame to suit a particular piece of artwork. You can also cover a tired, old picture frame in fabric for double the repurposing power.

, After you’ve made your keepsake, your old clothes can do double-duty by turning into gift wrap. Cut the fabric from a garment into a large circle or square (a bigger item like a dress or skirt works best) then place your gift in the middle. Wrap the fabric around your gift, gathering at the top. You can secure your packaging with a contrasting colored ribbon.Pinking shears, which have patterns cast into the cutting blade, can create an attractive finish, so your edges don’t look frayed.

, If you’re into bohemian style, patchwork curtains could be a unique addition to your home. First, measure the dimensions of your existing curtains. Then, cut many similarly-sized squares of fabric from your old clothes; the more variety of colors and patterns among your squares the better. Stitch the squares together along their edges into one cohesive piece of fabric, until you create the dimensions you measured at the outset.If you don’t have enough scraps to create a whole curtain, a valence for the top of the window can add some rustic charm.

, Old T-shirts, particularly soft ones, make great pillowcases. Cut off the arms of a T-shirt and the ridge around the neck. Sew the holes you’ve created shut, and turn the shirt inside out, so the seams are on the interior. You now have a soft new pillowcase.If you want the design on the front of the T-shirt on the outside of the pillowcase when you are finished, turn your shirt inside out before cutting.

, A rag rug is a durable, circular rug that incorporates many different fabrics and colors for a homespun look. They can be as small or large as you like, which makes them extremely versatile. Cut your clothes into long strips, approximately the size of the crochet hook you want to use. Then consult this guide for detailed stitching instruction.


If you’ve been looking for a unifying décor piece for your home, select strips for your rag rug that incorporate the colors present in your room already. Your rug will highlight each of them and pull the room together.

, If you have a smaller dog, you can use the pillowcase method with a big T-shirt to create a slipcover for your dog’s bed. If your dog is bigger and one shirt won’t cover it, create two smaller pillowcases with the pillowcase method, then stitch them almost all the way together around the body opening (so end-to-end,) leaving a small hole. Use more old clothes to fill the pillow through the hole. Once stuffed, stitch it shut the remainder of the way to complete your brand new dog bed.

Pull the sock over your hand.,
Dampen the sock.,
Wipe dust off your surfaces.,
Wash the sock.",How to Recycle Your Socks1," Fuzzy socks work best because the texture picks up dust and hair better than smooth socks. Simply stick your hand inside the sock., While fuzzy socks can pick up a lot when dry, other socks cannot. Run the sock under the faucet or add furniture polish. You don’t need a lot, only enough to cover the outside of the sock.

, The sock is ready to be used. Go and wipe it over any surface where dust has collected. When it looks like the sock is too full of hair and dust to pick up more, brush it off over a trash can or turn it inside-out to continue dusting.

, Throw the sock in the washer and dryer cycle with the rest of your laundry. Your sock will come out fresh and ready to use again.

Fill the sock with rice.,
Tie a knot at the top of the sock.,
Microwave the sock.,
Place the sock on your body.",How to Recycle Your Socks2," The best socks for heat packs are long ones without holes. Add four cups (946.4 mL) of non-instant white rice or other heatable food, including dried corn kernels and flaxseed, to the sock.The amount of filler you use can be adjusted. Less for example makes the heat pack softer and able to be used to focus on smaller areas on your body.

, Wrap the end of the sock so that you can twist it into the knot. This keeps the filler from spilling out and giving away heat.

, Limit the amount of time microwaving to one minute at a time and no more than three minutes. The sock can get too hot and the filler can burn. The sock should feel warm to the touch but not painful.Keeping a cup of water in the microwave next to the sock will slow down the heating process.

, Now that the sock is warm, it is useful for treating cold, sore, or painful spots. Drape the sock on the painful muscle or area or press it against the area you wish to treat.

Measure the length of sock you need.,
Cut off the top of the sock.,
Turn the sock inside-out.,
Fold the sock downwards.,
Sew the hem.,
Turn the sock inside out.,
Cut out a handle.",How to Recycle Your Socks3," If you have a specific size you need, such as for your favorite coffee container, break out the tape measure. Hold it up to the cup. Measure only the part you want covered by the cozy, then add an inch (2.54 cm). Measure up from the toe of the sock.If you want the cozy to bunch up a little, add extra length to your calculation.

, When you get to the end of the length of sock you need, remove anything above it by cutting across with scissors. At this point, you may be able to use the sock as an undecorated cozy., Reverse the sock. Working with the less attractive inside of the sock will leave you with a better-looking cozy later.

, Find the end that’s going to be the top of your cozy. Take the top and fold it downwards about one inch (2.54 cm).

, Use a sewing needle to secure the bottom of the folded part to the rest of the sock underneath it. If you don’t want to sew, you can also place bonding tape between the parts of the sock and iron them together or use fabric glue.Fabric glue requires you to place a heavy object, such as a book, on top of the sock and let the glue sit for an hour.

, Reverse the sock again. This time the sewing marks or other adhesive will be on the inside of the cozy where you can no longer see it. For most drink containers, the cozy will be ready for use.

, In case you are making a cozy for a coffee mug, find the side you want to use for a handle. With scissors, cut a vertical slit in the middle of the sock. Also remove any frayed ends.It is a good idea to apply a little bit of fabric glue around the edges of the hole to protect the threads from fraying.

Add corn kernels to a sock.,
Place quilt batting in the sock.,
Alternate layers.,
Stuff another sock.,
Pull the sock ends over one another.,
Sew the socks together.",How to Recycle Your Socks4," Pour the cup (236.6 mL) of dry kernels or other heat-absorbent foodstuff, such as dried beans or peas, into the sock. Let it settle at the bottom., Add an equal amount of fluffy stuffing as you did foodstuff. Quilt batting is a heat-absorbent stuffing found at craft stores. You can substitute in another stuffing, such as that from an old pillow.

, Next, add another cup of your corn kernels, then follow it with another cup of quilt batting. Alternate these layers until the sock is stuffed all the way to the top.

, This is optional but can be done to cover a large crack, such as the underside of a doorway. You may need to create one or two more draft protectors, depending on the length of sock. Repeat the steps to fill these socks with half corn kernels, half stuffing.

, Place the open end of one of your socks next to the bottom end of another one, if combining them into a larger draft protector. Pull the open end over the bottom of the next sock. Repeat this with other socks you wish to add., Where the socks meet, take needle and thread. Sew the hem of the outer sock to the one it covers. Alternatively, apply fabric glue and let it rest for an hour. Decorate the socks as you please, such as by sewing on eyes and a tongue to form a snake.

"
"
Place a tennis ball inside the sock.,
Tie a knot above the ball.,
Test out the toy with your dog.,
Monitor the toy for damage.",How to Recycle Your Socks5," Push the dog’s ball down to the toe of the sock. Other objects that can be put inside the sock instead of a ball include treats or an empty plastic water bottle. The dog will enjoy any of these objects but the sock will cause them to last longer than store-bought toys., Wrap the sock around itself to form a knot. Do this above the ball so the dog has an easier time picking up the toy and won’t chew the ends off immediately.


If you want the dog to get the object out right away, such as with a treat, don’t tie the sock. Bunch the sock into a ball.

, Throw the toy. The dog will likely see that the toy is in the shape of a ball, smell the treat, or hear the water bottle. As long as they’ve seen the object inside the sock, they won’t use your good socks as chew toys.

, After use, the sock will eventually begin to wear down. Trim off any frayed threads while the sock is in use and pick up torn pieces. When the sock is too damaged, replace the toy.


Some dogs may consume pieces of the sock, which can lead to bowel blockage, so be careful and opt for smoother socks."

, Cut small strips to use as bedding in a hamster, guinea pig, rat or mouse cage. They will use them in their nest for warmth. Or, use the whole towel, folded up, on chairs where your cats like to sleep, so that their fur gets on the towel, and less on your furniture.

, Most towels are about the right size to use for a crib mattress pad (crib or toddler beds). Just lay on the mattress and hold in place with the fitted sheet. This is an especially good use for those cheap dollar store or mail order towels you bought.


Stitch the hand towel across the bottom of the bath towel to add a little length.
Place over the plastic mattress cover, and under the fitted sheet in the body area. It may be pinned to the fitted sheet from underneath to hold in place––lay the fitted sheet on the bed upside down, decide where towel(s) should be placed, pin as needed, then flip over.

Instead of a mesh bag to wash your delicate articles, use old pantyhose. Cut the old pantyhose at about the thigh, or just use the entire thigh high stocking. Place your delicate washables in the stocking, tie off the open end, and launder as usual.







Hang wet sweaters without those pesky hanger marks. Take a pair of pantyhose and put one leg through each sleeve or, if you are using thigh high stockings or half a pair of pantyhose, slip one leg through both arms of the sweater. Next, tie the two ends of the stocking to your clothesline and let the sweater dry.;
,

Use them to scrub your bathroom, shower or sink. Spritz some cleaner on your sink, shower, or tub surface. Then, get a piece of your pantyhose and dampen it with either water or more cleaning solution. Next, scrub away the dirt and grime using the pantyhose cut-off much like you would use a regular washcloth. Want to make it even easier? Cut off the pantyhose at the calf and slip the piece over your hand for a cleaning mitt that works magic!






Use your old stockings to make a bath infusion sachet. Using herbs in the bath is a calming experience that fills the air with beautiful scents, transforming your bath from a cleaning routine to a transforming experience. To make one of these bath ""tea bags,"" simply cut off your stockings at the calf, fill it with your favorite herbs, tie off the open end, and float the sachet in your bathwater.






Add soap shavings to the old pantyhose. If you like a more bubbly bath, consider adding all of your old soap slivers into a stocking. Cut off the pantyhose leg at about the calf, and start collecting those soap pieces. When you have a decent amount of soap in the stocking, tie off the open end and swish it around the water to whip up some suds. You can use the soap filled stocking as a gentle scrubber for your skin.







, Put a full piece of soap in the toe of the pantyhose tie off above the soap. You now have a perfect way to carry soap with you to camping grounds. Just tie the pantyhose near the sink at the camping grounds and it will allow people to wash their hands without the possibility of the soap slipping and getting dirty or lost.

,


Store onions and garlic. Air circulation is a great way to keep onions and garlic around longer. Take a pair of clean pantyhose and cut them off at the thigh, or simply use an entire thigh high stocking. Then, place the onions or garlic into the stockings like a sleeve, tie off the end, and store them hanging up in your pantry. Flower bulbs can also be stored this way over winter.






Place old pantyhose over a rolling pin. This will prevent dough from sticking to the rolling pin.






Use as a dish scrubber. Simply screw up a piece or two of old pantyhose, add a drop of detergent and scrub away.






Use the elastic waistband to secure your trash bags to the trash can to keep the bags from slipping down in the can. The pantyhose can also be used to tie around the top of the trash bags. This method is ideal for all household trash.







,

Use them to make sachets for adding potpourri or cedar balls to your drawers.






Tie bundled blankets together using old pantyhose. Much gentler and easy to use than large elastics or rubber bands. They will last for years too.






Place over the part of clothes affected by the clip on skirt or trouser hangers. This will stop marks from the hanger clip indenting on the clothing.







,


Make garden ties out of them! The legs of pantyhose actually make very good plant ties, as they are soft and pliable. They might not look great at the front of the border, but hide them at the back and they'll do the job perfectly! Cut the pantyhose into lots of rings, to make much smaller, unobtrusive ties for all sorts of climbers, roses, etc.







Strain your paint. Take an old pair of pantyhose and cut them so that you have a usable piece of nylon that will stretch over a container. Then, pour your lumpy paint slowly over the mesh surface, letting the debris-free paint flow into the new container.






Protect growing melons in the garden. Use the seat part of the pantyhose to encase your cantaloupes and watermelons to keep rabbits, deer and other animals from taking a bite while you are waiting for them to fully ripen.






Use the old pantyhose as paint brush covers. After cleaning paint brushes, wrap them in pantyhose to keep them clean and soft.







,


If you're a crafter, then save all your old pantyhose and chop them into short lengths. Stuff toys or animals with the pantyhose; simply cut up old pantyhose and use as stuffing. As well, use them to stuff any craft item, from teddies to pillows to tiny Christmas tree ornaments.






If you ever need to sieve anything very finely, such as pigments, ceramic glazes, liquids, or even when cooking, then a length of pantyhose is great. Cut the leg lengthwise so that you have a square piece of fabric, and tie or tape it over the top of your bowl. Sieve through it.






See How to make a pantyhose choker necklace for another craft idea.

,

If you want to be energy efficient in every way possible, use this method. In the winter, remove the dryer vent house from the outside exhaust. Stuff the exhaust pipe with an old T-Shirt or something to stop the cold air from coming into your house. Take a pair of old pantyhose and secure it over the dryer vent hose with duct tape. This will allow the warm exhaust air to enter your home and act as heat (and humidity). And the pantyhose will trap the additional lint that finds its way through or around the dryer screen. It will also fill the air with the freshness of the fabric sheet.






You need to make certain you clean this out regularly as it could pose the risk of fire if your dryer hose clogs up.






Have your dryer cleaned and serviced regularly even if you don't do this.

Remove the remaining long side piece of the T-shirt from the top piece.",How to Recycle an Old T Shirt Into a Sexy Bikini1," Make sure it is in reasonable condition (without holes or stains) and fits you or is somewhat larger than necessary. Don't worry if it is stretched, faded or old - it is about to be transformed!


Avoid using a white T-shirt. Even if you do not get the suit wet, it may be too see-through to wear.

, Put it onto a broad, stable surface on which you can cut fabric. If you don't have a table big enough, lay an old towel out on the floor and put your T-shirt on top of that. (The towel will protect wood flooring or carpet from damage from the scissors).

, Using dressmaker's chalk (or a piece of bar soap), make marks to show where you will cut the T-shirt.


Mark the shape for the bottom of the bikini. To mark where the bikini bottom will be cut out, draw an hourglass-type shape in the middle of the shirt. Make sure that you leave enough space between the two curves to adequately cover your crotch, as well as making the two semi-triangles wide and tall enough to fit you. If you don't feel comfortable eyeballing it, take your measurements. (Remember, you can always cut off more fabric, but you can't add it back on without a lot of trouble. Mark cautiously.)

, Note that this square cut will not go all the way across the T-shirt - leave a few inches on one side of the shirt (including the seam) intact.

, Add pins to keep the two cut pieces aligned. Put them inside the hourglass shape you've marked.

,, Include the seams in your cuts - you'll trim them off later.

, Your cut should run from the shoulder seam to the bottom hem.

"
"
Fold over and pin the edges of the bikini bottom.,
Sew the folded edges together.,
Fold the hourglass shape in half, hamburger-style, so that the outside of the bottom is facing inward.,
Sew the two sides together.",How to Recycle an Old T Shirt Into a Sexy Bikini2," Go all the way around the bikini bottom and fold in by a half-inch (1.7 cm) or inch (2.5 cm). Pin into place.;
, Because the bikini bottom isn't a huge garment, you can sew it by hand in a reasonable amount of time, if you want to. However, for a straighter and swifter stitch, use a sewing machine. Remove the pins as you go.

, That is, you should be able to see the folds and seams you just did.

, Where the bikini bottom would sit around your waist, sew the two sides above the leg holes together. Turn the garment inside out and try it on to check the fit.

"
"
Shape the sleeves.,
Fold and pin the edges.,
Stitch both pieces.,
Cut long strips from the long piece of T-shirt that is left over.,
Again, it's better to go too long with these pieces than too short.,
Stitch a shorter halter strap to the top of each top piece.

,
Feed the long, back-tying cord through the bottom of each top piece.,
Try on the bikini and adjust the fit accordingly.

",How to Recycle an Old T Shirt Into a Sexy Bikini3," The two sleeves you cut off the T-shirt will constitute the top of the bikini. Cut them into a shape that will fit you and provide adequate coverage.

, As you did with the bikini bottom, fold in the edges by about a half-inch or inch (1.7 to 2.5 cm) all the way around, so that you end up with a somewhat triangular shape for each cup. Pin the folds into place.

, Again, because the pieces of fabric are small, sewing by hand wouldn't be too laborious. However, you can still use a sewing machine for more speed and accuracy. Remove the pins as you go.


At the base of each top piece, sew so that you leave a narrow, hollow space to allow a cord to slip through. Don't sew up the sides.

, Cut one long piece for threading through the base of the top as the back tie, and two shorter ones to form the halter straps that go up around the neck.

, You can always trim the ends later, if necessary.

,, Use a large needle to help push this cord through the hollow space.


Stitch the bottom of the top pieces to the back-tying cord (optional). If you want to make sure the top pieces stay in place, try the top on and measure where you want each piece to be. Then sew another stitch along the bottom of each top piece, after the back-tying cord is inside. This should lock the cups in place.

Gather all the old, unwanted T-shirts into one neat pile.,
Separate the T-shirts into a pile for like-material shirts.,
Create ""yarn"" from the T-shirts.,
Join the strips together.,
Design your dish towel.",How to Recycle T Shirts Into Dish Cloths1," You'll need a few T-shirts to make enough yarn for the cloths. Make sure the tops are laundered and clean.;
, Some cotton T-shirts are a blend, whereas others are 100 percent cotton. Having access to “like” materials in each pile makes things easier. Also, consider taking the organizational piles even further by putting T-shirts of similar colors together. Since you’ll be shredding these shirts and creating your own homemade yarn from them, having like-colors in the same pile will allow you to create a certain color of yarn. It's not entirely necessary but if you're looking for something more uniform, it is a good idea.

, This step involves tearing each T-shirt into small strips of fabric, which are molded together to create the yarn for knitting the dish cloths. Tear the fabric into 1” (2.5cm) strips. Rather than cutting with scissors, this can be achieved just by tearing the shirt into strips (especially if the shirt is old and worn), beginning at the seam. Not only is tearing a quicker method, it allows you to create a rugged look with less loose threads. You can use a Sharpie to mark off 1” (2.5cm) sections on each T-shirt and run your fingers along the sides of the shirt after you’ve ripped it, to remove any loose threads.

, Fold one end of a 1” (2.5cm) strip under about ½” (1cm) and cut a small slit in the top. Repeat this step with the second 1” (1.5cm) strip. Place the two cut ends over each other and then pull one end of the second strip through the slit in the first strip and then fold back into itself, pulling the second strip completely through the slit. Pull tightly so the two strips blend to become one.

, You can either use a lock and hook method or knit the dish cloths. Essentially, the t-shirts will provide you with a ball or bunch of thread or yarn to work with. You can use the T-shirt yarn to either make a lock or hook pattern by threading the T-shirt yarn through pre-patterned strips to create the dish towel, or you can knit one. A lock and hook dishcloth won't be as flexible as a knitted dishcloth though.


Another idea for using the yarn could be to embellish existing dish towels with fabric designs using the T-shirt strips. Create patchwork designs or even crochet a small design to apply to existing dishtowels to enhance their appearance.

Find a suitable, clean T-shirt.

,
Measure a neat square on the T-shirt that is the size of a dishcloth.,
Neatly place each square on top of the other until all three squares are aligned.,
Use.",How to Recycle T Shirts Into Dish Cloths3,", A good measurement would be about 8"" (20cm) squares. Mark it with a sewing pencil, then cut. Repeat two times so you have three squares of T-shirt fabric of the same size.


If there is a funky logo on the T-shirt that would fit inside the square neatly, cut it out too. It can be sewn in place on the top layer for added decoration.
If you have an old towel that is no longer needed, cut a square from the towel for the base layer––this will help with washing items or could be used as a bathroom cleaning cloth. Simply stitch this additional layer into the base position with the other three squares as discussed in the next step.

, Sew around the four edges by hand (or by machine if you have a sewing machine), about 1/4"" (6mm) from the edge. It doesn't have to be neat sewing and is definitely something that can be done in front of the TV.


If you're also using a logo, sew it in place on what will form the top layer of the dishcloth before you assemble the three squares.

, It's as simple as that––the dishcloth is now ready. Be sure to hang it to dry after each use and every week simply throw it in with a washing cycle to freshen it up again. (Adding a hanging loop is a good idea for drying purposes.)

Put these clothes into a pile and put the rest of your clothes back.;
, Looking through them one at a time, find at least one thing you like about each item. One may have awesome fabric, another, a great print, and another, a unique flair. Maybe your favorite tee is in great shape except for a ripped sleeve, or maybe you have a skirt that’s a hard-to-find color but is two sizes too big. Don’t count something out just because it’s plain or boring; this might make a great base for one of your designs. However, if you really can't find anything redeeming about an item, put it aside for now and move on to something else.

, Jeans that are too short can be cut them into shorts for summer. If a top that’s too small and shows off a little bit of your belly can be cut into a belly top.

, Decide if you can embellish it in some way to spice it up or deconstruct it into something else. Hold it up next to other items from your collection and see if you can make any interesting matches.

, Useful search terms include ""deconstructed clothing"" and ""DIY"" (do-it-yourself). Great sites are listed below, too, but don't forget to look on your own - there are lots of ideas out there!

, For example, consider adding fabric paint or beads, slashing it for peek-a-boo effect, shortening it, dying it, cutting off the sleeves, ironing on a transfer that you printed from your computer, or, for a punk look, attaching other pieces of fabric to it with safety pins.

, If you know how to sew, (or have a friend or relative who might help), consider reworking or even combining different items from your wardrobe. For example, you might: swap the sleeves of two different long-sleeved shirts to create a two-color effect; cut off and sew the collar of a collared shirt into the collar of a closed-neck shirt to fake a layered look; cut and sew a shirt with a torn armpit into a vest; invert a cheap hoodie and turn it into fuzzy mittens; cut out a long strip of an interesting fabric to make a belt, hip sash, or scarf; etc.

, Donate them to a thrift shop or sell them to a second-hand store. Usually second-hand stores give you the option of receiving cash or in-store credit for your items that sell. You will receive more in credit than you would in cash, and then when you come back to the store in a month or two, you can use your credit to get clothes you do like. If you bring in clothes to consign every time you visit the store, you will most likely have credit the next time you come in, and can establish a monthly or bi-monthly wardrobe rotation without spending any money.


You can also start clothing swaps with your friends. Often the clothes that no longer interest you can feel 'new' for someone else.

Fold the bottom of the muzzle under and sew it to the bottom of the monkey's chin.,
Add stuffing to make the muzzle puff out.,
Fold the raw edge under and stitch the top edge to the face.,
Fold the raw edges of each ear to the inside and stitch them closed.,
Add button eyes.",How to Make a Sock Monkey," The best ones will be ones with heels and toes in contrasting colors to the rest of the sock. One sock will be used to make the body, legs, and head, and the other will used to make the arms, tail, face, and ears.


These monkeys were traditionally made with “Rockford Red Heel Socks.” If you have striped socks, those work well, too. If your socks have cuffs, be sure to undo the seam carefully; the cuff length is needed for the length of the monkey.

,, You may have to flatten the sock against its natural crease to make this happen. If it's not cooperating, grab an iron and give it a quick once-over

, This will become the split in the monkey’s legs. Again, note that the heel is actually hidden beneath the sock at this point, so you may have to flip it over briefly to double-check your positioning.


Erasable fabric marker works best for drawing. Make sure before you cut that your line is indeed on the halfway mark -- a monkey with one fat leg and one skinny leg is not a happy monkey.

, Leave approximately 1/4 inch (.6 cm) between the line and each of your seams.


You can either use a sewing machine or sew by hand. If you're using a sewing machine, use your walking foot.

, The monkey’s legs and colored feet will now be clearly visible.

, Polyfill stuffing is available at all craft supply stores. The upper half of the sock will become the torso and head.


The amount of stuffing is up to you. How firm do you want your monkey? If the sock is thin, you may want to err on the side of under stuffing, as overstuffing it may cause it to stretch.

, If your sock opening is the same color as the body of the sock, just make a nice rounded head and stitch it shut. If it is a contrasting color, you will need to decide if you want to cut it off (making a shorter body for the monkey) and make the head as usual or use the excess coloring as a ""hat"" by not stuffing the last inch or two and cinching the opening into a cone shape.


To make the head: Stitch around the neck with quarter inch stitches. Use sturdy thread such as embroidery floss. Pull the stitches snugly until you get the size neck you want and knot the ends. Round out the head area with stuffing as desired and stitch the top opening shut.

, Gather the tip with large stitches and snug/cinch them closed. Fold the raw edges to the center and tuck inside. Then, stitch the opening closed. Winter ready!

, Though the pattern is only drawn on the top, make sure to cut through both layers. For a more detailed pattern, see the link in the Sources and Citations section.

, Then sew up the open side in a gentle arc around the dark ends; the dark ends will become the paws and the opposites (open ends) are where the arm will be stuffed and then attached to the body.


Keep all of these sections open-ended. Make sure they're turned inside-out as you work! If they're not, all your seams will be very, very rough.

, Then sew up the open side and in a gentle arc around the dark end as you did with the arms; the dark end will become the tip of the tail and the opposite, open end is where the tail will be stuffed and attached to the body.

, Then, sew in a gentle arc following the rounded sides, leaving the flat side open. The opening is where you will stuff each ear and then attach it to the body. Noticing a pattern?


If you'd like, you can then fold the ears again, forming a vertical line down the middle of the ear (giving it depth like a real ear has). Basically, pinch the edge you just sewed in and bring the two points together. Slip stitch the two sides together., That part's saved for later.

, You should now have two arms, two ears, a tail, and an unsewn, unstuffed nose.


The tail may prove to be a bit of a problem. You could try to stuff it using regular polyfill stuffing and a pencil to poke it through, or you could use batting or part of an aquarium filter. Both the batting and the filter are a bit firmer and will create a more uniform-looking tail in the long run., Position it carefully and slip stitch it all the way around.

, You may want them a little higher than your natural inclination says; this will give your sock a more monkey-like posture.

, Since this will form the muzzle, try to make sure the piece of fabric is uniform in color. Note that, since the outermost edges will be covered, you do not have to make them perfect.

, Make sure no raw edges are visible along the bottom, but leave the top open for now.

, You may want to refer to existing images of sock monkeys as to how this should look. The best sock monkeys seem to have a muzzle that puffs out at nearly a 90º angle.

, The muzzle should take up a large amount of the area for the head -- don't worry about needing space for the rest of his features.


Go ahead, give your monkey a mouth! Along the toe line of the muzzle (which should be dead center) branch stitch in a contrasting color of thread.If you'd like nostrils, simply embroider two small rectangles above the mouth about 1"" (2.5 cm) apart.

, Stitch the completed ears to the sides of the head. They should be in line with where the eyes will be, just above the muzzle. Make sure they stick out from the front!

, To give your monkey whites on the outside of his eyes, glue or sew the buttons onto a bit of white felt. Then, with thread of a contrasting color, sew on the felt just above the muzzle. You now have an adorable sock monkey!


For a non-demonic looking monkey, stick to black buttons. The size you need depends on the size of your monkey. And if you're giving it to a child, either avoid the buttons entirely or make sure they're sewn on really well !

Assemble the Things You'll Need.,
Decide how big you want the purse to be.,
Double it.,
Mark where you'll cut.,

Pin the sides into place.,

Turn your creation inside out, and voila, you have a nearly complete purse!,
Use a 7 inch (17.5 cm) long zipper that is typically used for pants or skirts.,
Pin the zipper into place, leaving it zipped shut, with one side attached to the front and one side attached to the back of the purse.,
Run each side of the zipper through the sewing machine, or sew up each edge by hand.,
Add the strap.,
Hem the two long edges by folding over 1/4 inch (6 mm) and sewing up each one.,
Sew the strap to the inside of the sides of the purse.

",How to Make a Corduroy Pants Purse," See below.;
, Perhaps a bag big enough to toss in your usual purse items, wallet, phone, Gerber multi-tool as well as things for work, like your lunch, occasional Glad containers of coffee, etc. For this pattern, a 10"" x 10"" (25 x 25 cm) square has been chosen.

, Once you've decided how big a purse you want, double that size and add two inches (5 cm). So, the 10 inches (25 cm) becomes 22 inches (55 cm). The way the purse is put together, there will be 3 pieces sewn together, not including the strap. The front, bottom, and back will be one U-shaped piece, hence the doubling of the size and adding an inch to allow for the bottom of the bag and an inch for hemming.

, Start below the seam that connects the leg of the pants to the waistband and go down 22 inches (55 cm). The goal is to have the back pocket in the center of the purse front. This turns out to be awesome for days that you wear pants without pockets! For the width of the purse, take the 10 inches (25 cm) and add an extra inch (2.5 cm) for hemming.

, This illustration shows the cut piece, with the back of the purse facing up. Put a book inside to make the shape a little more apparent. At this point, flip about a half of an inch over on the top of the front and back and pin those in place. You'll want to sew in a hem around the top, as most fabrics will start shredding like crazy otherwise. You can sew it by hand, but it's easier to run it through the sewing machine.

, Each side is a 10.5 inch (26.5 cm) tall, 3 inch (7.5 cm) wide strip of corduroy. Cut so that the lines run parallel to the rest of those on the purse. 3 inches may sound small, but it's not a deep purse, because of its fairly saggy nature. You can adapt it to whatever you put in it.

, That way, the fabric won't decide to unravel on you.

, Typically, you'll sew an item inside out, so that knots and seams are hidden inside of the finished project. Line up one side piece with the front (or back) of the main piece such that the long sides are next to each other. Make sure that the tops of the side and the main piece are lined up and pin them in place. Work your way around the side piece, so that the front, bottom, and back of the bag are pinned to the side. Then do the same on the other side. Check the picture for more direction.

, After all the pinning is done, run this through the sewing machine, one side at a time. It's not a bad idea to run it back through on a back stitch setting, to reinforce the stitches.

, Next, add the zipper.

, Before you buy one, check the zipper that is already on the pants to see if it'll be long enough to allow you reasonable access into your bag. If so, use a seam ripper to carefully remove the zipper and its permanent backing from the pants.

, There should be about an inch gap on each end between the zipper and the side of the purse. This will enable the purse to have holes small enough to drop a pen or keys into the purse without having to unzip the whole thing.

, Be sure to reinforce with a back-stitch.

, Decide how long a strap you want to have on your purse by judging with your measuring tape. For this pattern, there is a 48 inch (1.25 m) strap so that the purse can hang right about hip level. Use the front of the pant leg to cut two segments for this piece that you have sewn together. Go with a 3 inch (7.5 cm) width on the piece, so that you have a nice, thick strap.

, Then sew the two hems together for strength and a nice squishy shred resistant strap.

Turn the bag right side out.",How to Make a Denim Purse," Start by cutting one of the legs off, just below the crotch. Fold the jeans in half, then use the cut leg as a guide for the second one. This will ensure that the bottom of the bag is even.








Denim shorts, skirts, and capris will also work.
If you are using a skirt, cut it ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) longer than you want the bag to be.You can use jeans that you already own, or buy a pair from a garage sale or second hand store.;
, Begin by cutting along the crotch seam so that the pants open up like a skirt. Next, cut the crotch seam off of the pants completely—this is the folded, top-stitched part. Doing this will even up the bottom of the pants and help reduce bulk.







, You want the zipper to be on one side edge and the back seam on the other side edge. You will have a front pocket and a back pocket on both sides of the folded jeans.








If you are using a denim skirt, simply turn it inside out.

, Sew straight down from the zipper to the bottom, cut edge of the pants. You will have a little triangle that used to be the crotch. Repeat this step for the back seam.








Use a pen and ruler to draw guidelines if you have to.
If you are using a denim skirt, skip this step.

, Your new side seams should now be straight. If you want to, you can press open the new side seams with an iron.









If you are using a denim skirt, skip this step.

, You should how have the zipper and front pockets on one side, and the back pockets on the other. The original size seams should be on the left and right edges. Make sure that all of the seams match up.







, Use a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing and to go slowly over the seams.









Trim off any overhanging fabric so that the bottom edge is even.

, Flatten the base of the bag so that the bottom corners turn into flaps. Sew across each flap, about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) away from each side edge. This will make the base of the bag wide enough so that it can stand up on its own when you set it down.








If you want a simple bag, skip this step., You can skip this step if you want a simpler bag. If you want a fancier one, however, you should add the embellishments now before you add the straps and lining. Start by turn the bag right side out. Next, add some patches, embroidery, buttons, or studs—whatever you like! You can even stitch on some crocheted lace or a cut up doily onto the bag.


Some items, such as studs, will need special tools.

, How long you make this strip depends on how long you want the strap to be. You can have one long shoulder strap. You can also cut it in half and make two shorter handles instead.








, You can cut this from an old, button-up shirt, a pillowcase, or cotton fabric from the store. If you don't want a contrasting lining on your handle, cut another matching strip out of the other pant leg instead.








, If you want clean, finished edges on your handles, pin the strips with the right sides facing in.If you want a rustic, raw edge on the handles, pin the strips together with the right sides facing out.







, Use a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. The smaller the seam allowance, the wider the strap will be. Do not sew across the two narrow edges.








, If you pins the strips with the right sides facing in, you will need to turn them inside out. This will hide the seams inside the strips and give you a clean, finished edge.If you pins the strips with the right sides facing out for a rustic finish, skip this step.







, If you turned the strips inside out, consider topstitching along the edges using a ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. You can also sew straight down the handle for a nicer finish. This will work for both types of handles: finished or raw.








, If you made one long shoulder strap, pin the narrow ends to the side seams on your bag. If you made two short handles, pin one handle to the front of the bag, and the other handle to the back. Keep the narrow ends a few inches apart.









You can have the colored liner on the outside or the inside.
The ends of the handles should be just below the waistband of the bag.

, Simply stitch back and forth across the bottom edge, using a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. If you want to, you can also sew across the top and sides of each handle, securing it further to the waistband of the bag.








Remove the pins as you sew.

, Add a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance to the bottom and side edges.Use a shirt with a bright, colorful pattern. You can also use cotton fabric instead, or even an old pillow case.









Avoid tracing over any pockets, seams, or buttons.

, Try to cut through both layers of fabric at the same time. Remember to include the ½-inch seam allowances. If your shirt had a front pocket on it, consider cutting that out as well, as close to the seams as you can. You can add this pocket to the inside of your bag.








, If your cut the front pocket off of your shirt, pin it to the right side of one of your lining pieces. Make sure that the bottom edge of the pocket is at least ½ inch (1.27-centimeters) away from the bottom edge of the lining. Topstitch the pocket down, following the original stitching as much as possible.








, Pin the two pieces of fabric so that the wrong sides are facing out. Sew along the bottom and side edges using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.








If you widened the bottom of your bag by sewing across the triangular flaps, you will need to do the same thing for the liner.

, Turn the bag and the liner inside out so that the wrong sides are facing out. Match up the bottom triangle flaps. Sew across them using the original stitching as a guide. This will help secure the lining to the back.








If you made a simple bag without the widened bottom, skip this step., This will help reduce bulk.Serge the edges, or go over them with a zigzag stitch.









If you made a simple bag, skip this step.

, Tuck one hand into the bag. Use your other hand to roll the lining down onto the bag, like putting on a sock or a pair of pantyhose. When you are done, the lining should be right side out, with the bag tucked inside of it.








If you made a simple bag, turn the lining right side out, then tuck the bag into the lining., Secure it with sewing pins as you go. For a crisper finish, press it flat with an iron. How far you fold the lining down is up to you. You can fold it past the waistband or halfway down the waistband. Make sure that you are folding towards the waistband so that the raw edge is tucked inside.








, You can do this on a sewing machine or by hand using a ladder stitch. If you are using a sewing machine, sew as close as you can to the top edge of the lining.If you are sewing by hand, make sure that you only sew through the inside layer of the waistband. Don't let the needle and thread come out the front.








Machine sewing is only recommended if you folded the lining past the waistband, otherwise you will sew across the belt loops.
If you are sewing on the machine, make sure that the bobbin color matches the jeans and the thread color matches the lining., It is now ready to use! If you want to, you can embellish it with details to make it even more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Weave a ribbon through the belt loops, then tie it into a bow over the front button.
Weave a bandana or a leather belt through the belt loops for a rustic touch.
Add a snap, button, or zipper closure to the bag.
Decorate the bag further with fabric paint.
Add some decorative pins or patches.

Insert the lamp’s nipple into the adapter.,
Slip wire through the sleeve in the socket cap.,
Connect the wire to the neutral conductor.,
Place the brass shell over the lamp socket.,
Attach the lamp harp.,
Add the light bulb.,
Add a lamp shade.",How to Make a Lamp out of a Vase1," You want a vase large enough to allow you to work with, but also stable enough to support the fixtures you are about to add. The overall vase size is up to you and depends on the location you want to place it. You may add an additional base.The standard lamp kit has dimensions of 8.75” tall x 1.75” deep x 5.75” wide. So keep this in mind when selecting your vase. If your vase has a wider opening this will be addressed later. If it is too narrow then you will need to choose a different vase.;
, Use a ruler or tape measure to calculate and mark the center of the base. Do the same for the vase. This is something to consider in conjunction with stability of the vase and planning for the power cord. The base needs to be larger than the bottom of the vase in square area for stability.You want a base that will allow for the power cord to exit out the bottom center or side.

, Use a 3/8″ drill bit and power drill. Drill into point where you marked the center of the vase’s bottom. Drill from outside to inside.Clear out excess materials so they don’t create a hazard later.

, Use the pipe kit portion of the Westinghouse kit. Choose the rubber adapter that will fit into the vase opening, but don’t put it into the vase yet.If none of the kit’s adapters are wide enough for your vase you can look for other adapters at a lighting or hardware store.

, Do this so that 1⁄4” extends beyond the rubber adapter. Put the locknut onto the opposite end of nipple and tighten it. Insert the whole adapter and nipple setup into the vase so that the 1⁄4” nipple portion is protruding upward. Slide the kit’s check ring and harp bottom over the nipple. Place the socket cap onto the nipple and tighten it., Tie this wire into an overhand knot with two free ends within the cap., Look for the ribbing or raised portion on the insulation. Connect one end of the free end of the knotted wire to the silver-colored terminal screw on one side. Connect the other free end of the knotted wire to the brass-colored terminal screw on the other side. Hold the wires partially hooked under each screw head while you tighten both terminal screws to make sure both ends of the conducting wires remain under the screw heads.Try getting one screw started enough to hold the first wire, and then start on the second one. Get the second screw turned enough to pinch the wire down. You can now more easily finish tightening both terminal screws.

, Make sure the brass shell has paper insulation. Pull the extra wire sticking out of the socket back into the lamp and snap the brass shell onto the socket cap.Rock the shell back and forth if necessary. Listen for a clicking sound to signal the shell is locked onto the cap.

, This will be what fits the shade on top. Slide the harp’s two prongs onto the harp saddle.A harp could be 10.5"" x 0.13"" x 4.25""

, Turn the bulb just enough so it starts to tighten, but don’t over-tighten.Don’t plug in the lamp just yet or you might blind yourself. This design is meant for up to 150 watts.

, The style of shade is up to you. The harp should come with a fastener (finial) on top to fit a hole on top of shades configured for it.Make sure the shade is not too narrow or short for the harp or vase.

",How to Make a Baby Romper from a T Shirt,";
, Fold both the t-shirt and the romper in half and lay the romper on top of the shirt, lining them up at the fold. Trace.
See how the crotch on the romper puffs up because it's in a shorts shape? Ignore that. You'll have to fudge a bit for the bottom part. Use the image as a guide.
You should narrow the sleeves (or take them off altogether, up to you). So basically you're cutting a chunk out of the armpit and then letting it widen for the legs.

,]]Sew on the armpit line only. Don't close the leg area.

, Go ahead and cut your bottom line too, just make sure you leave enough to hem or you'll get an underwear shape.

, Don't let your cat help, he doesn't have thumbs.

,, If you use snaps, reinforce your fabric with something that doesn't stretch so they hold up better. Make sure your closures are so that the flaps point toward each other when you go to close it. So both sides should be facing up when laid flat.

, Otherwise, you'll want to hem. Cut that little diagonal slit between the crotch flap and the rest of the leg so your corners don't bunch.

Use wine corks to make coasters.",How to Reuse Old Wine Corks1," If you have a lot of old wine corks lying around, pick up a styrofoam wreath and a hot glue gun at a local craft store. Glue the corks upright around the wreath, covering all white areas. Then, allow the wreath to dry. Glue a ribbon in a loop to the wreath so you can hang it in your home.If you want, you can use paint to paint the wine corks a color to match your home.
This project tends to work best with a lot of wine corks. If you like the idea of a wine cork wreath, start saving wine corks over time.;
, With a utility knife, cut a small sliver of the wine cork on the long side to create a flat, smooth surface. This allows the wine cork to lie flat on a table without moving around. On the opposite side, cut a slit all the way across the cork. Then, insert your place card in the slit.For an added touch, paint the cork in a specific color. As this is a great project for a wedding, using your wedding colors can be a nice touch.

, A trivet is like a large coaster that you can use as a decorative item to set things like glasses on. Find an old picture frame, or buy an inexpensive one at a department store, and take out the glass. Arrange your corks in any design you desire inside the frame. Once you’re happy with your design, glue the corks in place to the backing board of the frame. Allow the glue to fully dry. When it's done, you can set things like coffee cups or vases on the trivet and display it in your home., Glass charms are a cute, simple decoration you can use to personalize glasses for occasions like parties, weddings, and other events. Cut your corks into half inch slices using a sharp knife. Use lettered stamps to stamp a letter onto each cork. You can use the first letter or initials of friends and family members for glass charms. Then, hold your corks flat on a table. Screw a tiny screw with a loop on the end into the corks sideways. Tie a ribbon around the loop in the screw to attach the glass charm around the stem of a wine glass. Now, you have personalized glasses for events.If you want to use people's initials, use smaller stamps so you can fit all the letters on the wine glasses.

Mark herbs with wine corks.,
Make planters.,
Replace old knobs with wine corks.,
Use wine corks as heel stays.,
Use wine corks as handles for cheese knives.,
Make a cat toy.",How to Reuse Old Wine Corks2," If you grow herbs in your backyard or on your balcony, they can sometimes be difficult to tell apart. Many herbs look similar, especially in the early stages. To fix this issue, simply stick a a thin wooden poll in the end of a wine cork. Use a marker or pen to write the name of the herb on the side of the cork. Stick it in the soil near the herb to remind yourself which herbs are which., Using a sharp knife, hollow out the center of a wine cork. Stop about three quarters down the length of the cork. Add potting soil to the hole you’ve created and insert a small plant. Succulents work well and will likely last the longest since they’re relatively easy to maintain. Small planters are a cute decoration for tiny plants in your home.If you want, you can glue a magnet to the back and stick your cute planter on your refrigerator to add some fresh greenery to your kitchen.

, If you have dressers or drawers with older, beat up knobs, you can replace the knobs with wine corks. First, remove the old knobs by opening the drawers. Unscrew the screws attaching the knobs to the drawers. Pick up matching screws at a local hardware or craft store. Insert new screws into the holes in each draw. Then, screw your wine corks onto the screws pointing out of the front of the drawers. You'll be left with a somewhat quirky set of knobs for your cabinets or drawers.This also works well with champagne corks.

, If you have a lot of high heels, wine corks can make great heel stops. To start, cut the cork in half. From there, use a power drill and a drill bit as big as the heels on your shoes to drill a hole into each half of the cork. Leave a small space at the bottom of the cork. Then, fit each heel into the hole, wiggling the heels as necessary to widen the holes to accommodate your heels., If you have cheese knives with unwieldy handles, replace the handles with wine corks. Use a mallet of carefully crack off the existing handle, leaving a small and thin bit of the handle in place. From there, make a slit at the end of the wine cork. Fit the cork into the bit of the handle still sticking out of the cheese knife.

, Wine corks are perfect to use for cat toys since they are light enough for your cat to bat around. Use small scissors to create a hole on the circular, flat end of a wine cork about 1 inch deep.

Mix corks in with your mulch.,
Use as a fire starter.,
Clean your knives.,
Use a wine cork as a sanding block.",How to Reuse Old Wine Corks3," Wine corks can actually be used as mulch for gardens. Chop the corks into small pieces and then use a blender to grind those pieces even further before adding them to your mulch. The corks will retain moisture longer than traditional mulch and help maintain your plant’s health between waterings., Fill a mason jar with wine corks. Pour in rubbing alcohol until the corks are fully submerged, and seal the jar tightly. When you need to start a fire, remove a cork or two and place them under the wood to be kindled before lighting the fire.Make sure not to use plastic wine corks for this method.
Be cautious when lighting a fire. Never leave a fire unattended.

Scrape the hook-and-loop fastener with the cutter of a tape dispenser.,
Pick any deep lint out with needle-nose tweezers.,
Brush lint out of your hook-and-loop fastener once a month.,
Fasten the hook-and-loop fastener together before placing it in washer.,
Spray your hook-and-loop fastener with anti-static spray after washing.",How to Clean Velcro," To remove surface debris, use a lint roller that you’d normally use on your clothes to roll your fastener. Lay the fastener flat, and hold at one end, rolling over it a few times with the lint brush. Refresh to a new sticky “sheet” of the lint roller as necessary., Cut a piece of duct tape no bigger than your palm, so it doesn’t get unwieldy and stick to itself. Lay your fastener flat, and press the tape into the closure to get it to adhere to as much lint as possible. Holding the fastener firmly at one end, strip the tape away to remove the lint.You can perform this step several times with new pieces of duct tape as necessary.

, Your fingers can be a useful tool to remove any surface lint from your fastener. Lay your fastener flat, and pick off any obvious pieces of thread or hair that may have ends you can grab sticking over the edge. Then, give your fastener a good scrape with your fingernails to remove as much surface lint as you can.

, Use a stiff, plain toothbrush (preferably just bristles no gum massagers or other plastic parts) to brush trapped lint out of your fastener. Lay the fastener flat, and apply pressure in short, hard strokes with the bristles from one end of the fastener to the other.Pick any lint that comes to the top of the fastener out with your fingers.

, Use the edge of the tape dispenser that your normally use to cut the tape to scrape your fastener clean. Lay your fastener flat, and use the teeth of the tape dispenser to rake it in short firm strokes from one end to the other.Pick any lint that comes to the top of the fastener out with your fingers.

, For lint that is very embedded in the hooks of your fastener, use a pair of needle-nose tweezers to pick it out. Lay your fastener flat, holding at both ends. Then, use the tips of the tweezers to tease out the debris., To keep your fastener closing well and lint free, clean it once a month. Doing this will keep debris from getting excessively embedded, which is more difficult to remove than surface lint.

, If your fastener is on an item you wash in the washing machine, fasten the hook and loop sides together before washing the item. This will keep your closure from picking up stray threads or damaging your other clothes in the washing process., Anti-static spray, such as Static Guard, can make your fastener attract less lint. Spray your fastener after your wash your clothes to minimize debris."

Locate the air ducts in your home.,
Look underneath the ducts.,
Set up a stable surface to stand on if your vent is high.,
Cover the supply registers with paper towels.,
Turn on a fan in the room you’re starting with.,
Check the filter.,
Loosen up the dust in the air ducts.,
Go back and clean the supply registers.,
Sweep out the air return registers.,
Turn off the fan and furnace.,
Vacuum the dust in the blower department and return air boot.,
Replace the furnace filter.,
Take the caps off of the rectangular duct work.,
Vacuum out the dust.,
Remove the inside basement registers.,
Call in a professional.",How to Clean an Indoor Air Duct," If you’ve lived in your home for a while, you probably know where most of the ducts are. Take some time to locate all of them anyway in order to save time. Some homes have vents high on the walls, and others have them located at the base of the walls. Plan to clean each one of these in a systematic fashion. Basically, clean them room-by-room—unless you want to skip around to make it last longer.Some vents might be located in unusual places. Roam around your house to locate them all. You’ll probably find other things that need to be cleaned or fixed in the process, but don’t get distracted.;
, Check for anything underneath the duct, such as furniture, hanging pictures, carpet or rugs, decorative items, etc. Move them out of the way or cover them so that they don't get dust or dirt landing on them. You don’t need another thing to clean., A ladder, step-stool, stable chair, or particularly strong person that can hold you up will work. Make sure that the item is sitting flat and does not wobble under your weight. Cleaner air is great, but it doesn’t have to come at the cost of a twisted ankle., In basic terms, the supply registers are the things that supply heated air to the rooms. Lift the register, cover it in a paper towel, and put it back in place. It’s as easy as that. This will keep excess dust from being released into the room while you clean the air ducts., Doing this will keep everyone in the house from inhaling and coughing up all the dust you’re about to release. Go to your thermostat and turn the fan on. Turn the heat and cool mode off. You’ll only want the fan to be running., Look at your furnace filter to make sure it isn’t missing or damaged. The filter is important so that the dust you’re about to clean out doesn’t get stuck in the fan motor. That would create another problem., Use something similar to a toilet brush, but you probably don’t want to use the toilet brush you already have. A fairly large, stiff-bristle paintbrush is ideal. Use that brush to knock loose the stuck or damp dust in the air vents., Return to clean the supply registers that you covered in paper towels not too long ago. Remove and toss away the paper towels. Lift the register. The fan will be pushing out dust. Use a vacuum hose to catch that dust before it starts to dirty up the room. Then, use the stiff-bristle paintbrush to scrub off any caked on dust. Now you’re getting somewhere., Now, turn from one register to another register. The air return registers will probably be fastened, so use a screwdriver or the appropriate tool to undo them. Use a broom to sweep out the dust. Get as far back in there as possible. Then, use that same stiff-bristle brush to remove any dust buildup.Fasten the registers again when you’re done.

, Go back to your thermostat and turn off the fan. Then, head on over to your service switch or breaker panel. Take a good look at the panel and find the switch for the furnace. Shut off the power to the furnace.Make sure that you don’t turn off the thermostat.

, Take off the panels on the front of the furnace. This will give you access to the blower department. Use the vacuum hose to clean out the dust that has built up in the blower department and return air boot. This is where most of the dust builds up, so once you’ve done this, you’ve done the bulk of the job!If you have time, go ahead and clean the furnace fan while you’re there.

, You may have to run out to get a new filter. A newer, better filter will definitely be worth it in the long run though. The air will be cleaner in your home with a new filter because there will be less dust, which means less worrying for you.Keep in mind that good filters will have to be changed more often.
How often you need change your filter also depends on the type of house you have, your pets, and where you live.

, You don’t have to clean the main air ducts, but you can do it if cleaning out as much dust as possible is your goal. First, check to see if you have rectangular duct work. If so, go ahead and slide the drives down with the use of pliers. Then, pull the caps off of the slips. The terminology may sound technical, but it should be pretty easy to figure out when you’re standing in front of it.The drives are the long, vertical pieces of metal on your rectangular duct work.

, Take your vacuum hose and slide it into the space created by removing the caps. This should be pretty easy to do, unless the duct is up against the wall. Vacuum out as much dirt and dust as possible. Then, check out what you’ve done with a flashlight. Vacuum again if doesn’t look as clean as you’d like it to be., This is only necessary if you actually have a basement. Usually the duct work in your house will have a few registers dedicated to the air flow in your basement. Take off those registers and vacuum inside of them., Hopefully the job has been done to your liking, but it’s okay if you couldn’t clean the ducts as well as you would have liked. Some problems, like mold, are too big to handle on your own. If so, call in a professional."

Cut out your shape using sewing scissors.Then, pin the pieces together. You want the sides that will be the outside to be facing toward each other. This way, the seams will be invisible.






Sew seams along three edges and three-fourths of the fourth edge. When you're done, turn the fabric right side out.






Stuff polyfill stuffing, which you can buy at the craft store, through the hole that you left in the one edge. Make sure to stuff the pillow until you can’t really fit anything else.When your pillow is completely stuffed, sew the open edge shut.







, Sturdy boot shafts work best for this project, but they aren’t essential. You can also use old rain boots. If there are holes in the soles or cracks in the rubber, that’s actually perfect, because you want them to drain a bit.


Drill a few holes in the sole. This is only necessary if the boots are still watertight. Make small holes and just enough to provide some drainage.Put something heavy in the bottom. You can use gravel, pebbles, or anything else that will anchor the boot while still allowing it to drain.






Fill each boot about halfway with potting soil.






Place one flower or plant in each boot. You can use practically anything that doesn’t require a lot of room for its roots.






Top up the potting soil. Don’t bury the roots too deep, especially if they tend to be shallow for that particular plant. You want enough to protect them.

Understand the importance of purifying indoor air with plant filters.,
Understand how plants help us.,
Decide where you have room to place plants.,
Think about which rooms could do with having plants purifying the air.,
Select your plants according to their benefits.,
Consider some other great plants as well:


Snake plants - these plants are amazing growers and very resilient.,
Keep the plants in good shape and make sure you have enough.",How to Purify the Air Using Plants," Indoor air is some of the worst air we breathe on a daily basis because it is inside that everything builds up from the off-gassing of chemicals in many of our products. We are exposed to a range of indoor air contaminants daily, including, smoke, toxins, chemicals off-gassing, pesticides, detergent fumes, mold, small fibres, bacteria etc. While cleaning takes care of some of it (provided we take care what we clean with), it cannot take care of many of the air contaminants. However, in a NASA study it was found that ""houseplants can purify and revitalize air in our homes and offices, protecting us from the negative effects of such common toxins as ammonia, formaldehyde, and benzene."";
, Plants act as filters because they absorb the toxins through their leaves, especially those with the largest leaves. The theory is that if the plants do the absorbing first, our nose and lungs take on less of a burden. That means reduced incidence of asthma, allergies, reactions to mold and other particles, and immuno-suppressed illnesses.

, It will need to be somewhere that you can access easily and where you can have the odd water spill without it being too devastating. Desks, floors, window sills and special plant stands are all good places that are commonly chosen.

, Usually bedrooms are an excellent place for plants as they convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. Consider rooms that are heavily laden with electrical equipment, such as studies and TV rooms, and areas that have high fume potential, such as kitchens and art workshops, etc. All offices can benefit from the addition of plants.

, Use larger leafed varieties where possible. Some of the best plants are considered to be a ""top 10"".They are:


Areca palm
Reed palm
Dwarf date palm
Boston fern
Janet Craig dracaena - breaks down benzene, carbon monoxide and trichloroethylene
English ivy - breaks down benzene and trichloroethylene
Australian sword fern
Peace Lily - breaks down benzene and trichloroethylene
Rubber plant - good for filtering a range of nasties, such as formaldehyde, benzene and ammonia.
Weeping fig

, They are great at removing most toxins and they are happy to grow where other plants might wither and die (such as a hot windowsill, for example). They are also good bathroom and dark space plants.

Christmas cactus - here is a plant that does well in rooms that are darkened in the evening, such as the DVD and game zones.
Spider plant - great for removing formaldehyde, carbon monoxide
Bamboo palm - another good formaldehyde remover, as well as carbon monoxide
Gerbera daisy - removes trichloroethylene

, The NASA study suggested that there be a 6 inch (15.2 cm) plant for each 100 square feet of interior space. And naturally, the plants that work best are those in top health themselves, so keep them well watered and fertilized.

Know the signs.",How to Avoid Carbon Monoxide Poisoning," Your heating system (including chimneys, ducts, and vents) and your hot water heater should be thoroughly inspected by a qualified technician every year., Never use a portable generator inside your home or garage, even if the doors and windows are open. Only use generators outside, at least 20 feet away from your doors and windows., Only use a space heater if someone in the house will be awake and alert enough to make sure it’s functioning correctly. Also make sure it is in a room with good air flow. You don’t want to use one in a tightly enclosed space.

, No matter how much you are tempted, do not barbecue or use your camp stove in the garage., Ovens and stoves are designed specifically for food preparation. They should never be used as a heating source for your home., Every year, you should have your vehicle’s exhaust system checked by a professional. Don’t ever leave your car running in your attached garage, even if the doors are open. Fumes can still make their way into your home., If you see soot coming from your fireplace or an appliance, it’s a bad sign. Make sure you open the damper on your fireplace before lighting a fire. Keep it open until all the ashes are cool. An open damper helps to prevent CO build up., Vent pipes that become loose or disconnected can become a major problem. Make sure pipes are connected properly with no rust or water streaks., A pilot light that frequently blows out could be a sign of CO being present in your home. Weak, yellowish flames can indicate a problem and the presence of CO. The flame on your pilot light should always be bright blue or blue-green with a yellow tip., Excessive or increased condensation inside your windows, walls, or cold surfaces in your home can also be a sign of CO buildup., By contacting your local Fire Department, you can find out who you should call in your area if you ever encounter a problem in your home. A local utility company can also provide you with useful information about local resources. By arming yourself with the information you need, you’ll be prepared if danger strikes., When you purchase your CO alarm, make sure that it is audible and battery-powered (or that it includes a battery backup.) Look for models with digital displays that will tell you precise CO level readings in addition to beeping an alarm., Make sure you have at least one CO detector on each level of your home (including the basement) to alert you if poisonous gas is present.Consider placing an alarm outside each bedroom or sleeping area in your home.
For a small, one-level home, one CO alarm would be sufficient.
Don’t place an alarm inside your garage where high CO from car exhaust may trigger a false reading.
Don't place alarms near doors or windows because the fresh air could cause a false low reading.

, By connecting your alarms together, you will be sure to be alerted to danger. If one detects the presence of CO in your home, they will all go off. Most alarms can be wirelessly interlinked together., Regularly check your alarms to make sure they are working correctly. Be sure to change your batteries on a regular basis to ensure proper battery backup., The first thing you should do if you suspect CO poisoning is to get outside your home into fresh air.

, If you suspect that that you or a loved one have suffered CO poisoning, call emergency services or proceed directly to a medical professional. The effects of CO poisoning should not be treated at home.

, Signs and symptoms of CO poisoning can appear suddenly or over a long period of time. As CO builds up in your body, symptoms can get worse and worse. You may notice that symptoms subside when you leave a building and then you feel worse when you return. Remember that signs of CO poisoning can include:


Weakness
Shortness of Breath
Dizziness
Vomiting
Sleepiness
Headache
Confusion

To remove these odor sources, vacuum your entire house.Use special attachments when necessary, and don’t forget to vacuum:


Floors
Baseboards
Carpets, rugs, and mats
Furniture
Under furniture
Cushions
Areas where pets spend lots of time;
, Improperly cleaned or undiscovered pet messes can make your entire house stink. But if there are areas where there have been recent pet messes, spray the area with an enzyme cleaner. Let the cleaner soak in for 30 minutes, and then blot it dry with a clean cloth.


Enzyme cleaners are ideal for this job because they will break down the proteins in urine, feces, vomit, and other biological stains., Spot cleaning stains will help remove smells from specific areas, but cleaning your entire carpet will get rid of pet smells that are lingering all over the house.You can either use a powder or wet shampoo to clean your carpets:


For a dry cleaning, sprinkle a powdered cleaner over the entire carpet. Let the cleaner sit for at least 30 minutes. Vacuum to remove cleaner, dirt, and smells from the carpet.
To shampoo, fill the shampooer’s reservoir with water, and add the liquid cleaner to the compartment. Press the lever and vacuum the entire carpet. Allow the carpet to dry for at least 24 hours, and then vacuum.

, Furniture is another place where pet smells love to hide. The type of furniture will dictate the best cleaning method, but you should always check the care labels before cleaning to make sure the piece isn't dry clean only. Care labels marked with an S mean don’t clean with water, and X means dry clean only.


To clean upholstered furniture like couches, fill a bucket with warm water and several drops of liquid dish soap. Swirl the water to create suds. Dip a soft-bristled brush into the suds and brush the entire surface of the furniture. Wipe with a barely damp cloth and air dry.
To clean leather and leather-like fabrics, make a solution of equal parts vinegar and water. Soak a cloth and wring out as much liquid as you can, so the cloth is barely damp. Wipe the surface of the fabric., Regular bathing is a good idea for dogs and ferrets, and some other pets might need a wash from time to time as well. Get your pet into a bathtub, wash basin, or bucket. Use a hose or bucket to wet your pet’s fur. Apply pet shampoo to the fur and lather it in with your hands. Rinse thoroughly to remove all traces of shampoo. Towel dry the fur.


When washing, pay special attention to the paws, the behind area, and any areas where your pet may have rolled in something.
Do not wash your pet’s face, eyes, or ears with water and shampoo. Shampoo in the eyes can sting, and water in the ears can cause a yeast infection., Another common odor source in the home is your pet’s bed.To clean the bed and remove odors, put the bed in the washing machine and wash it using a regular cycle and warm or hot water. Tumble dry the bed in the dryer.


Larger beds will likely have a removable cover on them. Wash the cover in the washing machine. Sprinkle the stuffing with baking soda to remove odors. Vacuum off the baking soda before replacing the clean cover.

, In homes where pets are allowed on the bed, it’s important to wash your bed as well, since it will likely be harboring pet odors too. Strip pillow cases, sheets, fitted sheets, duvet covers, and blankets from the bed. Machine wash all the linens and blankets. Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of vinegar to the wash for extra odor-fighting.Air or tumble dry all the bedding.


While the linens are being washed, sprinkle the bare mattress with baking soda to help remove odors. Before making the bed again, vacuum up the baking soda.

, Wash fabric toys, ropes, towels, collars, and leashes in the washing machine. Tumble dry them in the dryer. Wash hard toys, bowls, and rubber toys in the sink with hot soapy water.


You may not often think to wash your pet’s accessories, but these items can smell like your pet and leave lingering odors in the house.

, Empty the contents of the litter box into a plastic garbage bag. Scrub the litter box with soap and water. To remove difficult stains and smells, pour some vinegar into the box and let it soak for about 30 minutes. Scrub the box with a brush and rinse it out. Let the box air dry.


When the box is completely dry, fill it with fresh litter. You can also sprinkle in some baking soda to help prevent future odors., For pet guardians who have rats, mice, gerbils, ferrets, rabbits, and other pets that live in cages with bedding, the cage could be making your whole house stink. Gently remove your pet and place the pet somewhere safe, such as a second cage. To clean the cage:


Empty the contents of the cage and throw out the bedding
Clean all toys and bowls
Clean the bottom of the cage with soap and water
Let the cage air dry
Fill the bottom with fresh bedding
Replace all toys and dishes
Return your pet to the cage

, Letting in fresh air is one of the best ways to rid your house of bad smells. In spring, summer, and fall, open windows throughout the house to create a breeze that will blow fresh air in one window and bad smells out the other.During cold weather, open one window at a time, and only leave it open for a couple of minutes to help air the house out.

, An air purifier equipped with a HEPA filter is ideal for eliminating odors in your house, because the filter will trap dander, fur, and other odor sources. These filters will also reduce dust and other allergens, making the air in your home cleaner.


Replace the filters in the air purifier every few months, or according to the manufacturer’s instructions., There are lots of deodorizers you can use around the house to help get rid of pet smells. Two of the most popular items are baking soda and vinegar, which you can spray around the house, on carpets, on beds, and elsewhere to help remove smells. To make your own deodorizers:


Fill a spray bottle with plain vinegar. Add five to 10 drops of essential oils if you like, such as lemon, lavender, or vanilla. Spray the vinegar around the house.Add ¼ cup (55 g) of baking soda to a spray bottle and fill it with water.

When you opt for commercial sprays, gels, or plug-ins, make sure they're specially formulated to be safe for pets.Spray it around the house to freshen the air.


You can also make your own air freshener by filling a saucepan with water, citrus peels, and your favorite herbs. Bring the water to a boil and let it simmer on the stove to infuse your home with delicious smells.

, The best way to stop your home from smelling like your pets is to clean regularly and stay on top of messes. A good cleaning routine will include regular vacuuming, floor washing, laundry, and dusting. For the best results:Vacuum three times a week
Clean hard floors weekly with a vinegar and water solution
Dust weekly
Do laundry as necessary when you have a full load
Clean carpets every couple of months

, Pick up solid waste and throw it in the garbage. Blot the mess to absorb excess moisture. Spray the mess with an enzyme cleaner, and let it sit for 30 minutes. Blot the area with rags or a cloth and let it air dry.


Urine, feces, and vomit are major causes of pet smells in your home. To prevent these smells, clean up messes as soon as they happen, or a soon as you discover them., Pet smells build up over time, so it’s important to stay on top of cleaning and washing. Wash your pet’s bed, fabric toys, leashes, and collars in the washing machine every month. Wash hard toys every month in the sink with soap and water. Wash bowls with soap and water every week., Pet grooming involves bathing, clipping nails, and brushing teeth.

Brush your pet every day to remove excess fur and dirt
Brush your pet’s teeth at least three times a week for good oral hygiene and fresh breath
Bathe your dog at least once a month, and more for dogs with particularly smelly fur, Pets can track all manner of stinky substances into the house on their paws when they come in from outside. To stop this from happening, leave a towel by the door and always wipe your pet’s paws when it comes inside. This is especially important on rainy and muddy days, or if your pet rolled in something outside., If your pets spend a lot of time on chairs, couches, and other furniture, it’s a good idea to invest in washable covers like slip covers. That way, you can simply remove the cover when it starts to smell, wash it in the washing machine, and you don’t have to worry about vacuuming and scrubbing your furniture.


You can also invest in easy-to-clean furniture, such as microfiber, that won’t absorb smells and stains like furniture with a thick weave will., Scoop waste from the litter box daily to minimize urine and feces smells. Change the litter monthly. When you change the litter, wash the pan with soap and water. Let the pan dry completely before filling it with fresh litter."

Leaving these items in your home will lead to continual absorption of the smell of smoke. Dispose of these items after they have been completely extinguished. Place them in a grocery bag and tie it closed before putting it in an outdoor trash bin.
, Do this frequently throughout the cleaning and deodorizing process.


You can place fans strategically throughout your home for increased airflow. Point your fans in corners of the room that may not have good airflow to push air out of the room. Or, point fans toward doorways and windows to help stale air leave the home.

, Some products will advertise things such as odor control or odor removal. However, it's important you use products that have a cleaning agent included. Products that simply mask odors will not get rid of the smell of smoke. Look for products that have:



Baking soda. Baking soda naturally neutralizes odors and does it by bringing acidic and basic odor molecules into a more neutral pH or state.Activated charcoal. Charcoal is used often to filter dirt and particles from water but it also acts as a great deodorizing agent that absorbs odors and smells.Hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide deodorizes by giving oxygen to a contaminated or smelly area. However, this chemical can act like bleach and should be used carefully and only on certain surfaces. Do a test run on a small area before using it extensively.

, Anything that is cloth or linen and can be washable should be gathered into bags to be washed.


You may think a certain item doesn't smell, but you may have gone noseblind to it. This means you have gotten used to the smell of smoke and can't distinguish it from the environment anymore. It's safe to say that if something in a home smells of smoke, most or all items will probably smell like smoke.
Wash or dry clean all items. It's important to clean your clothes as well as cloths, linens, and pillows before you plan to clean the rest of the home. Cloths and linens are able to soak up odors more effectively than other types of materials. By getting them out of the way, it makes cleaning other surfaces easier.
Consider washing and storing your clean cloths and linens outside of the home. Bringing them back into the home after cleaning runs the risk of your items soaking up smoke odors left in the home.

, Many people forget to clean curtains and shades which are prime spots for tar and resin to settle and permeate into. Take down your curtains or shades and wash them. You can also buy new shades if yours are particularly old and smelly.


Certain wall hangings may also be made of fabric or canvas material. Remember to take these down as well and clean them with mild soap, water, and a wash cloth. Simply wipe them down and store them outside of the home until you finish the deodorizing process.

, If it is extremely dirty and the smoke smell is intense, consider replacing it. If you cannot, clean it by:


Shampooing it. You can rent a carpet steam cleaner and shampoo the carpet yourself. Or you can hire a professional to clean the carpet for you.

Sprinkling baking soda. Sprinkle a liberal amount of baking soda on top of your carpet surfaces and leave it to soak for a day. The baking soda will absorb the smell of smoke and any moisture in the carpet. Then vacuum the carpet to remove the baking soda. You can do this several times a week until the smell disappears., You may also choose to use a strong chemical cleaner like OdoBan. This deodorizing product is used by professionals who are trying to improve houses after a fire.


If you can remove the cushion covers, wet them and wash by hand or in a washing machine with a baking soda mixture. Let them dry a little, then place them back on the cushions when they are still slightly wet. This allows them to stretch to the appropriate size without causing mildew.

, Bleach, and especially vinegar, do well to break up the tars and resins in cigarette smoke.The smell of bleach and vinegar may be off putting at first, but unlike smoke, these odors will dissipate in time.


Mix equal parts of white distilled vinegar and warm water to create a cleaning solution.
Mix 1/2 cup (115 mL) of chlorine bleach to 1 gallon (4 L) of water to clean surfaces like sinks, showers, bathtubs, countertops, glazed tile, vinyl, and floors. Always rinse surfaces with water thoroughly after cleaning, before use. Do not use bleach on the same surface that you applied the vinegar mixture to.

, You may need a ladder to reach all the washable surfaces in your house.


Don't forget to wash down interiors of closets and cabinets as well as the walls of the basements, hallways, cupboards, and drawers.

, Put the vinegar in a spray bottle and wipe it clean with a rag. Follow up by rinsing with water and drying with a clean rag, if the furniture is delicate.


Place several drops of lavender, citrus, or rosemary essential oil to offset the smell of the vinegar. If you do not choose to do this, the vinegar smell will dissipate as it deodorizes furniture.

, Simply wipe them or wash them in mild soap. You may want to remove them from the home until all surfaces are clean and deodorized., You can use a variety of products or cleaning solutions to wash your walls and remove dirt, grease, and odors.


Most professional painters use TSP, or trisodium phosphate, to clean walls Just mix 1 cup of TSP to 20 cups of water or buy a TSP spray to apply to your walls and wipe with a washcloth. Be sure to use gloves when you're using TSP.

, Products like Zinsser Bullseye and Kilz are an essential step to removing smoke odors that have been around for a long period of time. Simple repainting will not remove the smell and will just trap smoke odors within the paint.

, For example, if an old piece of furniture smells smoky, you can wash it, prime it with a deodorizing primer, and paint it to get rid of the smell.

, Air that is forced through your home will still contain smoky smells, so replacing any and all filters will begin to purify the air and move clean, fresh air into the home.


You can clean filters in TSP solutions. While wearing gloves, simply soak the filter in a TSP solution and agitate it for no more than an hour. Use a brush to further rid of any dirt or remaining odors. Rinse thoroughly after cleaning.

, You can choose to install an air purifier in your home's forced air system or you can buy purifiers that can be placed in a single room. Make sure to take into consideration the size of the room or home, and purchase equipment that is the right size and strength for the area.

, Activated charcoal works to absorb odors over time. Place bowls of charcoal around places within your home that cannot be aired out, such as a windowless room or cupboard space. Over time, the charcoal should soak up the odors.

Create a vinegar solution.,
Dunk contaminated fabrics into the solution.,
Finish washing the fabrics in a washing machine.,
Place bowls of vinegar around the house.",How to Get Skunk Smell Out of the House1," Mix one part vinegar with five parts warm water in a large bucket.


The precise amounts you need will largely depend on how much you need to clean. This solution is meant for clothes, blankets, towels, and other removable fabrics that can be washed in a washing machine.
Note that some synthetic fabrics and delicate fabrics may not hold up well when exposed to acidic vinegar.;
, Dip your contaminated clothes and other fabrics into the diluted vinegar. Let them soak for two to three hours.









For best results, use your hands to gently scrub the fabric for several minutes after dipping it into the vinegar solution. Doing so works the vinegar in between the fibers of the fabric, allowing it to penetrate further and deodorize more of the smell.
This treatment is most effective when performed within one or two hours of contamination.

, After removing your fabrics from the vinegar solution, wash them in a standard warm wash cycle.









For extra deodorizing power, add 1/2 cup (125 ml) baking soda to the washing machine at the beginning of the wash.
If possible, air dry in sun and fresh air instead of drying in the dryer.

, If you cannot pinpoint the exact source of the smell, fill small bowls with a little white vinegar and place them around the house.









Focus on the worst smelling rooms of the house, since the source of the stench most likely originates there.
If you have pets or small children, you may want to consider putting the vinegar high up on shelves to prevent them from ingesting it.
The vinegar should absorb much of the smell after 24 hours. In most cases, the smell of vinegar should not be too potent, either.

, Charcoal is similarly a powerful odor absorber that can be used in many rooms and inside appliances to deodorize.Be sure to use pure charcoal and not something that contains lighter fluid. Place a few pieces of charcoal on plates and distribute them around the house. You can put them in:


Closets
Refrigerator and freezer
Living areas

, Certain houseplants are known to clean the air, and they may help to control odors in the house as well. Houseplants you can grow around the house for air-purification include:Snake plants
English ivy
Lady palms
Dracaena

, Fabric softener sheets make your clothes smell great, and they can do the same for the air in your house.To use these as an air freshener, place sheets in smelly areas around the house, such as in:


Shoe closets
Garbage cans
Wet basements
Areas where mold has been

, When you boil water in the kitchen, the water particles evaporate and get carried around the house. You can turn this into a potent air freshener by adding your favorite herbs, spices, and citrus rinds to a pot, filling it with water, and boiling it on the stove with the lid off for a couple of hours. Ingredients you can use in the simmer pot include:Lemon peels
Cinnamon sticks
Allspice
Basil
Ginger
Cranberries
Orange peels
Cloves
Bay leaf

, Commercial air fresheners are specifically designed to make the air in your house smell clean and wonderful. These devices often contain chemicals that mask bad odors, plus fragrances that make the air smell nice. Air fresheners come in a variety of forms, including:Sprays
Diffusers
Gels
Waxes

, Incense comes in many forms and in many different smells. To burn incense sticks, place the skinny end of the stick into an incense holder. Light the opposite end of the stick until the tip begins to glow, and then blow out the flame. As the incense burns it will release sweet-smelling smoke that will make the air smell great.


To distribute the smell throughout the entire house, set up a fan on the opposite side of the room to the incense. This will produce air to blow the smoke throughout the house, but not too much breeze that ashes blow everywhere.
Never leave incense unattended, as it does produce heat and can cause fires.

Open your windows.Let natural sunlight and fresh air into your home to help neutralize the skunk odor.,
Run fans.,
Change out your filters.Change out your air conditioner and heater filters before and after you treat the rest of your home for skunk odor.,
Shampoo your carpets and wash removable fabrics.,
Spray air deodorizers.",How to Get Skunk Smell Out of the House2,"









Closing your house up will only keep the stench inside. By opening your windows, you let out some of the smell and allow fresh air into your home to help replace some of the contaminated air.
Sunlight also has an effect on fabric. The ultraviolet rays can help neutralize the odor and lift it out of your fabrics.
If you need to get skunk smell out of clothes, towels, blankets, or other removable fabrics, wash the fabric and hang it to dry outdoors. The direct exposure to sunlight and fresh air will work better at ridding the fabric of the skunk smell than a dryer would.

, Turn on electric ceiling fans and desk fans to keep the air circulating in your home.









If you allow the air to remain still and stagnant, the skunk smell will only sink deeper into your fabrics. Turning on all the fans in your home as soon as possible helps to keep the air in your house moving, thereby preventing the odor from settling into anything too deeply.
This works especially well when used in conjunction with opened windows.

,









The skunk smell can cling to these filters, and as a result, you may end up smelling skunk through your air vents for months. The only way to remedy this is by changing out your air filters.
Changing the air filters before treating the rest of your home minimizes the amount of stink coming through your vents and re-contaminating the rest of your home.
Do a sniff test after you clean the rest of your home. Smell the air filters. If they do not smell like skunk, you may not need to change them again. If they do smell like skunk, however, you should replace them once more to prevent the filters from re-contaminating the rest of your home with smelly air.

, Clothes, towels, blankets, and other removable fabrics should be washed in washing machine with hot water and detergent as quickly as possible. Carpets and other hard-to-wash fabrics, like cloth furniture and curtains, should be washed using a wet vacuum.









Steam cleaners work better than ordinary wet vacuums because the heat helps to open and expand the stitching of the fabric. This allows the detergent to sink in further and eliminate more of the skunk smell. An ordinary wet vacuum is still better than nothing, however.
As a general rule, clothes and other fabrics should be washed within one or two hours of initial contamination in order to prevent the smell from sinking in too deep.

, Deodorizing air fresheners can mask and remove part of the skunk smell.









Look for a spray that specifically indicates its ability to deodorizing. Most air fresheners only emit a strong perfume that covers other odors in the home. This will not be enough to deal with skunk smell, however. Only a deodorizing freshener can neutralize and eliminate some of the stink.
There are also special ""de-skunking"" sprays that are formulated specifically with the purpose of removing skunk odor. People who use these sprays tend to report mixed results, but you can read reviews about various types online and determine which may be the most effective for your needs.

Alternatively, add baking soda to your next wash.",How to Get Skunk Smell Out of the House3,"









Use 3 percent hydrogen peroxide, if possible.
For more stubborn skunk odors, you may need to up the amount of baking soda to 1/2 cup (125 ml) and the amount of soap to 1 Tbsp (15 ml).
Do not close the container after mixing the ingredients together. The gas that will be produced could build up and create enough pressure to destroy the container.
Do not store this mixture. Use it as soon as you mix it together.

, Dip a clean washcloth in the solution and use it to clean contaminated fur and skin.









This solution is safe for both dogs and human, but you should avoid getting it into eyes, ears, or mouths. While it is safe for skin, it can sting and damage eyes or other sensitive areas.
Saturate then scrub the skunked dog or human with this solution and let sit for five minutes before rinsing it off with clean water. Repeat as necessary until you can no longer smell the skunk.
Note that you may need to make more of the solution for a bigger dog or adult human.
This works best if done within an hour or two after contamination.

, This solution is safe to use on clothing and other fabrics, but the amount you make will depend on how much you need to deodorize.









As far as fabrics are concerned, this solution is recommended over the stronger hydrogen peroxide solution used to clean pets and people. Strong concentrations of hydrogen peroxide can damage clothes, but when diluted with water, it should be safe to use on normal fabrics.
Avoid using this solution on delicate fabrics or ""dry clean only"" clothes.

, Dip contaminated clothes in the diluted hydrogen peroxide and let soak for one or two hours.









After removing the clothes from the solution, place them in the washing machine and run a normal washing cycle.

, If you feel uncomfortable dunking your clothes in hydrogen peroxide, add 1/2 cup (125 ml) baking soda to the washing machine at the beginning of your washing cycle.









You can also add the same amount of baking soda to a load of clothes treated with hydrogen peroxide for maximum deodorizing power.

You may be using too much laundry detergent or fabric softener. This can cause soap to accumulate on clothing, making them less absorbent and causing musty odors.;
, Add 1 cup of baking soda to a normal load and let soak for 30 minutes. Complete normal wash cycle., Bleach can remove both stains and odors caused by mold. However, check any garment label to determine if item can be bleached, as bleach will discolor most items that are not white. Place clothing in the washing machine, making sure not to overload the machine. Add liquid detergent and set your washer for ""warm"" water. Once the machine has filled with water, add a cup of bleach (reduce this for smaller loads). Continue regular wash. Remove and rinse clothing if you notice colors beginning to fade.



Bleach will typically permanently discolor or damage clothing or fabrics. Natural fabrics such as silk, wool, or animal fibers are very likely to suffer bleaching effects. Check clothing tags for any ""do not use chlorine bleach"" warnings. While you may approach a pair of jeans as an opportunity to do a creative bleaching wash, you may not that for other garments.
Do not over wash clothes with chlorine bleach, as it can weaken fabrics such as linen, cotton, and rayon over time. The occasional bleaching will not do a lot of harm.

, Exposing your fabrics to light and fresh air can remove odors naturally.


Make sure fabrics are completely dry before bringing them inside and storing them. Trapped moisture is a major cause of mildew.Keep an eye on the weather and bring all fabrics inside if it gets damp or rainy. Do not leave out overnight if possible. Prolonged exposure outside in damp weather can cause mold and must in clothing.

Avoid abrasive chemical cleaners.,
Spray the stains with vinegar.,
Allow the vinegar to sit for 10-20 minutes.,
Wipe away the stains with a soft sponge.,
Rinse out the inside of the tub.",How to Clean Tough Stains from a Bathtub1," When cleaning an acrylic bathtub, stay away from harsh astringent powders such as Comet and Ajax, as well as harsh chemicals like bleach. Acrylic is a soft material and is therefore easily damaged. These types of products are almost guaranteed to ruin your tub's finish.It's generally a good idea to start with the gentlest cleaning solution available to you and work your way up to more powerful options if that doesn't work.;
, Distilled white vinegar makes an excellent natural cleaning solution, especially on smooth surfaces like acrylic that release stains easily. Fill a spray bottle with vinegar and keep it on hand for routine bathroom cleaning tasks. Apply the vinegar liberally to completely cover the affected area.Lemon juice makes a fine alternative to vinegar if you happen to have some in the refrigerator.

, As it sits, the acidity in the vinegar will break down mold, grime and discoloration so that they can wiped away with ease. You may even see stains begin to dissolve and run off on their own, before you even begin scrubbing.Make sure you give the vinegar ample time to begin working.
For especially troublesome spots, sprinkle a little baking soda onto the vinegar as it soaks., The yellow side of a normal dish sponge will do the trick. After being soaked with vinegar, dirt and grime should simply lift off with little difficulty. Use a quick back and forth scrubbing motion, and continue treating the stains until they vanish.You can also use specialty scrubbing tools, like the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, which are made from porous melamine foam for added stain-fighting power., Run the faucet for a few minutes to wash away every last trace of dissolved grim and dirty vinegar solution. If you’re cleaning a bathtub with an adjustable shower head, turn it on and direct the stream over the areas you just treated. Once it’s clean, the tub will need to dry so that stain-causing bacteria doesn’t return.Most bathtub stains are the result of germs that create a filmy residue as they accumulate.Leave the shower curtain drawn and switch on the overhead fan so that the tub receives steady airflow.

Try cleaning with vinegar first.,
Use a bleach-free commercial cleaning spray.,
Make your own natural cleaner.,
Soak problem areas for several minutes.,
Scrub out the stains gently.",How to Clean Tough Stains from a Bathtub2," Though it’s a mild natural cleanser, vinegar will typically be potent enough to deal with most stains when applied heavily and given time to set up. Spray the tub down thoroughly, let the vinegar sit for a few minutes, then scrub away the stains using a sponge or stiff-bristled brush. If you discover that vinegar isn't having the desired effect, you can move on to more intensive methods.


There will come a point when simply adding more and more vinegar won’t suffice.

, Products like Lysol All Purpose Cleaner, Kaboom, Shout! and Scrubbing Bubbles shower cleaner are good for eating away at tough stains without damaging delicate surfaces. Since most of these products contain a similar combination of ingredients, any of them will work as well as another. Just make sure whatever product you choose doesn’t contain bleach, as this can severely weaken the outer enamel layer of the tub.Only buy cleaners that have been approved for use on enamel-coated bathroom surfaces. Be sure to check the label carefully before buying a particular cleaning product so you'll know you’re getting what you need.

, If you're reluctant to go shopping, you can formulate a simple all-purpose bathroom cleaner at home by mixing together warm water, baking soda, Castile soap and essential oils in a spray bottle. All of these ingredients are readily available and safe to use but are quite potent when brought together. Once they're combined, spray the mixture onto the stained surface and give it a few minutes to take effect before wiping it away.If you're having trouble tracking down Castile soap, hydrogen peroxide will make an acceptable substitute.
Essential oils like tea tree and peppermint can also act as natural disinfectants., Mist on the solution and give it a chance to sit. Pay special attention to places with heavy staining and discoloration. The cleaning solution should get to work dissolving these stains right away.The longer you let the solution sit, the more effective it will be at lifting long-settled residue.
Wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area when handling chemical cleaning solutions.

, Use a soft sponge or microfiber towel to avoid leaving marks or scratches. Go over the stains using a gentle circular motion. When you’re finished, rinse away any remaining dirt and cleaning solution and let the tub dry completely.If necessary, apply another burst of cleaning solution. Wipe and repeat until the stains come out of the enamel finish.
Using anything more abrasive than a sponge to scrub enamel may wear down the finish.

Pick up a canister of abrasive cleaning powder.,
Stick with natural alternatives.,
Sprinkle the cleaning powder around the stained tub.,
Add enough water to produce a paste.,
Scour the stains with a sturdy scrubber.",How to Clean Tough Stains from a Bathtub3," For thick buildup on porcelain surfaces, you’ll need to use something a little more heavy-duty. Use a product like Comet or Ajax that comes in powdered form. The small particles will be able to penetrate deeper into stains that have set up on the surface of the tub to remove them.Powdered cleansers contain chemicals known as surfactants which have mild abrasive properties. This makes them much more effective for addressing hardened, stuck-on residue.Apply abrasive cleansers sparingly. For most jobs, a single canister be enough for a single thorough cleaning., Alternately, tough stains like rust and hard water residue can be treated with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar. Blend the two ingredients together until they're about the same consistency as cake frosting and spread them directly over the stains. After 10 minutes, buff the stains with a nylon brush or pumice stone until they're erased completely.Homemade concoctions like hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar will be preferable for those who are wary of the health and environmental effects of chemical cleaning products.
Hydrogen peroxide will also help treat age-related discoloration and lighten the finish of the tub., A moderate dusting should be enough to deal with most messes. The powder won’t stick to the surface of the porcelain on its own, but when combined with a liquid it will form a paste that can be spread directly over stains.Be sure to cover the bottom of the tub, where accumulated mold can become a slipping hazard.

, Spray purified or ordinary tap water onto the cleaning powder. With the addition of moisture, the powder will take on a thick, foamy consistency. Rub this paste into the stains and give it about half an hour to take effect.You can also wet a clean sponge or washcloth and use it to rub in the cleaner until it thickens.Be careful not to add an excessive amount of water. The cleaner won’t be as effective if it’s too thin.

, Since porcelain has a hard, durable finish, you can scrub it safely with an abrasive implement without worrying about scratching it up. For best results, equip a pumice stone or stiff-bristled scrubbing brush. Work on the stains until they’re completely erased, then rinse the tub with clean water and let it dry before using it again.If you don’t own a dedicated scrubbing brush, you can use the rough green side of a kitchen sponge.
Never use steel wool or any similar material to scour a porcelain tub. Even though porcelain is scratch-resistant, this can be enough to cause permanent damage to the finish."

Apply a layer of petroleum jelly.,
Apply rubbing alcohol with water.,
Wipe away the mildew.,
Allow the material to dry.",How to Clean Mold from Leather1," Test the effect of the petroleum jelly on a small area that won’t be noticeable. Apply the petroleum jelly on the moldy areas creating only a thin layer. You may also use a suede cleaner but read the label of the cleaning product to ensure that it works on mold and mildew.


Nubuck can easily change colour so make sure the cleaning product you use has been tested before applying.;
, Mix equal parts rubbing alcohol and water for stronger stains. If the mold remains after you have tried using jelly or suede cleaner, add the water and rubbing alcohol mixture onto the fabric.Test the rubbing alcohol mixture on a small portion of the mold stain to ensure that it does not change the colour of the material.

, Moisten a soft cloth rag or sponge with water. Rub the jelly or suede cleaner into the material gently with the cloth rag or sponge. Do the same with the rubbing alcohol mixture for stronger mold stains.


Repeat the process as necessary but do not use force if the stain refuses to go away. You could damage the material if you aren’t careful., Set the material aside for the suede or nubuck to dry completely. Use a suede brush to restore the texture. A suede brush can be purchased online or at your local shoe store.If your material is still stained with mold, consult a professional suede cleaner."

Vacuum everything thoroughly.",How to Clean Soot Stains from Walls," Soot can irritate your lungs and cause lung disease if you inhale too much of it, so it’s important to open the windows in the room before you start working.Open windows will provide fresh air, decreasing the amount of soot you inhale.


Open windows will also help air out the room, and allow soot particles to escape outside, rather than settling on your carpets or furniture.;
, Ventilation is also important when you're cleaning soot, because it will provide a constant supply of fresh air, and circulate fresh air throughout the room. Turn on ceiling fans, set up a standing fan, and turn on any nearby vents or fans in places like the laundry room, bathroom, and kitchen., To protect your eyes, skin, and lungs from soot particles, you should wear a full array of personal protective equipment when you're cleaning soot from a wall. Safety equipment you should consider includes:Safety glasses
Rubber or latex gloves
Mask or respirator
Long-sleeved shirt
Thick apron

, As you clean soot from the walls, particles will float around the room and settle on furniture, decorations, and anything else that’s in the room. To protect your personal belongings, remove everything from the room that you can. This will also remove clutter, making it easier to move around and clean. Remove items like:Furniture
Carpets and rugs
Paintings and pictures
Plants
Drapes and curtains
Personal belongings

, Once everything is out of the room, cover the entire floor with a plastic drop sheet, canvas, or newspaper. The soot will float around on the air, so cover the whole floor, and not just the section near where you'll be cleaning. Position the drop sheet so it comes up and over the baseboards too, and tape the sheet in place so it doesn’t move around.


If there are any items left in the room, such as furniture that was too large to move, cover it with a drop sheet as well., Dry cleaning sponges are specifically designed to absorb residue, which makes them perfect for cleaning soot. Soot is easy to smear, so if you use a regular sponge, you risk pushing the soot farther into the wall and causing a permanent stain.Dry cleaning sponges are also called chemical sponges, but they don’t contain any chemicals. Instead, they're made from vulcanized rubber.
Dry cleaning sponges are available from building stores, hardware stores, cleaning supply stores, and online.

, Start at the top left edge of the soot stain. Press the sponge firmly against the wall and wipe downward in a vertical line. Then, go back to the top. Move over one section, overlapping the first stroke by an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm), and wipe again.Repeat until you get to the bottom right edge of the stain and have wiped the entire surface.
The key to cleaning soot off walls is to wipe, not scrub, because scrubbing can move the soot around and cause the stain to spread.

, After each stroke, check the sponge to see how saturated it is with soot. When the sponge becomes clogged and full of soot, flip it over and use the clean side. Repeat with all four sides until the upper layer of the sponge is clogged with soot.


Do not rinse the sponge with water to clean it, or it will become unusable for cleaning soot.

, Place the sponge on a flat surface. Hold the sponge in place with one hand, and use a utility knife, retractable razor knife, or razor blade to slice off the dirty outer layer of the sponge. Turn the sponge over and repeat until you’ve sliced off all the clogged sections.When the sponge is clean again, you can continue using it to remove soot.

, Repeat wiping the wall with the downward, vertical, and overlapping strokes until the sponge comes away clean. Once the sponge has absorbed all the soot it can, you can remove any remaining stain with a regular sponge and a degreasing cleaner.

, Once the soot is gone from the wall, you can treat the remaining stain with a degreaser, such as denatured alcohol, sugar soap, ammonia-based cleaners, trisodium phosphate, degreasing dish detergent, or a citrus cleaner. Mix your cleaning solution in a bucket:


To make a cleaning solution with sugar soap, mix 3 tablespoons of sugar soap with ½ gallon (1.9 L) of water.
To make a cleaning solution with TSP, mix ½ cup (4 ounces) of trisodium phosphate with ½ gallon (1.9 L) of water.
To make a cleaning solution with degreasing dish detergent, mix 2 tablespoons of liquid detergent with ½ gallon (1.9 L) of water.

, Soak a sponge in the solution and wring out the excess. Wipe the wall with the damp sponge to remove soot residue. As the sponge gets dirty, rinse it in the cleaning solution and wring it out again before continuing.Because the majority of the soot is gone and you're just cleaning the residue, you don’t have to use a special technique to clean the wall.

, When you’ve finished cleaning the wall with a degreaser, dump the cleaning solution, rinse the bucket, and fill it with plain water. Rinse out your sponge or grab a fresh one, dampen the sponge, and wipe away excess cleaner and soot with the wet sponge.

, When the wall is clean, use a towel or rag to dry the surface. Depending on the size of the soot stain you had to remove, you may need more than one towel. When you’ve removed as much water as you can, let the wall air dry for several hours.

, Once the wall is clean, you can remove the protective cover you had over the floor. Peel the tape from the wall or baseboards at a 45-degree angle. Starting at the edges, fold the drop sheet over on itself toward the center to avoid throwing soot everywhere.


Discard newspapers and plastic drop sheets to avoid spreading soot around.
If you used a canvas drop sheet, take it outside and bang it out to remove excess soot before laundering it.

, In case any soot did manage to settle on the contents of the room, vacuum the floors, carpets, baseboards, and furniture that was left in the room when you were cleaning the wall. Use the long nozzle attachment to vacuum.


When you vacuum, avoid pressing the vacuum directly against the surface you're cleaning, as this can push soot particles deeper into the surface. Instead, hold the nozzle about an inch (2.5 cm) from the surface as you vacuum.When the walls and floors are clean, you can return carpets, rugs, furniture, decorations, and personal items to their original places in the room.

Remove loose mold.,
Vacuum the leather.,
Soap your material.,
Wipe with diluted alcohol.,
Airing the frame (Optional.)",How to Clean Mold from Leather2," Using a brush with soft bristles, remove any loose mold from the material. Try to remove mold outdoors to avoid scattering spores of mildew within your home. Make sure to wash your brush before using if it is old., Remove mold from panels or creases with the hose of your vacuum. Dispose of the vacuum contents immediately as you don’t want the spores of the mold to spread. Remove the mold from your home as soon as possible., Make sure your leather has a finish otherwise avoid getting it wet. Finished leather means that there is a coating of pigment atop. Use a sponge to apply thick soap thuds onto the mold and use a damp cloth to wipe it away.Avoid getting leather overly wet or you might damage it.
Test whether you have stained leather by dropping a tiny amount of water on to it. If the water darkens or stains the area, do not proceed with soap or water. If the mold is near zippers, the fungi or bacteria may have moved to the inner layer of your cushion or clothing. Treat the inner layer as well or replace cushions completely.

, Dip a cloth in a mixture of 1 cup denatured or isopropyl alcohol and 4 cups water. Gently wipe your material with the cloth to remove remaining mildew. Do not soak the material. Let the leather dry thoroughly.Again, only use diluted if you are sure it is finished leather. Make sure to test a tiny portion of the leather before applying the alcohol mixture. Even if you are dealing with finished leather, the alcohol mixture can still damage it., Air out the inner portions of a furniture frame if you suspect mold has crept past the upholstery. Be sure to open the underside dust cover and call a disinfecting and fumigating service if the mold is severe.Inquire if the disinfecting service has an “ozone chamber”.

Apply a saddle soap.,
Wipe the leather clean.,
Allow the leather to dry.,
Condition the leather.",How to Clean Mold from Leather4," Saddle soap can be purchased online or at a leather goods store. Use only about a dime-sized portion on a damp sponge or cloth rag. Work the saddle soap into the cracks of the leather by creating a light lather.Test to see if you are dealing with unfinished leather by dropping a tiny amount of water on an inconspicuous spot. If the spot darkens or changes color, you are dealing with unfinished leather.
Read the label of your cleaner and test a small amount on an inconspicuous spot on the leather.

Create a source of ventilation.,
Place a dropcloth beneath the cleaning area.,
Don durable cleaning gloves.,
Wear protective face gear.,
Grab a stepladder.,
Vacuum the area.,
Wipe down with a dry towel or sponge.,
Spray the area with a grease cleaner.,
Wipe down the damaged area with a clean cloth or sponge.,
Repeat cleaning with a degreaser until the soot has gone.,
Scrape off any beading that has occurred.,
Mix water with either vinegar or a TSP solution.,
Apply vinegar or TSP liberally to the ceiling.,
Dry each section as you go.",How to Clean Smoke Off of a Ceiling," When dealing with caustic cleaning materials, you make sure you have good airflow in the room. You can accomplish this in many ways, but the most basic way to create ventilation is to open a window and turn on a fan.

If the room in question does not have a window, be sure to leave the door open and have a fan on its highest setting.;
, Soot and smoke stains can fall off of the ceiling and floor, so laying down a dropcloth will minimize cleanup. This is particularly true of walls and ceilings containing smoke damage and soot, as soot will crumble and peel away.


A dropcloth can also be used to catch dust and any stray droplets of cleaning solution that might damage the floor. Sturdy canvas dropcloth is usually best.

, Some of the cleaning materials are caustic and should not come into direct contact with your skin. Select a pair of thick cleaning gloves, avoiding thin latex medical gloves, as these can easily puncture and may actually melt or burn with certain cleaning solutions.

Most markets have cleaning gloves thick enough to get the job done. You can also check the cleaning section of your local hardware store.

, Because debris can fall from the ceiling, you should have your eyes covered by protective glasses. Depending on the amount of ventilation the room has, you can choose between a simple mask for your mouth and nose, or a heavy-duty air filter for your mouth and nose.You may also want to wear a hat of some kind to prevent items from falling into your hair and eyebrows, but it is not a safety concern.

, Use a sturdy stepladder to reach tall walls and ceilings, avoiding flimsy step stools or ladders intended for outdoor use. This will help you maintain steady balance, which will be key in scrubbing everything away., Before you begin cleaning, vacuum the wall and ceiling you intend to clean. Dust can attach itself to soot and the greasy byproduct of some smoke staining. Vacuuming the dust away will cut down on your cleaning time and the amount of rags and cleaning solution you’ll need.Vacuuming is especially important for popcorn ceilings and other uneven textures, as water and a rag will not be likely to get into all of the crevices.

, After you’ve vacuumed, remove any lingering dust with a dry towel or a sponge.There are sponges created specifically for removing soot and smoke staining. These can be found at most hardware stores.

, If the area is extremely small, you can use a degreasing dish soap to begin cleaning. On a larger area, you’ll need more strength. A solution such as TSP (tri-sodium phosphate) can cut through grease, soot, and staining quickly, making clean-up a breeze.TSP should never touch your bare skin, so be sure to wear gloves. Also be sure to use a cleaning rag or sponge you do not mind ruining, as TSP can cause bleaching and may wear down material.

, Once you’ve sprayed the area, begin wiping away the solution and soot with firm strokes. If there is a lot of soot, you may need to use several rags or sponges, and may want to stay close to running water to rinse away dirt and debris., A single pass with a degreasing agent may not do the trick, especially on large, heavily-stained areas. Continue passing over the area with a degreaser until all remnants of the staining and soot have been removed.

If the area has sustained heavy damage, you may need to increase the cleaning agent in your solution. To do so, increase in small increments.

, Cigarette smoke stains can cause yellow beading on ceilings and walls. Once the beading has hardened, it must be scraped off before the area can be cleaned properly. You can use a butterknife or a putty knife to scrape away these beads.If the beading is severe, scraping it away may cause some of the drywall to come away, as well. If this is the case, you may need to patch the ceilings before you continue.

, Once the beading has been removed, stir your vinegar or TSP solution, making enough to cover the area several times. For a small area, like a bathroom, a 1-gallon bucket should be enough. Follow the instructions listed on the cleaning agent’s container to get the optimum results., Dip your rag or sponge into the solution and gently wring out any excess. This will keep the solution from dripping onto your face. With your hands gloved, apply the cleaning solution to the area with beading.

Dip and re-wring your cloth or sponge when one side has become completely soiled.

, After you’ve finished each section, dry it with a clean towel or washcloth. This will help you get a better idea of whether or not you need to go back over each spot. When the solution is wet, the beading may appear to have been removed, but may reappear after the ceiling has dried.

If possible, use a microfiber cloth to prevent pilling or snagging on textured ceilings.

Blot the stain and allow it to dry, if necessary.,
Brush the dry stain with a suede brush.,
Rub the stain with an eraser.,
Brush the stained area again to blend out the suede.",How to Clean Stains off a Suede Purse1," If the stain isn’t already dry, you can attempt to blot up some of the liquid. Be careful to lightly dab it, soaking up the liquid rather than pressing it deeper into the suede.Once you think you’ve blotted up as much as you can, allow it to air dry. You can try other methods once it’s no longer wet.;
, You can buy these at Target, on Amazon, or even at your local pharmacy. Aside from cleaning up mishaps, a suede brush can be used regularly to help maintain the look of your suede clothing and accessories, so it’s a smart purchase. Before you do anything, you’ll need to brush the stain thoroughly with a suede brush.


You’ll be removing the top, outer layer of dirt first. Brush in one direction as you remove these bigger particles.Once you’ve gotten the surface dirt off, you’ll need to scrub with a bit more force. You can also start scrubbing in both directions to tackle the deeper, ground-in stains.
Along with removing dirt, brushing the area of the stain will help you reach the deeper stains with your next methods., You can find an eraser specifically made for suede, but a large pencil eraser will also work. Use a white eraser to clean your suede, because you risk staining your suede with a colored eraser. Don’t begin this step until you’re confident you’ve brushed out any dirt or dried pieces with the suede brush.Lightly begin to rub the stain with the eraser. After a little bit of rubbing, you should see the stain start to lift.
Continue working the eraser on the suede until the stain has been removed.

, After rubbing a spot with an eraser, it’s likely that the suede will be a little matted down and uneven. To get your purse looking as good as new, rub your suede brush all over the surface. This will “re-fluff” the suede, and no one will know you ever had a stain!"

Add three or four drops of dish soap.,
Add water.,
Shake the bottle.,
Empty the bottle.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Dry the bottle.",How to Clean the Inside of a Bottle1," If you choose rice, use raw, uncooked rice. If you choose gravel, choose a size in between sand and pea gravel. You’ll want the gravel/rice to reach all the nooks, crannies, and corners of the bottle.This method is great for irregularly-shaped bottles, as the gravel/rice will reach areas that may otherwise be hard to clean.
Ensure your gravel doesn’t have sharp edges that can scratch the inside of the bottle. If you are concerned about scratches, use rice instead.;
, Any kind of dish soap will work, and you don’t need a lot to get your bottle clean. The soap helps to remove residue from previous beverages as well as dust or dirt.If your bottle isn’t very dirty, you can omit the rice/gravel and simply use the dish soap.

, Fill the rest of the bottle, nearly the top, with water. Hot water works best for removing sticky residue., Be sure to cover the opening of the bottle with your finger or hand so the solution doesn’t spill out. Vigorously shake in every direction; back and forth as well as sideways. Swirl and rotate the soap, water, and gravel/rice around., Dump out the gravel/rice, soap, and water mixture and inspect for any missed pieces of gravel/rice. Repeat the process as needed.Don’t rinse gravel down the drain; be sure to strain it out or pour the contents of the bottle into a bucket or bowl.

, Fill the bottle with clean water and dump it out. Repeat several times. Rinse the mouth of the bottle, paying special attention to the threads, if applicable, and the outside as well. You want to be sure to remove all the gravel/rice and any traces of soap.If you are going to drink from the bottle, wash with an antibacterial soap, or use one or two drops of bleach, and rinse well before refilling.

, Air-drying is likely the easiest way to do this. Begin by setting the bottle upside down on a towel. Prop it up if need be to prevent the bottle from falling and breaking. After a few hours, turn the bottle right-side-up on the towel and allow it to fully dry."

Test the vinegar or rubbing alcohol on a small, hidden part of the purse.,
Rub the white vinegar or rubbing alcohol into the stain with a white washcloth.,
Use the suede brush to complete the process.",How to Clean Stains off a Suede Purse2," This step should only be taken if the procedure outlined in Method 1 did not work. It's important to do a test run before applying the liquid all over the stain, just in case it reacts badly with the particular suede you are working with. Examples of unnoticeable spots on your purse might be the underside of the strap, or the bottom of the purse. Dab a bit of the liquid onto the spot you've chosen, and allow it to dry. Make sure that it doesn't leave any unsightly marks.


While vinegar and rubbing alcohol both work well, they work best on different types of stains. For example, white vinegar works well on environmental stains like salt, dirt, and even food. Rubbing alcohol works best on the more ""intense"" stains, like ink., Once you know the suede doesn't have a terrible reaction to the liquid, pour it onto a white washcloth. It’s important to use a white cloth to avoid any color transfer from a colored one. While water stains suede, rubbing alcohol and white vinegar do not.You shouldn't rub violently, but rather press the cloth into the stain so that you are sure the liquid is soaking into it fully.


Once you’ve thoroughly covered the surface of the stain with either rubbing alcohol or white vinegar, let it air dry.You really won’t know how well it worked until it’s fully dry.
The vinegar can leave an odor on the suede, but that will dissipate after a bit of time.

, If necessary, you may also want to rub the stain down with the eraser as well.After the area of the stain is completely dry, brush the area so that it blends with the rest of the purse. Assess your handiwork and decide if you will try a second round!

Sprinkle the stain with cornstarch.,
Brush out the area on your purse.",How to Clean Stains off a Suede Purse3," Whether a lip gloss leaked or you got some butter on your purse at a restaurant, these greasy stains are stubborn. Cornstarch is your secret weapon. The cornstarch works by soaking the oil right out of the stain., When you’ve fully covered the stain, pat it into the suede gently. Then, let the cornstarch sit and work its magic. After at least an hour, gently shake the purse over a trashcan so the cornmeal comes off.As the cornstarch falls away, hopefully so does that pesky oil stain.

, Brushing will remove the remnants of cornstarch. It will also blend out the area so it doesn’t stand out from the rest of the purse. If everything has gone perfectly, you won’t be able to tell that there was ever a stain."

, They will be accepted by scrap recycling companies as whole assemblies.

, Iron, steel and other ferrous metals are magnetic. If they are small enough and the magnet is large enough, they can be lifted out with a magnet. Larger ferrous pieces are identified by noting that a magnet will stick to these pieces. All ferrous metals will be accepted as 1 type of item by scrap recycling companies.

, Stainless steel -- alloyed (mixed) in smelting with chromium -- has a dull shine and is heavier than chrome-/or nickel-plated steel. It may be slightly magnetic in some alloys.
Note: If ""stainless steel"" has magnetic attraction, it must be added to the iron pieces, rather than among the stainless steel pieces.

, Copper is lightweight and reddish in color. Copper may become greenish over time due to corrosion. Copper comes in 3 grades.


Gather all electrical wiring. This wiring is considered light copper. Strip, using wire strippers (burning-off insulation is illegal, see ""Warnings"" section). Discard the stripped insulation. Some metal recyclers accept wire with the insulation on, including Christmas lights, at a much lower price.
Segregate copper tubing (considered medium copper). Remove any brass fittings from the tubing. Scrap recycling companies likely will offer only the lower price of brass if the copper tubing still has brass fittings attached, because of labor of handling and removing the brass (in buildings, air conditioner piping may be copper).
Put aside copper tanks, such as special, water heater tanks. These tanks are considered heavy copper. Remove any attached insulation, covers and fittings from the tank (ordinary water heater tanks are zinc galvanized and ""glass/ceramic lined"").

, Aluminum is a lightweight metal with a dull silver color. Soda cans and lightweight lawn furniture are considered light aluminum. Remove all plastic fittings from pieces of lawn furniture. All other aluminum is considered heavy aluminum. Aluminum can be further sorted into ""clean"" and ""coated"" as some recyclers pay more for aluminum which is not painted or otherwise pre-finished.


Remove aluminum, automobile parts such as engine overhead-cam-/and valve-covers, intake manifold and thermostat housing (some bright trim may be aluminum).

, Lead is soft and heavy, and has a dull gray color. Lead is often used for piping, scuba diving weights and fishing plumbs.

, Brass is yellow. It is often used for bathroom fixtures, door knobs and as trim hardware.

, Bronze is reddish yellow. Bronze is often used for hose fittings and couplings. Remove any hose from the bronze coupling.

, The field windings (parts with copper wire wound around) should be separated out from the iron and steel for the best price (armatures are very difficult to separate and might be cut/chiseled out).

Test the pen on a hidden portion of fabric.,
Remove excess residue from the spill.,
Depress the tip of the pen to release solution.,
Rub the dispersed solution into the stain.,
Wait and reapply as necessary.,
Blot the fabric dry when finished.",How to Use a Tide to Go Pen1," Make sure the fabric of your garment will not react negatively to the solution in a Tide to Go Pen. Before using it on your food or drink stain, test it out on another small area of fabric that is not easily visible on your garment.


To use the pen for a test, take the cap off and press the tip of the pen firmly onto the area you want to test on until a small amount of solution comes out. Rub the stain with the pen tip, then wait several minutes until the solution mostly dries on the fabric to determine its effect.
The Tide to Go Pen should be safe for use on most garments labeled as a colorfast machine washable or dry cleanable item. However, some fabrics may be more susceptible to change colors or other adverse effects, so it’s important to do this test first.;
, Gently dab or wipe at a food stain that has any excess matter, like a thick sauce or crumbly food item. Take care not to spread the stain any wider than it already is while doing so.


The best way to remove this excess is typically to lay an absorbent paper towel or napkin directly onto the stain, then lift straight up. Or, scoop the excess off with a spoon or knife. Avoid rubbing or swiping at the stain, which could make it spread and worsen.
Note that the Tide to Go Pen works best on spills from food and drink, and will not perform as well or at all on stains from materials like blood, grease, ink, and grass., Uncap the pen and press the tip onto the area of fabric where your stain is located, until enough solution comes out to cover the area of your stain.


A couple of quick presses with the tip is typically sufficient to release enough of the solution. It doesn’t need to be pressed down continuously.
Press the tip straight down, rather than at an angle as if you were writing or beginning to rub the stain with the tip. The tip should actually push into the pen, allowing the solution to be released.

, After pressing the tip down to release solution, rub gently with the pen tip across the area of the stain. The microfiber cloth tip helps to absorb and pick up the stain that the solution pulls out.


Rub until you see the stain begin to lighten or disappear altogether. Make sure you are getting solution and rubbing with the tip over all areas of the stain.
Add more solution if necessary by depressing the tip again. Each part of the stained fabric should be lightly saturated with solution before rubbing.

, Wait several minutes for the fabric to dry to determine the success of the stain removal. Repeat the process of releasing the solution and rubbing with the pen tip if the stain is still very visible.


Note that the Tide to Go Pen is formulated for stains that have recently occurred and is used to pre-treat a stain quickly before it can be washed. Further laundering is expected.
After treating with the Tide to Go Pen, the stain on your garment may still appear slightly discolored, show faint residue from the solution, or have a slight odor. These will all typically be removed with further laundering.

, Blot away any excess solution once you’ve treated the stain with the Tide to Go Pen. You can also let it air dry until you can take the garment off and clean it further.


Use a dry and clean cloth, napkin, or towel to gently blot at the fabric. There may be some visible residue of the solution after it’s dry, which will go away when you wash it later
You should use a damp cloth or napkin to further remove residue of the solution if the treated area of your garment will be exposed to sunlight. This will prevent any lightening that may occur with sun exposure."

Put some baking soda and vinegar into the bottom of your flask.,
Fill the flask with hot water.,
Let the flask sit for a few minutes.,
Scrub the inside of the flask with a bottle brush.,
Pour out the mixture and rinse.",How to Clean a Vacuum Thermosflask That Has Stains at the Bottom1," Pour about half a cup (120ml) of distilled white vinegar into your stained flask. Then, shake in approximately one tablespoon (15ml) of baking soda for every cup the flask holds. The vinegar and baking soda mixture will froth up, so be sure to put the flask in the sink when you combine them.Baking soda and vinegar are excellent at killing germs and wearing down stains when acting together.It’s important to use distilled white vinegar, as it's more acidic and will result in a better cleaning. It’s also less likely to leave a lingering odor or taste in your flask, which other types of vinegar may do.;
, After the fizzing baking soda mixture has died down, fill the flask the rest of the way up with hot water. This will help loosen the dried stains from the inner surface of the flask, as well as distribute the vinegar and baking soda throughout. Leave the cap off the flask to keep the pressure from building up too much.Baking soda and vinegar are notoriously reactive. Putting the cap on the flask with both substances inside could result in a messy leak or even damage.

, Leave the flask to soak for 8-10 minutes. The baking soda solution will begin working on the worst of the discoloration while the heat of the water softens and collects the stain-causing residue. It’s as easy as that!For especially thick buildup or heavy discoloration, give the vinegar and baking soda longer to set up.

, Purchase a bottle brush in the baby aisle of your local supermarket or department store. These brushes were designed to clean out the types of bottles used to feed infants, which tend to be tall and narrow, so they’ll work perfectly for scrubbing out your flask. Use the bottle brush to scour away any stubborn spots that the baking soda mixture hasn’t already removed.A basic bottle brush only costs about $5, but it’s a very useful tool to have on hand for difficult cleaning jobs.
Be sure to run your bottle brush through the dishwasher after using it to clean a stained flask.

, Dump out the mixture so that the flask is completely empty. Rinse it repeatedly with hot water until no trace of vinegar or baking soda remains. Don’t forget to rinse around the opening of the flask. Your flask should now be clean and ready for use.Pat the body, mouth and cap of the flask dry with a clean towel, or let it sit and air dry.
Give the opening of the flask a sniff. If you can still smell vinegar, rinse it a few more times, or fill it with hot water and let it soak, until it’s odorless.

Treat the stain further if needed.,
Wash according to the care tag instructions.,
Dry the garment carefully.",How to Use a Tide to Go Pen2," Use another pre-treatment stain remover product at home if you find that the Tide to Go Pen hasn’t effectively removed the stain. Do this as soon as you are able, and before you machine wash or dry clean your garment.


Follow any instructions on your individual stain remover product, as they may vary in their application.
Consider the type of food or drink that caused the stain when you treat it further at home. A greasy stain may warrant the use of hot water, for example, while a wine stain needs cool water., Pay attention to the instructions given on care for your specific garment’s fabric and style. Wash by hand, machine, or dry cleaning as instructed.


Look for the care tag along a collar, waist, or side seam of any garment. If you no longer have one, look for the fabric content. Most common natural and synthetic fabrics like cotton or polyester can be machine washed.Delicate fabrics like silk and cashmere, and items with beaded or embroidered detail, usually require hand washing or dry cleaning.
Wash a stained garment as soon as possible for a better chance at getting it out.

, Follow the care instructions for your clothing after washing it, taking care not to apply heat from a dryer or iron until the stain is out. Hang, lay flat, or machine dry as instructed.


After washing your garment, check to see if there is a remaining stain. If there is, treat it again with a stain remover and rewash. Don’t put it in a dryer until the stain is out, otherwise the heat will set it in.You may want to alter the exact drying instructions on your garment’s care tag if you are concerned about a stubborn stain. Hang up or place an item on a towel away from sunlight, which are gentler drying options that won’t set in any existing stain with heat.

Fill your flask with ice.,
Add a few spoonfuls of salt.,
Close the lid and shake.,
Rinse out the flask.",How to Clean a Vacuum Thermosflask That Has Stains at the Bottom2," Empty out your flask if there is any liquid in it. Load the flask about a quarter of the way full with ice. It’s best if the ice is crushed or in smaller, irregularly shaped pieces, though normal cubes will also work. The exact amount of ice you use will depend on the size of your flask.The type of bagged ice you can buy at the grocery store is perfect for this task.
If you only have access to large, smooth or rounded ice cubes, you can break them up into a more effective size yourself by placing them in a plastic bag and crushing them or throwing them in a food processor.

, Sprinkle 2-3 heaping spoonfuls of salt over the ice. For the purpose of cleaning, salt of a larger grain, such as coarse-ground kosher salt or sea salt, will get the most done. Add the salt to the flask quickly so that the ice you put inside doesn’t have a chance to melt.Use an extra half tablespoon (about 7ml) of salt if its a finer grain.
Ice that melts in the flask may dissolve the salt, making it less useful for cleaning.

, Place the lid on the flask and make sure it’s secure. Shake the flask vigorously. As the hard ice and jagged salt granules move around inside the flask, they’ll scrape away whatever stains and grime have accumulate on the insulated metal. Shake for as long as you want, until you feel confident that the ice and salt have done their job.The salt and ice combination will essentially act as an “exfoliant” for the walls of the flask.
Don’t worry about damaging the metal that your flask is made of. They’re designed to withstand extreme temperatures, mild impacts from being dropped and general wear and tear.

, Take the lid off the flask and pour out the ice-salt mixture. Run some warm water into the flask and swirl it around to remove any lingering remnants. Rinse the mouth of the flask as well, and leave the lid off as it dries.Using ice and salt to wear down stains is a safe, natural solution. Both ingredients are non-toxic and don’t contain chemicals that may be harmful if ingested.

Buy a package of denture cleaning tablets.,
Fill your flask with water.,
Add one or two denture cleaning tablets.,
Let the flask sit for awhile.,
Rinse repeatedly.",How to Clean a Vacuum Thermosflask That Has Stains at the Bottom3," Run down to your local pharmacy and pick up a pack of dissolving denture cleaning tablets. Most denture tablets contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as an active ingredient, which fizzes when the tablets are added to water. They are designed to eliminate stains from artificial teeth as they soak, which means they’re perfectly safe to use for objects that you’ll be putting in or around your mouth.A pack of denture tablets will only run you a few dollars, providing many uses in cleaning your well-used flask.
The dissolving action of denture tablets also has an antibacterial effect, sterilizing the flask as they clean., Fill your empty flask to about the halfway point with warm or hot water. The higher the temperature of the water, the faster it will begin to loosen the hold of troublesome stains. Allow the flask to soak for a few minutes before moving on to the next step.Swish the water around inside the flask to make sure it’s completely wet throughout. This will help the sodium bicarbonate react on all parts of the flask’s inner surface.

, Drop a couple of denture tablets into your water-filled flask. The chemical reaction will cause the water to bubble and foam up, so it’s best to do this in the sink, outside or somewhere you don’t have to worry about making a mess. Don’t cap the flask—this will cause pressure to build up inside.A good general guideline is to use one tablet for every two cups of the flask’s volume.

, Walk away from the flask while the tablets do their thing. As they dissolve, the effervescent action will also disintegrate the buildup on the walls of the flask. Allow the flask to sit for up to half an hour, until the effect of the tablets has begun to diminish.Denture cleaning tablets are one of the safest and most effective ways to clean a dirty flask or thermos. All you have to do is wait.
Once the reaction has died down, you can go over the inside of the flask with a bottle brush for a more thorough clean.

, Pour out the water that the denture tablets dissolved in. Run fresh water in and out of the flask a few times to clear away whatever traces are left behind. While the flask is drying, keep it right-side up with the cap off. Afterwards, it will look as good as new!Putting the cap on your flask while it’s still wet will encourage bacteria to set up shop inside."

Terracotta pot with a saucer upended over it
Plastic cereal containers with easily pulled-off lid
Coffee and tea metallic containers with lids
A biscuit barrel that is no longer wanted
Specially designed kitchen scraps bins;
, Wash it regularly to keep it clean and hygienic.

, More supermarkets are now selling compost bags. These are bags that allow you to collect the compost waste inside the bag and toss the entire bag into the compost bin. The bag itself is biodegradable and breaks down in the compost bin. This neat solution takes care of spillage and provides ease of carrying from your kitchen to the compost bin. These can line the scraps bin and will save you a bit of washing time. These bags ensure that the storage of kitchen scraps is less messy and smelly on the whole. See photo above for an example.

, Sprinkle a little on now and then to keep the rotting odours at bay.

, During winter when it gets dark early and is cold, or when you work all day, it can be difficult getting to the compost bin at times. And yet, your kitchen scraps bin is probably mounting up between visits. One simple solution is to have two kitchen scrap bins and to leave one at the back door or some other non-intrusive place when it is full, and to start on the next one. When the next compost bin visit is possible, you can collect both scrap bins and carry them with you.

Consider saving it for a later project.,
Look into community paint recycling programs.,
Throw paint away if you can't recycle it.,
Recycle empty paint cans.",How to Safely Dispose of Paint1," Latex paint can be stored, mixed and reused for a later project. It won't be the exact color you need, but it's useful to use as a base paint or to paint interior surfaces that won't be seen. This way, you can use up all the paint without needing to throw it away.Tightly seal the used paint can and store it upside-down in a cool, dry storage area.
Make sure the stored paint is out of reach of children and pets.;
, If you don't have use for your leftover paint, someone else might. Look up community paint recycling programs in your area.


Waste haulers, schools, and municipalities often have programs to collect paint, mix it, and use it on community projects.

, If you don't have use for the paint and can't find a paint recycling program, dispose of the paint by placing it in a plastic container filled with kitty litter or paper scraps, letting it dry, and throwing it away with the trash. Latex paint is not considered toxic waste, so it doesn't have to be taken to a toxic waste site.


Never pour paint into a drain. It can damage your pipes and it isn't good for the water supply.
Don't pour paint into the ground. This is hazardous to the soil.
If you need to get rid of a lot of latex paint you may want to consider purchasing waste paint hardener. A cup or so of this powder mixed in with a gallon of paint will cause it to harden up within hours.

, Let the empty paint cans dry completely, then recycle them with other metals.


If you have an inch or more of dried paint left in the bottom of the can, you'll have to throw the whole can in the trash."

Sometimes trash bags come with twist ties. Using these ties makes it easy to secure the contents of the bag. Gather the entire opening of the bag, close and place the twist tie around it.;
, Check to see if there are any holes in the bag. If so, double bag it by placing the entire bag inside of an empty bag., Be sure nothing has been left behind or dropped during the transportation process.


To transport heavy items or more than one bag, either take more than one trip, ask for help, or use a dolly or wagon.

, If you live in a house and not an apartment, there are specific waste management guidelines to follow. Be sure to follow the rules for dumpster placement and pick up. You should set the trash out on time so that it does not pile up.


You can find your neighborhood’s trash pick up schedule with a quick online search. Most residents receive this information by mail from their local waste management service. It is generally provided when the trash pick up service is first scheduled.
If you place your trash in a community dumpster, replace the lid after dropping your trash bag into it. This will prevent rodents and animals from entering the dumpster.

Press down the contents of the bag.,
Remove overflowing trash.,
Remove sharp or other hazardous objects.",How to Take out the Trash3," Compress trash into the trash bag as much as you can while it is still in the trash can. This process maximizes the amount of available space so that you can place more trash into the bag.


Compacting the trash can yield cost savings because you will buy trash bags less often.
Be careful not to tear the trash bag when compressing the contents.
Do not use your hand to compress trash. This could result in injury if there are unseen sharp objects in the trash. You can use a hand held compressor instead.
Use an electronic trash compacter to reduce the volume of your trash. An electronic trash compactor can turn six bags of trash into one bag., If you are unable to compress overflowing trash, place the overflow into a new bag. If there is a lot of room left in the overflow bag, it may be best to place it into the trash can until it is full.


If you have a trash can that is not lined with a bag, place a bag over the top of the trash can, then turn the can upside down. This will allow the contents to fall into the bag. Take your time so that you do not drop trash all over the floor.

, Keep a look out for hazardous items, such as broken glass, knives, and toxic substances. These items may require special handling for disposal.Put on gloves. It is a good practice to use gloves when handling trash. This is especially true if the trash contains liquids.
Secure sharp objects so that they do not harm you or anyone else who may encounter them. For example, place broken glass in a labeled and puncture resistant container. You can use a box as the container. Place the box labeled “broken glass” in the designated trash pick up location.
Acids, pesticides, fluorescent lamps, and batteries are examples of items that must be recycled. These items should not go in the trash. You can contact your local waste management company for questions about toxic substances."

You may want to put rags on the bottom of your cabinet as protection; in case the disposal drops this will protect your cabinet floor from damage.

, Remove the mounting assembly by first loosening the three mounting screws that hold the upper and lower rings apart. Remove the ring that is in a groove on the sink sleeve and then remove the sink sleeve, flange and fiber gasket.









Clean out any remaining sealing gaskets, plumber's putty, or debris from the sink opening.
If you are replacing your disposal with the same disposal then you can leave the mounting assembly.

, This will install a new sink drain and connect the drain to the waste pipes, allowing wastewater to drain directly from the sink into the drainpipes.

, Use a pipe wrench to loosen and remove the nut securing the drain flange. Then you can push the sink drain up through the sink for removal.

, Scrape the putty off using the putty knife. If the putty is very hard and difficult to remove then you should use a razor to remove the excess. After cleaning off the chunks of putty use a scrubbing pad and water to scrub the area clean.


If the putty is too difficult to remove, use rubbing alcohol or spirits to remove the putty.

, The rope should be long enough to go around the circumference of the drain. Place it on the underside lip of the drain and then set the drain into the sink opening. Press the drain down firmly and wipe away excess putty.








, The drain will come with a washer when it is purchased. Move to the underside of the drain and place the washer over the threads and secure with the large nut that comes with your drain. Tighten the nut as securely as possible using tongue-and-groove pliers.


It may help to have someone hold the drain from the top so it does not move around.
Remove excess putty after securing the drain.

, This will connect the drain to the elbow pipe. It should be long enough that it is at the same level of the pipe it needs to be connected to. Hand-tighten the tailpiece to the sink drain to secure the piece.

, Attach the pieces together to create the bend in the pipe directing towards the adjacent sink.

, Use the connector pipe to connect the elbow piece to the T-fitting on the adjacent sink. The connector piece might need to be cut down to the correct length depending on your sink. Use the nuts and washers provided with your pipes to secure the pieces together using the tongue-and-groove pliers., If you are installing a garbage disposal of the same brand then you could keep the mounting bracket on the sink drain rather than removing it.

, The rubber seal will usually come with your new disposal. You can simply wrap it around the flange and then put the drain flange in the drain hole.


You will need to use putty if your disposal does not include a rubber seal.

, Use another of the provided seals on the drain flange on the underside of the sink. Attach the metal backup ring flat side up by pushing over the underside of the drain flange underneath the sink.








, First loosely attach the mounting ring with three screws. Then secure the mounting ring with the snap ring, which snaps into place. Finally tighten the three screws, making sure the assembly is tight and even.









The mounting bracket is now attached and ready for the new garbage disposal.

, Turn the disposal upside down and shake it to remove anything inside. Remove the electrical plate and pull the wires away from the disposal. Screw the strain relief sleeve into place and feed the electrical wires through it into the disposal.


If you are connecting the disposal to a dishwasher, then you must remove the knock out plug using a hammer and screwdriver.

, On many disposals you will connect the ground wire to the green screw on the disposal, and then splice the white wires to white wires and black to black. Secure the connections with wire nuts and tighten the strain relief sleeve. Replace the cover plate on the disposal.

, Lift up the disposal and push it into the mounting bracket. Then turn the locking ring until all three housing pins catch. Tighten the locking ring as far as possible, using slip-joint pliers to finish tightening. You should hear the pins snap into place.








, You will attach a 90-degree disposal drainpipe to the disposal and the tailpiece to the other sink drain. There should be p-traps on both the disposal and the tailpiece from the other sink and they should be level to one another. Use straight pipes and a T-fitting to connect both drains into one line and route the drainpipes into the main drain.


Dry fit the pieces together at first.
Connect the pipes using PVC glue on both the outside of the pipe and inside of the fitting. PVC glue will melt the material a little to give a strong weld.

, If you are running the drain from a dishwasher through the disposal then you must connect the pipe to the disposal at the spot where you knocked out a plug previously.

, Turn on the sink and let water run through the pipes for several minutes to make sure nothing is leaking. This can prevent many problems in the future with leaks so make sure you test your pipes., Flip the circuit switch back on at the electrical service panel to power up the disposal. If all works correctly then the installation is finished.








, Check to see that your garbage disposal actually needs to be replaced. If the disposal is not making a humming noise then the problem may simply be electrical and can be checked.


If it makes a humming sound but does not work, then it may be stuck or need the sub-breaker reset.

, While this may seem obvious, make sure that your disposal is plugged in properly.

, This resets the garbage disposal and will pop out if it has reset. It will make a click as it goes back in.

, Check to see that the circuit breaker has not tripped and turned off in the electrical service panel or breaker box. All the switches should be fully on at the fuse box.

, If nothing else has worked then either there is a faulty switch or a faulty garbage disposal. Replace the switch to test if that is the problem by first turning off the circuit breaker at the service panel. Then replace the switch and turn power back on at the service panel.


If none of these steps is effective, then the disposal will have to be replaced.

Don't leave it too late.,
Dispose of the of the carcass.,
Deal with a non apparent dead animal issue.,
Locate all your foundation vents and make sure all the vent screens are still there.,
Go into the crawl space and find that stinky critter.,
Properly clean, remove, and replace material that was in contact with the animal.,
Then you have solved the problem and should seal any holes that lead into your house to prevent future problems.

",How to Remove a Dead Animal from Under Your House," The first step for dealing with a dead animal underneath your house is when you first notice something you should looking into it! Although this sounds like a ""duh"" point many people will wait too long. There are two main ways that people first become aware of this problem: Smelling the odor or actually seeing the animal.;
, If you can see the animal, then it is pretty self explanatory that you should use proper gloves to put it in a garbage bag and properly dispose of it according to your local area regulations.

, If all you notice is an odor, many people will not choose to do anything about it right away. This is where the problem escalates very, very quickly. The longer the animal is left under your house the stronger the odor will become due to the bacteria and rotting carcass. This will also make the clean up much more difficult


Is there a bad smell? You need to investigate. Many times it might be just garbage or a rotten piece of food, but it is worth looking into.

, If one is missing then there is a great chance an animal is causing that smell.

, Obviously a best way to locate the dead animal is to use your nose to follow the odor. But many times they crawl up in to your insulation that makes this a lot harder, without tearing down all the insulation. There are two things to look for before pulling down some insulation; first you should look for a saggy spot that is lower that everywhere else. Second is to look and listen for flies because they will lead you too the dead animal most likely.

, Basic solution for cleaning is bleach and water, but there are many great commercial cleaning solutions out there.

Know when to use a dumpster.,
Decide whether you want self-service or someone else to clear it all for you.,
Ask if the bins are ""driveway-friendly"".,
Think about size needed.,
Let your neighbors know.,
Find out what protection is provided by the dumpster company.,
Know what you can and cannot put into a bin.,
Get a permit if you want to place your bin on the street.,
Fill the dumpster properly and don't overfill it.",How to Order a Dumpster," A dumpster is important when you have garbage and disposable items that are in amounts greater than what your municipality will collect with the regular pick-up rounds. Dumpsters are also ideal for fast removal of garbage when you've little time, such as when moving quickly. Dumpsters can be useful when:


Renovating
Shifting house
Downsizing
Cleaning
Doing large garden clean-ups;
, Self-service will be a case of having the dumpster dropped off and collected once full, whereas if you get a dumpster with helpers, they will also clean away your garbage into the dumpster.

, Make sure that they can be placed in your neighborhood without taking up excessive room or blocking others entrance and exit ways.

, The dumpster should fit the amount of waste you have to dispose of. In general, bin sizes are:


15 cubic yards ( 12 x 8 x 4)
20 cubic yards (14 x 8 x 5)
40 cubic yards ( 20 long x 8 wide x 8 high)

, It's not nice having a dumpster turn up without warning, especially if it impinges on your neighbor's parking space or egress.

, Ask if they use bin pads and additional protectors to prevent pavement damage.

, Virtually everything can go in a bin, except, of course, hazardous material. Also, certain materials like soil and concrete cannot be mixed in with regular garbage. It is important in the latter case to order bins that exclusively hold either soil or concrete — just talk to to your dumpster provider first.

, For that, just call up your local municipality, or check their website.

, Your garbage needs to be level with the top of the container, so don't let anything stick out of the top — the dumpster company can't transport it otherwise.

Locate your garbage disposal's operating manual, if you can.,
Find the hex wrench that came with the disposal.,
Turn off the garbage disposal using the circuit breaker.,
Hold a flashlight above the garbage disposal.,
Remove the drain cover, or rubber catch, if possible.

,
Stick a hex wrench or wooden spoon handle into the disposal.,
Turn on the power once you believe the disposal is unclogged.,
Turn on the water.",How to Fix a Garbage Disposal1," It can instruct you on recommended garbage disposal repairs and give you a diagram of the disposal before you take anything apart.;
, This tool is usually kept near the disposal for small repairs.


A hex wrench is a small, thin metal tool. It has 6 sides and it tightens the mounting bolts on the disposal. It is often referred to as a hex key and is used for bike repairs and furniture construction.

, Occasionally, wall switches are not properly connected, so there should be no chance that power can get to the impellers.

, Attempt to see down the disposal and find the cause of the clog.

,, Rock it from side to side between the impellers to try to loosen any caught food.


If you find some hard object, such as a bone, try to grasp it with tongs and pull it up. It is preferable to forcing it down the hoses.

,


If you believe it is still clogged, leave the power off. You will need to go underneath the sink and remove the hoses that attach to the disposal. You can clear the impellers with the hex wrench from below.

, Turn on the disposal. See if the disposal appears to be running better.

Look in the area underneath your sink.,
Try to catch the liquid.,
Run your hand across the garbage disposal seal on the sink, drain pipe and/or dishwasher intake.,
Try to tighten the mounting bolts around the seal.,
Purchase a new seal, when you have determined the area it is leaking from.,
Replace the seal.",How to Fix a Garbage Disposal2," If it is wet, you have a problem with the hoses and/or seals.

, The color and contents will tell you where the leak is coming from.


If the liquid is brown and discolored, then the leak is probably coming from a dishwasher intake or drain pipe.
If the liquid is clear, it is most likely a leak from the sink.

, You may be able to feel where water is dripping.

, This may solve your problem without requiring further repair. Turn on the water to see if the leak continues.

,


You may need to shut off the water source, take apart the hose and remove the seal. Take the seal to a hardware store to make sure you get the right item.

, Tighten the mounting bolts and try the disposal again.

Remove clogs.,
Soak the garbage disposal in soapy water.,
Scrub the visible parts of the appliance.,
Scrub the inside of the unit.,
Flush the appliance with cold water.,
Use baking soda and vinegar to get rid of smells.,
Use vinegar cubes in the garbage disposal.,
Freshen up with lemon peels.,
Don’t put fibrous foods in the disposal.,
Avoid putting starchy or expandable foods in the disposal.,
Cut larger items into smaller pieces.,
Run water every time you use the appliance.,
Don’t use hot water.,
Clean the blades regularly with hard materials.",How to Get a Bad Smell out of a Garbage Disposal," When your garbage disposal starts to smell, there's a chance that there's a clog in the unit somewhere that’s causing the bad odor. In order to get rid of the odor, you must first remove the clog. When cleaning the disposal, never stick your hand into the drain, even if the appliance is turned off. To remove clogs:Unplug the garbage disposal
Shine a flashlight into the drain to see if you can locate any large clogs, stuck food, or other blockages
Use tongs, long tweezers, or pliers to remove the blockage
Plug the appliance back in
Turn on the water, turn on the disposal, and run the disposal for a minute
Turn off the disposal, followed by the water;
, Because the disposal is always processing and draining, it can be difficult to give it a good soaking and cleaning. This means food particles can get trapped in the disposal, and they’ll start to smell eventually. To soak the disposal for a thorough cleaning:Put a plug in the garbage disposal drain
Fill the sink with at least 4 inches (10 cm) of water
Add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of liquid dish soap
Swish the water around to create suds
Unplug the drain
Turn on the garbage disposal and let it process the soapy water
Turn off the disposal when the water has drained out

, Once you’ve soaked the garbage disposal housing and loosened any food particles that might be trapped, you can scrub the disposal to dislodge any crumbs that are still stuck. To scrub the visible parts of the appliance:Rinse a dish wand or scrub brush with water
Pour a liberal amount of liquid dish soap onto the brush
Scrub the accessible parts of the garbage disposal, including the rim in the sink basin and the inside of the drain

, Put at least 10 ice cubes into the basin where the garbage disposal is. Cover the ice cubes with ½ cup (96 g) of coarse salt. Turn on a slow stream of water, turn on the disposal, and push the ice cubes and salt toward the drain. Run the disposal until the ice cubes and salt are gone.


The ice cubes will help dislodge any stuck-on food particles, and the salt will scrub the impeller blades and remove possible odor sources., To flush out any leftover debris or remnants, turn the cold water on full blast and direct the stream into the garbage disposal drain. Turn on the garbage disposal and let it and the water run for one to two minutes.Always turn the water on before running the disposal, and turn the disposal off before shutting off the water.

, Baking soda is a great odor absorber and vinegar is a wonderful cleaner. Best of all, the two are safe to use in your garbage disposal. To clean, disinfect, and deodorize the garbage disposal with these two ingredients:Pour 2 cups (440 g) of baking soda into the garbage disposal drain
Slowly pour in ½ cup (11 ml) of vinegar
Let the cleaner sit for an hour
After an hour, turn on the water and the disposal and run it for a minute

, You can combine the cleaning power of vinegar and the scrubbing power of ice cubes to clean and deodorize your garbage disposal. Fill an empty ice cube tray with vinegar. Place the tray in the freezer and let the cubes freeze overnight.In the morning, remove the vinegar cubes from the tray and pour them into the disposal drain
Turn on a low stream of water, turn on the disposal, and let it run until the cubes are gone

, Citrus peels contain powerful cleaners, and they make everything smell great. To make your garbage disposal smell like fresh lemons, juice a lemon and reserve the juice for another use. Cut up the peel into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Turn on the water, turn on the disposal, and feed the lemon peels into the disposal a few at a time.


You can use any citrus peel for cleaning and deodorizing your disposal, including orange, lime, or grapefruit., One of the keys to preventing odors in your garbage disposal is making sure you don’t put in the wrong foods. The wrong foods can clog the disposal, jam the motor, clog the drains, and leave rotting and smelly food stuck in the drain.


Fibrous foods to avoid include banana peels, artichoke, celery, onion skin, and corn husks., Foods that contain a lot of starch or that expand when wet are also a bad idea in the garbage disposal, because they can get thick and sticky and gum up the impeller. Foods of this nature to avoid include:Potatoes
Rice
Bread
Pasta

, Large chunks of food can clog the disposal and get stuck in the drain, and this can lead to bad food smells coming from the drain. To deal with large pieces of food, cut them into smaller 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes before feeding them into the disposal.


Similarly, putting too much food into the disposal at once can also cause problems, so only add food in small quantities., The garbage disposal needs a steady stream of water to process food properly, and you should never run the disposal unless you're running the water too. When you're processing food, run a strong stream of cold water with it.


Always turn the water on before you run the disposal, keep the water running as long as the disposal is on, and run the water for at least five seconds after you turn the disposal off.If you don’t run the water long enough, food can get caught in the disposal, can dry onto the blades and housing, and can cause bad odors.

, When you use hot water to run the garbage disposal, the heat can liquefy any grease or fat that’s in the disposal or the drain. The problem here is that once the grease cools farther down the pipes, it will congeal on the walls of the pipes and cause clogs.As the grease ages, it will start to smell, and if food gets stuck in the drain because of the grease, it will also cause bad odors.
Because grease can accumulate on pipe walls and cause blockages, you shouldn’t put grease into the garbage disposal.

, Another important thing to remember when you want to prevent garbage disposal smells is to keep the blades clean. You can do this by running hard materials through the disposal every few days at least. Good hard materials that can clean the blades include:Egg shells
Chicken bones
Small fruit pits, such as cherry pits
Fish bones
Ice cubes

Determine if the impellers in your garbage disposal aren't turning.,
Go underneath the sink to access the disposal.,
Find the hex holes.,
Remove any debris that is stuck in the disposal's flywheel.

,
Loosen the lock nut on the flywheel and remove it, if you believe the problem is caused by the impeller blades.

,
Remove all the hose fittings that are connected to the disposal flywheel and impellers.

,
Remove debris in the impellers, if that is the cause of the problem.

,
Sharpen impellers in place or by removing them.,
Read the instruction manual.",How to Fix a Garbage Disposal3," If this is the case, and you have checked for garbage disposal clogs, the cause may be the flywheel.


Leaking from the bottom of the disposal may also be a problem with the flywheel. In this case the flywheel seal needs to be replaced. Follow the instructions in the method above to replace it.
Do not test your garbage disposal for longer than 10 seconds, if the wheels aren't turning. A caught flywheel can burn out the motor in the disposal.

, Make sure power is completely off.

, Use your hex wrench to loosen the flywheel at the bottom of the disposal.

,,,,, This can help to avoid future clogs, if food debris was the cause of your problem.

, If it says that blades cannot be sharpened, or if you cannot find the cause of the problem, you may need to send for a new flywheel assembly.

Know when your garbage collection day is.,
Have bags handy.,
Get the old, full bag out of the container.,
Replace the bag.,
Repeat these steps on any other garbage's you may have in your house.

,
Take all these bags out to a master can, such as a large can.

,
Take the trash out to the curb.,
Put a new bag in your can(s) if necessary.",How to Empty a Trash Bin," Change your garbage's and get it all to the curb the day before. This will prevent damage to the bags/cans from weather, animals, and anything else that might rip, topple, or destroy the garbage.;
, You can buy garbage bags from a store specifically fitted for almost any size trash container. Find the brand and size you like. Usual sizes include tall, short, kitchen, or can varieties.

, If the bag has drawstrings, handles, or anything else to grab onto, pull gently on them, as to not spill any of the contents over the sides. If the bag won't come out, pull with a little more force, or hold down the bin so that it's not off the floor.

, Open it by unfolding it, then open the top. Catch air in the bag by waving it around, which will open it the rest of the way. Slide in the bag, and fold the top of the sides over the lid of the bin to hold it in place. Replace any covering you may have on top of the bin.

,,, If your master bin(s) use a bag, remove it using the steps above. Carry it or the whole can itself to the curb.

, If you took out the whole can, remember to put it back to wherever you store it (garage, shed, outside, etc.) after the garbage collectors are gone.

Hang towel bars with S-hooks for pans.,
Switch from a knife block to a magnetic knife strip.,
Install a pegboard for storing small utensils.,
Make a mason jar display.",How to Use Your Walls for Storage1," Buy a basic towel bar and metal S-hooks at a hardware or big-box store. Follow the towel bar instructions to attach it to a kitchen wall with available space. Hang the S-hooks from the bar. Hang pots and pans from the S-hooks.The benefit here is that you’ll free up cabinet space and the cookware is easier to reach.
It’s best to screw the towel bar into wall studs whenever possible. Since cookware weighs more than a towel, you’ll need the extra support.;
, Buy a sturdy magnetic knife strip from a department store or hardware store. Hang it on the wall over the counter where you are most likely to use the knives.The benefit of this is that by moving the knives to the wall, you free up the counter space that the knife block was using.
It also saves a bit of time grabbing a knife from the wall rather than from the knife block.

, Go to the hardware store and buy a rectangular piece of pegboard, as well as some hooks that are designed for pegboard use. Pegboards come in many sizes, so choose what suits your wall space best. Hang cooking utensils or other kitchen items for quick access.You’ll also need a minimum of four screws to secure the board to the wall at the corners.

, Buy a ½ inch (1.3cm) wooden plank, some mason jars, screws, and circular pipe clamps. Use screws to attach the pipe clamps to the board. Slide the mason jars into the ring clamps and tighten the clamps. Hang the board on the wall over your counter.Use the jars to store utensils, spices, change, batteries, toothpicks or almost anything that fits in the jars.
Be sure to screw the board into wall studs so it’s secure.

Attach wooden crates or wire baskets to the walls.,
Hang spice racks in children’s bedrooms.,
Make a hanging shelf with rope and a wooden plank.",How to Use Your Walls for Storage2," Use old milk crates, wooden boxes, or wire baskets to add wall storage to any room. Hang them open side up like a regular container, or hang them open side out as a shelf. Secure the boxes to the wall by screwing them into studs or using curved wall hooks.This is a versatile option because it works with any type of basket, box, or crate. The material of the basket will determine what hanging method works best.
For wooden crates, screwing them into studs is a good option. Wire baskets can be hung from hooks.

, Spice racks are not only for the kitchen. They provide storage for toys, books, school papers, and more. Buy three or four wooden spice racks and attach them in a vertical row to your child’s wall. Try to screw the racks into studs whenever possible.If you want to get more creative, paint each rack a different color. Then use a stencil to paint words. Designate one rack for each child, or a rack for books, one for toys, and one for odds and ends.

, Buy a board that’s about ½ inch thick (1.3 cm) and two to three feet long. Drill one hole in each end of the wider part of the board. Feed a piece of rope through each hole, knotting it under the board. Screw hook screws into wall studs and tie the rope around the hooks.The shelf can be as long you want, but may require more rope and hooks for a longer shelf.
Always use caution when using power tools.

Lean a wooden ladder against the wall behind a door.,
Nail suction cup hooks to the entryway wall for shoe storage.,
Hang cork boards around the house.",How to Use Your Walls for Storage3," Choose a ladder with plank steps as opposed to rungs. Push the ladder up to the wall, keeping it far enough away from the door for the door to open. Use two small L brackets screwed to the wall and the sides of the ladder to keep it in place.The planks of the ladder function as shelves.
Use the ladder to store shoes, car keys, mail, or other things that pile up on flat surfaces.

, At the store, buy suction cups with hooks. Nail them to the wall near your front door, about one foot off of the ground. Use these to hang shoes that clutter the floor of the doorway.This is great as an organizational tool because it gets the shoes up off of the floor.
The basic setup can be moved to any room of the house as a way for extra storage. Nail the hooks higher up on the wall for things other than shoes.

, Go to a craft store or any big-box store and buy some cork boards or cork panels. Nail them by the front door to leave messages, in the kitchen for receipts or reminders, or in the laundry room for the laundry schedule. Stick extra tacks in the cork for new additions.The benefit of cork boards is that it’s easy to take things down and pin new things up. They work great for collecting the various scraps of paper that always accumulate around the house.

Remove the bottom rack to expose the salt reservoir.,
Unscrew the cap and check for water.,
Use only dishwasher salt in your softener unit.,
Pour salt into the funnel until the reservoir is full.,
Clean excess salt with a wet cloth.,
Screw the cap on tightly.,
Replace the bottom rack and run the dishwasher normally.",How to Use Dishwasher Salt1," Pull the bottom rack out completely and set it on your kitchen counter. You may need to lift it up slightly to unclip it from its rollers. Your reservoir will be on the bottom of the dishwasher, probably off to one side. If you don’t see a reservoir, your dishwasher may not have a built-in water softener., Water softener units have caps that need to be tightly secured after each use. Unscrew this cap and set it to the side. If this is the first time you’re using your unit, it needs to be filled with water. Pour enough in to fill it to the top of the opening.After the first time you use it, your softener unit should always have a bit of water in it. You won’t need to refill it.

, You can find specially made dishwasher salt at grocery stores, hardware stores, or online. It doesn’t matter which brand of you choose, but you cannot use table salt, sea salt, or kosher salt as a replacement for dishwasher salt. These cooking salts contain additives that might actually increase the hardness of your water. They may also be too fine, which could clog the unit., Different dishwashers will have differently sized units that take various amounts of salt, so there’s no precise measurement for this process. Pour salt into the unit until it’s completely filled up. Since you also have water in the unit, you’re creating a saltwater brine that will refresh the chemical processes that occur in the built-in softener.Using a funnel to pour your salt will help you avoid spills. Hold the funnel above the reservoir instead of plunging it into the unit. If the funnel gets wet, the salt won’t pour through it properly.

, If you’ve spilled any salt in the dishwasher around the unit, wipe it up with a wet cloth. The salt you pour in the softener unit never actually touches your dishes, as it just stays in the unit itself. If you leave loose salt in the dishwasher, however, it will get mixed in with the water that cleans your dishes. This won’t hurt them, but it may give you slightly dirty (or salty) dishes for one cycle.You can also run a rinse cycle without dishes to clean any spilled salt out of the dishwasher.

, Replace the cap securely and check to make sure it’s tight. If the cap gets loose during a cycle and detergent gets into the unit, it could break. You certainly don’t want to pay for a new dishwasher just because your cap wasn’t tight enough!, Once you’ve checked your cap, you can put the bottom rack back into the dishwasher. Fill your dishwasher with dishes and run it like you always do. There’s no need for an empty rinse or clean cycle after you refill the salt."
"
Use salt only in dishwashers that have built-in softener units.,
Check your dishwasher’s salt indicator.,
Top off the reservoir at least once per month.,
Top off the reservoir if your dishes appear overly streaky.",How to Use Dishwasher Salt2," If you are unsure whether your dishwasher has a built-in unit, contact your manufacturer. If you can’t find it on the bottom of the dishwasher, you probably don’t have one. Don’t put dishwasher salt into other spots marked for normal detergent or dishwasher cleaner. This could easily break your appliance.

Most dishwashers in the United States do not have built-in softener units that need to be filled with salt. Only select models come with this feature., The easiest way to know if your dishwasher needs more salt is for it to tell you that it’s ready for a refill! Many dishwashers have an indicator light either on the top panel of the dishwasher and/or on the unit itself. If your lights are green, they’re good to go. If your indicator lights are red (or, on the unit itself, clear), then you’re ready to pour in more salt., If your dishwasher doesn’t have indicator lights, it’s up you to make your own schedule. It’s a good idea to refill the salt about once per month in dishwashers that contain built-in units. Even if you have indicator lights, you may want to do a refill if it’s been over a month.If you notice that your indicator lights are taking more than a month to tell you to refill the unit, they may be broken. Check your unit levels, and call your manufacturer if you’re concerned.

, Monitor your dishes to keep an eye on the water softness. If your water is getting too hard, you’ll start getting streaky dishes that look like they have a white film on them. This will be especially obvious on clear glasses. Top off the reservoir with salt to restore that pretty sparkle to your wine glasses!"

",How to Re Organize a Garage on a Budget3,",, For example: cardboard can be used to protect a wood finish from scaring. This allows quickly constructed shelves to be stacked on top of a stored desk. Or, a stored washer and dryer pair can be stacked with the dryer on top, once you build a 2""x6"" frame to support the dryer above the washer control panel. This also makes a nice storage space between the two. Remember to secure the dryer to the wall to make sure it cannot fall on anyone!

,, This may be particularly useful for those who are both gardeners and dog owners, for instance.

,,, Your best storage ideas will defeat gravity in some way. Here are some examples:

, (Upper wood strip is ""2 X 4"" and lower wood strip is ""1 X 4"". This provides clearance between the upper and lower layers),

,,,,, All of these were constructed from scrap or $3 lumber save the chest of drawers which was $14.

,, I found that interior house paint stores well under a work table. An oilcloth tablecloth drapes down to hide the paint containers and a shop vac. I mounted a drill press on that same wipeable oil-cloth covered table - just bolted right through the cloth.

Select a sturdy and good quality coat hanger.,
Choose a hanging spot.,
Place the reading material on the coat hanger.,
Hang in place.",How to Use a Coat Hanger for Storing Reading Material," Wooden coat hangers of substance are ideal, as are very strong plastic molded ones. Avoid skinny wire ones as they will likely bend out of shape and may damage the reading material.


Think of the decoration as well. Where you intend hanging the coat hanger will determine the suitability of the hanger choice––the more obvious the hanging location, the more elegant the hanger should look.;
, For example, you might read the paper or magazines in the kitchen, so finding a suitable hanging spot there will make sense, such as off a drawer knob or a cupboard handle near the kitchen table. It should be strong enough to hold the reading material.


The bedroom is another place where this might work well, such as

, Simply slide the magazine or newspaper onto the hanger so that it hangs down each side evenly. Check that it is balanced properly before leaving it in place.

, It will be easy to find the day's newspaper or most recent magazines for continued reading.


Replace reading materials frequently to keep up-to-date.

Begin by sorting and purging.,
Donate gently used items.,
Schedule a garage sale.,
Change your daily routine.,
Grab something to be put away as you leave a room.,
Recruit the whole family for help.",How to Organize Your House," Before you can even think about how you are going to organize your house, you have to get rid of all the stuff you have accumulated over the year that is just taking up space. Go through each room in your house and throw out what you know is trash.;
, Now that you have gotten rid of the trash, you can better see what is left in each room and what items can find purpose in someone else's home. Even if you can't use toddler toys or baby pajamas anymore, it doesn't mean that other families can't benefit from your donations.

, For bigger items and ones that still hold their monetary value, a garage sale is a great way to reorganize your house. If you have small furniture or a crib that you are not going to use anymore, sell them and use the proceeds toward something fun or another home improvement project.

, Spending up to 10 minutes a day organizing a small area of your house as you go about your everyday chores will save you stress and aggravation. Since you spent all of that time sorting and purging, you don't ever want your house to get so disorganized again that you have to devote hours to repeating the task.

, Getting into the habit of taking items with you before you go to bed or take a shower leaves less to pick up later. You won't even realize that you are about to reorganize your house and your new routine won't seem like work.

, You didn't make the mess alone; you shouldn't have to organize it alone. Assign everyone a specific job or room for which they are responsible, and set up a schedule for them to follow in the days and weeks ahead for cleaning and organizing those rooms.

"
"
Sort your items.,
Think critically about ‘keep’ items.,
Find good uses for non-keep items.",How to Organize Your Home1," Go through every room in your home and sort items by what you will do with them: keep, donate, or throw away. Keep items should be things you need and cannot part with, throw away items should be those which are completely useless to everyone, and donate items are those which you can’t use but someone else would benefit from.;
, Sometimes we feel like we need something but we really don’t. These are the types of items which usually make homes cluttered and leave little space for the things we do need. Once you’re done with the initial keep-donate-trash sweep, make a second sweep through your keep items and think about the last time you used them and if you actually need them.

, For the items that you will trash or donate, consider the best uses for those items. Certain types of donated items will do the most good if donated to particular organizations (old furniture to Goodwill, toys to the Salvation Army, clothes to refugee organizations, etc). Make sure that items you designate trash really are trash. Tattered clothing should not be donated but low-quality though functional and intact kitchen equipment could really help someone out.

Once everything has been stacked back in neatly, examine the ""After"" effect and congratulate yourself for finishing the job.

,
Keep up with your tidying.",How to Organize Small Spaces," It might be your wardrobe, office, kitchen, craft room etc.;
, Look at it in its cluttered form and ask yourself if there is anything you can get rid of, recycle, donate to a charity etc that would mean less items to look after.

, Place all items into a large box.

, Wipe it down, dust, etc. until it's dust-free and clean.

, Decide if you might need to get new storage furniture or boxes or do any maintenance work like painting.

, Consider what you want to add back into this small space and what needs to live elsewhere or be recycled. Try to at least halve what is being returned, or even more.

, For true hoarders, it's painful to get rid of old things.

, These make it easier to keep a small space orderly, as well as making it easier to retrieve things especially where the space is cramped. Try to get boxes that you can stack easily.

,,,, What comes out of the box goes back into the box and the box goes back on the shelf.

Designate a storage space for each type of toy.,
Swap out a toy box for individual bins.,
Buy furniture with built-in storage features.,
Label boxes and bins.,
Locate toys efficiently.",How to Organize Toys1," If toys are taking over your home, split up storage space by toy type. Split up your child's bedroom, or your living room, into different sections. Each section can house a different type of toy.In a child's bedroom, separate corners of each room for different toy types. You can, for example, keep stuffed animals in one corner. In the closet, one half can be dedicated to action figures while the other can store plastic animal toys.
You can use decorative storage baskets and bins in common areas of your home. For example, you could keep your kid's lego collection in an attractive basket that matches the color scheme of your living room.;
, One big toy box can present a problem. Toy boxes tend to get messy easily, as they don't have separate storage compartments. Your child will also easily make a mess digging through a toy box.Instead of a toy box, make a run to a local department store. Buy a variety of bins, boxes, and baskets in a variety of shapes and sizes.
You can store toys by type instead of storing multiple toys in one bin. For extra organization, look for bins divided into sections. If you're storing something like action figures, they can be divided by type in different sections of a single bin.

, When selecting furniture, look for items that come with storage features. Look for stools and bookshelves with drawers and bins built in. Many children's beds come with drawers built into the bottom. Every time you need a new piece of furniture, see this as an opportunity to further organize your child's toys., Once you've separated the toys into different sections and bins, label them. You don't want to be scrambling to find your child's G.I. Joes because you forgot whether you put them in the red or green bin. Labels can also help young children remember what goes where when cleaning up.If you have very young children, use visual labels. Print out a picture of the type of toy stored in that bin and tape it on.
You can also color coordinate the boxes if your child is very young.

, When arranging toys in your home, make a point of storing similar toys together. For example, put dolls near the tea set. Place train sets near an open floor space. Keep paint and other supplies in the kitchen, near the sink.

"
"
Dress properly for the occasion.,
Take everything out of the garage and separate it into three piles: things to keep, things to throw away and things to sell or donate.,
Take all of the items you want to keep and separate them into categories.,
Label the front and side of each bin as to the contents.,
Clean your empty garage thoroughly.,
Determine the room needed for the car.,
Place all of the bins in the garage along one wall.,
Trash or donate what you will not use.",How to Start Organizing Your Garage," Wear old clothes and comfortable shoes. It is a dirty job so be prepared. Wear long pants to protect you legs. If your garage is prone to insects such as spiders, consider wearing gloves. It is also hard work so get help! Make it a family affair. Or offer to buy pizza if friends are coming to visit. Play music that everyone likes to lighten the atmosphere.;
, For anyone who has a hard time parting with things use this rule: if you haven’t used it in the last year, get rid of it. Throw away anything that is broken. If you haven’t fixed it, toss it. Make sure to also dispose of things properly. If you have old paint, cleaners, motor oil or other substances, contact the city to see where to take it.

, My categories were: tools, holiday decorations, luggage, cleaning supplies, camping equipment and miscellaneous. Buy large bins to store these items. Bins can be found at Home Improvement stores or discount stores. Make sure to buy large bins with tight closing lids. This will prevent insects from getting into the contents inside.

, For example, four of my bins are labeled “Christmas Decorations”. Another boxes are labeled “Camping Supplies”.

, Sweep the floor and hose it out. Remove any cobwebs and wipe down the walls. If the studs are exposed, clean off the cross bars of any excess dust or dirt.

, The most important goal is usually the ability to park car in the garage. Determine how much room is needed and that includes when the car door was opened. You also want to have adequate walking room to get any appliances there. Two feet is a good distance.

, Have them facing so the labels can be read easily. Group them together so all bins relating to each other are together. Pile them as high as you can so that you can easily get to them. With other items that don’t fit into the bins, group them together and place them where it makes sense. If possible buy hooks for large garden tools such as rakes, for sporting equipment such as bikes and other unwieldy items.

, Throw away all items that you separated into the trash pile. Do not second guess yourself. If it has been sitting in your garage for several years for you to “someday get around to fix it”, toss it. That one item is taking up valuable space. With all other useful items, have a garage sale or donate everything to a worthy charity such as Salvation Army.

"
"
Sort items by function.,
Sort items by room and location.,
Consider multiple purpose items.",How to Organize Your Home2," Go through all of your keep items and decide what their primary function is. Like items should be grouped together so that you can decide how best to store them. They may be able to nest inside each other or otherwise be stored together efficiently. If they don’t really have a function, you may want to consider putting them in the donate pile.

, Once your items are sorted by function, separate and organize them by what room is appropriate for them to go in. Think about their function and locate them where they can be efficiently reached and used. Though items may share a similar function, they may need to be split up if one serves its purpose better elsewhere.


For example, kitchen supplies should be kept in the area of the kitchen where they can be easily accessed when necessary. Items which are not used often can be stored up and out of the way, like infrequently used appliances (such as ice cream makers) or fancy or overly large dishes.

, Consider items which serve multiple purposes and find a place to store them where both can be served without hindering the other. In some cases, you have multiples of that item, you can split them up between locations but this may not always be possible.


An example of such an item may be small towels, which may be necessary to both the bathroom and the kitchen.

"
"
Have a home for every item.,
Store items efficiently.,
Create storage systems.,
Think about using wasted space.",How to Organize Your Home3," Items left lying around will make your home look cluttered and unorganized so be sure to have a home set aside for every item. A good practice is to stand in a room and pick up every visible item and ask yourself if that is where that item should be at all times. If it’s not, find a place for it to go.


You will especially want a set home for items like your keys, phone and wallet. Keep a set spot for them near the door and develop a habit of always putting them in that spot. Doing this will keep you from constantly misplacing your items.

, Store items in a way which minimizes the amount of space they take while maximising how much use you can get out of them. With items organized efficiently, your home will have more space and look less cluttered.


Small items in a ‘junk’ drawer can be sorted into labeled used Altoids tins, for example (to keep them from getting mixed up and wandering everywhere).
Tension rods can be placed in a tupperware drawer to hold back and separate lids.
Place metal sheets on the inside of cupboards so that you can use that space to store recipe clippings, instead of attaching them to your fridge.
Organize necklaces on coat hooks, earrings in ice cube trays, and purses on hangers.
Put stock cooking ingredients (like sugar and flour) into tins or mason jars, to make them stackable and easier to store. Put spices into metal spice tins and store them on the side of your fridge.
Use a filing cabinet to store laundry supplies and a shoe organizer on the inside of cabinet doors to store kitchen cleaning supplies.

, For items of which you have multiples or large numbers, you will want to instigate a system of organization to help you find the individual items when needed. This will also help you use less space to store them to begin with, allowing for more storage space.


Get a filing cabinet or filing boxes for files and papers. This is especially important for crucial documents like tax papers, birth certificates, and other sensitive information which you may need to find in a hurry or do not want to get lost.
Have a set system for your clothes. You will have to devise a system which works best for you, but be sure you have a clear way of organizing both clean and dirty clothes. Dirty clothes can be separated by color into different baskets. Clean clothes should be hung neatly when needed and otherwise stored in drawers or baskets. Take a cue from frequent fliers and roll your clothes when storing them in drawers to minimize wrinkles and maximize storage space.

, Think about spaces which go unused and how they may be turned into good storage space. Finding ways to use the extra space in your home will maximize your organizational options.


A cubby space between a fridge and a wall could be home to a pull-out shelving unit for small items like cans and jars.
An awkward spot in a hallway could be home to a small bookshelf and used for various items.
The space under your bed can be used to store off-season bedding and large coats and sweaters (using boxes, bags, or roll-out storage).

"
"
Consider each new item you buy.,
Put things where they go.,
Make ‘giving away’ a regular habit.",How to Organize Your Home4," Staying organized is about developing better habits. One good habit to develop is analyzing each new item you buy or otherwise acquire. Don’t build up a whole bunch of things you don’t need. This will make your home cluttered and disorganized all over again. Remember for that each item you acquire, you will have to find a home for it.

, Get in the habit of always putting things away when you are done using them. Don’t tell yourself you’ll get it later or that maybe someone else will need to use it: just put it away. This habit will go the furthest in ensuring that your home stays organized.

, Always have a bag or box in your house which is a designated ‘donate’ location. Put items in there that you find you don’t use anymore and try to put one or two items in every time you acquire a new item.

Donate toys you no longer use.,
Store items in shoe trees.,
Get rid of the original boxes and bins.,
Use a storage ottoman.,
Keep some toys out of circulation.,
Use a swing for stuffed animals.",How to Organize Toys2," Children lose interest in toys after awhile. While your child may have loved their Mr. Potato Head for years, they may have grown out of it with time. Periodically do a sweep of your home. Identify any toys that are no longer used.Box up unwanted toys. Swing by a local thrift store and offer them as a donation.
You can encourage your children to join in on the process. Point out the positives about donating toys, such as helping a child in need.
You can also do something like provide your child with one box. Tell them they can keep everything that fits in the single box, and must discard everything else.
When cleaning, always take a mental note of which toys need to be put away often and which toys you do not frequently see. This can help you decide what to keep and what to donate.

, You can buy a plastic shoe tree at most department stores. If you don't want too many boxes and baskets cluttering your floor, store certain toys in the tree. A shoe tree is a particularly good place to store plastic figurines, as these may scratch or break if stored in a box or basket., Toy boxes and bins are usually bigger than necessary due to excess packaging. Toss the original baskets and bins and instead store toys in compartments in your home.If you know how a toy works, you can also throw out instruction manuals. If you ever need to refer to them again, many instructions manuals can be found online.

, An ottoman in a common area, such as a living room, can easily be used for storage space. You can place toys in the ottoman to free up space in your home.Do not just throw toys in the ottoman, however. Stick to basic organization. Divide toys into small boxes you can comfortably fit in the ottoman.

, Toys your child does not play with often, for example, can be stored in a closet. There's no need to have a toy that's not used a lot kept easily accessible. If your child wants a toy that's in storage, you can take it out upon their request.

, You can buy a cute swing for stuffed animals online or purchase one at a local department store. Instead of placing stuffed animals on the ground, you can position them in the swing. In addition to freeing up floor space, this creates a cute decoration for your child's room.If your child is very young, make sure to keep the swing near the ground. You want your child to be able to reach their toys.

Clean every 24 hours.,
Do not allow your kids to take out new toys until old ones are put away.,
Break down cleanup into small steps.,
Try to make cleanup fun.",How to Organize Toys3," Make a rule to clean up every day. If you let a mess go on too long, your organizational structure will fall apart fast. Designate a certain time every 24 hours to clean.Select a time and be firm about it. For example, have your kids clean up every night half an hour after dinner.
In addition to putting away toys, target other messes. Throw away things like napkins, wrappers, and other junk that's been left around the house.

, This rule will assure that your home does not become messy during the day. Before a child removes a new toy, make sure they have put the old one back in its proper place. This will keep your organizational structure intact and make cleanup easier.Be gentle when reminding your children of this rule. Do not yell, but say something like, ""Hey, are your Legos away? You need to put them away before you take out your dolls.""
Acknowledge you hear your child's complaints instead of scolding or dismissing them. This makes your child more likely to cooperate. Say something like, ""I know you think putting away your stuffed animals will take forever, but it will make things so much easier later.""

, If there's a big mess, take it one step at a time. Focus on one type of toy first. For example, have your kids pick up all the stuffed animals, then all the all the actions figures, and so on. This will make cleaning up the mess feel more manageable., If your children dislike cleaning up, strive to make it feel like less of a chore. You can play upbeat music during clean up or turn it into a game.Try a competition if you have multiple children. You can have them try to see who can clean up the most toys in 3 minutes.
If you only have one child, you can have them see how many toys they can put away in three minutes. Then, have them try to break that record.

If not, top off as needed, according to the manufacturer’s instructions., Your snowblower’s manufacturer will recommend a specific fuel type/grade. You’ll want to have plenty of fuel before you begin. Make sure it's fresh, especially if you haven't fired up your snowblower in a while.Drain your gas if your snowblower has sat longer than a month with ethanol fuel in it. Ethanol fuel can deteriorate over time, and bad fuel can cause engine problems., For safety reasons, you’ll want all drive controls set to “off” before starting your snowblower. Keeping your snowblower in neutral will prevent unintended activity once the machine starts., However, if you used your snowblower very recently (within five minutes), set the choke to the warm start setting, or about halfway., Turn it to the “fast” setting. Many models will identify this with a rabbit symbol. You should always start your snowblower on this setting., Your snowblower will have a fuel shutoff valve. To start using your snow blower, you will have to turn this to the “on” position. If you are unsure of the valve’s location, check the manual.Always make sure to turn the fuel shutoff valve back to “off” when you are done with your snowblower. This will reduce the risk that fuel will leak.

, Usually, this control is a simple up/down switch, much like a light switch. Turn it to the “on” or “run” position., Some snow blowers include a key as a safety feature. These models won’t run unless the key is inserted.If you need to quickly stop your snow blower while operating it, just remove the key.

, This is a bubble-like switch that helps circulate fuel. Pushing it a few times should be enough. Try twice if the temperature is above 15 degrees Fahrenheit (-9 Celsius), or four times if the temperature is below this.Don’t push the primer for a warm start (if you used the snowblower less than five minutes prior to starting again).

, Grasp the starter rope by its handle. Pull slowly until you feel it “catch” some resistance. Then quickly and smoothly pull upward to start the engine., If your model has an electric starter, take the three-pronged cord and plug the other end into an outlet. The outlet must be the same voltage as your snow blower.Read your model’s instruction manual if you are unsure of the voltage level.

, Push the button in short cycles of only five seconds until the engine fires and stays running. Overtaxing the starter can damage it.Disconnect from the power source once your snowblower is running.

, Let your snowblower run for a few minutes to warm up. Then, turn the choke to the “off” or “run” setting. Your snowblower is now ready to use."

Move rarely used appliances to a cabinet.,
Use the top of the refrigerator for more storage.,
Trade your knife block for a magnetic knife strip.,
Install a towel bar or a rack on the side of the countertop.",How to Organize Your Kitchen Counter1," Your counter may store the food processor, waffle iron, and mixing bowl, but it is unlikely that you use these items daily. Clear out some cabinet or pantry space for these large countertop appliances. Leave them in storage except for when you are using them. Put them back as soon as you finish with them.If you don’t have much cabinet space, you may have to get more creative. Put some things in a hall closet or even a bedroom closet, if you know you don’t use them often.;
, If the top of your refrigerator is not covered by cabinets, it’s a great place for extra storage. Use it for items that you use often but not daily. Store small appliances that don’t fit in the cabinets or your spice rack that’s only for fancy dinners on top of the fridge.The size of your fridge limits how easy it is to store things on top of it. For tall fridges, store things you only rarely need because you can pull a footstool up to it when necessary.
Store items like soda or juices on top of the fridge so you can easily restock when you run out.
If you are tall enough to reach, move your microwave to the top of the fridge to free up a big section of your counter.

, A nice big set of knives is often displayed with a knife block, but this takes up valuable counter space, too. Install a magnetic knife strip over the section of counter where you most often use the knives.The wall strip uses space that is otherwise wasted. It also clears up another small section of your counter.

, A visible end of the countertop is a rarely used part of the counter, but it gives you many options. A towel rack with S-hooks can hang up pots and pans or utensils. A small wooden rack can store spices, oven mitts, or extra stuff that ends up on the counter.If you screw a bar or rack into the side of the counter or cabinets, be sure the screws go into a sturdy part of the cabinet.

For a more eco-friendly method, you can add washing soda crystals to the water instead of bleach., Let the brush soak in the bleach for at least one hour. It could take up to four hours, so allow it extra time if needed.If you notice that the brush isn’t clean after one hour, you could add more bleach or more crystals. Do not mix in more than an additional half cup (four ounces) of either.

, Once clean, remove the brush from the bucket and rinse it under hot water. Replace your toilet brush in its holder. Your brush should be cleaned at least once each month."

Pick up a simple cake stand and place all of the dishwashing supplies on it.Look for a cheap cake stand at a thrift store.

, If you keep your flour, sugar, salt, oatmeal, or various other baking items on the counter, a set of storage jars will keep them organized. You have almost unlimited options, from glass jars to plastic rectangular canisters.Look for a set of stacking containers to keep this stuff even more condensed.
It’s also a good time to think about whether you need to keep that stuff on the counter. You may use it less than you think you do, so move it to the cabinets.

, Your counter may be the place you store various food preparation items. Honey, olive oil, soy sauce, or corn syrup can all make your counter sticky. Store these on a tray so the mess stays contained. A tray also makes for easier cleaning than a whole section of counter.Set this tray on whatever part of the counter you are most likely to prepare foods that would need these items.

, Grab an old coffee can or an elegant ceramic container. Fill it with spoons, spatulas, whisks, or any other utensils. If you use these items daily, keeping them on the counter makes it easier to access them. The container won’t take up much space and is great for organizing., You may store pieces of fruit, small bags of chips, candy, or other snacks on the counter. These take up a lot of space. Put a tiered basket on the counter to gather the assorted snack foods into one place.If a wire basket doesn’t fit your decor, opt for a two-level rack for ceramic trays or glass bowls.

Clean the counter off each night.",How to Organize Your Kitchen Counter3," Your kitchen counter will become cluttered if you do not put things away after using them. Make a rule in the kitchen that everything gets put away after it’s used.For example, if you pour cereal, put it back in the cabinet. If you pull out three spatulas to find the right one, put them back in the draw. Make a rule that nothing gets left on the counter when it already has a designated spot.

, The kitchen counter may also be a catch-all for junk mail, kids’ homework, car keys, and electronics. Clear these items off of the counter and move them where they need to go. Make a rule that if it isn’t used in the kitchen, it doesn’t get set on the counter.It also helps to have a basket designated for this type of stuff, so that it is at least corralled into one spot.

, Counters become cluttered little by little. Avoid ending up with a pile on the counter by clearing it off each night. Removing one day’s worth of dishes and other assorted items is easier than cleaning off a week’s worth. Remove everything and put it where it needs to be. Then give the counter a quick wipe with a wet rag."

Call your waste disposal company to find a recycling site.,
Look for a recycling program in your area.,
Call BestBuy to get rid of your old TV.,
Return the used television to the manufacturer.",How to Dispose of Television Sets1," Most states have laws preventing you from leaving TVs and other electronics outside for trash pickup. Some individual companies also have rules against this type of disposal. However, most waste companies give paying customers the option of dropping off old TVs at a site for recycling.Depending on the company, you may need to show a driver's license or utility bill to gain access to the site.
Most of these centers accept TVs and other items, such as cameras, small appliances, cell phones, CD players, and photocopiers.;
, Many cities and towns have pick-up or drop-off options for electronics and other large items. They may give you one day per month to take your TV to a specific spot in town. Some cities may even pick up your old (extremely heavy) TVs from your home.


Go to your town or county’s website to look for this information.

, In the United States, BestBuy is the only major retailer that picks up and recycles old TVs. They charge a fee for this service, and they limit you to getting rid of two TVs per family per day.Unfortunately, BestBuy doesn’t accept all TVs, especially if they’re super big. Call the store to see if your TV qualifies.
You can also drop the TV off at the store to avoid paying BestBuy’s “haul-away fee.” If you buy a new TV from them, this fee is pretty minimal. For non-customers, it’s about $100.

, Some manufacturers will accept your old television set and recycle it themselves. Contact the manufacturer to see if your TV qualifies for this service. You may even get a little money back in return for your old TV!Usually, you’ll need to find the nearest drop-off site by looking online or talking to a representative on the phone. Be sure to follow the company’s guidelines for proper recycling.

Keep mineral spirits in the original container after you are done using them.,
Leave the mineral spirits alone in their sealed container for months at a time.,
Remove the lid, pour off the clear mineral spirits into a thick, new waste-safe container.,
Use mineral spirits to thin oil paints.,
Call a local construction co-op, art school or lifelong learning center to inquire about donating extra mineral spirits.",How to Dispose of Mineral Spirits1," Seal the lid as tightly as possible. Place them away from any areas with open flames.


Mineral spirits ignite at 105 to 145 °F (41 to 63 °C).;
, Mineral spirits do not “go bad,” so it is not necessary to dispose of them after you use them as paint solvent. Allow the mineral spirits to settle, letting the paint sink to the bottom.


The best thing to do with mineral spirits is to buy low quantities and reuse them for decades. They evaporate very slowly., Label them immediately for reuse. Pour the remaining paint at the bottom into cat litter.Follow the next method to dispose of the paint and kitty litter properly.
You can buy containers that can safely store solvents at art supply stores, hardware stores and on the Internet. Not all plastic containers are acceptable for use, because the solvent may wear down and break the plastic over time.

, This solvent can be retained for use with oil-based house paint or art paints. Add small quantities until the paint reaches the consistency of your choice.


Add more medium to your paint, if you feel you may have added too much solvent. Overly diluted paint may not bind to the canvas. However, using more paint medium will reverse the effect.

, You can extend the life of the spirits if you must get rid of them.

Buy a paper shredder.,
Investigate document destruction services.,
Shred the paper using a shredder.,
Shred the paper by hand.,
Recycle the shredded material.",How to Dispose of Paper1," Paper shredders come in a variety of shapes, sizes and qualities. In general, the most effective shredders are usually those with the higher price tags. These also tend to be able to shred a higher volume of paper more efficiently. Which shredder you choose entirely depends on your needs. Any office supply store will carry a range of shredders for both home and office use.If you are shredding large amounts of paper, get the best shredder that you can afford. Low priced shredders tend to only allow you to shred one or two documents at a time, feeding them in slowly by hand. If you have a lot of paper to shred, this could take a very long time.
If you are shredding documents with highly private or sensitive information, don’t opt for the cheapest shredder solution. A mid-priced home or office shredder is your best bet. This is because the cheaper the shredder, the less effective the shredding mechanism actually is. It may shred in fairly large strips; you’d want to get something higher quality to destroy your sensitive documents.;
, If you don’t want to invest in a shredder, or if the amount you have to shred is very large, there are companies that specialize in document disposal.The cost is relatively low, and it’s common for these businesses to allow you to watch your documents being shredded, for your own peace of mind.


Do a quick Google search for your local document destruction agencies – in most cities, you’ll have multiple options and a range of prices and services. Choose what suits your situation best.
In many cases, document disposal agencies will come to you and shred on-site. This is an especially popular choice for small businesses and those in a corporate setting.
If you are disposing of paper on a regular basis, document destruction agencies offer regularly scheduled services.
Most of these companies will provide you with a Certificate of Destruction after each service, providing you with even more peace of mind.
If privacy protection is your main motivation for disposing of paper, don’t forget to consider any old hard drives you might have in your home or office. Many of these companies also offer destruction services for a variety of media.

, Follow the instruction manual carefully. Shredders can jam up very easily if you try to pass through too many documents at once.


Check the volume your shredder can handle. Smaller machines can only shred around 5 documents at one time. Bigger machines can handle a lot more. Be sure not to exceed your machine’s shredding capacity.
Also check your machine’s manual for items that shouldn’t be shredded. Some of the smaller home machines will jam if you try to shred an envelope with a plastic window. Other machines can easily shred plastic windows, staples, paper clips and even credit cards.If you do exceed capacity or shred the wrong item and end up with a paper jam, all standard machines are equipped with a reverse mode that allows you to remove the jam easily.
After you are finished with your shredding, don’t forget to turn the machine off. Leaving it on for excessive amounts of time can overheat its motor.
Shredders need to be oiled on a regular basis to keep them working optimally.Many machines provide a small bottle of this when you purchase it. If yours didn’t, you can easily pick this up at any office supply store.
To oil the machine, drizzle a small amount of the lubricant through the machine’s feed opening and run your shredder in reverse mode for about 60 seconds. Then switch it back to normal mode and pass a few papers through to absorb any excess oil.

, You probably only want to do this if you have a relatively small amount of paper to dispose of, as this method can be rather time-consuming. It’s generally not a recommended way to dispose of documents that contain sensitive information. If you do choose this method, make sure you do tear the paper into very small pieces.


Tear the paper into six to eight vertical strips. Then take those strips and tear them into pieces no larger than one inch. Anything larger will be a security risk.
After you complete your task, store the paper in a bag somewhere safe, such as a locked closet or office, until you can recycle it.

, After paper is shredded, it is still viable for recycling and there is no security risk in doing this.If the amount of shredded material will fit into your home recycling bin, its fine to put it in there. If you have a large volume of shredded material, it’s better to take it to a recycling agency yourself.

If your TV isn’t working at all, you may be able to sell or donate it to a local theater or school to use as a prop in their plays.

, Your easiest option is to hand off your old TV to someone you know. They’ll likely help you move it or pick it up themselves, and they’ll be excited to have a TV to enjoy for years to come., If the TV still works well, donate it! Someone else will surely appreciate it, and it’s actually better for the environment to reuse electronics for as long as they last than to recycle them.Check with local community centers, schools, homeless shelters, churches, and nursing homes to see if any of these spots could use the TV. They could also have programs for delivering TVs to families in need of one.
National agencies such as Salvation Army and Goodwill have programs for taking in and re-selling old electronics and TVs.

, Lots of big retailers, including Amazon, BestBuy, and Target, will buy back TVs and other electronics. Look on the stores’ websites to see if your TV qualifies for buyback. You can also sell your TV yourself by advertising it on eBay or Craigslist.Craigslist will be easier than eBay. Shipping the TV once you’ve sold it on eBay could be pretty difficult, while Craigslist customers almost always pick up their own purchases.

, If you’re already having a big garage sale, put your TV out on your lawn! Especially if your TV is older, set the price low. Remember, the goal is to get rid of it."

Find transportation to drop off your TV if there’s no pick-up option.,
Enlist some friends to get some extra muscle.,
Stand close to the TV to get ready to pick it up.,
Bend your knees to lift the item safely.,
Get a grip on the bottom corners of the TV.,
Straighten your legs to lift the TV.",How to Dispose of Television Sets3," The hardest part of getting rid of your old TV is getting it in a truck and lugging it around town. Since most recycling centers and manufacturers make you drop off your own item, you’ll need a big vehicle.

If you have your own pick-up truck, the TV will likely fit in the bed. If you only have a tiny sedan, ask around to see if a friend has a larger vehicle you can borrow for a day. As a last resort, you may need to rent a truck.

, Offer a friend or two some pizza in return for helping you move your old TV. You’ll need the extra hands. Once the job is done, you can relax in front of your new TV!, Don’t stand more than 1 foot (0.30 m) from the old TV. Your legs should be shoulder-width apart. This is a nice strong stance that’ll help you stay balanced as you lift the heavy item., You should never bend over from the waist to lift heavy items. Squat down, keeping your back straight. This will allow you to lift with your legs and avoid straining your back muscles., Lift up one side of the TV at a time. Slip your fingers safely under the lifted sides. If you’re working in a team, be sure to communicate with one another.Make one person the spotter by positioning them in front of the TV to steady it as you lift each side.

, All the weight should be in your legs. If you feel a strain in your back, put the TV back down and reposition yourself. Once you’ve got it lifted, either walk the TV to the truck or move it to a wheeled dolly.Wheeled dollies will make moving the TV from spot to spot much easier. If you’re working without a dolly, you can also use an old blanket to slide the TV across surfaces.
The spotter should continue to steady the TV once you transfer to it a dolly or start walking by keeping a hand on the center of the item.

Extract usable paint thinner.,
Let the rest dry.,
Wrap dry thinner and put in trash.,
Throw away empty paint thinner containers.",How to Dispose of Paint Thinner1," Rags soaked in paint thinner may combust in air, causing a serious fire. Place them in a metal container with a tight lid, fill with water, and bring it to a hazardous waste collection site.If you do not have a watertight container, spread the rags out on a non-flammable surface in a ventilated area. Weigh them down with no bunching or overlap. Supervise them until they are dry. Seal in a fireproof container.;
, There's no need to throw out paint thinner after one use. After soaking tools or brushes, leave the paint thinner to sit in a sealed, labeled glass container. Over time, the paint and other contaminants will settle to the bottom. This can take anywhere from a couple days to several months depending on how dirty the paint thinner is.

, Once the dirt has settled to the bottom, pour the clean top layer through coffee filters into a clean glass jar.Leave some space at the top of the new jar, seal tightly, and label it.Always wear heavy rubber or nitrile gloves when handling paint thinner., Leave the container open and let dry in a well-ventilated area. Add cat litter, sawdust, or sand to speed up drying.Keep this container out of the reach of pets and children, and away from heat, flame, and flammable materials.


If there is more than 1 cup (240 mL) of material left, use the method below instead.
Bring it straight to a hazardous waste facility instead if the solvent contains a halogenated chemical (anything with ""fluor-,"" ""chlor-,"" ""brom-,"" or ""iod-"" in the name).These chemicals are not commonly used in paint thinners, but can be found in related solvents such as paint strippers and degreasers.

, Once the material is solid and completely dry, wrap the paint thinner in newspaper, then seal in a plastic bag. You can now throw it away in the household trash.


Many waste collection services will accept this, but there's a chance yours requires you to bring this to a hazardous waste site. You can call yours to confirm., You can use the regular household trash if there is less than one inch (2.5 cm) of residue inside the container, and it has dried completely.Do not put them in the recycling.If there is still liquid inside, or a large amount of dried residue, take the container to a hazardous waste collection site.

Choose a place to burn the paper.,
Burn the paper.,
Sift through the debris and then discard.",How to Dispose of Paper2," Do not burn papers in your wastepaper basket inside. This can easily get out of control and catch other things alight, leading to a serious house fire. Before burning outside, make sure you are allowed to burn paper in your city, county, or township.


If you have one on hand, you can burn the paper in a metal barrel.
If you have a home with a yard, you can burn your documents by digging a hole in the ground. If you choose this method, be sure to take precautionary fire measures.
If you have a lot of documents, then a bonfire will work well.
If you have a manageable stack, then use your barbecue grill.
You can also purchase items which compact shredded paper into fire logs.

, Take every precaution possible to prevent fire risks. If burning in a metal barrel, do it in an open area on a surface such as concrete, to avoid catching the container or anything not in the bin on fire. Make sure that all the documents burn completely. If they haven’t, repeat the process until they do.


Choose a non-windy day to burn outside.
Always stay with a fire while it’s in progress. Never walk away from it.
Don't burn paper that has plastic coating, magazines, colored paper, wrapping paper, or newspaper inserts. The ink used to print these materials contain metals that give off toxic fumes when burned.It is safe to burn documents on plain, uncoated printer paper, junk mail, envelopes (without plastic windows), and plain newspapers (with inserts removed).
Allow the burn location to cool completely before doing anything additionally.

, This is just to make doubly sure that all of the documents were burned completely.Make sure the fire has burned out completely before discarding the ashes.

Determine what is compostable.,
Shred or otherwise break down the paper.,
Compost the paper.",How to Dispose of Paper3," Newspapers and non-glossy paper make excellent compost material, especially in compost bins that have lots of kitchen type scraps. There are a few things to watch out for, but overall this is a great way to bulk up your compost.


Most ink is non-toxic these days, so don’t worry about that.The types of paper you should avoid using in your compost are: glossy/waxy paper, magazine paper, fluorescent colored papers, paper with metallic inks and colored construction paper.

, Composting with paper works best when shredded material is used because it breaks down more easily. Shredded material is also easier to mix into your compost pile.

, Stir it down into the compost heap so that it doesn’t get blown around by the wind.The dry material helps soak up the water content from the kitchen scraps and help oxygenate the pile.


If your compost heap contains kitchen scraps and yard trimmings, the shredded paper helps to bulk up the volume of soil. This means that once the composting process is complete, you will end up with more finished compost to go around.
Paper is almost completely carbon. A healthy compost thrives on a ratio of 25 parts carbon to 1 part nitrogen, so using shredded paper in your compost heap provides an excellent source of the carbon needed for a successful composting process.
Since a lot of paper equates to a lot of carbon, be sure to balance it with plenty of nitrogen (green stuff) and keep the compost damp.
Shredded paper may be used as bedding for worm composting, as well, if it's not glossy. Be sure to keep it moist.

Check your local yellow pages or search online for ""Hazardous waste cleanup,"" ""environmental engineers,"" or ""engineering services"" in your area that you could hire.If the mercury was spilled outdoors, phone our local, state, or national environmental response team. In the United States, call 1-800-424-8802., Wear rubber, nitrile, latex, or vinyl gloves whenever handling mercury.Wear old clothes and shoes, as you may need to throw them away afterward. Because mercury can react with metals, remove all jewelry and piercings, especially gold.If you do not have a spare pair of disposable shoes, put your shoes in sturdy plastic bags and fix them to your ankle with rubber bands.
If you have safety goggles, put them on.This is not vital for cleaning up mercury spills smaller than a pea, but a large spill may require professional-quality eye protection.

, This is not necessary for small home spills, but if you do find a mercury cleanup kit at a hardware store, the powdered sulfur will make the task easier. This yellow powder turns brown in contact with mercury, making detection of small spills easier, and binds with the mercury to make cleanup easier., Begin by carefully picking up pieces of broken glass or other small objects that have come into contact with mercury. Place these in a disposable puncture-proof container such as a sharps container or glass jar.


If no disposable puncture-proof container is available, instead place a zip-locked bag inside a second zip-locked bag, and fold all broken material inside a paper towel before placing in the bag.
Leave tiny specks of broken glass alone for now. We'll handle them later.

, If the mercury has spilled onto an absorbent surface, you cannot save this material on your own. A trained professional may be able to help, but if you are cleaning up the spill at home, all you can do is cut out the affected area and discard it in a double trash bag.


Never wash this material, as it can contaminate your washing machine or pollute the water or sewage system., Use index cards, small pieces of cardboard, or a disposable squeegee to slide beads of mercury along hard surfaces, pooling them into one location.


To locate more mercury, dim the lights and hold a flashlight low to the floor, looking for glints.Mercury can scatter quite far, so check the entire room.

, Use an eyedropper to pick up the beads of mercury. Slowly squeeze each bead onto damp paper towel, fold the paper towel, and place it inside a zip-locked bag., Small beads of mercury or tiny pieces of broken glass can be picked up with sticky tape. Wrap the sticky tape around your gloves finger, with the sticky side out, then pick up the contaminants and place the tap inside a zip-locked bag.Alternatively, dab shaving cream onto a disposable paint brush and use the brush to pick up the mercury.Place the paint brush in the bag along with the mercury. Do not apply shaving cream directly to a mercury-contaminated brush.

, This includes shoes that walked over the contaminated area, clothing that mercury dripped on to, and any tools that came into contact with mercury.

, If possible, leave windows to the outside open for 24 hours after cleanup. Keep children and pets outside of the contaminated room during this time. In the meantime, continue to the next section for information on getting rid of your contaminated materials.

, Tightly seal all containers used for mercury disposal. Clearly label them as ""Mercury Waste Disposal — Do Not Open.""

, Many household products contain mercury. While these are typically harmless unless the product breaks, these still need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, not in the regular trash. Visit epa.gov/mercury/mgmt_options.html for a long list of these products, or refer to this abbreviated list of common household mercury-containing items:


Compact Fluorescent Light bulbs (CFL)
Liquid Crystal Display monitors (LCD) on television or computer screens
Button batteries in toys or phones (but not lithium button batteries)
Any object containing a silver liquid.

, Visit search.earth911.com and enter the type of object you are recycling, and your city or zip code. A list of nearby addresses should appear that can recycle your mercury waste.


Earth911 provides best results for United States addressed, but some international cities are included.

, Some companies will take back their products for recycling. These include Lowes, Home Depot, and IKEA., If you cannot find a nearby recycling center, search online for an ""environmental regulation office"" or ""environmental health department"" in your area that can inform you about legal disposal requirements. If you have a large amount of mercury to dispose of, you may be required to dispose of it through a professional or government cleanup service.

Look up your local hazardous waste collection site.,
Call you local disposal companies.,
Use collection days to have unused kerosene picked up.,
Take your unused kerosene to a service station that accepts unwanted fuel.,
Contact your local fire department or local government if you cannot find a hazardous waste collection site.,
Use up all of your kerosene.,
Read the instructions on your kerosene bottle.,
Donate excess kerosene to neighbors or local charities who may need it.,
Make sure to store your kerosene in a safe container labeled for kerosene or flammable liquid.,
Store your kerosene in a safe place.,
Keep kerosene for one to three months.,
Don't throw your kerosene away – no matter how old it is.",How to Dispose of Kerosene Safely," If you decide that you want to dispose of your kerosene, you'll need to find a household hazardous waste collection site sponsored by your local waste district. Look in the yellow pages or online to find the one nearest to you., First, ask them if they accept kerosene. If they do, ask if you'll need to drop your kerosene off or if they'll come pick it up from you house.If necessary, make an appointment for them to pick up your kerosene or for you to drop it off.
Ask them if there is a disposal fee. There is sometimes a disposal fee for toxic waste, so it's good to know beforehand.

, Taking advantage of community waste collection days is a great way to manage hazardous household waste without harming the environment. Collection days are typically sponsored by a local government agency. Go online to look up your community waste collection day to find out the date, drop off location, and the materials that the program will accept., Most service stations (gas stations) accept used or unwanted motor oil, but some may also accept kerosene. If you find a station that does accept kerosene, make sure you deliver it in a properly marked container so that it does not get confused for any other type of gasoline or oil.It's best to call service stations in advance to see if they accept kerosene.

, They will be able to point you in the right direction to safely dispose of your kerosene. Some fire stations may even accept your unwanted kerosene., When you use all of a product, there will not be any hazardous waste left over. For this reason, don't buy a gallon of kerosene when you know you won't be using the whole bottle. Large containers may seem more cost-efficient, but you'll have leftover kerosene to deal with. Then, you'll have to properly dispose of the leftover kerosene so as not to harm people or the environment., Kerosene is used to supply light for kerosene lamps, and is sometimes used for cooking gas in portable stoves. Reading the instructions when using a stove or lamp that burns kerosene will help you purchase the right amount of kerosene, so as not to waste any.


Reading the instructions will also give you details tips on how and where to store your kerosene., If you accidentally buy too much kerosene, ask your friends, neighbors, or local charity if they need any. It's best to put the kerosene to use before it goes bad and has to be disposed of., Kerosene containers must also be provided with an approved label, as required by federal and state authorities. Storing kerosene in anything other than an approved container is strictly prohibited for safety reasons., Since kerosene is a flammable liquid, it should be stored at room temperature and away from potential heat sources like the sun, hot water heaters, space heaters, furnaces, or ignition sources. This safety precaution will help keep you and your family safe in case of a spill., Storing kerosene for longer than three months can be dangerous, as the old fuel can break down and cause the growth of bacteria or mold. Ideally, you should buy high-quality kerosene in small quantities and store it in its original certified container. If you change the container of the kerosene, it might get mistaken for another substance – which could be dangerous.If you have kerosene left over after a few months, it's best for you to properly dispose of it.

, If you throw kerosene away, it will end up in landfills or incinerators, or may even be dumped into rivers. When kerosene is disposed improperly, it can poison the air, soil, water, wild animals, and even people and their pets. "

Understand hazardous waste.,
Be responsible with your waste.,
Research your local laws.,
Recognize everyday hazardous products.",How to Dispose of Hazardous Waste1," Hazardous waste cannot be disposed like normal trash in landfills. Instead it must be disposed through the proper networks to prevent human and environmental harm. Look at the four characteristics of hazardous waste:


Ignitability means that the waste can easily catch on fire. It is considered flammable if the flash point is less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
Corrosive wastes are acids/bases that are capable of corroding metal containers.
Reactive wastes are unstable under normal conditions. They can cause explosions, toxic fumes, gases or vapors when heated.
Toxic types of wastes are potentially fatal or harmful when absorbed or ingested. They can pollute groundwater if not disposed of properly.;
, Responsibility in disposing these types of wastes isn’t just for your carbon footprint. Many counties and states attach legal responsibility towards disposing hazardous waste.


Companies who don’t adhere to the laws are subject to fines and other legal action.

, Many counties across the U.S. have specific protocol for disposing hazardous waste. Each county can have different steps and regulations for disposing hazardous waste. The actual disposal of hazardous waste on the local level is enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

, It is common to come into contact with hazardous waste without ever knowing it. Take a look at the following list of common products that shouldn’t be thrown away normally:


Automotive products. This includes antifreeze, fluids, motor oils, and gasoline.
Batteries
Fluorescent light bulbs. Many of the older models contain mercury.
Household cleaners. This includes ammonia, drain cleaner, and rust remover.
Paint products.
Garden chemicals.
Swimming pool chemicals."

Give the paint thinner away.,
Take the paint thinner to a hazardous household waste collection facility.,
Take the paint thinner to a hazardous household waste collection event.",How to Dispose of Paint Thinner2," The easiest way to get rid of unused paint thinner is to find someone who needs it. Offer it to a friend or neighbor, or donate it to a local organization that could use it for renovation projects.

, Many municipalities have permanent sites available for the drop-off of hazardous materials like paint and paint thinner. Search for facilities in your area by contacting your local government, or using an online search such as Earth911.com in the US, or gov.uk/hazardous-waste-disposal in the UK.


Most hazardous waste facilities will accept pain thinner in a sealed metal or glass container. Contact your local facility if you have a large amount of waste to dispose of.

, Many jurisdictions hold annual or semiannual events for the disposal of hazardous waste. These events can be found through your local government website. Many states in the United States have a Department of Environmental Protection (or a similar branch) that organizes these events.

Recognize common household hazardous wastes.,
Use a home pickup service.,
Locate a drop-off facility.,
Recycle hazardous waste.,
Request by-mail-kits.,
Organize a community drop-off.,
Use non-hazardous products.",How to Dispose of Hazardous Waste2," Hazardous waste can find its way into most household. The most common hazardous wastes you’ll come into contact with at home are:


Harsh chemical cleaners
Paints/thinners
Antifreeze
Weed killers
Insecticide/pesticide, Many communities have set up an easy to follow home pickup system. Never mix hazardous waste with normal trash. Your community will benefit from separating the two. Unfortunately pickup systems aren’t mandated on the federal level, so there is a chance you won’t have access to these services. Many times this service will charge a fee.


Check the waste management's location tracker to see if your address is eligible.There are various different types of receptacles that can be used for different wastes. For instance you can request special containers for used batteries, syringes, and extra durable bags for heavier waste.

, For those unable to use a pick up service, dropping off your waste to a facility is another option. Most local government websites can direct you to the appropriate contacts to help dispose of hazardous waste. There is usually a day of the week where facilities accept waste like: paint products, motor oil, and other common household wastes., You might be able to recycle some of your hazardous waste. Many sites will accept materials like batteries and used cellphones to be recycled on a daily basis. Be on the lookout for other recycling opportunities. Many schools and community groups will accept leftover paint supplies, and give them to the people who can still use them.Check with your auto garage if they’d accept used or spare fluids from your car. Some will even accept antifreeze and recycle it., Some organizations, like waste management, will send you a mail-in kit for your waste. After you confirm your location, you’ll fill out a form online. In this form you’ll indicate certain information about the waste and your address. You’ll receive a recycling kit that is postage paid. The kits will vary depending on what information about the waste you included on your form., Depending on how established waste management is in your community, they will come out and work with you. You can organize a regular hazardous waste drop-off if there isn’t already one in your community. Contact waste management for information about setting up or attending a hazardous waste drop-off.These can be a recurring event or a one time drop-off.
You should always consult with waste management about a potential hazardous waste. It is not recommended to dispose hazardous waste manually.

, As a general rule, only buy what you need and consider alternatives when available. Instead of using a chemical drain cleaner, use strainers to catch the debris that may clog your pipes. Flush your drains weekly with hot water or warm vinegar.


Use baking soda and a steel wool pad instead of using intense counter top cleaners.
Consider using non-aerosol products like those with pump sprays. Instead of using an aerosol air-cleaner, keep an open box of baking soda in a room or create potpourri out of scrap orange peels."

Hire an expert consultant.,
Join WasteWise.,
Consider reduction as a disposal tactic.,
Reduce and recycle hazardous materials.,
Look into land disposal.,
Keep up to date with your permits.",How to Dispose of Hazardous Waste3," Companies can reap the benefits from groups like waste management. Experts from waste management can be scheduled to appear at your business to review your hazardous waste and give you their opinion. They can show where you fall on the EPA’s category assessment of how much waste small businesses generate:


Conditionally exempt small quantity generator (CESQG). This means that you are exempt from hazardous waste management regulations. You must generate less than 220 pounds a month to fit this category.
Small quantity generators (SQG). Your business is deemed SQG if your establishment generates between 220 and 2,200 pounds a month. This classification must comply with EPA requirements for managing hazardous waste.
Large quantity generators (LQG). The EPA considers any business that generates 2,200 pounds or more of hazardous waste a month to be LQG. This classification must adhere to the strictest rules deemed by the EPA., Any type of business, non-profit organization, or government office is eligible to join the EPA’s WasteWise program. Participants can utilize the free technical assistance in disposing and consultation about hazardous waste. There are even opportunities for WasteWise to assist with your business’ sustainability and environmental impact.There are opportunities in networking and public recognition for your companies environmental efforts.

, Many industries are looking for ways to reduce the amount of hazardous chemicals they use, which in turn reduces the amount of hazardous waste they generate. The Environmental Protection Agency lists various approaches to do this for businesses:


Lean manufacturing is a reduction tactic that emphasizes eliminating wastes that don't add value.
Energy recovery is enacted through gasification. Gasification converts materials containing carbon into synthetic gas. This type of gas can be used as fuel to generate electricity and other features.
Environmental Management Systems (EMS) is a system for assessing a company's environmental footprint.
Green chemistry is a designing outlook that strives to create products and chemicals that reduce or remove hazardous substances.

, Many items that can become a hazardous waste problem can be recycled, or in some cases, reclaimed. This is a process that recovers what is left of an usable product. Some reclamation processes recover acetone from spent solvents and lead from metals.


Zinc can be gathered from smelting furnaces.
Used oil, hydraulic fluids, refrigerator compressors and more can be recovered from cars and fridges.
Batteries can also be recycled.

, Land disposal of hazardous waste contains the waste in a landfill, waste pile, injection well or other land based disposal area. These areas fall under regulation to help protect the families around them as well as reduce environmental impact., The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is a permitting program in place to ensure that specific requirements are followed in safe treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. Permits are issued by authorized states or by EPA regional offices. Electronic permits are also available."

Ensure that the can is empty.,
Refrain from modifying the can.,
Consider the contents of the can.,
Check with your town's recycling program.,
Get paid for your aerosol cans.",How to Dispose of Aerosol Cans1," Before you toss your aerosol can, take a moment to make sure that it is really empty. If no product comes out of the nozzle and it does not appear to be clogged, the can is empty enough to dispose of safely.If you're not sure if the can is empty, try shaking it. You shouldn't feel any liquid moving inside.
Aerosol cans that are not empty must be treated differently, as disposing of a partially full aerosol can can be dangerous.;
, You don't need to alter an aerosol can in any way dispose of it. Leave the can exactly the way it is, no matter how you end up disposing of it .Aerosol cans are pressurized, which means they may explode if tampered with. Never attempt to puncture an aerosol can or expose it to extreme heat. Do not attempt to remove the spray nozzle from the can, even though it is usually plastic.
If the can has a plastic lid, you can remove this for recycling. (The lid is likely recyclable too.)

, Not all aerosol cans are created equal. Some contain hazardous materials, so you may not be able to dispose of them in your regular trash or recycling. Check the can for indications that it contains hazardous waste. If the can has specific directions for disposal on it, make sure you follow them. In some cases, you may be required to take the can to a hazardous waste disposal center.
If you are unsure whether a specific can can be recycled, call your town's recycling center and let them know the contents of the can.

, Every municipality has different policies on recycling, so you may or may not be able to recycle an aerosol can in your area. Look up your city or county's regulations online or call them to inquire about whether aerosol cans are accepted for recycling.If you do not have single stream recycling in your area, be sure to put your aerosol can with your other metal recyclables.
If there are no options for recycling an aerosol can in your area, you can throw it in the regular trash (as long as it is empty and the can does not indicate that it needs to be treated as a hazardous material).

, Since many aerosol cans are made of steel or aluminum, some scrap yards may be willing to take them. If you want to be sure before you visit the scrap yard, call ahead of time.This may not be worth your time if you only have one or two cans. If you have a large number of cans, however, it can really add up.
While you're at the scrap yard, you may be able to sell other metal scraps as well, like aluminum soda cans. This is especially helpful in states that don't have deposits on cans. (If your state does have deposits, it may be more convenient to return your soda cans at the grocery store.)"

Do not throw away an aerosol can that is not empty.,
Try to use the product until the can is empty.,
Do not attempt to empty the can except by using the product.,
Take your partially full aerosol cans to hazardous waste collection site.",How to Dispose of Aerosol Cans2," It may not seem like a big deal to throw a partially full can of hairspray or cleaning product in the garbage, but it can actually be very dangerous. Because aerosol cans are pressurized, they explode if they are exposed to high heat or flattened. This could even happen in the garbage truck, which could cause injuries., The easiest way to get rid of the aerosol can is simply to use the product until the can is empty, and then dispose of the can in the recycling or trash.


If you can’t use it yourself, consider donating it to someone who will use it. For example, cans of spray paint may be used by local artists or students. Your friends or family members may also be able to use your products.

, When you bring a partially full aerosol can to a hazardous waste collection site, they may puncture it to remove the contents and allow the can to be recycled. While this can be done by trained professionals with specialized equipment, it should never be done at home! Puncturing an aerosol can can cause an explosion, so please leave it to the experts., You can locate a collection facility near you by searching on your city's or county's website. You may need to pay a small fee to safely dispose of your aerosol cans, but it should not be significant.Many towns have events where people can bring in their hazardous waste and get rid of it for free or a reduced cost.
You may find a local business that needs the product inside. They may be willing to take them for you.

Give it away.,
Recycle the glass.,
Contact your waste management company.,
Cover the surface with tape.,
Wrap the glass.,
Label the exterior.,
Place the glass beside the receptacle.",How to Dispose of Glass1," In the case of mirrors or glass tabletops especially, you may be able to give the object to a friend or even donate it to a charitable organization. By giving the glass away, you can get rid of it, help someone else, and keep the glass out of a landfill.;
, Ultimately, whether or not you can recycle your specific piece of glass depends upon the area where you live. Mirrors, window glass, and other large pieces of glass have a different chemical composition than standard bottle glass, and many recycling plants may not accept them.If your municipality does accept window glass, etc., then they'll likely have a specific process for it. Contact them and follow any specific instructions.


This process will most likely involve taking the glass down to a recycling center since the trucks that run recycling routes aren't typically equipped for nonstandard items.

, If it looks like sending your glass to the dump is the only option, then you’ll want to start by contacting your area’s waste management service. Different companies will handle waste of different sizes. For truly large pieces of glass, your waste management company may not dispose of it in a single piece. You'll likely find information with weight and dimension restrictions on the company's website or by calling.


If they tell you you’ll need to break up the pane first, then the second method will be more suited to your needs.

, If your piece of glass is small enough to dispose of whole, you can trash the glass by taking steps to prepare it for disposal first. Since multiple waste management personnel will have to handle the glass, you want to help ensure that it doesn't break and become a hazard in the process. Start by covering the surface of the glass with duct tape.Tape across the glass will help keep the pieces in place and limit splintering in the event that is does break.


Tape both the front and back surfaces of the glass.
The more of the surface you cover the better, but if you don't want to waste a large amount of tape, then you can simply place a large X across the front and back surfaces., Use bubble wrap or even an old blanket that you don't mind discarding to wrap the glass and tape the wrapping shut.This way even if the glass does break and some of it breaks free from the tape, it will still be held in place by the wrapping.

, Once you have the piece of glass properly wrapped, label the exterior of the wrapping, so that anyone who handles it knows to do so with a bit of care. A note as simple as ""Glass for disposal"" will suffice.Make sure the writing is both clear and large enough to read.

, Since throwing the piece into a dumpster would defeat the purpose of labeling it, simply place the glass beside your personal or community receptacle.You should also ensure that the labeling faces outward and can be easily seen.

Break the glass with caution.,
Take proper precautions.,
Place the bigger pieces in a large trash bag.,
Vacuum up smaller pieces.,
Blot the area with a soft piece of bread.,
Wipe down the area with a damp paper towel.,
Place the trash bag in a cardboard box.,
Put the container out with the normal trash.",How to Dispose of Glass2," In the instance that you actually have a whole piece of glass but it exceeds the dimensions that your waste management company will handle, you'll need to break the piece into smaller, easily disposable pieces. Place the glass down flat on the ground and cover the entire pane with an old blanket or several old towels to keep the shards in place before using a hammer or shovel to break the pane.


If you can also put a blanket that you don't mind throwing away beneath the glass, then you'll have a much easier time cleaning up with fewer tiny shards to worry about as well.
Alternatively, and if it fits, put the glass into a garbage can and break it there.
When breaking glass, always be sure to wear gloves and goggles or other eye protection.

, Whether you dropped a bottle or had to break your own large pane of glass, always put on work gloves and thick-soled shoes while handling broken glass. You should also keep kids and pets away from the area until you’ve finished the cleaning process.

, You should start by collecting the larger pieces of glass, and you should place them in a large trash bag.Thick outdoor trash bags are preferable because they are less likely to puncture and tear.


In addition to using thick trash bags, you should actually place a second trash bag inside the first before you start putting the broken glass inside.It’s much easier to double-bag the clean-up effort before you start rather than trying to fit a jagged trash bag inside a second one later.

, Once you have collected the larger pieces to the degree that you can, vacuum up the area with the hose attachment on a shop vacuum.Use the hose attachment to get the entire area up to approximately fifteen feet away since broken glass can fly quite far.Make sure you use the hose attachment on a shop vac. A conventional rolling vacuum will only crush the glass into even tinier shards and it lacks the suction power of the hose.
Many people are tempted to use a broom to sweep up the glass instead of a vacuum, but glass shards can easily trap in the bristles of your broom only to be redistributed later. A vacuum is a safer method.

, Even a vacuum can miss some of the truly tiny pieces than can nonetheless cut or irritate skin. For an easy and economical way to capture those pieces of glass dust, you can get a piece of soft bread from the kitchen and blot it face down across the area to trap the remainder of the glass.Though bread is the item you most likely already have in your home, other household items can work well in this case too. A halved potato, packing or duct tape, or a lint roller also work well for this purpose.Make sure you do not accidentally touch the area of the item with the glass stuck to it.

, A damp paper towel can finish the job, so wipe the area down thoroughly.Also remember to wipe down the soles of your shoes to get any glass dust you may have picked up during the rest of the cleaning process.

, Some companies may also request that you dispose of broken glass in a solid container as well.If this is the case with your waste management company, then you should also place the glass-filled garbage bags in a cardboard box, seal it, and label it broken glass.

, At this point, you have properly contained and labeled the broken glass, and you can simply put it into your regular trashcan or community’s dumpster.

Dispose of car batteries at an auto parts retailer or hazardous waste collection site.,
Take rechargeable batteries to a recycling facility.,
Donate or recycle lithium-ion batteries.,
Dispose of button batteries at a hazardous waste collection site or recycling facility.",How to Dispose of Batteries1," Alkaline batteries are the type that power most simple battery-operated devices, such as flashlights, toys, remote controls, or smoke alarms. They come in a variety of sizes, ranging from AAA to 9 volt. Proper disposal methods for alkaline batteries may depend on your local waste regulations.Most alkaline batteries manufactured since 1996 are made of relatively non-hazardous materials, and can be tossed directly into the trash.
However, some states or municipalities still require that alkaline batteries be treated as hazardous waste. In these cases, the batteries must be recycled or dropped off at a designated facility.
You may be able to drop off alkaline batteries for recycling at a local electronics retailer, recycling center, or community center. Check the Earth911 website for drop-off locations in your area.;
, Since car batteries contain lead acid, they can’t be disposed of in the trash or tossed in with your recycling.Many retailers, like Home Depot or Auto Zone, will accept dead or used car batteries. You can also drop them off at recycling or waste disposal facilities that specialize in hazardous materials.

, Rechargeable batteries contain nickel and cadmium, which can create an environmental hazard if the batteries are thrown away in a landfill or an incinerator. These batteries must be disposed of at a hazardous waste collection site, recycling facility, or an electronics retailer that recycles batteries.Many electronics retailers, like Radio Shack or Staples, will accept used rechargeable batteries for recycling. Check Earth911.com for participating retailers in your area.

, These are the kinds of batteries that typically power portable electronics like your mobile phone, digital camera, tablet, or laptop. Lithium-ion batteries can be recycled at a recycling center or hazardous waste collection site, or donated to refurbishers and recyclers.In the USA, some retailers participate in a program called the Sustainable Materials Management Electronics Challenge. The SSM program encourages companies to recycle and refurbish lithium batteries and other electronic components. Check the EPA website for a list of participating businesses, here: https://www.epa.gov/recycle/electronics-donation-and-recycling

Check with electronics retailers in your area to find out if they will accept donations of lithium-ion batteries.

, This kind of battery is used in hearing aids and watches, and contains mercuric oxide, lithium, silver oxide, or zinc-air. They are considered hazardous materials and must be brought to a household hazardous waste collection site for proper handling.Button batteries contain extremely toxic materials, and should never be disposed of in the trash.
You may be able to recycle or dispose of button batteries at some electronics retailers."

Check with local electronics or hardware retailers.",How to Dispose of Batteries2," The correct procedure for disposing of different types of batteries may vary significantly by region. Check the website for your state, city, or municipality for information on how to dispose of batteries in your area. For example:

If you are in the UK, begin by looking at gov.uk’s hazardous waste disposal page, which can help you find battery disposal facilities in your area: https://www.gov.uk/hazardous-waste-disposal

If you are in the US, your state government’s website probably has information on battery disposal. For example, if you live in California, you can find detailed information on battery recycling and disposal here: http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/reducewaste/Batteries/


, Once you have information on your local laws regarding battery disposal, you will need to find appropriate hazardous waste disposal or recycling facilities in your area. Some areas also offer home hazardous waste collection programs or regularly scheduled events in which you take your batteries to a designated collection site.In the US, you can use the Earth911 website to search for battery recycling or disposal locations in your area.

, In the US and UK, many libraries offer battery recycling drop-off sites. Some community centers or city halls may also accept batteries for recycling., The company that collects garbage or recycling from your home or workplace may offer hazardous waste disposal services. Even if they cannot collect your batteries, they may have a disposal site where you can drop off your batteries and other hazardous waste materials., Many businesses will accept batteries for recycling or disposal. In many cases, you can simply return your batteries to the store where you originally purchased them. If you aren’t sure if a store will accept your batteries, call ahead. If the store does not accept used batteries, they may be able to suggest an alternative."

Store your dead batteries away from children and pets.,
Keep your batteries in a cool, dry place.,
Tape the terminals of your batteries.,
Store used batteries in a cardboard or plastic container.,
Do not store different types of batteries together.",How to Dispose of Batteries3," Many types of batteries contain hazardous materials, such as mercury, lead, or acid. While you are waiting to dispose of your batteries, keep them in a place where they will not be accessible to children or pets who might be harmed by playing with them or swallowing them.If you do suspect that a child or pet has swallowed a battery, contact emergency services immediately.

, If your batteries become corroded or overheated, they could leak or rupture. It is also important to avoid storing your batteries near any flammable materials, as this could present a fire hazard., Sometimes seemingly dead batteries still carry a bit of a charge. If the positive and negative terminals of old batteries touch, it can create an electric current, which can lead to a fire. This risk can be minimized by putting a little tape over the terminals of your old batteries until you are ready to dispose of them.Fire can also result from the terminals of batteries coming into contact with conductive materials (like keys, steel wool, or other objects likely to be lying in your rummage drawer).

, Storing your batteries in a non-conductive container will reduce the risk of fire, leakage, or rupture.If you still have the original packaging for your batteries, this is a relatively safe way to store old batteries for disposal.
Consider individually bagging especially hazardous batteries, like 9 volt alkaline batteries, button batteries, lead acid batteries, or lithium batteries.

, Mixing batteries with different chemistries may result in leakage and hazardous chemical reactions. If you have multiple types of batteries to dispose of, bag them separately."
"
Wear the appropriate safety gear.,
Disconnect the battery.,
Remove the battery from the vehicle.,
Visually inspect the battery for damage.",How to Dispose of Car Batteries1," Before removing an old battery from your vehicle, you should be prepared in the event the battery has leaked battery acid. Put on eye protection, as the fluids inside most batteries can be very dangerous for your eyes. Gloves are also a highly recommended precaution.Goggle style eye protection will offer the highest degree of protection for your eyes.
Gloves can prevent you from getting battery fluids on your skin, as they can be an irritant.;
, Use a hand or socket wrench of the appropriate size to loosen the nut on the negative terminal on the battery first. Remove the ground cable from the negative terminal and tuck it to the side, then repeat the process on the positive terminal.Tuck both cables down and to the side to ensure they can’t come back into contact with the terminals as you remove the battery.

, Automotive batteries are secured into vehicles in a number of ways, so identify the strap or clip used to secure your battery in place and loosen or remove it so the battery can be removed. Often, this will require the removal of one long bolt.If you are unsure of how to remove the battery from the vehicle, refer to the owner’s manual for guidance.
Take care not to lose the fastening hardware, as you will need it to secure the new battery you put in.

, If the battery has been crushed in an accident or punctured in some manner, it will be much more dangerous to transport. Check the battery for holes or leaks so you can be sure of what you are dealing with moving forward.If there is a leak in the battery, you will need to be extremely careful not to get the fluid leaking out on your skin or in your eyes.

Wrap the battery in a plastic bag.,
Keep the battery upright at all times.,
Look up a local battery recycling center.,
Contact the recycling center to establish a pickup or drop off.",How to Dispose of Car Batteries2," The battery you remove from your vehicle will likely be covered in dirt and grime from the engine bay, so wrapping it plastic will keep that from staining the interior of your vehicle when you transport the battery to a recycling center.If the battery is leaking, double wrap it in heavy duty trash bags to ensure the fluid doesn’t get on anything.
You don’t need to tie the bags tight, as long as they stay upright.

, The only safe way to transport an automotive battery is sitting upright, so be sure you do not place it on the ground or in a vehicle on its side of upside down.When transporting a battery, be sure it is positioned so it won’t fall over while you are driving.
Some batteries have lids on the top that may open if tipped, draining the fluids from inside.

, You will need to bring the battery to a local recycling center that accepts automotive batteries. You can usually find this information on the city or town you live in’s website, or by doing an online search for local recycling centers.The website Earth911.com can help you locate recycling centers in your area as well.
Many auto repair facilities will also accept batteries for recycling.

, Contact the recycling center in your area and tell them what you hope to drop off. Some centers will come to your house and pick up the battery for you, but often you will need to deliver it yourself.If the battery is leaking, make sure you tell them so before they come to pick up the battery.
If you are transporting it yourself, be sure you have the address of the recycling center you are going to.

Locate your local auto parts store.,
Request assistance locating a replacement battery.,
Provide your battery as a deposit on the new one.",How to Dispose of Car Batteries3," There are many auto parts stores that accept your old battery as a deposit toward a new one. If you need to replace your battery, wrap it in plastic and bring it to the auto parts store you intend to buy the new battery from.You may want to call the auto parts store first to ensure they accept old batteries as a deposit.
Be sure to drive the battery to the store wrapped in plastic and sitting upright.

, Speak to the clerk at the front desk to get help finding the specific size battery you will need in your vehicle. Provide them with the year, make and model of the vehicle, as well as the engine type if you know it.If you are unsure of the type of engine you have in your vehicle, refer to the owner’s manual for assistance.

, When you purchase the new battery, the store will charge you an additional fee unless you provide a “core” battery as a deposit. The old battery you brought serves as that core. Trade them the battery in exchange for a lower price on your new one.The store will have the battery drained and refurbished to be sold again as a new battery.
You may have to pay more for a battery if you do not choose to recycle your old one through the auto parts store.

Avoid stacking frequently-used pots and pans.,
Cushion stacked cookware with paper plates.,
Put your heaviest items on the bottom.,
Make use of wire racks.,
Hang a pan to the side, if you have a large enough cupboard.,
File your flat items vertically, rather than horizontally.,
Move the interior shelf if necessary.,
Install a door-mounted lid rack.,
Create your own door-mounted lid storage.",How to Organize the Pots and Pans Cabinet," Before you can organize your cookware, you need to take inventory of what you have. Lay the contents of your cupboard out flat on the kitchen floor, table, or counter.;
, If you never use a pot or pan, having it in your cupboard only adds unnecessary clutter. Similarly, cookware that is in bad shape should also be disposed of.


Make sure that each lid corresponds to a pot or pan. You can use a pot or pan without a lid, but a lid that goes to nothing serves no purpose and only wastes space.
If a lid has a loose handle, try tightening it first. If the lid cannot be tightened, however, it becomes a potential hazard—loose handles can come off in the middle of cooking—making the lid something that you should replace.
Get rid of duplicate pans. Most people do not need three 8-inch skillets, even though they could benefit from having one 8, 10, and 12-inch pan apiece. If the pans are in good shape, you can donate them or keep them stored away in the basement or attic.
Toss or recycle cookware in poor shape, including any pots and pans that are warped, dented, peeling, or scratched. Damaged items may not cook food evenly or thoroughly.

, For instance, if you have a large roaster that you only use around the holidays, store it in an easy-to-get-to spot in your basement or closet. You have very limited space in your kitchen cupboard. You should reserve that space for the items you need frequently.

, Lay paper or rubber shelf lining inside your cupboard to protect your cookware. Rubber lining is especially useful in preventing your cookware from moving around too much. The less your cookware moves around, the less likely it will shift around or get scratched up.

, For instance, keep the pans you use for baking near your cooking bowls, and the pots you use for boiling pasta near your colander. By organizing your cookware in this manner, you create a system of sections, and you can quickly find an item you’re looking for by immediately looking in its correct section.

, If you use your trusty 10-inch skillet three times a week while preparing dinner, it does not make much sense to have it buried underneath your 8-inch skillet and a number of small saucepans. By setting the items you use most frequently off to the side instead of stacking them with the rest, you can save yourself the time and effort it takes to juggle extra pans as you remove them at dinnertime.

, Some pots and pans will inevitably need to be stacked in order to fit. Place paper plates in between your pots and pans to prevent the bottoms and sides from getting scratched or dented.

, Slow cookers, large metal stockpots, glass pans, and cast iron skillets are all worthy candidates for the bottom shelf. Putting your heavy items on the top shelf could cause unsteady shelves to collapse. Even if the shelf stays intact, there is still some chance that you may bump the cookware as you try to get something else out, causing it to crash into and damage other pieces on the bottom. Storing your heaviest items on the lowest shelf prevents most of these accidents from occurring.

, Racks with stands create more vertical space, allowing you to “stack” your cookware without actually stacking pieces inside one another.


If you need to keep a frequently-used item separate, you can do so by placing a single-layer metal rack above your other pots and pans and positioning the special pan on top.
Use a tiered wire rack to store multiple sauté skillets or other pans.

, This offers you another way to keep a frequently-used pan separate from the rest. Fix a simple hook to the side of your cupboard and hang a narrow pan from it. This only works with narrow pans, however, since large pots may take up too much horizontal space.

, Firmly fix tension curtain rods in between shelves to create narrow cubby holes that you can slide muffin pans, cookie sheets, and other long, flat items in. Organizing these items vertically saves you the hassle of digging through a large pile of baking pans later on.

, In order to accommodate the size needed for large cookware, wire racks, or hanging pans and lids, you may need to move the inside shelf up or down to create additional space on the bottom or lower shelf.

, These wire racks are specially designed to store lids vertically. Place a hook on the inside of your cupboard door and mount the rack onto the hook.

, If you cannot find a lid rack, create make-shift lid storage by mounting adjustable curtain rods onto eye hooks on the inside of your door. The handle of the lid will rest on top of the curtain rod, holding the lid in place.

Put your remaining photos into boxes.",How to Organize Old Photos1," Dig through your cabinets, closets, and anywhere else your photos may be hiding and bring them all to a central location before you start your organization process., There are many different ways that you can successfully sort. If you aren’t sure which to try, think about your end goal. Are you putting photos together to celebrate someone’s birthday? Then sort by person. Are you organizing a family yearbook? Then sort by date or event. Typically, the most popular ways to sort are by:


Years or eras
Events, such as weddings
Individual people, Since these are the best of the best, you should store them in a location where they can easily be viewed.

, Throw away doubles and photos that are of poor quality.

, These are where the bulk of your photos will most likely go. The photos that you choose to store in boxes are those that you don’t want to part with, but can be stored somewhere out of the way for infrequent viewing."
"
Label photos and boxes.,
Have a backup plan.,
Choose proper storage containers.,
Beware of the elements.",How to Organize Old Photos2," The more detail you can make note of in this process, the better. Using an archival safe photo pen, you can write details like the year the photo was taken or the names of the people in the photo on the back of the photo.Some photo albums have lined margins where you can also write this information.
Properly labeling storage boxes will help you have quick access to particular photos in the future.

, Whether you decide to organize hard copies or digital files, you should always have a second copy stored using a different method just in case there’s a fire in your home or your computer crashes.


If you only have hard copies of your photos, consider scanning them and also saving and organizing them digitally.If you have them, keep your negatives as a back up. Store them as flatly as possible to keep them from curling., Instead of putting your printed photos in just any kind of box, go to a local craft store and purchase photo storage boxes. Make sure to only use products made from acid-free materials., If stored incorrectly, your photos can be damaged or even destroyed by heat, moisture, mold, rodents, and bugs. Keep your photos in a cool, dry place that’s away from direct sunlight."

Store and organize photos on your computer.,
Store photos online using digital archives.,
Use portable storage media.",How to Organize Old Photos3," If you want to get all of your photos onto your computer, upload them from your camera or smartphone, rename the files, and put them into the correct folders. By renaming each photo with details about that particular photo and creating folders named after events, years, or people, you can stay the most organized.


However you decide to go about sorting and naming your photo files and folders, make sure you stay consistent.IPhoto and Microsoft Windows Photo Gallery are both programs that you might be able to use to organize and save photos on your computer.

, There are many ways that you can keep your photos organized and stored online. You may need internet access in order to view your photos, but the upside is that storage capacity is much greater and easier to manage. Using this method, you won’t need to worry about taking up storage space on your computer or phone, and you also won’t have to deal with thousands of hard copies.

Prepare a water source.,
Dunk fireworks in water after use.,
Do not soak fireworks in or near a natural body of water.",How to Dispose of Fireworks1," Before you light any fireworks, make sure that you have a water source on hand. Fill a couple of buckets with water to dunk used fireworks and put out fires. Keep a hose or a fire extinguisher nearby. In a pinch, you can pour a bucket of soil or sand over a fire to extinguish the blaze – but water will be most effective.;
, Submerge them in a large bucket of water until they are thoroughly cooled and all of the embers have been extinguished. Soak for at least fifteen minutes, and soak overnight if possible. This applies to all spent fireworks, ""dud"" fireworks, and sparklers.


For extra safety, soak the fireworks from a distance. Pour water from a bucket, or spray the explosives using a garden hose.
It's important to soak even the fireworks that don't go off. Sometimes, ""duds"" explode late, causing fire or injury. Never try to relight a ""dud"" – wait 20 minutes after the failed detonation, and then soak the explosive in water.
Remove the fuse from live fireworks. If you are trying to dispose of fireworks that have not yet been lit, make sure to pull off the wicks so that the explosives won't detonate.

, The compounds that are used to make the colorful explosions contain metals that can pollute the air, water, and surrounding ecosystem. Furthermore: if you set off fireworks near the surface of a body of water, the concussion can kill fish and other local wildlife. If your fireworks do explode above a body of water, make sure to promptly remove any visible debris from he explosive shell."
"
Pick up all debris.,
Wrap the soaked fireworks.,
Place fireworks in regular household trash.",How to Dispose of Fireworks2," After your firework show, comb the area for any pieces that may have scattered in the explosion. Watch the fireworks as they fall to the ground, and mark their locations so that you don't miss anything. If you leave a piece of burning material on the ground, you might start a fire! Furthermore, fireworks often contain metals and other materials that can pollute an ecosystem and contaminate the water table.Do your part to minimize your impact.

, Use trash bags, Ziploc, or plastic wrap so that the wet explosives don't dry out.Consider double-wrapping the bags. It's okay to put multiple fireworks in the same bag, as long as it is sealed.

, Fireworks cannot be recycled or composted.If possible, bring the fireworks to your local solid waste center. Make sure to tell the workers at the waste center that you are disposing of fireworks – and whether they are live, spent, or duds.


If you don't feel comfortable placing fireworks in the garbage, contact your local fire department. Some police and fire authorities will take fireworks and ensure proper disposal. This applies especially to live fireworks.

Gather all of your craft items.,
Sort your supplies out according to item type.,
Decide what to donate.,
Create a trash pile and dispose of it.,
Repeat this process every few weeks.",How to Organize a Craft Room1," Grab a basket and walk throughout your living space grabbing any and all craft supplies and tools. Carry them into your designated craft room and place everything in the middle of the floor. Once you think that you’ve gotten it all, go back through one more time just to be certain. Make sure to open all of your drawers and cabinets, as craft supplies can often ‘hide.’Likewise, go through your craft room and identify any objects or items that do not belong there and move them out. They may need to go in a ‘staging area’ in another room, so that you can concentrate your energy on your craft area.;
, Look over your supply pile and begin to build smaller piles based upon different categories of supplies. For example, put all of your wrapping paper together. All fabrics should go together initially. After these first piles are finished, you can go back through them and narrow them even further according to size and color. For example, put all of the red wrapping paper together.


At this point your room may be in controlled chaos, so be careful walking around or you may slip on one of your piles. For that reason, try to keep other people out of the room as well, at least during this stage.
To keep you from feeling overwhelmed, bring an egg timer into the room and set it for 15-minutes. When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. Then, re-set the timer and start again. This will keep you motivated to work at a steady pace without burning out., As you sort, identify items that are worth donating. Perhaps you have multiples of some items or maybe leftover supplies from projects that you’ve completed and moved on from. Make sure that whatever you donate is safe for another user. For example, don’t donate rusty scissors or any cracked glass items.Various charity organizations, schools, and libraries will gladly accept donations of craft supplies as long as they are in good condition. This is a great opportunity to share your interest in crafting with other people.
Depending on the amount of items that you have, some charities will actually come to your house and pick them up for you. This may be a good opportunity to do organize other areas of your home as well.

, As you sort, identify items that need to be thrown away. This could be items that you no longer find useful, but that aren’t suitable for donation due to condition or quantity. You should also trash any supplies that are no good anymore, such as dried out glue or frayed ribbons. Ask yourself if you’ve used the item in the past year and if you haven’t odds are it needs to be thrown away or donated.


Take the trash out after you’ve finished sorting the main pile. If you wait you are likely to leave it there and it will become an eyesore and will slow your organizing progress.

, As life goes on, many of your supplies will likely wander out of your craft space once more. To keep your area tidy and useful for you, go through a sorting and cleaning process fairly often, especially after completing a major project.


Also, devote at least ten minutes after you finish working in your craft room for picking up and storing items in their new proper places. Devoting even this small amount of time can make a major difference in the long-term appearance of your craft room."
"
Store similar items together.,
Use plastic bins.,
Arrange items by color.,
Repurpose materials as storage containers.,
Label everything.,
Install shelving.",How to Organize a Craft Room2," You’ll want to keep your supplies together in their sorted piles as you place them in their designated storage spots and containers. Extra-small items will need to be placed in extra-small containers and will probably be grouped together for storage and then usage.


Keep an eye out for items that may appear similar but that have slightly different functions. These situations may require that you divide up your storage system even further. For example, you’ll want to divide your fabric scissors from your paper scissors., These are the number one storage option when organizing a craft room. They come in a wide variety of sizes and are easy to stack. They also fit well within a cube shelf. You can see inside the clear bins, making it easy to find an item that you are looking for.Depending on how you arrange your bins, you will want to purchase ones that open on the top or via a front panel. Look for lids that snap on tightly to avoid spilling your supplies.
Bins are also especially useful when working with messy items such as paints. In addition, they contain fumes from paints as well.Make sure to purchase extra bins, and to leave space in the ones that you currently use, for new supplies that you may purchase., Store and display your craft supplies according to the color wheel. This will create a quick way for you to find an item that you need for a particular project. It will also lead to beautiful displays of items within the room itself. For example, if you have a bunch of balls of yarn, sort them according to color (reds next to orange tints, etc.) and place them in a wooden cube bookcase for quick access and visual appeal., Almost any container that is sturdy with a lid can be reused as storage in your craft room. Try to think creatively and find jars, buckets, etc. that you find visually appealing already. They will be even more attractive when holding your supplies.


Here are a few unique ideas. To house smaller items such as sequins, use little plastic pill storage boxes that you can get at a pharmacy or grocery store.For colored beads, place them in a spice rack by color for ease of access and beauty. Small tins or colored buckets make a great storage option for pens, pencils, and paintbrushes.
For a more industrial look, grab a magnetic knife holder from your kitchen, attach it to the wall of your craft room, and use it to display your sharp cutting devices and scissors. This works best when positioned close to your standing work area.Look at crafting sites and blogs online or buy inspirational craft books/magazines in order to find additional design ideas that may suit your particular space and taste.

, This is especially important when storing items in plastic bins or opaque containers. As you put away every storage container, make sure that it has a clear and visible label that you can see from the center of your craft room. For example, the bin with tape should say, “Tape-clear.”You can get as fancy as you’d like with the labels. Some people prefer to use a standard label maker while others print directly from online templates. You can even make your own labels by hand., You want to get the most use out of all surfaces within your room, so don’t ignore the walls. Look around your craft room and consider adding shelves to many of the open spaces on the walls. Think creatively about shelving and use materials such as recycled bookcase shelves or even old metal signs repurposed as shelves.

Locate your work table for ease of access.,
Keep your favorite supplies close by.,
Emphasize the natural light when possible.,
Create an inspiration board.,
Decorate with beautiful craft items.,
Create more access by manipulating your space.",How to Organize a Craft Room3," Get a sturdy table that you’d feel comfortable working on and place it in the most convenient space in the room, usually right in the middle. You want to be able to access it from all sides. Consider adding a chair or stool, unless you plan to stand all of the time when crafting.In addition to your main table, you may want another one placed against the wall that will almost act like a workbench. You can hang items on the wall next to it for quick grabbing access.

, The materials that you are using for a current project, or those that you consistently rely upon, should be placed close to your table workspace. For example, if you are a seamstress, do not hide your best pair of cutting shears in a labeled storage bin in the closet., If you have a choice of room, pick a room with ample light sources. This will help to save you from eye strain as you work on your projects. You can also supplement the light by adding interesting (and bright) lamps. Hanging lamps often work the quite well as they are out of the way.

, Pin up photos or drawings to a fabric-covered poster board. Or, hang a magnetic board on your wall and attach items to it. Clip or write down quotes that you like and attach them to the board. Let it keep growing until you feel the need to remove some items into storage. This can be a fairly chaotic, but inspirational space, in an another organized room.To add even more visual appeal, use colorful and creative stick-pins to attach items to the board. You can even go with pieces of patterned tape too.

, If you love your yarn, don’t hide it, display it. As you sort out items at the start of this process, look for those supplies that you find particularly visually stunning or exciting. Try to create spaces out in the open to store these items. For example, lengths of ribbon can be stored and displayed by hanging a peg board on the wall.

, Don’t be afraid to use every inch of your craft room for some storage, display, or work purpose. You can paint inspirational quotes on the ceiling and hang items from it too. You can go vertical up the walls and increase your reach by employing footstools.Typically neglected areas, such as the backs of doors, can be put to good use with hanging storage pouches.


Increase your visibility in closet spaces by removing the doors and replacing them with a rod and curtain. When you first enter your room, sweep aside the curtain and you’ve got instant access and visibility into this space."

A big mistake many folks make is buying something they like, bringing it home, and then finding out the object is taking up too much of the room.;
, This is critical to utilizing your space. A desk just deep enough for the computer with lots of shelves going up towards the ceiling to hold Cd's, books, etc. is key to successfully furnishing this small office. Try to allocate a desk with cabinets to hide tower and monitor from view when not in use. Also, keep the desk clean and clear when it is not being used. This makes for a more relaxing environment for guests.

, Avoid dark colors on furniture and walls. Light colors give the illusion of space.

, This adds floor space and storage to your room.

Use a bin on the floor to collect grimy laundry.,
Hang a rod to dry wet clothes.,
Assign each family member a personal laundry basket.",How to Organize a Laundry Room1," Dirty clothing can quickly overtake a laundry room, making it seem drab and unorganized. Try positioning several laundry baskets in the room, with each one dedicated to a particular type of laundry. For example, you could sort laundry into a basket for white clothing, one for colored clothing, and one for household laundry like sheets and towels.;
, Keep your sweaty running shorts and muddy gardening socks separate from the rest of your clothes. Try placing a canvas bin on the floor and tossing grimy items directly in the bin.

, Try hanging a shower curtain rod in the laundry room. A rod will provide a space for hanging wet or damp clothing. Try positioning a shower curtain rod above the washing machine, and use it for hanging up clothes that need to air dry.







, Make sure each member of your family has their own laundry basket. Place clean laundry in personal baskets, and ask each family member to retrieve the basket and put away the laundry. Store empty baskets on a shelf. Try baskets with fun, attractive designs to prevent folded or dirty laundry from becoming an eyesore."

Try organizing different types of supplies in separate cabinets. For example, place laundry detergent and fabric softener in one cabinet and use a different cabinet for clothespins and delicates bags.








, If you don’t have enough cabinet space to house all your laundry supplies, create more vertical space with a shelf or basket. Try hanging a shelf above the washing machine to store laundry detergent and stain remover. You could also hang small baskets inside a laundry closet to store supplies like dryer sheets and clothes pins.







, Organize items like stain removers, scrub brushes, and laundry pens in a shower caddy. Corralling the items in the caddy will help you stay organized, and make it easier to respond to a fabric first aid incident like wine on a white couch.

, You can transform the tops of your washing machine and dryer into a usable workspace with a butcher block. Put the butcher block directly on the machines and use it to sort and fold laundry., If you do a lot of ironing, you can create a collapsible workspace by hanging an ironing board. Try hanging the board on a wall or on the back of a door. When you are done ironing, fold the board back up against the door or wall.







, Having a trash can set up in your workspace will help you handle lint, used dryer sheets, and other garbage efficiently. Try setting up a trash can near the laundry machines. For example, you can slide the trash can between the wall and the washing machine or dryer.

",How to Organize Craft Supplies,"


If something is basically already organized or put away, don't pull it out now. Start with the stuff that's in your way.
Go a bit at a time, especially if you have a lot of stuff. Spend fifteen minutes sorting, or just sort one bag, bin, or area.;
, It can be hard to admit that a particular activity might have been a passing phase that you've outgrown, or that an unfinished project ought to remain so, but if you can reduce the amount of stuff you'll have less of it to organize and to have to cram in somewhere.


Go for the easy stuff first, to help yourself build momentum. Toss anything that's obvious: hopelessly tiny scraps, mostly empty packages, dried-up paints.
Remember, you decide what's worth keeping. At the same time, organizing only goes so far if there's too much stuff.
Be choosy about what you bring home from the craft store. Do you have a project in mind for this item? Do you have a place to put it? Do you really find it attractive or promising? Can you do the project? Anytime soon? Be realistic, and you'll save money, space, and time.

,


Sort by item type. Put glue sticks, bottles, and jars into one pile. Put decorative stickers into a different pile. Put fancy paper into a pile of its own.
Better yet, sort by activity. Have one kit, bag, bin, or space for painting, one for paper crafts, one for yarn, knitting needles,

, Think about where and how you do crafts. If you have a craft area already, add drawers, bins, or shelves. If you knit in front of the TV, your organization may consist of a knitting basket or two with active projects that live by the sofa and a bin full of extra yarn and inactive supplies stashed away in a closet elsewhere.


Try a drawer organizer or even a fishing tackle box to corral many small items. Something with multiple smaller spaces helps separate little stuff.
If you have a lot of small items, like beads or buttons, giving each group its own small container or compartment that seals or closes tight can save spills.
Do you craft on the go? A tote bag or even a purse-sized craft kit might be just the right organization system for you. Keep a project at hand when you go out to make use of wait times.

,


Sort a little bit whenever you start or finish a project or get new supplies.
Rearrange if you notice something isn't working. If it's not where you looked for it, put it back where you will look for it next time. If it's not handy and you use it often, put it back near the top or closer to where you work.

, It's best if you don't have to empty an entire bin to get out one item.


Put the flat objects into the container first, standing up on one side if possible, and then place the non-flat objects on top of them or alongside. Put frequently used items near the top.
For materials, like paper or fabric, try a filing system that displays them. Stand them on edge in a bin or drawer so that you can sort through them and see at a glance what you have. Smaller pieces might be rolled and stood up in a basket or bin.

,, Don't rely on sticky notes or anything else that could fall off too easily. For example, if a certain container holds glue, markers, and crayons, write that out and attach that to the container. This way, you will know what is in the container when you need to get something out of it in the future.

Label one box ""Trash,"" the other ""Storage,"" and the last box, ""Donate."" As you go through items in your home, figure out what to store, what to donate, and what to throw away. Keep the boxes close as you being the decluttering process so you can easily toss items as necessary., The process of decluttering can take a long time. To start, set specific goals for what you want to accomplish each day. Have both long and short term goals to keep you on track.Think about where to start. Pick a room or corner of your house to declutter first. For example, say you want to work on decluttering throughout the month of May. You can set a goal to get your kitchen done one weekend.
Keep a list or calendar outlining your goals. Have a series of small tasks (i.e., ""Clean out the silverware drawer"") that will get you to your larger goal (i.e., ""Declutter the kitchen."")

, Many people hang on to items unnecessarily. You may find things lying around you never bothered to throw out. You may also be hanging on to certain items unnecessarily. As you go through your home, toss anything you don't need or want anymore.As you move through any room, start by getting rid of anything you don't need. If you haven't used an item in years, it's time to throw it away or donate it. If you aren't regularly using something, you probably don't really need it. You will feel a lot better right away as you get rid of visual clutter, which can cause a lot of stress.
Push yourself to get rid of things. Many times, people hold onto things thinking they will use them. Be honest when you find an item you do not currently use. For example, you find a pari of damaged jeans you've been meaning to fix for years. Are you honestly going to get them fixed at this point? Probably not. It may be time to simply toss them.

, You will be surprised how much smoother and calmer your home feels simply by clearing off counters, bedside tables, and other surfaces. If you have anything sitting on a countertop that doesn't need to be there, find a new place for it.There's probably a lot sitting out on counters and desks that does not need to be there. Store old papers in drawers. Put books back on the shelves. Move clean dishes into cupboards instead of leaving them on the drying rack.
Kitchen appliances can take up a lot of counter space. See if there's somewhere else you can put such appliances. You can probably keep your toaster under the sink when it's not in use, for example.

, Drawers, especially junk drawers, can get messy fast. You may find yourself frustrated as you dig for an item you need. To streamline the process of locating items in your home, add containers add compartments to drawers.If you have a silverware drawer, pick up a silverware organizer at a local department store. You will have an easier time cooking and eating with the forks, knives, and spoons separated.
Add tiny containers to messy drawers. You will find it easier to locate, say, your nail polish if you keep all the bottles in a pencil box in a drawer in your bathroom.

, Shoe hangers can be used for more than just hanging shoes. If you want to make your home easier to navigate, purchase a variety of shoe hangers from a local department store. Use them for storage throughout your home.In closets, you can use shoe hangers for their intended purpose. You can also use them to store other items of clothing, like socks and belts, to free up floor space and drawer space.
Use shoe hangers in your bathroom. Hang a shoe hanger on the back of the bathroom drawer and put things like hair straighteners, hair products, makeup, and other bathroom items in the hanger.
You can use a shoe hanger in your kitchen. Remove items clogging up drawer space and set them in the hanger for easy access. You can, for example, have an electronic mixer strung up in a shoe hanger rather than buried under the sink.

, Losing your keys creates a lot of chaos. Have a place to regularly set your keys so you're not left scrambling to find them when leaving your home.You can set a decorative dish down at a table near your door. Make a point of always tossing your keys in here.
You can also have a rack to hang your keys on nailed up near your door.

, Cords also create a lot of chaos. This can get especially tricky if you have a lot of electronics in your home. You can purchase a cord organizer at a local department store. It will keep your cords separate so you can easily see what you're plugging and unplugging.You may want more than one cord organizer for different areas of your home. For example, have one in the living room and one in the kitchen.

, One of the biggest causes of chaos in a home is an overflowing stack of papers and mail. Have a designated to set things like receipts, mail, coupons, and other paper mess. Once a week, go through your stack and get rid of anything you don't need.Try to keep unwanted paper mess out of the way. You can have a drawer designated to slip papers until you have the time to sort through them. You can also set papers in a box on your desk or kitchen counter.

, You may notice a lot of chaos and disorganization in your cabinet drawers and closets. Purchase smaller boxes and bins. Use these to group clothing by type.Hang up fancier outfits, like nice tops, suits, and dresses.
For clothing stuck in drawers, box the clothes by type. You can have your t-shirts in one box, your jeans in another, and so on.
You should also group clothing by season. You can store summer clothes when winter comes, and vice versa, to free up storage space. You can easily, say, slip your bin of winter clothes under your bed when the weather starts warming up.

, If you want your home less chaotic, you have to work on managing your own personal routine. You will be better able to keep your home under control if you have a regular routine that you follow.Stick to healthy patterns. Eat regular meals, have a regular sleep/wake cycle, and exercise each day. Follow this routine as closely as you can.
If you're on a schedule, you'll find yourself better able to keep up with household chores. This can lead to a less chaotic home life.

, It's a small tweak, but it can be a powerful one. Making your bed makes your room look cleaner and more organized. Making your bed first thing in the morning will mean you start the day off motivated to keep your home neat and clean., Little messes can add up fast. A dirty mug on your desk or coffee table may not seem like a big deal. However, if you continuously let messes like this pile up, things will get out of hand fast. Make a habit of always putting dirty dishes in the sink. This way, when it's time to clean, you won't have to collect dirty dishes from around the house.Get other household members on board. Remind everyone who lives in your house to put their dishes in the sink when they're done.

, Leaving shoes and coats strewn about the house creates mess. This can leave your home feeling chaotic, creating unnecessary stress. Make sure to have a place to put coats and shoes.If you don't already have one, invest in a coat rack. You can also simply make a policy of hanging up your coats in the closet.
You can buy a small shoe rack to place near the door. You can also just have a particular corner of your entryway dedicated to storing shoes.

, If you let trash build up, this will create odor and mess. If you want your home to feel clean and chaos-free, get rid of trash right away. Always take the garbage out as soon as it is full.It can help to leave reminders for yourself. For example, on garbage day, leave a note by the door reminding you to set out the trash.

, If your home feels chaotic frequently, your schedule may be too packed. Look where you can simplify. Cut out extraneous hobbies and obligations so you can focus on what really matters.Write down all of your current obligations. Rank them in order of most important to least important.
Some obligations may not matter that much to you. If you can, cut these obligations out of your schedule. You will have more time to focus on creating a chaos free home.

Do a clean out and place all the papers, folders, books and other materials you don't want anymore, or don't really need, into piles.,

Do the same thing with folders.,
Sort the books.,
Ensure that the shelves look very organized.,
Use boxes, containers, and hooks to store and tidy.,
Have just a few minimal essentials on your side table, like an alarm clock or a phone if you have one.,
Add a few items without cluttering the look.","How to Organize Papers, Books and Objects in a Bedroom"," If you don't need it, but you still want it, put in one pile. If you don't want it, put it in a separate pile.


Consider the potential for reuse. The things you don't want could be reused for anything. You could make turn things into paper-mâché, or you could crumple them up for packing boxes. Anything you can think of. If you really can't think of anything, don't throw it away. Instead, recycle it. This will allow the paper to be reused for something more usable than paper-mâché, or maybe less usable, but sturdier.;
, For now, leave it alone somewhere where it cannot get in your way.

, Put it all into a pile, and put it on the very side of your desk. Choose any side you want., If you already have enough to do that, you can just use those binders.


Label all the binders, for example, you could label one binder ""Important Stuff,"" and another binder ""Homework and Schoolwork,"" while yet another binder could be labeled ""Puzzles and Games.""
When you're done labeling, sort everything you have into the binders by what the labels say. So all your schoolwork and homework, and all other related things, should be put into ""Homework and Schoolwork."" Then, puzzles and games to do, and all other related things, should go in ""Puzzles and Games.""

, You can label them, then slide them into the shelf, only you can have more. With folders, you may not be able to get enough. It's okay if you don't fill up the whole shelf with folders. If half of the shelf is filled, that's good enough. At least a quarter of the shelf should be filled.

, If you have books in your bedroom, sort them (in alphabetical order if you like) on the shelves very neatly. When you take out a book, always put it back in its correct place. Make sure you fit as many oops on each shelf as possible-the self should be about to burst, but if you have a shelf that bursts, cracks or breaks easily, don't even try putting oops on the shelf like that. You can even put books on shelves in the order you like them.

, This will make lots of space for other stuff. Put small trinkets in a box, and put it on the shelf. If you have smaller trinkets that you want to display, put them where you want to display them, but make them organized! You can even sort them by popularity, color, or alphabetical order (if possible.) If you find a small spot that you think could have a little something in it, place a small trinket from the box there, if any can fit.

, Put all your things that won't fit on the shelf right in a box, even label the box if you would like to. If most of your things are in a box, things not be so cluttered. Same thing with containers. Hooks, however, can be used t hang many things, and if you have something with a bunch of hooks attached to it, it can be a jewelry hanger, if you want one. Other hooks can hold hats, coats, pants, skirts, even some shoes, socks (though that would seem pretty abnormal,) and other clothing items. Handbags too.

, It's okay if you have some things on your bed, like blankets, quilts, extra pillows, stuffed animals, etc. but it's not okay at all to have other unrelated things on your bed, such as blocks, candy, Legos, electronics, or Barbies. All of those things go on shelves. If you do have those things on your bed, however, you may get easily poked when you're trying to sleep.Tidy up your bed, and if you would like to, under your bed.

, Wall decals are awesome, and so are posters and other things to make the wall look great. But don't overdo posters, because some are un-removable, some will leave marks when removed, and some will even leave half of them behind, stuck on the wall, that you won't be able to get off unless you redo the whole area. A few posters in each area-5 is great-is okay, but not everywhere, and especially not so much posters that you can't see what color the wall is.

, Work on the tool bench in the garage rather than the entire garage. Work on the pantry rather than the entire kitchen.

, You may wish to sit and crochet while at your favorite window seat. You may also enjoy reading at the same area.

, A wheelbarrow, shovel and watering can would be needed for gardening. Paints, brushes and canvas would be needed for painting. Thread, scissors and patterns would be needed for sewing.

, A wicker basket would be suitable for embroidery threads, a hoop, scissors and needles. A bookshelf would be suitable for your reading area. A small garden shed would be suitable adjacent to the garden gate.

, Containers should be movable if you wish to rearrange your area periodically. At times, toys may be stored in the living room, but then moved into your child's bedroom when guests arrive. Transfer your chair and bookcase to a new sitting area. Take your knitting basket to a chair with the most sunlight.

, Use a mug to measure rather than buying a measuring cup. Use a cooking pot as a mixing bowl. Use a fork as a whisk.

, Place a silverware basket on the kitchen counter for use with food preparation. Transfer the basket to the kitchen table for use while dining. Use a cosmetic basket at the mirror in your bedroom or at the mirror in the bathroom.

, Use an old purse as a jewelry case or sewing kit. Recycle a glass jar to arrange a few flowers on the windowsill. Use an old suitcase to store your shoes under the bed.

, Fold your colorful bath towels on a shelf near the shower. Use a small wicker basket for decorative soaps.

, If you frequently travel, make a separate cosmetic case just for such an occasion. If you walk in the park, pack a small shoulder bag with your iPod and sunglasses. Keep a small first-aid kit in an envelope in the glove compartment of your car.

, Use your desk area to write bills, do your artwork or place a towel over your desk to do your ironing. Lounge or study while on your bed. Hang a quilt over the back of a rocking chair as display and as a cushion.

, Hooks at the entry are convenient for your keys, purse and coat. Attach an additional hook in the kitchen for the convenience of an extra kitchen towel.

, Keep your items stored away in their containers. Dust, then vacuum once the dust settles to the floor. Items can rapidly collect dust leading to allergies, respiratory discomfort and more cleaning.

, Use an open basket with a handle for cleaning products. Carry it throughout the house and store it conveniently beneath the kitchen sink. Use a covered container for buttons. Use a Ziploc bag for things that need to kept clean, such as a handmade heirloom. Use Ziploc bags for toys with small pieces.

Cut off the lower portion of a cardboard box and use it as a cover.
Cut the handle of a milk jug into a scoop. Use the bottom of a milk jug as a waterproof container. Scoop pet food and provide water to your pet while outdoors.
Attach a long string to either side of a coffee can for berry picking. Place the string around your neck so that your hands are free to pick. Cover the can with a plastic lid.
Reuse a glass jar for small notions to be easily seen.
Reuse a glass jar for food storage.

, Learn to live with less. Having less means less to organize.

, Organizing small portions of your life will provide convenience and ease in doing things.

Keep like with like.,
Put the heaviest or bulkiest items on the bottom.,
Consider whether folding or rolling works best.,
Make good use of baskets for loose and small items.,
Keep with the routine.",How to Have a Tidy Linen Closet," It makes good common sense to keep the same items together in the linen closet. For example:


Put all the bed linen together. Some people prefer to put the sheet set together (fitted sheet, flat sheet, pillow cases) and keep it intact. Others prefer to separate into fitted sheet piles, flat sheet piles, pillowcase piles. It all depends on how fussed you are about mix and match, your personal preference, and what your space permits.
Put all the towels together. It is a good idea to separate into: bath towels, beach towels, bath sheets, hand towels,
Keep face washers in a small basket or container. This makes them much easier to contain and find.
Keep tea-towels in a container for fast retrieval.
Keep serviettes (napkins) in a container as well.
Put tablecloths together.
Miscellaneous items such as table runners, doilies, sheet clips, sewing basket, etc, can all be kept together on one shelf.;
, It is much easier to pick up and pull out heavier and bulkier items if they are at the bottom level of the closet. This allows you to kneel down to get them out and there is no risk of them falling on you. Quilts, sheet sets, blankets, etc., are all best placed at the bottom of the closet.

, Some items will fit more neatly rolled, such as towels, face washers, and blankets. Try different ways of fitting the items in to see what fits and to check the ease of removal/addition.

, These look nice, are easy to see, and keep things neat. If you have space, consider adding wire baskets to the inner side of the linen closet door to provide you with additional space.

, Once you have the linen closet sorted, be disciplined to keep it in order. Once this becomes an ingrained habit, you will appreciate how much easier it is to find your linen!

"
"
Have as many shelves as possible.,
Sort linen into types or groups.,
Make use of containers, boxes, etc.,
Place the least used items at the very top of the linen closet.,
Place heavier items on the floor of the linen closet.,
Make use of the door space in a linen closet for small items.",How to Organise a Linen Closet," This makes the linen closet the most useful. Shelves allow you to organise vertically, not just stacking things. You can easily by hanging shelves from most major retailers like target, which are cost-effective ways to maximise space.









Spacing between shelves should be about 40 centimeter (15.7 in) height. This allows for stacking and easy access. Any taller and the piles will be too tall and will topple easily.;
, Put towels together, sheets together, pillow cases together, etc.









Another method is to create piles or shelves by room, such as master bedroom, child's bedroom, guest bedroom, bathroom, dining room, etc.

, to keep like objects grouped together. Baskets, plastic containers, pull-out drawers on wheels, etc., all make great dividing containers to keep items separate. Towels, face washers, tablecloths, tea towels, and serviettes (napkins) will all fit into these containers easily, and can then be labelled to easily organise them.








, For example, sleeping bags, picnic rugs, guest sheets, dining table linen, etc. can all go up the top.









Try to keep infrequently used linen in packaging or bags for added protection and organisation.

, This is where you can keep your sewing machine, small appliances, a picnic basket, sewing items, etc.








, Hang wire baskets on the door; just check that the door shuts easily into the linen closet first. This can hold sewing items, feather dusters, light bulbs, shoelaces, fabric or name markers, etc. for easy finding.

Keep a note pad next to your bed.",How to Keep Your Home Organized Daily," Making your bed takes all of five minutes, but at the end of a busy day, when you can retreat to an inviting bed you will be able to feel the stresses of the day slip away as you slip under the covers. Make it a daily chore for your children to make their beds too. It will help your home look neater and teach them responsibility.;
, If you do not have a washer with a timer, gather the load in the morning and throw it into the machine. As soon as you walk through the door in the evening get the load started so it will be ready to transfer to the dryer just before you sit down for dinner. The dryer will be done by the time you are finished cleaning up the dishes and you will be ready to fold the clothes and put them away. Doing a load of laundry every day adds only minutes to your daily routine, but when you do not have to spend your entire weekend trying to dig yourself out from underneath a mountain of dirty laundry, you will be glad you took those extra few minutes throughout the week.

, If you know exactly what you are going to make for dinner each night you will save yourself so much time that would have been wasted standing in front of the open refrigerator wondering what you can make. Pull anything out of the freezer that needs to defrost during the day, chop up some veggies or marinate something. If there is anything you can do in the morning to make the dinner time rush go smoother, do it.

, Blending errands into your daily routine will save you the hassle of having to run all over town on the weekends. Can you make a stop during your lunch hour? Can you drop something off on your way in to work or can you swing by and pick something up on your way home? Doing your errands throughout the week will save you a lot of time in the long run.

, Although you are exhausted at the end of the day and it is tempting to put the dishes in the sink with the thought that you will do them in the morning, how many times has the next morning come and you get busy with other things? When this happens you wind up leaving the house with the dishes still undone and you have to come home to an untidy kitchen. Make a point to spend the extra ten minutes cleaning up the kitchen after dinner so that you can start each new day with a fresh clean slate instead of getting behind and letting things pile up.

, Make this a family chore. Take five or ten minutes to do a sweep through the living room and put everything back where it belongs. Leaving things laying around is exactly how mountains get created out of molehills.

, Life may not always allow for strict schedules, but try to keep things as consistent as possible so that your kids know what to expect and what is expected of them. Choose a time that you will be able to stick to most nights of the week and dedicate it to homework. Turn off the television and eliminate any other distractions so that your kids can sit down and really focus on their studies. Right after dinner is a good time for this if possible. The kids can sit at the table while you are cleaning up after dinner. You can spend time together while still accomplishing the task at hand and you are readily available for any questions they may have.

, We all know how much easier it can make the morning rush to have your children choose their clothes the night before. Practice what you preach and choose your own outfit the night before. Remove all necessary items from the closet or dresser drawers and lay them out so they are close at hand. The precious minutes you save when you don't have to try to decide what you will wear could make the difference between running late and being right on time.

, Explain to all of your family members what is expected of them when you say it is time for bed. This would include things like bathing and brushing their teeth, putting their clothes in the laundry hamper, changing into their pajamas, choosing their clothes for the next day and getting into bed. Practice this so that when you say ""it's time for bed,"" they know exactly what to do. If you do not have to follow them around telling them what to do next, while they are executing their routine, you will have time to take care of any last minute details you need to accomplish before calling it a day. If your kids need some motivation, create a reward system for each night that they can successfully accomplish their bedtime routine all by themselves.

, It is always just as we are getting ready to retire for the day that we remember something we have to do tomorrow. Be prepared for these end of the day ideas with a note pad at hand to write down anything you must remember. The next morning, simply pull off the top sheet of paper and put it in your pocket or purse to refer to later in the day.

Do you want to take on your closet? Is there a giant pile of dirty and clean clothes in the corner? Are all your video games littering the floor? These three things will seem to make the most progress and will keep you motivated to finish the entire room.


It's good to keep the amount of time you have in mind, too. If you only have half an hour, spend ten minutes on each task. If you have all day, you can get to deep cleaning. With time constraints, it's best to tackle each little bit so you feel as if you made a lot of little efforts toward progress.;
, Clean clothes should be hanging in a closet or a wardrobe, or folded on shelves – don't just throw them on your bed! There are several factors as to how to organize your clothes, and here are a few thoughts:The clothes you wear the most should be the easiest to access. This way you don't rip through all of your clothes every day trying to find that piece you want to wear.
Consider organizing your clothes by color or season, too. They'll be easier to find this way and you'll know right where to go.
We'll talk more about storage in a bit, but when it comes to your closet or wardrobe, try to utilize all the space. Put shelves above or below your closet rod, buy some boxes, and stack, stack, stack.

, You probably have a handful of items each day that you take from their proper places, and as the days tick by, this can turn into quite the mess. Take a moment to grab everything you use regularly and organize it on a space on your table or on a shelf that is easily accessible and that is now space for these specific items. Next time you need it, you'll grab it and be able to put it right back where you found it.


Figure out how you want to organize your books. If you read on a regular basis, and even if you don't, you need to keep it organized. You may organize by priority, category, then finally in alphabetical order.
It's good to develop a system, a blueprint in your head of your room. When you know that books, for example, go here, next time you walk into your room, instead of throwing it on the floor, you go right to the spot where it belongs.

, Separate and put away the makeup and other items that you only use for special occasions from your everyday items. The unused products can be kept in the bathroom or in a box in your closet. Then, throw away the crumbly, broken, or undesirable items you know you'll never use – they're just cluttering your space.


Often this type of item can be put out of sight. Keep them in a storage container, under the bed, or even in a linen closet.

, When you're done playing video games, put their cases back, roll the wires up and put all the pieces of equipment away. As for your computer, you can leave it at your desk, but organize around it. Put away your notebooks, textbooks, writing supplies, and whatever else into drawers or aligned nicely in the corner.


You may want to take a second and think about what you don't actually need on your desk. What do you never use? You'll be able to be more productive at your desk if it's not cluttered.

, Unless you are doing a science experiment on how to attract flies, keep food and dirty dishes out of your room. They look bad, can get messy, attract bugs and sometimes small rodents, and they'll stink up your room.


If you have a habit of eating in your room, make sure to keep a garbage container or trash can easily accessible. This way something doesn't end up on the floor and forgotten about for weeks, leading to disaster. Instead, you can just throw it right away.

, Looking to get your room nice and sparkly? If you have carpet, vacuum your floors. Wood or tile? Sweep and mop. Also wipe down your surfaces for dust and residue with a damp cloth and some all-purpose cleaner. Spray a good-smelling spray and you're good to go!


Not all cleaners are safe for all surfaces. Check the label beforehand to make sure the one you're using is appropriate for the items in your room.

, Now that your room is clean, you're going to want to keep it that way. One of the simplest things you can do every day (or nearly every day) to give your room that ""still clean"" feel is to make your bed. It takes minutes and can completely change the feel of your room.


You can probably get away with not really making it, for the record. Just organize the comforter (or whatever is on top), fluff the pillows, and no one will have a clue.

, Another way rooms get messy quickly is when we throw our clothes on the floor. Either we're changing into new ones or clean ones end up on the floor when we're picking out the day's outfit. To avoid a mountain of clothes forming, tackle this issue every day. When it's just a few pieces, it'll take a matter of seconds.


You probably go through one or two pairs of shoes a day, too. Instead of kicking them off and wondering where they wind up, put them back in their spot – ideally a shoe rack or other designated area.

, How easy is it to take all your clean laundry, dump it on your bed, and call it a day? Too easy, that's what. Unfortunately, then you wind up with yet another pile of clothes to deal with and they're clean, sure, but now they're wrinkly.Resist the urge to be lazy and put them away when they're fresh out of the dryer. You'll be glad you did.


Again, make sure you're putting it back how you want it – not just putting it back so it gets out of the way. Your closet needs to stay organized as much as your room does.

, Every day you probably go through a handful of things: a book or two, some toiletries, some papers, video games, make up, etc. Take a second to put everything back in its place that you've used today, even if you need it tomorrow.


Alright, if you need it tomorrow, you can go easy on yourself. Just put the items in an easily accessible area that you can grab and go when necessary. A mid-level shelf is a good bet.

, It's pretty difficult to organize any room if you don't have a way to store your belongings. To get jazzed about staying organized, get some pieces for storage that you like and don't mind looking at. Some colorful boxes, some shelves, a shoe or towel rack, and a closet organizer can do wonders. When you can utilize the space you have, your room can open up and seem much, much larger.


Try to be innovative if you don't want to make a trip to the store. An umbrella holder can hold cylindrical items, like a yoga mat.Gift boxes can be used for small knickknacks. What do you have around that could be put to good use?

, Let's say you're out shopping for an end table. You don't want just a table – you want an end table with built-in shelves. Look for pieces that serve two functions – not only do they do their job, but they're also good for storage.


Another example is a frame for your bed. When your bed is lifted up off the floor, all of a sudden you have a ton of hidden storage space underneath it, keeping even large items from cluttering your room.

, When you have a whole bunch of things in front of you and you don't know how to organize them (whether they're clothes or video games), aim to keep everything you use regularly at hand or eye level. Everything you don't use can be put on the floor or above your head. It keeps these areas organized since you don't mess with them often and makes it easy for you to find what you need.Sometimes this requires overhauling your entire closet or bookshelf. If that's the case, so be it. You'll be glad you did when you're done, and your closet or shelving unit will look like new.

, Once your closet and room get organized, it's surprisingly easy to let it slip back into disarray. A good way to make it easy on yourself is to put labels on boxes and storage pieces. Then when you have a piece and you don't remember where it goes, the labels do the work for you.


Choose a label that matches the feel of your room. You can either print them out on your computer or buy premade labels from the store. Use a permanent marker to label them, put them away, and your room will be in total order.

Wash the chamois in warm, soapy water.,
Fold the chamois over several times and wring out thoroughly.,
Rinse the chamois thoroughly.,
Hang the chamois up to dry.",How to Prepare a Genuine Leather Chamois for Use," Fill a sink or bucket with warm soapy water. Be sure to use a mild soap designed for cleaning vehicle finishes (car wash soap).;
, When cleaning a chamois, do not use soaps intended for general or other uses. Dish soaps, especially degreasers such as dawn, that are intended to break up grease and oils will strip the protective tanning oils from the chamois cloth leaving the leather unprotected (and if used on a vehicle will completely strip the wax finish).


The unprotected leather will become stiff and begin to fall apart. Other degreasers, such as Simple Green, will have the same effect. Laundry detergents will also break down and remove the chamois’ protective tanning oils so laundering or using these types of soaps should also be avoided.

, Soak the chamois in clean rinse water. Fold the chamois over several times and twist until all of the water is squeezed out. As excess tanning oils are removed, the soapy water and the rinse water will take on a yellow tint.


These excess oils help preserve the chamois during shipping, if stored for long periods, or when stored in a hot dry climate, but it is important to remove these before using. If not removed, the oils may streak on a surface of the vehicle. This process is also essential for removing any lint produced during the buffing process.
In order to avoid leaving lint or streaks on the vehicle’s finish, steps 1 and 2 should be repeated, with clean water, until the rinse water is no longer tinted yellow and is completely clear.

, Once the cloth has be properly cleaned, it is ready for immediate use or can be hung up to dry.


If the chamois cloth isn’t used immediately, it should be stretched back to its original form (which is roughly rectangular) by pulling on opposite edges until the desired shape is achieved. Once back to its original form, the chamois should be hung, away from direct sunlight, up to dry completely.
Leaving a little soap (car wash soap) in the cloth when storing will not damage the cloth. Never store a chamois wet by balling it up or putting it in a sealed bag.
As a chamois dries, it will become extremely stiff, due to its ability to completely release water, but can easily be re-softened by wetting it. It can also be re-softened for dry use by rubbing the cloth against itself or drawing it across the edge of a clean surface.

Obtain the necessary materials.,
Pull some of the tape from the dispenser roll.,
Clasp the tape onto the roller.,
Wrap as much tape as you want around the cylinder.,
Use your new lint roller.",How to Make Your Own Lint Roller1," You will need:A cylindrical object. A cardboard tube may be the best option, but a thick wooden dowel would work as well. The circumference should be several inches in length; if the cylinder is too small it will not work as a roller.
Tape. Nearly type of tape will do. Masking tape is probably closest to the sticky paper used on most lint rollers. Wide rolls of tape are the easiest to use, but any can be made to work.
Scissors (if the tape does not come with a cutting tool).;
, Just pull 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm) of tape loose at once. Do not cut it yet.








, Use a portion of the sticky side of the tape to attach it to the cylinder. After it is secure, gently wrap the tape around the cylinder in the opposite direction (glue side out). You may need to hold the tape in place with your finger for the first few moments after you change directions.









Leave the ends of the cylinder exposed. You can hold onto it at these ends.
If you are using narrow strips of tape, start by attaching the tape near one end of the cylinder, and then with each wrap move the tape further down toward the other end. After you approach the end of the side opposite to the one you started on, you can reverse the process. It will work best if you make sure there is a slight overlap as you wrap the tape around in order to stick the tape to itself.

, You may find it most efficient to wrap an entire roll of tape at one time, enabling you to use the roller for quite some time before you will have to repeat this process again.

This is obviously a method of convenience (how long would you really want a tape roll on your hand anyhow?), so there is no need to use too much at a time.
Do not wrap the tape too tightly (you will see why in a moment).

Run the water slowly and gently.",How to Fill a Bucket in a Small Sink," Also find a dustpan; the dustpan must have a curved, hollow and high-sided handle with a hole at the end. This is because it will act like a pipe, to funnel the water to the bucket.
, It must be aligned directly under the dustpan handle.

If you have a stool to place the bucket on, this may make it easier as it will raise the bucket up from the ground, but the lip of the bucket must still come under the sink top, to allow the water to flow in easily.

, Have the handle facing outward, over the bucket., The water will run down from the sink and into the bucket via the hole in the end. Adjust if needed; keep a careful eye on the stream of water to ensure it's not ending up on the floor."

Run an empty cycle.,
Clean dishwasher once a week.,
Remove grime once a month.",How to Clean Household Cleaning Tools1," Every few weeks add bleach in the soap box or a cup of vinegar and run on the highest temperature.;
, Clean your dishwasher by leaving it open to cool after you run it about once per week. That way all the steam can escape and it won’t build up on the racks in your dishwasher.

, Wipe down the bottom section of your dishwasher about once per month with paper towels or lint-free cloths to remove any grime. You can also use clean water and dish soap for stuck on bits of food or soap that won’t easily come off.

Make a paste.,
Spread the paste on the iron’s plate.,
Get a clean cloth wet.,
Use a cotton swab to clean the steam holes.,
Fill the reservoir.,
Turn on the iron.,
Iron a clean cloth for a few minutes.,
Turn off the iron and let it cool.",How to Clean an Iron1," Mix together a paste of 1 tablespoon water and 2 tablespoons baking soda. The paste should be a bit runny, but still thick enough so that it can stick to the plate of your iron.Use filtered or distilled water, if you can.;
, You can apply the paste directly to the plate. If your iron is only dirty in one place, you don’t have to spread the mixture all over. If you are just doing a general cleaning, it is also OK to spread the paste over the entire plate.








You can use your fingers to apply the paste or you can use a spatula.
You can leave this paste sitting on the iron for a few minutes if there is a lot of buildup on the iron.

, You will use this to remove the paste, so make sure it is clean. Get the cloth wet. Wring out any excess water, and then wipe off the paste that you have spread onto the iron.









Spread the paste on generously, especially if your iron is very dirty.

, Dip the cotton swab (the kind that people use to clean their ears) into some fresh distilled water. Clean out each of the steam holes using the cotton swab.








You may need to use more than one cotton swab if there is a lot of gunk coming out of the holes. Use a new cotton swab if there is a lot of buildup stuck on the swab.

, If there is any old water leftover in the iron, be sure to empty it out first. You can do this by opening the hatch to the reservoir and turning it upside down. After it is empty, use distilled or filtered water, and fill the reservoir about 1/3 of the way.









You can also fill the reservoir with a mixture of 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup white vinegar for a stronger cleaning solution. However, you should read your iron’s instruction manual to make sure that it will tolerate vinegar.

, Turn the iron to it’s highest setting, and make sure the steam setting is on. In this step, the steam and heat will clean out gunk and mineral deposits caught deep in the steam holes.









Be careful when working with a hot iron. Don’t get burned by the steam that will be released by the iron.

, Choose a clean cloth that you don’t mind getting dirty. If there is dirt caught inside the iron it may leave brown streaks on your cloth. All you need to do now is iron the cloth to help clean out the iron. If you have a manual steam button, press the button often to help release even more steam.








A kitchen towel will probably work well for this.

, Make sure that you place the iron on a protected surface (e.g. a kitchen counter covered with a towel). As the iron cools, more old sediment might drip out of the iron.


If there is any leftover water in the reservoir, be sure to remove it.

Remove the broom head.,
Vacuum the broom bristles.,
Bang your broom on a hard surface.",How to Clean Brooms1," Many broom sticks are threaded, which allows you to unscrew the broom head from the broom stick. Having the broom head separated from the stick can make it easier to clean your broom., Before you get the bristles wet, it’s important to remove as much debris as possible. Use the upholstery attachment to remove any debris from your broom. If you don't have an upholstery attachment, you can just use your hands to pull debris off.







, You can only get so much dirt off the bristles with your hands or vacuum. Bang the broom against the ground to loosen up and shake off any dirt that might be clinging to the bristles.







"
"
Mix dish soap with warm water.,
Soak the broom for an hour.,
Rinse the broom.,
Disinfect the broom handle.,
Hang the broom up to dry.",How to Clean Brooms2," Because brooms are large, you'll need to mix the soap and water in a bucket to ensure the broom head can fully soak. Fill a small bucket with warm water and add a few squirts of liquid dish soap. Mix the soap and water together until it’s sudsy.







, This gives the soap a chance to work into the broom bristles. It also allows the soap to disinfect your broom.








If the broom is used somewhere where germs are more likely to accumulate, like a bathroom, add a drop of two of bleach to the bucket.

, Holding the broom head under a running faucet, rub the bristles between your fingers. Do this until all the detergent has run off the bristles and the water runs clear.







, While the broom head is soaking, wipe down the broom handle. You can use any type of disinfecting cleaning wipe to wipe down the handle. You can also dip a cloth in the bucket the broom head is soaking in and use that to wipe down the handle.







, You can also lean the broom-head up against an outdoor wall, since drying in the sunlight can help kill off any bacteria. Make sure the broom is completely dry before you use it again – you don’t want to drag wet dirt across your floor.

Rinse your sponge thoroughly.,
Place your sponge in a solution of water and lemon juice.,
Microwave the wet sponge while carefully monitoring it.,
Remove the sponge with tongs.",How to Clean and Sanitize a Sponge1," Never microwave a sponge that has any metal on it. Metal reflects microwaves, causing them to move around erratically, which can cause sparking, fire, and damage to your microwave. To be safe, don't use a metal scouring pad or anything else that contains metal in your microwave., There should be no food or dirt visible in it. You can use a little dish soap to help get it clean. Wring it out to remove excess water., Pour about a 1/2 cup of water into a bowl and add a teaspoon of lemon juice. Soak the sponge in the solution until it is drenched. The lemon juice will help your sponge to smell clean and fresh when removing it from the microwave, and the water is necessary so that the sponge doesn't burn., Place the sponge in the microwave for about two minutes on high. Make sure to monitor the sponge vigilantly to watch for any signs of burning. Be sure to only microwave wet sponges and to turn off the microwave immediately if you see any smoke. Microwaves kill over 99% of germs to make your sponge sanitized and clean.Because types of microwaves and types of sponges vary, some sponges may only need a minute in the microwave.
You can put the sponge directly in the microwave or on a small plate if you prefer.

, Your sponge will be freshly sanitized and will also be very hot. Let it sit in the microwave for a couple of minutes to cool off. Remove it carefully, using tongs or oven mitts. It is ready to go! Be sure to sanitize your sponges regularly, at least once a week, for best results."

Clean and maintain your vacuum cleaner.,
Keep your broom and dustpan cleaned and maintained.,
Sanitize your sponges and other scrubbing tools.,
Wash mop heads and cleaning cloths in the washing machine.",How to Clean and Maintain Housecleaning Tools and Equipment," A vacuum cleaner is an essential piece of household equipment, and it needs more frequent maintenance than perhaps any other piece of equipment in your home.


It is important to keep the bag or canister on a vacuum cleaned and empty. Air needs to be able to flow through this compartment, and if airflow is blocked by dust and debris, the vacuum will work inefficiently. Bagless vacuums should be emptied after each use. Bagged models should have their bags replaced when they are about 1/3 full.
Replacing or cleaning the air filter is also important. Every few uses the vacuum cleaner's air filter should be cleaned. This can usually be done by removing built-up dust with your fingers. After several months to a year, the filter on most models will need to be replaced.






Cleaning the brush roll is another important step. The brush roll is the spinning portion of the vacuum that brushes dirt up from the floor into the vacuum; it easily becomes wrapped in hair and other long fibers. This hair and debris can be removed either with your fingers or with scissors.





;
, A broom is another essential household tool, and one that gets dirty and damaged fairly quickly. Bent, dirtied bristles will not clean as effectively. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to keep your broom in better shape over its life.


Store your broom off of the ground. Use a hook to hang your broom against a wall or from a ceiling. Storing the broom on its bristles will contribute to bent and split bristles that don't clean effectively.
Comb the broom's bristles regularly. This is the best way to clear out the dust and dirt that becomes lodged throughout the bristles. An old, inexpensive plastic comb is usually sufficient for this task.
Wash both the broom and dustpan with soap and water. You can occasionally wash the entire broom and dustpan with a mild dish soap and water to keep it clean. Pat the tool dry or allow it to air dry afterwards.

, Sponges and abrasive scrubbing pads are great tools for washing dishes, wiping down flat surfaces, and scrubbing tough areas like bathtubs and utility sinks. These sponges can quickly become covered with bacteria, however, so cleaning them is crucial.


Soak the sponges in a mild bleach solution for 5 minutes for the most effective bacteria reduction. If you don't want to use bleach, soaking the sponges in undiluted vinegar will also kill over 99 percent of bacteria.
Other effective options for sanitizing sponges including running them through the dishwasher with your dishes and heating them in the microwave. In the microwave, saturate the sponge with water and heat it on the highest setting for 2 full minutes.

, Other important housecleaning tools include microfiber cleaning cloths, terrycloth rags, and mop heads. All of these items can be cleaned in the washing machine using regular detergent. Microfiber cloths are best allowed to air dry rather than being tumble-dried in a dryer.

Make sure there aren’t any large chunks of food on it, but you don’t need to clean it ahead of time., Make sure to use the heated dry setting for maximum sterilization. Run it through the full cycle on a regular dish setting; just make sure the water is hot. Use the same dish detergent that you normally would, preferably one that is antibacterial., Make sure to do this at least once a week. You can simply throw in your sponge each time you run a load of dishes. The dishwasher will both clean and sanitize your sponge, killing over 99% of germs and removing any grime.Wash and sterilize your sponge immediately if you use it to clean a surface that has touched raw meat or fish.

Remove the sponge with a spoon or tongs.",How to Clean and Sanitize a Sponge3," Use a 3-quart pot and fill it 3/4 to the top with cold water. Bring the water to a boil by placing it on the stove. Turn the burner on high until the water boils. Keep the pot covered to heat the water faster.

, Clean off any excess food or grime that is sticking to it. You want the sponge to be fairly clean before immersing it in water so that it isn’t soaking in anything dirty. Simply run it under warm water and clean it with a little dish soap. Wring out any excess water.

, Make sure not to burn your hands. Remove the pot’s lid and slowly lower the sponge into the water. You can place the sponge in the water using a cooking spoon or tongs to avoid burning your fingers. The sponge should be covered in water. Make sure it doesn’t rest on the bottom of the pot or it could melt. To keep it from sticking to the pot, stir it occasionally.


Turn down the burner down to medium-high so that the water doesn’t boil over.

, This is enough time to reduce bacteria from millions to a safe number. Keep the pot uncovered and make sure the sponge isn’t sticking to the edges., It will be very hot. Place it on a clean surface to thoroughly air-dry, such as a dish rack. This will keep bacteria from multiplying. After it has cooled for about 10 minutes, you can wring out the sponge to remove excess water and help it to dry faster."

Use strong trash bags.,
Take trash out frequently.,
Compost food scraps.,
Recycle cans, bottles, and cardboard.,
Double-bag stinky items.,
Choose an odor absorber.",How to Control Garbage Bin Odors1," If food never touches the inside of your garbage bin, it won’t have the chance to smell. The best way to ensure this is by using the thickest trash bags you can get, so they won’t tear or leak. If you want a little extra protection, there are odor-reducing trash bags available, as well., If your garbage doesn’t marinate in the garbage bin, it won’t get the chance to smell as bad! Remove the bag from the trash can at least once a week. Ideally, you should coordinate this time with the time your city collects the garbage., The scraps and leftovers you produce when cooking are some of the biggest culprits in making the trash smell bad. Collect them, and you can help your garden (or a city garden) and simultaneously keep your garbage bin cleaner. Compost can be kept in a pile or sealed bin outside, or in a container in the freezer., It’s not just good for the environment; it’s good for your trashcan. Recyclables take up a lot of space in the bin, and food can spill on cardboard and smell bad quickly. Rinse recyclables like bottles and cans that had food touching them, and keep them in a separate bin., If you’re working with food scraps that get smelly extra-fast, like meat, fish bones, or cheese rinds, defend your trashcan and nose from them. Pop them in a smaller plastic bag, then seal it with a knot or twist tie, before chucking them into the can., Most of the smell of a trash can is concentrated at the bottom, so it makes sense to place something at the bottom to soak up the stench. There are a few different options, but whatever you choose, remember to switch it up every couple of weeks. Otherwise, it will stop serving its purpose.


Baking soda is a classic and inexpensive odor absorber. Sprinkle a generous layer along the bottom of the garbage bin.Cat litter was made to combat bad smells, so it’s an ideal odor absorber, as well. Sprinkle it along the bottom of the bin, and make sure it doesn’t get wet and clump up.Dryer sheets are a miracle of science--they can de-static your clothes and keep your trash can from smelling. Put one or two in a scent you like in the can."
"
Do a simple cleaning once a week.,
Deodorize with vinegar.,
Hose down the trash can.,
Use bleach to sterilize.",How to Control Garbage Bin Odors2," Incorporate a wipe-down of your garbage can into your weekly cleaning schedule. If you wash the trash can frequently, you may find that strong smells take much longer to build up. Start with an empty bin, then follow these steps (preferably outside).Wipe out any chunks with a wet paper towel.
Spray down with a bleach-based disinfectant, and distribute evenly with a dry paper towel.
Let the disinfectant dry. Ideally, place the can outside while this happens.

, After washing the trash can, you may notice that it looks clean, but still smells strange. You can deodorize without using household cleaners by making a solution of one part vinegar to three parts water. Fill a spray bottle with the mixture, coat the inside of the trash can, then wipe with a dry paper towel., Every once in a while--perhaps every three months--you should give the can a deep clean. Giving your trashcan a bath is time-consuming, but the squeaky-clean results are worth it. Make sure the trash can is positioned on a surface that you can flood with soapy water (like the driveway), then follow these steps.Squirt about 10 seconds’ worth of dishwashing liquid into the bottom of the bin.
Aim the hose into the bottom, and fill up the can until it’s about a quarter full. If you can “pressure wash” with the hose’s nozzle, so much the better.
Pour out the soapy liquid, then rinse with plain water and allow the can to dry in the sun., If you want to be really thorough about the cleaning process, pour a little bleach or bleach-based disinfectant onto a paper towel, then wipe down the inside of the trash can with it. This is only safe to do if the dishwashing liquid you used does not have a message on the bottle saying “do not mix with bleach.”"

Don't flush most medications.,
Mix medications with kitty litter or coffee grounds.,
Place the mixture in a plastic bag and seal it.,
Throw the bag away with your trash.,
Remove the labels from the empty medicine bottles.",How to Dispose of Medication1," In recent years it has been discovered that flushing certain medications that contain hormones, antibiotics, and other substances can lead to contamination of groundwater and other detrimental effects. Instead of flushing these medications, the safest way to dispose of them is to disguise them and then throw them away with your trash.


Read the packaging on the medication and look for instructions on safe disposal.
There are certain medications considered to be too potentially harmful to throw out with the trash. If the medication is a highly controlled substance that could cause severe medical harm to someone else if they were to ingest it, the FDA recommends flushing it or disposing of it in another way.
If you're not sure whether the medication you want to get rid of is considered to be highly controlled, ask your pharmacist what to do.;
, Mixing either pills or liquids with an undesirable substance like kitty litter or coffee grounds will make it much less likely that a child or household pet will find and ingest the substance.


If the pills are large or brightly colored, crush them or dissolve them before mixing them with another substance.

, This extra level of protection is another way to make sure the medication won't fall into the wrong hands., Once the medication is thoroughly disguised and sealed in a bag, simply throw it out with your trash.

, Scrape off the labels so that the print is illegible before you throw the bottles away. This measure is taken to protect your identity.

"

Determine whether your medication is considered potentially dangerous.,
Look into community drug disposal programs.,
Flush if you have no other option.,
Finished.

",How to Dispose of Medication2," The FDA has published a list of medications that it recommends against throwing away with the trash. If someone were to find and ingest these medications, he or she could face serious health consequences., Many communities have programs that allow you to bring in unused medications so that they can be disposed of safely and properly.


Call a local pharmacy to find out if they can dispose of your medication. In some states, although not all, they have an unused medication disposal program that the pharmacies themselves may use to dispose of outdated medications.
Consider donating your unused medications to third world countries. There are organizations you can find online. Alternatively, consider contacting your local Emergency Rooms, occasionally they will collect usable supplies and medications for donation out-country.
Call your local trash service - they might have household waste facilities that will incinerate the medication.
Contact your local hospital or medical center who will place unused medications into their Bio Hazard containers for incineration. All hospitals have this option so there is never a need to toss or flush unused medication., If your medication is on the FDA's list of medications that should not be thrown out, and you have no other immediate way of disposing of them, flushing might be the best option.,"

Back up important personal data.,
Permanently remove all personal data from the computer.,
Choose an option for disposal.,
If reusing, selling, or giving away your computer, clean it.",How to Safely Get Rid of an Old Computer1," Once your computer is gone, it's (most likely) gone forever, so be sure that you've made copies of any and all files on the computer that you'll need in the future. Be conservative - it's always better to back up too much information than too little.


You may use a USB stick or an external hard drive to store your important information - both of these are available at electronics stores. Additionally, a storage method that's become available in the last few years is the use of cloud drives, which can be free to casual users with the registration of an account.

, Once your important information has been backed up, it's wise to delete it from the computer so that future users or identity thieves can't access it. Deleting data by putting it in the recycle bin or your computer's equivalent can actually leave it on your hard drive in a form that's possible for savvy individuals to recover. This means that, usually, rendering your computer completely free of personal information requires formatting its hard drive.


Formatting a hard drive is irreversible and will essential make your computer a ""blank slate"" - free of not just your personal data but of basically all data - so make absolutely sure you're done with your computer before doing this.

, There's no one ""right way"" to get rid of an old computer - depending on how well it works and your own computing needs, you may choose to re-purpose the computer for another use, sell it or give it away so that someone else can use it, or allow it to be recycled and/or disposed of in an environmentally safe way.


You may also wish to physically remove certain parts of the computer, like the hard drive or video card, so that you can use them in the future, but only remove parts from the inside of your computer if you're confident you can do so safely or you have access to experienced help.

, If you don't believe your computer has reached the end of its life, take this opportunity to give it a fresh start by thoroughly cleaning it. Wipe the exterior and the screen with a slightly damp (not wet) rag or mild chemical wipe. Be sure to pay attention to the gaps in between keys on the keyboard, which can become disgusting with long-term use. Use a Q-tip to clean these hard-to-reach spaces. For a deep clean, open the computer's inner compartment and use compressed air to remove dust.

Use your computer as a small file server.,
Keep your computer as a backup.,
Consider installing a lightweight OS like Linux.,
Use your old computer as a router.",How to Safely Get Rid of an Old Computer2," One new use for your old computer is as a file server for your home or work place. Basically, your reconfigured computer will act as shared storage for the other computers in your home. This option is a great idea for homes with several computers that all need to access the same data. It's also great in terms of energy efficiency, because, since the computer is acting solely as storage space, you won't need to use its monitor, keyboard, or speakers.


Several free open-source programs exist that allow you to convert your old computer into a server. One example of such a program is FreeNAS. These programs are available for download from the internet.
For extra storage space, you may want to install an extra hard drive or two.
You may also want to install a basic, streamlined operating system (such as Ubuntu) on your file server.;
, An option related to the one above is to use your computer not as storage space for new files, but, rather, as a backup for your new computer. In other words, keep it around so that you'll have a functional replacement for your new computer if it should break or suffer an error. If you choose to do this, you will not even need to remove your personal data from the computer - you can just disconnect it and leave it in the closet until it's needed.

, Another method for getting some use out of an old computer is to install an operating system with exceptionally low system requirements. This allows you to continue using the computer for certain minor purposes - basic word processing, web browsing, simple games, etc. Linux is a free, popular, no-frills operating system with many different variants are often used for this purpose. For example, a Linux system called Puppy Linux is a variety of Linux that has especially low system requirements.

, Depending on the wireless capabilities of your old machine, you may be able to re-purpose it as a wireless router so that you're able to enjoy internet on your smartphone, tablet, or another computer. Many computers have the ability to act as the broadcasting hub for a wireless network. If yours does, be sure that a firewall is installed for security purposes before using your computer as a router.

Contact a school, non-profit, or philanthropic organization.,
Give it to a willing stranger.",How to Safely Get Rid of an Old Computer3," All that you need to make a posting on an online auction site like eBay are the technical specification of your computer and a few pictures for good measure. You may be surprised to discover that people out there are actually willing to pay money for relatively old machines. For instance, certain types of hardware from the 80's and early 90's may be considered ""vintage"" and thus fetch a reasonable price from collectors.


If your computer is so old as to be rare or remarkable, you may actually be able to sell (or donate) it to a computer museum where it will be preserved for its role in history.
Also be open to the possibility of selling your computer's parts, rather than the entire machine. If some of your computer's components are higher-quality than others (i.e: after-market video cards, memory, etc.), it may be well worth the effort to remove and sell them separately.

, Before you throw your computer out, ask around to see if any of your friends are looking for an older computer. Tech-savvy people sometimes reconfigure old computers for use as file servers or e-mail stations. They may also be able to scrap your computer for parts, taking what they need and properly disposing of the rest.

, Your old computer may be insufficient for your purposes, but, to someone who's not used to modern computers, it may seem borderline-miraculous. Consider giving your computer to an elderly user like a parent or grandparent. Old, slow computers are perfect for the types of basic tasks that elderly relatives are likely to be interested in. When you have time, try teaching him or her how to use e-mail and surf the web - you'll be doing him or her a favor and ensuring that your old computer isn't going to waste.

, Many organizations that exist primarily for the public good have programs to make use of older computers. Contact a local school, church, youth organization, non-profit, or charity and ask if they're willing to find a use for your old computer. There are a wide variety of charitable uses for computers. For instance, some charities will recycle or refurbish computers, then give them to the poor, while others charities will send the computers to schools in undeveloped areas of the world.


As an added bonus, you will sometimes be eligible to receive a receipt of your donation for a tax deduction.

, When all else fails, giving a functional computer to a complete stranger is still better than putting it in a landfill. You might try putting a sign on your computer saying something along the lines of ""Free old computer - good for parts or case,"" and leaving it by the curb on a dry afternoon. Or, you might try making the same offer on an online classifieds site like Craigslist. Finally, you can try taking it to a local swap-meet or flea market and fetching whatever price you can for it.


Be extra careful when giving your computer to a stranger, as you have no way of knowing whether they have malicious intentions or not. Be absolutely sure that any personal information has been removed from the computer before giving it away.

Contact the manufacturer.,
Trade your computer in when you buy a new one.,
Use a computer recycling or disposal firm.,
Salvage any usable parts before disposal.",How to Safely Get Rid of an Old Computer4," Today, most computer manufacturers offer some sort of end-of-life disposal service for their products. If you're unable to find someone to take your computer off your hands or your computer is in a non-functional condition, consider contacting the manufacturer for safe disposal options.


However, note that not all manufacturers behave equally ethically when disposing of old computers. Some ship computer waste to landfills in the developing world, where it becomes an environmental and health hazard for the local community. Before handing your computer over to your manufacturer, try to research it's ethical record with regards to computer recycling and disposal.

, Some companies, such as Dell and HP, now offer to recycle your old computer for free when you buy a new one from them. If you have yet to buy your new computer and you're interested in purchasing from the same company as before, consider this option, as it allows you to leave the process of finding a responsible means of disposal to the experts while (possibly) receiving a discount on your new computer.

, Today, many independent companies exist for the purpose of processing, recycling, and disposing of computer waste. Some are philanthropic organizations, some are non-profits, and some are for-profit. Search for local companies in your area - you may be able to dispose of your computer for free or may need to pay a disposal fee, depending on which types of services are available.


However, note that, like computer manufacturers, some e-waste recycling and disposal companies have less-than-stellar business practices. Be a responsible consumer by researching the companies you choose for your disposal needs. Make sure your computer will not end up in a landfill in China before handing it over.

, Before disposing of your computer, consider whether you have any uses for the case, accessories, or any internal components. For instance, if disposing of several computers of the same model, you might consider using the cases as oversize building blocks for a makeshift bookcase or wall of cubbyholes.

, Microfiber towels are specially designed for a number of uses, including car polishing, electronics dusting and cleaning homes. The following are considerations to make when you are choosing microfiber towels:


For car detailing uses, the thicker the towel, the more effective it will be. It also should be a tight weave and a short nap. Microfiber can soak up to 7 lbs. (3.75 kg.) of water per square foot (30 cm) and they can replace more expensive chamois towels. Auto-glass towels should be thinner and more pliant.
For home cleaning purposes, microfiber absorbs oil and dust, and it also picks up approximately 99 percent of bacteria. You want both thick and thin towels, so that you can pick up dust and polish glass.
For electronics or lens cleaning, only use thin, looser knit microfiber cloths. Grit and particles can become easily trapped inside thicker towels, making it easier to scratch sensitive surfaces. Electronics towels should be high in electrostatic properties, so check the label before buying.

, In general, the higher the towel's weight in grams, the better value the towel will be. Towels that are made of 100 percent nylon, a polyamide, are often better quality and more expensive.

, These towels are perfect for car detailing or home dusting. They can also be used to wipe down showers, in order to avoid hard water stains.

, Bath towels can be thick, or very thin so that they pack into small spaces. These towels are more rare and expensive, but they can be found on Amazon.com, REI or through a search on Nexttag.com.

, An office supply store will likely offer a multi-pack for a lower price. You can also find these towels for less money on online marketplaces like Amazon.com.

, Stores like Target or Walmart will offer a large variety of price and quality, as well as microfiber mops and dusters. Remember that the lowest price is unlikely to offer you the best cleaning properties.

Reuse small candy boxes or a bottle of “stick” sun screen.,
Repurpose old cardboard matchboxes to hold paper clips and thumb tacks.,
Design a classy organization system by storing items in decorative teacups on your desk or bathroom vanity.,
Line metal items against a magnetic strip inside your desk/bathroom drawer.,
Repurpose a hard plastic soap case you can use for travel.",How to Create Storage in Used Containers for Small Items," Don’t throw away old Tic Tac boxes or even an empty bottle of stick sun screen--instead use them to store small items like bobby pins or Q-Tips.


Wash out empty boxes. Especially with the sunscreen bottles--make sure you use dish detergent and hot water to thoroughly clean empty containers.
Remove label or create your own. You may toss the empty bottle or box if you can’t remember what’s stored inside. You don’t need a fancy label--either hand write on a blank adhesive name tag what’s inside or you could type a small label using your computer and printer. Use a glue stick to hold it in place.;
, The sturdy cardboard provides ideal storage opportunities for a variety of tiny items.


Seek a wide variety of matchbook sizes and shapes to hold nearly every type of item--some come in round shapes whereas others are presented in the traditional rectangular size.
Create labels to place over the matchbox top to identify what’s inside. Or you could use a small symbol that you could possibly purchase as a sticker or you could print from your computer. For example, a picture of a large paperclip would do the trick to identify a box of paperclips.

, You don’t have to transform the cups you typically use at home, but could pick up inexpensive vintage cups at a yard sale or second hand.


Scrub the desired number of tea cups before use. Even if the cups are clean use vinegar and hot water to remove any stains inside the cups.
Fill cups with everyday items such as loose change, thumb tacks, paper clips, jewelry, bobby pins or Q-Tips. Make each teacup the official “home” for everyday items, getting them off your countertops and in one place.
Strategically place the teacups in easy-to-access areas on your desk or bathroom vanity. If you have small children or curious pets, place them out of reach so curiosity won’t result in a smashed cup.

, For metal items, keep them in place and hidden using a long magnetic, self adhesive strip run along the inside of your drawer.


Identify the items that can be housed along the magnetic strip such as office supplies (paper clips, thumb tacks, etc.) or beauty items (bobby pins, hair ties with a magnetic clasp, jewelry).
Purchase self adhesive magnetic stripping from the local craft store. Make sure you purchase a strip that comes with a self adhesive backing for mounting ease.
Clean the area that will receive the magnetic strip. Your strip will be less likely to stick to a dirty surface. Also, you don’t want to adhere your strip to an area that’s dusty or has loose strands of hair stuck to it.
Measure for desired length. Make sure you cut the strip to fit the exact space by using a ruler or measuring tape.
Cut strip to fit and adhere to surface. Use sharp scissors to cut strip as it will be thick and may be difficult to cut using dull (or child) scissors. Remove backing and run the strip along the desired area. Smooth your hand over it to remove any bubbles and ensure it fully sticks to the surface.
Add items to be stored. You may want to test other items to see if they cling to the magnetic surface.

, Don’t toss those old travel, hard plastic soap cases. Instead use them to hold loose supplies.


Inspect the soap case for damage. After being in the shower or bath, the case may be too far gone for repurposing.
Clean the case to remove old soap build up and scum. Dish detergent, hot water and a little elbow grease will do the trick.
Create a label if the case is not created from clear, see through plastic. If you are working with see through material you won’t need a label (as you’ll be able to see exactly what’s inside). However, for quick reference consider either creating a label using your computer and printer (and adhering the label using a glue stick) or write what’s inside on a self mailing sticker.

Get rid of items you don’t need.,
Declutter the hidden cluttered areas.,
Throw away old mail.,
Hang up and put away clothes.,
Make a list of needed organization items.",How to Be Neat and Tidy2," Go through your belongings and set aside the items you no longer want or need, or simply put items back where they belong. For instance, put clean clothes back in their drawers or hang them up. Make sure dirty clothes end up in a hamper. Toss out broken or badly worn items.Go through your closets and remove clothes that no longer fit. Any clothes with stains, rips or tears should be put in a bag as well.Old toys, games, broken items and unwanted items should be set aside to be given away or sold. Seek obvious clutter -- clutter on the floors and counters. For instance, if you have two knife blocks, you can probably give one away to make more counter space.
Once you have set aside the items you don't want, separate them into a sell pile and give away pile. You may need separate bags or boxes for each category of item.
List the gently used items on Craigslist or give them away to charity, a family member or friend

, Disorganized drawers and closets offer the illusion of a clean and tidy room because you can simply close the door and hide the mess. Yet, once you open the closet door, items come tumbling out, or you’re unable to find anything in the messy closet. So, if you have drawers that you can barely close, then it’s time to go through them and sort them.Empty out the drawers completely and toss out anything broken. Set aside items that you may need like keys, and place stray items, such as batteries, that have been rolling around in the drawer in a basket for organization later.Once you have it sorted, neatly place the items back in the drawer. Note if you need an organizer to help keep everything together neatly., You don’t need to keep every bill or piece of mail forever. Stacks of mail piled up on your counters or inside desk drawers creates a mess -- both hidden and unhidden. Go through the stacks of mail, newspapers and coupons while sorting out recent mail you need to keep from expired coupons and tattered newspapers. Toss out or recycle the old stuff.


Like a pile of dishes in the sink, stacks of mail make a room look untidy and unkempt. Utility bills and paycheck stubs don’t need to be kept longer than a year. ATM receipts can be tossed out after a few days.Set aside the coupons and mail that you need to keep. Throw away the rest.
Once you have sorted the mail you’re going to keep, neatly place the items back where they belong. Make a mental note about if a mail organizer is necessary., Piles and piles of clothes strewn across a room make it appear messy even if everything else in the room is tidy. Set aside the clean clothes and place them in drawers or hang them up. Fold clean unfolded clothes and put them away. Put unwanted clothes in a bag to be given away or sold.Shoes strewn across the room or piled up in a corner is no less of a mess. Set shoes upright in the closet, and put any unwanted shoes in the “give away” or “ to be sold” bag.

, As you clean, make a list of organization materials that you might need to keep everything tidy. For instance, you might need a shoe rack to keep your closet neat. Do you need more hangers? What about a desk organizer? Do you need another bookshelf?Baskets with lids are great for storage and hiding clutter. You can store items inside of them without having to look at everything you own.
If you don’t have a lot of floor space, then make use of your wall space. You can put up more shelves or bookcases, and this will help to free up some space to help keep everything organized."
"
Decide what you’re keeping.,
Give away unwanted items.,
Sell the items on Craigslist or Ebay.,
Sell used clothing and shoes.,
Have a garage sale.",How to Be Neat and Tidy3," Go through everything that you’ve pulled out of your closets and drawers and sort them into four piles: keep, give away, sell and trash. Assess the items by asking yourself a few questions: Have you used it in the past year? Would you buy the item again? Am I only keeping it because I don’t want to waste money? Am I keeping it for sentimental value?Items that should not be kept are broken items and outdated items that have been collecting dust. If you haven’t used the item in many many years, it is time to dispose of it unless it is for sentimental value.
Keep the items you use frequently. Get rid of stained, torn and dusty unused items. Don’t keep items simply because you think you might use it again even though you haven’t used it in years. (Don’t be a hoarder.)
Unused sentimental items can be stored away for safe keeping. Old t-shirts, pictures, books and stuffed animals that are purely for sentimental value can be stored away in a large storage chest. Separate them from your frequently used items so that they don’t take up space.

, These would be the items that didn’t pass the test when you asked yourself the “decluttering questions, “ and you’re unable to sell them for some reason. Examples of unsellable items might be outdated items, items with blemishes or heavily used items. Once you’ve separated the wanted items from the “giveaways,” place them in a pile away from the keep and trash pile. Give them to friends, family or charities such as the Goodwill.

, Electronics, furniture and appliances that you simply do not need or want can be sold online. Simply take a picture of the item, and create a short listing on the website. You can make some extra money on the side selling your unwanted decluttered items, but the website you’re using matters. Some websites are better than others for selling your goods.Craigslist is best for selling furniture, appliances and electronics to local buyers in your area.Sell old cell phones, laptops or unused supplies to an international crowd on Ebay, which allows people to bid on items or purchase them outright.

, Gently used clothing can be re-sold if they are trendy, designer or too nice to give away. Stores such as Plato’s Closet or Buffalo Exchange purchase gently used clothing without stains or holes that they believe can be re-sold to its customers. Keep in mind that whether or not the store takes the items is up to the discretion of each individual store.


Local consignment shops and local chains in your area similar to Plato’s Closet also are great resources for selling used clothing. Review the store’s website to assess if your clothing fits the store’s re-sale criteria., If you have a number of items to get rid of, then it may be faster to have a garage sale over a weekend. Advertise by putting signs around your neighborhood. Then, label your items and get ready to haggle. Use the money you make to purchase new organizing materials for your home."
"
Assign a home for everything even the items that have no home.,
Re-organize badly organized items.,
Purchase items to store away things.,
Store away what you’re keeping.",How to Be Neat and Tidy4," Some items are easy to find a home for such as the kitchen scissors. They belong in the knife block on the kitchen counter, but where should you store the batteries you found rolling around in a drawer?Mentally decide where everything should go so that every item has a home. Put any random items in a location you think is appropriate. For instance, put screws in a tool box. Put pens and pencils in a container on the desk. Put decorative items on a side table.

, If your current bookshelves, closets, or drawers aren’t laid out well, then re-organize them. You don’t always have to toss out items to declutter. Sometimes you need to re-organize books, closets, shelves and the items they hold because entropy has taken over, and sometimes it’s because the items were never organized well in the first place.


Restack the books on the shelves. Unfold and refold items in the linen closet that make it look messy. Take all the shoes out of the closet and then line them up in the closet again.
Assess what you may need to store everything properly. Consider boxes, baskets, shelves and underbed boxes.
Utilize your wall space to create more living space in your home. Think about hanging more items on the wall or putting up shelves if you don’t have a lot of floor space., Stores such as The Container Store, Target and KMart have lots of organization materials to choose from. Don’t be afraid to get creative, and consider a wide variety of materials. Cardboard office style shoe boxes are good for storing items on open shelves. Baskets, which usually don’t have lids, are good for storing items you don’t mind displaying like magazines or extra throw blankets.


For closet organizers, look for hanging shoe racks and clothes racks. Grab some extra- hangers and hooks if you need them. Underbed boxes are good for overflow -- stuff that doesn’t have any other place to go. Use them to store seasonal clothes like sweaters.Ottomans with interior storage areas can help you hide clutter. Also, think about bookshelves, boxes with lids and baskets to organize items like magazines that otherwise might be left laying around on the floor.If you have any messy drawers or cabinets, think about purchasing some drawer organizers. These are good options to store loose items like tacks, coins and batteries.
Hooks and small dishes are good decorative options to store keys and loose items.
Zip ties and charging stations can help you make your area look neater by making your charging cords more organized. , Once you have everything that you need, put everything away neatly in its new organizers. Use clear storage containers so that you can see what’s inside. You’ll thank yourself later when you’re searching for your items, since you won’t need to open every single box to see what it contains. Place items that you’ll rarely use in storage spaces such as the attic or basement. Put more frequently used items under the bed or in the closet.


Label the boxes that are going to be stored away in closets or under the bed so that you don’t have to open the boxes when you’re searching for your items."

Set a cleaning routine.,
Put everything back where it belongs.,
Assign chores.,
Tidy up every night.,
Hire a cleaning service.",How to Be Neat and Tidy5," Left to your own devices your home might be messy again in no time. So, set a cleaning schedule to help keep you on track. The schedule will also help you create a new habit of cleaning and tidying more frequently.


Choose days for vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom and taking out the trash.
Make a mental note of how many dishes you should allow to pile up in the sink before you wash them. Or, don’t let them pile up at all. Wash them after every meal.

, Since you’ve taken the time to find everything a home, establish a routine of putting items back where they belong. Making a habit of putting items back when you’re done with them means you’ll be less likely to allow items to pile up. Your home will stay cleaner longer.


If you live with people and you have moved some items around, make sure you tell them where everything belongs, so they can put them back too.

, If you live with other people, give everyone weekly or nightly chores. When maintaining the house is everyone’s responsibility, the house is easier to keep clean and tidy. More people cleaning consistently equates to a cleaner home. There’s power in numbers.Task someone with doing the dishes every night or take turns.
Decide who is going to vacuum each week and clean the bathrooms. If you live alone, then you get the lucky task of doing everything alone.

, Before you go to bed, do a quick clean-up. Put dirty dishes in the sink. Pick up anything laying on the floor. Make it look nice enough so that when you wake up in the morning, the look of your home is a benefit, not a stressor.

, If you’re really busy, hire a maid to come weekly or monthly to help you out. With busy schedules, everyone doesn’t have the time to clean all the time, and there’s nothing wrong with employing help. Simply do your research to ensure you find the right person to clean your home."

Take all of your belongings out of their current locations.,
Organize your belongings.,
Try to get rid of as many items as possible.,
Put all the boxes except the ""Keep"" boxes in the right place.",How to Organize Your Room1," This may seem painful and like you're creating a bigger mess, but if you really want to organize your room as new, you have to start from scratch. Though you may be overwhelmed by the giant pile of stuff you've created on your floor, desk, or bed, rest assured that you'll find the right place for everything you own soon.Remove everything from your closet -- your clothes, shoes, and anything you keep in your closet can go in a pile on the floor in front of the closet.
Remove everything from your desk. You can place the papers and anything else you find on the desk's surface.
Remove everything from your dresser. If you're creating too much of a mess, remove one drawer at a time.
Take any other items that are laying around and place them on your bed and on the floor.

If taking everything out of its place at once is overwhelming and is taking up too much space, you can tackle your room by taking apart one area at a time.

;
, Before you begin to figure out where everything should go, you should get a number of boxes and label them for different purposes. Crates or plastic bins will work just as well, but boxes are best because you can just recycle them when you're done organizing and won't have to deal with more clutter. Here's how you should label the boxes:



Keep. The items that you keep will be items that you use on a regular basis. If you've used the item in the last two or three months, you should keep it.

Store. These are things that you can't bear to throw away, such as something with sentimental value, but which you rarely use. You can also store away a large portion of your clothes that you won't wear until the next season or two. If it's the middle of the summer, you can store your winter sweaters, and if it's the dead of winter, you can store your summer dresses.

Give or Sell. These are items that may benefit someone or could be sold, but which you don't need any more. You may have a nice sweater that you don't fit into anymore that you can donate, or an old textbook that you can sell.

Throw Out. These are items that no one needs -- including you. If you have to spend time wondering what something is, or when the last time you even saw it was, it's time to toss it.

, This is an important step. Though you may want to throw everything in the ""Keep"" box, or have put every last extra item in the ""Store"" box, this won't help you get organized. You need to do some soul-searching to figure out what you really need in your life. Remember that less really is more; the less things you have, the easier it will be to organize your room.


Try the twenty second rule. If you have to spend more than twenty seconds looking at an item and asking yourself if you'll ever use it again, the answer is no.
If you have something you know you don't need but don't want to part with it, try giving it to a friend or family member so you feel better about it being in someone else's hands.

, Now that you've organized your room, you can begin to get rid of all the things you don't need. The sooner you get rid of or store the other boxes, the easier it will be to move on with your organization. Here's what to do:


The first part is easy. Just throw out everything in the ""Throw Out"" box.
Find a local church, Goodwill, or another organization that is taking donations, and bring all of your donated items there. Be prepared for the place to tell you that they won't accept some of your items. You can either try to donate them somewhere else, or just throw them out.
Start selling your ""Sell"" items. Have a garage sale or put them on craigslist.
Store your storage boxes. If you have a storage unit or another place outside of your room to place them, great. If not, store them in a part of your room you won't be using very often, such as under your bed or in the back of your closet. Remember to label them carefully so you know where your things are when the time comes.

Dump out the drawer.,
Once your junk drawer is completely empty, give the drawer a quick wipe down with a moist paper towel.,
Take all of the pens you find in the junk drawer and test them out on a scratch piece of paper.,
Another common item for junk drawers is take-out menus.,
Purchase drawer organizers.,
Take all of your tools and place them back into your purchased organizers by the type of item.,
For all of the tiny items that are hard to compartmentalize (tacks, paperclips, batteries) place them in Ziploc bags by type.,
Put all of the loose change in a piggy bank.,
Enjoy your tidy new drawer.",How to Organize Your Junk Drawer," Find a big, open surface – either a floor or a big table where you can dump everything out and sort it into piles. Make the piles into ""like"" items, where the tools go together and all of the craft items have their own pile. Separate miscellaneous items so you don't end up with another junk pile.;
, Try using a multi-purpose cleaner and spray the inside of the drawer a few times.

, There's no need to keep pens that are out of ink, so immediately throw them out. Pens rarely hold sentimental value, so no excuses for keeping them!

, Go through them and pile them together before placing them in a simple manila folder so they won't move around in the drawer.

, They come in a variety of shapes and sizes so you can choose the best one to fit the size of your drawer. Go to any home goods store or organizational store to purchase the organizers. The organizers come in plastic, bamboo, silver, and many other styles and colors to match your décor. The organizers are also stackable so you can oftentimes slide the organizers or move them around on top of one another.


When purchasing the drawer organizers, consider the size and depth of your drawer, as well as what types of items you have going into the drawer.

, Put all of the larger items (tools, etc.) in the larger compartments and place the smaller ones (pens, etc.) in a smaller one.


Try using different colors of organizers to better label what items go in each place.

, Alternatively, use small boxes like little butter tubs. Test out the batteries and recycle any out that no longer work.

, It's OK to have a lot of pennies and dimes, just as long as they're grouped together and have their own space. When the piggy bank gets too full you can go to a coin machine at your local supermarket (try Coinstar or, better yet, take your coins to your bank where their machine can count them for free) and transfer it in for cash.

, From this point on, it's essential to return everything to its place. If it doesn't have a place, think twice about dumping it in – perhaps disposal, recycling, or a different storage space are better options.


Make sure you occasionally check on your drawer so the junk doesn't start accumulating again. Clean things out of it throughout the month and keep a process going on keeping it clean until waiting till it looks like it's about to explode. Don't put anything in the drawer that doesn't have a place – instead, find an organized space for that item.
Warn other members in your home about the new change with the organization. Tell them what items belong in each drawer and show them the effort you made to keep the drawers clutter-free. Warn them that you will periodically throw out things that have been dumped in there!

Organize your closet.,
Organize your dresser.,
Organize your desk.,
Organize the rest of your room.",How to Organize Your Room2," Keeping an organized and neat closet is the key to having a clean bedroom. You should make the most of your closet space and organize your clothes by season and color. If you have a larger closet, it may be a good place to store your additional items or to keep your shoes and accessories. Here's how to organize your closet:


The first thing you should do after you've sorted your clothes into the ""Keep"" and ""Store"" piles is to take one more hard look at your clothes. If you haven't worn a certain item in over a year, it's time for it to go. The only exception for this rule is if you have a very formal gown or suit that you haven't had a chance to wear.
Organize your clothes by season. Keep the summer, spring, winter, and fall clothes on the same part of the closet. If you have room for storage in the closet, store those off-season clothes in a bin in the back of your closet.
Hang up as many of the clothes as you can. Try organizing them by the type of garment they are. For example, when you hang up your summer clothes, keep tank tops, t-shirts, and dresses separated.
Make use of the space below your clothes. If you've hung up your clothes, you should still have a few feet of space below them, so don't waste it. Use the space for a storage bin or for a shoe rack.
If you have a door that opens instead of a sliding door, invest in a shoe rack or jewelry holder that hangs over your door. This is a great use of space. If you don't have a door there, you can consider hanging one of these over your bedroom door.
If you have room in your closet for a dresser, this is the perfect place for it.

, Your dresser is the place where you store your additional clothes or accessories, so it should be as neat as possible to prevent you from turning it upside down every time you search for another piece of clothing. Here's how to organize your dresser:


Organize the top of your dresser. Take all the clutter from the top of your dresser and put it in a plastic bin at the corner of the dresser. If there's a better place for the clutter, like your bathroom, desk, or top drawer, put it there.
Find a good use for your top dresser drawer. Don't just use the top drawer to throw in everything that doesn't have a good place. Decide what this use will be, whether it's for socks, comic books, or baseball cards.
Organize the rest of your drawers. Create a drawer for your underwear, a drawer for your pajamas, a drawer for your athletic gear if you work out a lot, and then one or two drawers for the tops and bottoms you wear every day.

, If you have a desk in your room, you should keep it as organized as possible. Come up with a game plan for separating and organizing all of your important items so you avoid a mess in the future. Here's how to do it:


Designate a place for your scissors, staplers, and other office supplies. This could be an area on the corner of your desk or your top drawer. It should be easily accessible since you'll use these items often. Vow to keep all of the desk things on the desk. If you use the stapler, return it to the desk, or it may get lost.
Designate a place for your writing utensils. Have a cup or small case for keeping your writing utensils so you no longer have to spend fifteen minutes looking for a pen. As you do this, go through your utensils to make sure that all of them work. Toss out the ones that can barely write.
Create a filing system for organizing your papers. Create folders or drawers designated for different tasks. One drawer could be used for important papers that you don't use often, such as the title to your car, your lease, contracts, and other important forms. Another drawer or folder could be designated for papers for a certain subject or aspect of your life. Don't mix these up.
Minimize the clutter on the surface of your desk. Try to keep the photos and mementos on your desk at a minimum to give yourself more room to work.

, Once you've tackled your closet, dresser, and desk, your room should begin to look like a new calm and organized place. However, you're not done quite yet. Before you can truly say your room is organized, there are a few more things you should do:


Make your bed. Part of having an organized room is putting things in their place, and your bedspread and pillows should go where they belong. If your bed is cluttered with so many pillows or stuffed animals that you can barely sleep in it, then it may be time to store or get rid of some of the items.
Get rid of the clutter on your walls. Some eye-catching posters and paintings are nice and a whiteboard or calendar can also help you get organized. However, get rid of extra old posters, torn photos, or random papers you've taped above your desk so your room and life feel less cluttered.
Organize any other remaining pieces of furniture. If you have a night stand, a filing cabinet, or a bookshelf, make sure that they are as neat, tidy, and as logically organized as the rest of the items in your room.
Put any remaining items in their place. If you still have some items hanging around, find a place for them.

"
"
Clean your floor.,
Wipe down all of the surfaces in your room.,
Make a game plan to stay organized and clean.",How to Organize Your Room3," Now that you've put all of your items in their place, you should have a bare floor. Take the time to clean it to give your room that polished feel. You won't feel organized if your room doesn't feel clean.


Put on some music or invite a friend over to help you clean to make the process more enjoyable.
If you have a hardwood floor, wash or sweep it. If you have a carpeted floor, it's time to vacuum.

, Take a wet cloth and run it over your desk, the top of your dresser, your nightstand, and any additional items in your room. Get rid of all of the dust that you've ignored while your room was too messy.


Make a goal of wiping the surfaces in your room at least once a week.

, You don't want all the hard work you put into cleaning and organizing your room to go to waste. If you go back to your messy habits in just one week, you can undo so much of the effort that you've put in. Here's how to make sure you maintain a clean and organized room in the future:


Be determined to spend at least 5 to 10 minutes every night organizing your room before you go to bed. Now that you've organized the last of your things, you should vow to keep them in their places.
Be determined to clean your room for at least 5 to 10 minutes every day. This includes taking out the trash, getting rid of any food, and removing any old papers, ticket stubs, or random things that have accumulated in your space.

Set up a pegboard.,
Convert a shoe organizer into toy storage.,
Put up some strips of magnetic tape.,
Invest in a wall mounted desk or table.",How to Add Storage Space to a Playroom1," Find or buy a pegboard from a home improvement store like Home Depot or Lowes. You can get it cut to whatever size you need and it should only require a few wood screws and drywall anchors to set it up. Paint the pegboard whichever way you like.


Try bright colors like red or orange or a design with stars and stripes. Once painted, attach hooks and hang things like baskets, toys, and clothes to get things up off the ground and add space to the room.This is an easily customizable item and can be changed regularly as you need.;
, Buy a cloth or plastic see-through over-the-door shoe organizer for toys like Barbies, stuffed animals, or cars. Simply follow the instructions to hang it over a door and then fill every cubby as needed. You can even divide the shoe organizer in half with different children’s toys. For example, barbies and their clothes can go in the top half and action figures like G.I. Joes can go in the bottom.Using a see-through organizer makes it easy for kids to see what’s in each pocket, which helps make clean-up easier.

, Measure out a few strips of magnetic tape to add to a playroom wall. The amount you use will depend on the number of toys you plan to attach. For example, if your child has a large collection of race cars, then you may want 3-5 strips of tape. However, if you have the wall space, you can also just do one long line of magnetic tape. Once you’ve attached it to the wall, simply place the cars or other metal toys along the stripe.Make sure this strip is low enough for children to access easily.
You can find magnetic tape at most craft stores or online on Amazon for around $20. It should have one side with a typical tape adhesive covered in thin white paper. Simply peel this off and stick the tape to the wall.
The tape should peel off easily. However, if you are having issues, try using a mixture or warm water and dishwasher soap to remove the tape., A hideaway table or desk is a great way to free-up space in a playroom. You can find wall-mounted desks on Amazon or from Ikea for under $50. Everything you need for the set-up is included, outside of a screwdriver. Just make sure to test the durability of the desk before you buy it, as children can be rough in their usage of household furniture.Most fold-away desks only require screws and hinges. You first need to decide where on the wall you want the desk, then use a level and pencil to mark a straight and even line. Once you've done this, you should only have to screw the hinges into the desk, and then screw the other half of the hinges into the wall.

"
"
Turn storage bins into seating.,
Use chests as tables.,
Line a wall or under a window with benches.",How to Add Storage Space to a Playroom2," Take a couple of wooden, plastic, or wicker storage bins and attach seat cushions to their tops. These storage bins are the perfect size for young children and are a great way to get toys, books, and clothing out of the way without sacrificing space. You can even attach wheels to their bottoms to make them easy for kids to move around as needed.Try different colors and patterns for the fabric tops to add character to a playroom.

, Repurpose a wooden or wicker chest to double-up as a table. Most chests are already at the perfect height for children, however, you can always add table legs to elevate the chest and make it appear more like a table. Try purchasing wooden table legs from Lowes or Home Depot, which are only $1-$3 each. You can also paint or stain these trunks to match the decor of the room.If you don’t have a chest, try searching in thrift stores or at Goodwill for a cheaper item you won’t mind the kids getting paint and other things on.

, Benches are a great way to get both storage and seating. Look for ones that have cubbies for you to put things away in. You can even get a bunch of baskets or colored storage containers to enliven the room's decor. Use these cubbies to pack away stuffed animals, clothes, or shoes.


If you have a window, try installing a bench with storage directly under it to create a reading area. You can then fill the cubbies with your child’s favorite books.

"
"
Try floating shelves.,
Make a whole wall of shelving or storage boxes.,
Use open standing shelves to divide a room.",How to Add Storage Space to a Playroom3," This type of shelving is not only easy to put up but very affordable. You can find floating shelves in plain wood colors like oak or cherry, or in black and white. They are carried in most stores like Target, Home Depot, and Walmart. All hardware required for the shelves is included. However, you will need a drill to put in the drywall screws to make sure these shelves are secure.


Floating shelves come in many sizes but are often short and thin. Try using them for smaller toy collections like cars or action figures.

, Try devoting a whole wall to storage by putting up multiple rows of shelving. You can do this with standing or floating shelves. Just make sure you measure the height and width of the wall so you can keep the spacing between shelves even. You can also try creating a wall solely of storage bins or boxes, which would act similarly to cupboards.


If you don't have the space for a whole wall, you can still install multiple shelves in the area available.

, Use standing shelves to separate a playroom from a living or family room space, or simply between activities like reading and arts and crafts. This is a great way to separate areas while still retaining a feeling of openness. You can even divide the bookshelf between the different spaces. For example, playroom items can be placed on the lower shelves where children can reach them, while items like pictures and knick knacks can sit on the top shelves.

Get the boxes.,
Assemble the cubic boxes into a shelving unit.,
Assemble the long boxes, which will be drawers.,
Load your inventory in the drawers.",How to Make a Cardboard Box Storage System," If you can't find them locally, look online. You can use any measurements you want, as long as four long boxes (drawers) fit into one cubic box (compartment). Here are some suggested measurements and quantities:


25 to 500 cubic boxes - 13 x 13 x 13 inches (33 x 33 x 33 cm)






25 to 900 long boxes - 12 x 6 x 6 inches (30.5 x 15.25 x 15.25 cm)





;
,


Cut the flaps on one side.






Tape the cubes together - front, back and side.






When taping is completed, put the completed shelving unit against a wall.







, Cut out a square at one end of the box. Four drawers fit in one compartment.

,


Write the description on the box. Then, put the drawers in so that the order makes sense.






Sort the drawers alphabetically.
Alternatively, sort the drawers so that things you use most often are at arm level, easiest to reach, and things that are less frequently used are lower or higher.
Slide the drawers into the compartments.






Use compartments without the drawers for larger objects.






Use small containers to store small objects. These are tennis ball cans. Check with your local tennis club - you might get hundreds of them for free.

Flatten the bag.,
Fold the bag lengthwise.,
Fold a bottom corner of the rectangle.,
Fold the triangle inward to make a new triangle.,
Keep folding the bottom edge inward over itself.,
Tuck the handles into the triangle.,
Repeat with your other bags and store.,
Unfold each bag for use.",How to Fold a Plastic Bag1," Make sure to line up the sides of the bag so that the handles are parallel to each other. Pay attention to the way you orient the handles, as they play an important role in the folded triangle's structure.


This is easiest to do on a hard, flat surface like your kitchen counter.
If you're especially dexterous, you can try folding a triangle in the air without a flat surface. Just keep in mind this will be fairly difficult and you may just end up frustrating yourself. If you can't do it now, you may want to try again after you've had some practice folding.
Do your best to get all of the air out of the bag. Run your hands across the bag to smooth it out.;
, Start by folding the bag in half so that the two handles perfectly overlap. Fold it again in the same direction, this time lining the edge opposite the handles on top of the other. Repeat this process until the entire bag has been folded into a roughly even rectangle the same width as the base of its handles. It should look like a narrow strip.Be sure to flatten the bag and squeeze the air out of it after each fold. The flatter the bag is, the easier it will be to fold into a triangle.
The number of times you'll need to fold the bag lengthwise will depend on its size and the shape of its handles. This step typically takes a total of two or three folds.

, Choose a corner of the bag at the edge opposite the handles. Fold the corner over to meet the other side to form a triangle.


Flatten and smooth out the triangle you've just formed.
At this point, the overall shape of your folded bag should look like a rectangle that shares one shorter edge with a much smaller isosceles right triangle.

, Take the free corner of the triangle and fold it inwards, turning its base into a new crease.


The overall shape of the bag should once again be a narrow strip or rectangle.
This method is similar to the technique used to fold a flag.

, Repeat the last two steps, rolling the triangle along the length of the bag. Keep going until you reach the near end of the handles. Make sure to leave enough of the bag unfolded for one last triangle fold.


You should be making a new isosceles right triangle to add to your ""stack"" of triangles with each fold.
Don't forget to smooth and flatten every time you fold. If your triangle is too puffy, it will not hold together.

, Make one last triangle fold, wrapping the tail of the bag around. Carefully stick the loose end into the pocket formed by the ""roll"" of triangles. As always, smooth out your triangle for the neatest, most stable shape possible.

, Turn the rest of your bag collection into triangles. Now that your bags take up much less room, they should be a lot easier to store. You can keep them anywhere you'd like. You can neatly arrange your triangles in a basket on your kitchen counter or simply toss them into a bin under your sink. The choice is up to you.

, As pretty as your triangle bags are, you can't use them folded up like that. Whenever you need a bag, start by taking a triangle and untucking the loose end. Hold the bag by this edge and shake until it comes completely undone. Depending on how tightly you wound the bag, you may need to put some elbow grease into it.

"

Fold your bag lengthwise.,
Fold your bag widthwise.,
Make a small loop using your strip.,
Thread the tail overtop and through the loop.,
Thread both ends through the loop.,
Undo the bag for use.",How to Fold a Plastic Bag2," Turn your bag into a narrow strip for you to tie into a knot. How you orient its handles is not important for this method. To fold your bag:


Smooth your bag out onto a hard, flat surface. Run your hands over the bag to remove as much air as possible. The flatter you make your bag, the smaller your finished knot will be.
Fold your bag in half lengthwise to form a rectangle. Smooth and flatten as before.
Fold your bag in half lengthwise again. It should once more form a rectangle, this time with a more narrow width. Keep folding the bag in half lengthwise until the layers are thick enough that you begin to feel some resistance. Make sure to flatten with each fold.

, Fold the strip in half along its width to make a shorter strip. You should now have a thin rectangle that is about half as long as your bag is tall.Test the flexibility of your strip by wrapping it around your fingers. If it's too stiff to do that, it will be too stiff to tie a knot with. Unfold the width crease and one or two length creases. Fold your strip back widthwise and test it again.

, Position the loop about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the folded end of the strip. The loop should be just big enough for two of your fingers to fit through. Make sure that the folded end of the strip is in front, while the longer uneven tail that includes the handles crosses behind.


The loop is the first step in tying what will be similar to a repeated overhand knot.If you have difficulty working with the strip because it's too short, you can always undo the widthwise fold. However, your knot will not be as compact or easy to undo.

, Take the uneven tail in one hand and bring it inward across the half of the strip closest to the folded end. Stick the tail through the loop and pull it through to the other side. Do not pull the ends to tighten the knot, yet., Start by bringing the tail back around and through the loop a few more times until you run out of length. Tuck the end into the center of the knot. Repeat this process with the remaining free end, pushing it through the loop to add to the ball. Once you reach the end, tighten the loop by holding the ball and tugging the free end.


Make sure you're wrapping the plastic bag in on itself in one big ball of a knot. You do not want to make a separate knot over the first, as this will be a double knot. Double knots are harder to undo.

, You can't use a balled-up bag to hold anything. To unravel a bag, press a thumb through the middle of the loop in the opposite direction the folded end was wrapped. The knot should loosen and the folded end will pop out of the loop. Unravel one half of the knot. Do this again for the tail end, and your bag is ready to use.


The knotted ball will not be nearly as neat and aesthetically pleasing as a folded triangle. Instead of displaying these bags, simply place them in a bucket or bag caddy until you need one."

Find a source of straw.,
Cut a straight limb with smooth bark, and few knots or smaller limbs for your broom handle.

,
Buy or find some twine to tie off the broom straw, shaping your finished broom.,
Clean your straw, shaking out loose stems, leaves, and other debris.

,
Gather it into bundles about 1 to 1 1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) thick, wrapping each bundle tightly, and trimming the ends straight.,
Using twine or wire, tie the bundles together, one at a time, and side by side.,
Sharpen the end of your ""handle"" stick so that it can be pushed up into the end of your bundles at the center.,
Using sharp, heavy duty scissors, or even tin snips, cut the ends of your straw straight across.

,
Try your new broom out!

",How to Make a Straw Broom," In the southwest U.S., there are lots of ""straw"" growing in fallow fields and open woodlands, but grain straw like wheat, oat, or others, or even split cornstalks will do. Asking permission from the owner of the field or woodland is advised because taking straw, grains or cornstalks without permission is stealing. For a more durable broom that is less likely to fall apart, it is also advised to use real ""broom straw"" a variety of the Sorghum plant, and that variety is called Sorghum vulgare var. technicum.;
,, Small gauge wire will work, too, but care should be taken when using it, and you will need pliers to cut and tighten it.

,, Tie individual bundles of straw tightly. This will help keep the finished broom neat.

, Keep them as flat as possible. By wrapping your wire or twine back and forth from opposite sides around each bundle, they will lay closer together and flatter.

, Push it about 6 inches (15 cm) deep between the center bundles, then tie it off securely with more twine.

, The sponge will now have 99.9998% less bacteria on it. 







, But it still helps a great deal. 







,, Rinse thoroughly under running water.








, Use hot tap water to maximize the effectiveness of the bleach (Chemistry 101 - hot water makes the molecules in the bleach more agitated, thereby increasing their effectiveness). A plastic food container you are intending to recycle is a good bowl to use.








, Squeeze the sponge at least a couple of times while it is soaking. This helps ensure the bleach completely penetrates the sponge, and aids the removal of organic debris (the very stuff you want gone).

Breathe in and out.,
Empty your brain.,
Remember that it's not the end of the world.,
Put it in context.,
Be confident.",How to Find Lost Objects1," Take a moment to take a few deep breaths. The breaths will help you calm down and refocus.Sometimes you get too stressed when searching for something, and you need to calm down to help you find the item. Your emotional response will distract you from looking.;
, As you're breathing deeply, take a moment to clear your head of other thoughts. Stop trying to frantically think about where you left it, and just keep your mind clear., If you let adrenaline take control, you won't be able to focus. Calm down, and take a step back. 

, What were you doing when you last had the item? Where were you going? Thinking through the context of when you saw it last can help you remember where you put it down., Tell yourself you will be able to find what you've lost. By bolstering yourself up, you not only calm yourself down, you also give yourself the energy you need to go find it."
"
Check where the item should be first every time.,
Clean up.,
Be systematic.,
Check odd places.,
Look thoroughly.,
Check your pockets.,
Check your car.,
Retrace your steps.,
Look in the same place.,
Call any place you have been.,
Search for your lost item from a different perspective.",How to Find Lost Objects2," That is, if you always put your keys by the door, look by the door first. They may have fallen off the table or be under your purse., Sometimes the easiest way to find an object is to start cleaning away the clutter. You'll be better able to see what's there if you move away everything else., If you're certain you've lost an item in a certain room, divide it into sections. Go through each section one by one, checking under furniture and lifting up other items., Sometimes, you may stick something in an odd place without realizing it. For instance, you may stick your coffee cup in the freezer without realizing it, especially if you're half asleep. The item will be where you least expect it.

, Sometimes your eye will dart over an area where you think the item can't be. Take the time to intentionally look around the room to make sure it isn't around., Don't forget to check the pockets for the item. Look in your coat, your pants, and your purse or briefcase.

, If it's an item you carry with you, make sure to check your car, as well as the house.

, Though you've already thought back, actually retracing your steps can help you remember where the item is or actually find the item. Go through the motions of where you've been since you had the object last., If you commonly lose an item, look in the place you found it last time, as it may have ended up there again.

, If you can't physically get in the car and drive to them, call the places you've been today. For instance, if you stopped at a convenience store, call and ask them if they found it., Try looking for your lost item by standing on a stool, crouching down on the floor, looking down while standing upright,  looking up while standing upright, or even lying on the floor. Sometimes your mind finds things easier from a different perspective.

Say the place you're putting an object in a sentence.,
Pinpoint the item you lose most.,
Make certain areas clutter-free.,
Look behind you every time you exit.,
Be mindful.,
Figure out the best place to store items.,
Put items in the right place.,
Put your name on it.,
Make yourself human.",How to Find Lost Objects3," For instance, if you're putting your book in a different place than you normally do, name that place out loud: ""I'm putting the book on the bathroom counter.""Psychologists note that putting it into a full sentence helps you remember., For instance, maybe you misplace your cellphone all the time. If that's the case, figure out how you lose it and correct the behavior. Maybe you lose it because you forget to put it in your pocket. If that's true, then you should always make a point to return your phone to your pocket., If you're always losing stuff on your desk, for example, decide to keep it as free of clutter as possible, so you can always find what you need., As you get off the bus or get out of the taxicab, make it a habit to look behind you. You'll be less likely to leave something behind., You often lose items when you let your mind wander. If you're just going through the motions without really thinking about it, you may put an item somewhere odd and forget about it. Try to be mindful of what you're doing as you go through your day., Things should be stored where you use them the most. For instance, have a hook by your door for your keys, since that's where you'll use them the most., When you come in the door, put your keys on the hook. When you take your shoes off, place them by the dresser. If you always take the time to put items in the same place, you won't lose them., Especially with expensive items, write your name, address, and phone number on it. That way, if you lose it somewhere public, you'll have a chance that someone will return it., That is, put pictures of kids in your wallet. Take pictures of yourself that you keep on your camera, stating who you are and why you'd like your camera back. If you humanize yourself for the person who finds your item, he or she is more likely to return it."

Salt and sand as needed.",How to Shovel Snow," You will need boots that keep your feet warm and dry and provide good traction. Appropriate soles will help you maintain balance and reduce the risk of injury.Wear your boots in combination with wool socks to keep your feet as warm and dry as possible.;
, Ergonomic shovels have a bend in the handle and help you to keep your back straighter while shoveling snow, reducing the risk of back injury.Your shovel should have a long enough handle so that you can keep bending to a minimum while using it. Select a shovel that is right for your height.
You may wish to choose a plastic shovel as opposed to a heavier metal one.
There are two basic types of shovel: digging and pushing. It is far easier to push snow than it is to lift it, so if the snow is not too heavy try to push the snow rather than lift it.Consider a shovel with a smaller blade to lighten the load and reduce the risk of spinal injury. The blade is the part that actually shovels the snow.

, This will help to make shoveling less tiring by causing the snow to slide off easily.


Spray a silicon lubricant on the shovel before using to prevent snow from sticking to the surface.
A non-stick surface can be produced at home. Simply coat the blade of the snow shovel with shortening or vegetable oil., If you are out of shape, have back problems, or heart conditions, it may actually be dangerous for you to shovel snow. After a snowfall, hospitals are inundated with heart attack victims and patients with wrenched backs. Hire a local teen, borrow a snow blower from a neighbor, or contact a professional snow and ice removal service instead.

, You need to dress warmly, but not so warmly that you are sweating heavily after several minutes of work. Dress in light layers that are easy to remove and do not restrict your movement. Thermal underwear is a great option for keeping you warm while you work in the snow.


Be sure to remove clothing as you heat up while shoveling, as sweat can turn clammy on your skin and actually make you colder. Your skin should remain warm (not hot) and dry.
Wear gloves that will prevent blisters and keep your hands warm and dry.
You can also wear hand and foot warmers (like Hot Hands or Yaktrax Handwarmers/Footwarmers) in your gloves and shoes to prevent your hands and feet from getting too cold.
You lose a large amount of body heat through your head. Wear a hat and earmuffs to retain that body heat and keep yourself warm.
If it is very cold you may consider breathing through a scarf but be careful that it does not obstruct your view.A cold-weather face mask is also a good option.

, Warm muscles will be more efficient and less likely to get injured. Focus on stretching your extremities (arms and legs) and back in particular.

, Some areas can be uneven and cause you to trip, slip or fall, causing injury. Before shoveling snow, spread sand or salt on any particularly slippery locations where you might have to stand while shoveling snow. This will create foot traction and reduce the risk of injury.

, Remind yourself to keep good posture and maintain the natural curve of your spine. Keep your back straight as you change between the squatting and upright positions., Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart for balance and bend at the knees rather than at the waist or back. Keep the shovel close to your body rather than extending your arms all the way. Tighten your stomach muscles and then lift with your legs as if you are doing a squat.


Use your shoulder muscles as much as possible.
Scoop small amounts of snow at a time so that it will not be too heavy., You do not want to twist your body when lifting snow as this can injure your back. Face the pile of snow front on, keeping your body as straight as possible. Make sure you have a place in front of you to dump your shovel loads. If you have to dump the load on the side, then move your feet rather than twisting your body.


Choose a close location to dump loads so that you do not have to carry the snow far.
If clearing a certain area then dump the first loads farthest away from you so that the last shovel loads will have to travel the shortest distance to be dumped.
Do not throw snow over your shoulder! If you must lift snow then move forward it rather than throwing it backwards., Never try to remove deep snow all at once. Rather remove one or two inches (2.5-5cm) at a time, resting in between. This will reduce the weight of the loads and reduce the risk of injury., Shoveling is extremely hard physical work and you need to pace yourself to avoid ill effects. In the cold, you're not as likely to feel thirsty, but dehydration can set in quickly while completing so much physical work. Take your time.


Stretch while taking breaks to keep your muscles loose. Especially focus on your extremities (arms and legs) and back., Pain can mean a heart attack or injured back, which can occur during snow shoveling activities., Although optional, it's traditional in most snowy locations, and helps replenish your fluids. If you do not like hot cocoa, help yourself to some tea, broth, or even just water.

, Stretch when you are finished to prevent your muscles from tightening up and causing you pain. You can also relax your muscles by taking a hot shower.

, Fresh snow weighs less than older snow so you should clear snow as soon as it has fallen. As snow sits on the ground it compacts and becomes wet, making it heavier. It can also then turn into ice and become very difficult to remove.


Wait until the snowplow has come by before finishing the driveway. A snowplow will usually ""plow in"" the driveway at least a bit, pushing more snow onto the edge of your driveway. It can be easier to deal with just clearing the driveway once.
Use extra care when shoveling snow pushed onto your driveway by the plow. Plows pack the snow, making it much heavier than undisturbed, freshly fallen snow.
One shovelful of snow can weigh 20 pounds (9kg) or more!, You will need to consider what is the most efficient snow removal plan. You will also have to avoid piling snow where you'll have to just remove it again, so do not block access to snow that still needs to be cleared.


If you are clearing a rectangle, it is better to work from the center out. First clear a strip of snow around the perimeter of the rectangle. Then, starting in the center, push snow towards the cleared area. From there, lift the snow out of the area., Use a brush to get snow off cars before clearing around the car to prevent extra work.

, Pushing snow is much easier than lifting and can reduce the risk of injury. If you begin early and if the snow is not too deep, then it is better to simply push it off driveways and sidewalks. This is a good way to clear away snow while it is still falling, to reduce accumulation.

, Spread your hands far apart on the handle, with one hand close to the blade. This will provide more leverage while lifting snow.

, If you need to dig (to get to your car, for instance), dig using a steady, easy motion. If you are ""pushing"" (as you might when clearing a driveway), hold your shovel at a slight angle and begin making passes back and forth width-wise along your driveway. You should rarely need to move your shovel above waist height.

, Make sure you clear around your mailbox every time it snows. If your mail carrier cannot easily reach your mailbox, then they cannot deliver your mail!

, Be careful with salt, as it can hurt your lawn, landscaping, and your watershed. It can also damage driveways and other paved areas. Use salt only if the temperature is warm enough (above 0 degrees F/-17 degrees C).


Sand provides traction, but if more snow falls on top, it will become useless.
Salting the ground before or during a storm can actually increase the amount of snow on your sidewalks and driveways because dry snow sticks to a salted paved area but does not stick to an unsalted paved area.

, How far along a particular road does the person need to go? There are several different ways to tell them:



How many blocks or streets they'll pass. This works better in a city than in the country, because in the city there are more cross-streets to count, whereas in the country the space between them makes it easier to lose count, and some driveways look like roads of their own. For example: ""Continue down that street, passing 4 side roads along the way.""


How many traffic lights they'll pass. This is good, but you must be right about the number! For example: ""You are going to pass three traffic lights before the turn.""


Distance in miles or kilometers. For example: ""Go 3 miles (5 kilometers) on Holypoke Road""


How much time it'll take. This is better for when they'll be spending a short time on that path; any longer than that, and your directions will become inaccurate depending on how fast the person drives. For example: ""It should be about five minutes on the highway.""


Give them a drop dead point. A drop dead point is a landmark that tells them that they've gone too far and have missed their turn. For example: ""If you see the library, you have gone too far.""


, If it's not a simple, four-way intersection, give a few extra details. Otherwise, tell them to make a left or right. Give them a street name and one landmark (a traffic light, a particular store). If the person you're giving directions to is good with cardinal directions (north, south, west, east) and/or the city you're in is laid out like a grid (with all the streets perpendicular, running east-west or north-south) indicate the direction, too. For example: ""Turn a left at the traffic light onto Foster, heading east.""

, For example: ""Turn left onto Baker Street"" instead of ""At Baker Street, turn left.""

, For example: ""My house is on the left.""

, For instance, if a lane ends or is right turn only, or a road they need to turn onto is small or hidden, you might want to mention that. If there's a turn that you know people tend to miss, tell them how they'll know they've gone too far. For example: ""The lane is going to merge before the turn, and Baker street will become Forest Street. But you will want to keep traveling down it once it becomes Forest Street.""

, Remember to be concise. Detailed directions are useless if you give so many details that the person driving gets confused. For example: ""Make a left on Baker street, then a right at the second light, and go straight all the way down that road until you get to the highway, it should be about three miles (5 kilometers). Stay on the highway for three minutes and then get off on exit 7. We are the third house on the left. If you see the library, you have gone too far.""

, Whether or not they've written them down, make sure they heard you correctly and understand the route you laid out for them. For example: ""Did you said left on Baker street, then a right at the second light, and go straight all the way down that road until you get to the highway? Get off on exit 7. And it's the third house on the left. But if I pass the library, I went too far."" do not shout at them if they are confused.

Stay ahead of the game by checking your winter gear.",How to Prepare Your Home for Autumn," The days will grow colder as the fall season gets underway, and you may eventually end up using your furnace. It would be a good idea to ensure that it is in working order before the cold weather settles in. Change out the filter for a new one, and clean out any dust or debris. Check the furnace for any signs of damage—this includes things like cracks, strange noises, or strange smells.


Consider having a professional furnace technician inspect your furnace and gas lines (if you have a gas furnace).
Plan on changing your furnace's filter every 30 to 90 days. This will help your furnace last longer.If you can't replace your filter right away, clean it with a soft brush and a vacuum.;
, A humidifier will not only keep the bone-dry air at bay, but it will also prevent wood from cracking. Check the pads or plates on your humidifier, and clean them using laundry detergent. Scrape off any mineral deposits using steel wool or a wire brush., Malfunctioning and poorly-maintained gas equipment can not only be a fire hazard, but they can also release poisonous gases into the air in your home. You should have a professional inspect your gas heaters and stoves. There are also a few things you can do on your own. Start by shutting off the heater or stove completely, then:Check the exhaust vents and air-shutter openings for dust.
Vacuum the exhaust vents and air-shutter openings.
Clean the burner to ensure that it is dust and lint free.

, Check your stove for any cracks, holes, loose joints, or signs of corrosion. If you spot any damage, hire a professional to repair them. You should also clean the stove, and replace te pipe if necessary. A clean, well-maintained stove will give you a warm, bright fire.Make sure that the stove is resting on a heat-safe surface, and that there is nothing flammable close by.
If you have children or pets, consider fencing the stove off when it is burning.

, There is nothing like a warm, cozy fire, a toasty stove, or a fragrant candle on a cold, autumn night. Unfortunately, with all of these warm, cozy comforts comes an increased risk of fire. You should prepare your home and family for the possibility of a fire by doing the following:Make sure that there is a smoke and carbon monoxide detector on every floor of your home.
Test if the detectors are working by pressing the test button, and change out the batteries, if needed.
Have a multi-task fire extinguisher (it should have an A-B-C rating on the label) in an easily-accessible spot. Instruct your family members on how to use the fire extinguisher.
Check all existing fire extinguishers for damage, including dents, scratches, and corrosion. If the extinguisher is over 6 years old, get a new one.
Clear spaces around fireplaces, heaters, furnaces, and stoves. You will be using these more often as the weather gets colder, so you won't want anything flammable close to them.

, Teach your family on what to do in the event of a fire, and agree on a safe meeting place in the event of an emergency. Instruct your family members on how to properly handle stoves, heaters, and fire extinguishers. It would be a good idea to teach them to practice common sense regarding open flames—such as never leaving burning candles, fireplaces, or stoves unattended. Lastly, make sure that all possible escape routes aren't blocked, including windows.

, The last thing you'd want is to get a leak, especially once winter rolls around with its heavy storms and snows. You might also want to take a peak in the gutters. If you spot any large amounts of grit, the protective coating on your roof might be wearing off., If the rain gutters are blocked, they might overflow. Any overflowing water can cause water damage to your home, including the foundation and basement. Take out your ladder, and clear out any leaves, branches, or debris from the gutter.When you are done, consider covering your gutters with mesh guards to keep the leaves and debris out and the water flowing., As the year comes to a close, the weather will get colder. If your windows aren't sealed properly, your home could lose lots of heat, causing your gas and heating bills to spike! If you have a lot of windows and not a lot of time and money, focus on the biggest windows, such as patio doors or bay windows. Here are some more tips on insulating your windows and doors:Place a polyurethane sheet over your windows. It is often referred to as an ""insulation kit,"" and it will help keep the warm air in and the cold air out.
Check for any gaps in the caulk around your windows. If you find any gaps, fill them in with some caulk.
Check your door's weather stripper by closing it on a sheet of paper. If the paper moves about easily, the weather stripper needs to be replaced.
Check your windows and doors for tightness by holding a candle close to them. If the candle flickers, there might be a leak.

, It would be best to have this done professionally, as they usually know what to look for. If you seldom use your fireplace, however, shine a flashlight into the flue, and look for any deposits. If you find any that are ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) thick (or thicker), call in a professional chimney sweep. Here are some other things you should look out for:Check the flute for creosote buildup to prevent fires. This is essential if you have a wood-burning stove or fireplace.
Check the flue for any blockages, especially if you don't have a chimney cap. Birds love to build nests on top of chimneys!
Check the damper. It is a metal plate that opens and closes the flue above the firebox. It should open and close smoothly and easily
Check the chimney for any overall signs of damage. This includes the flue cap and any loose or broken joints.

, If you have any trees on your property, take a look at the branches, and take note of any that seem frail, weak, or dry. This included branches that never revived during the spring and summer.Focus on the branches that hang over your home, garden shed, etc.

, Because of how damp and cool autumn gets, you don't have to worry about droughts or evaporation caused by the heat and sun. This makes it a great chance to aerate and seed your lawn. Be sure to aerate your lawn first, then plant the seeds.If you don't want to do this, plan on using some winter fertilizer instead. This will keep your lawn healthy throughout the winter.

, On a similar note, you would also want to blow out any water that might be left in your sprinklers. If you don't know how to do this, consider getting it done professionally., If any water gets into those pipes and it freezes, the pipes could burst, and cause significant damage to your home. Start by closing all shut-off valves on your home's exterior faucets. Next, open the exterior faucets, and let any leftover water drain out.If your faucets don't have shut-off valves, they are not freeze-proof. You should get some Styrofoam faucet covers from your local home improvement store., Look for any cracks that are more than ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) wide. If any water gets into those cracks and it freezes, it will expand and make the cracks even bigger. This could potentially damage your sidewalk or driveway. Fill in these cracks with some cement.In addition to your driveway, you should also check your sidewalk and steps.
If you have a lot of cracks, or very big ones, hire a professional.

, This includes things like shovels, snow blowers, and stashes of ground salt. You want everything to be in working order before the first snow fall. If you wait until it starts to snow, and your shovel is broken, you may have a tough time getting out of the house in order to buy a new shovel.Consider winterizing your lawn mower by draining the gas tank and disconnecting the spark tank.At the same time, consider checking your rakes and leaf blowers, and having them out and ready for the season's first snow.

, If you have things you cannot part with, rent a storage unit. They're much cheaper out in small towns than in big cities. Incorporate your monthly storage unit expense into your budget.

, You're not going to want to sit around somewhere. Boredom is actually the toughest thing you'll face.



Hiking. Hiking is by far the hardest way to go. Everything you need is latched to your back, and the ground you can cover is limited. However, thousands of people hike incredible distances every year on major national scenic trails, and many find the experience addictive. Keep in mind that just because you're hiking doesn't mean you always have to be 'on the move'. Find a spot you like way off trail and stay as long as your food lasts. You can also use buses, cabs and shuttles to drop you off in the middle of nowhere, then hike in and find some place gorgeous to stay for a while.

Biking. Biking allows you to cover much greater distances, and it's easier than backpacking. However, you are tied to roads, instead of on trails. Get 'touring' bikes and rig them out with saddlebags and pull a cargo trailer. Mountain bikes can work also, if you plan on doing any off-road touring, or just exploring down trails and 4x4 roads. Bike touring is hardest in the mountains, with continual climbs. But the mountains are where the majority of public lands are in America, with lots of free camping. But if you have children, as well as all your gear, biking might not provide enough long-term room for you.

Canoeing. Get a 17'4"" or longer for touring so it tracks straight. Camp on islands. You can swim, fish, and bathe every day. You can travel almost anywhere via big rivers, lakes, and canals. Water is where all the life is - you can guarantee every minute will be scenic. It's where towns are also, so getting groceries and necessities will be as close as the next bridge.

Get a 4 wheel drive vehicle and do them all. Use backpacking gear, put bikes on the back, and your canoe on top. This way you're ready for anything. You can leave the car and hike in, take a trip down a river, go explore an area on mountain bikes. If you have more than one bike, place rags between them so metal isn't scraped away going down bumpy 4x4 roads. Lightweight bulky items can be strapped in under the canoe. And the inside of a vehicle has all the room you'll ever need. The drawback of course is the cost of gas and repairs. But if you budget for it, and stay put in each spot as long as possible, you can make it work.

, Come up with a general itinerary. Find out about any public lands you're visiting through the internet - and if you call, or write, they'll send you an avalanche of information for free. Come up with a set period of time, say a month, or six months, or a year, and plan and budget for it.

, The minute you begin deviating from your budget it will only get worse, the downward spiral will begin, and you will be broke and desperate in no time. Allow so much money to each month, and when you're out, stay put, until the next month begins. If that means an extra week or two in the same boring spot, do it. The longer you stay in one place the more you'll come to love it. Stay a month, and leaving will be like moving out of your home.

, Your tent is your only shelter - make it comfortable. Sleeping bags should be rated below zero - synthetic tend to be more durable than down, and still work when wet. Have plenty of wool clothing, blankets, tarps, and rope. Be aware that cotton has no insulating value when wet, unlike wool and synthetics, so have non-cotton versions of all clothing items with you. Bamboo mats are nice and great to lay out on. Sleeping on the ground will wear you out fast - get thick foam pads, or an inflatable mattress. And if you have the room, a futon mattress is worth its weight in gold.

, Relax, stay organized, stick to your budget and your plans. Always set up camp long before dark, or you'll end up in motel territory. If a motel is part of your monthly budget - fine... show up early, and enjoy it for a full 24 hours. But if you end up getting last-minute motels out of poor planning and decision-making, you'll be back in the city in no time, and back to work.

, You're going to need to bathe, wash dishes, do laundry (if you're hardcore - most people use laundromats), drinking water, possible edible plants, etc. Not only is water where all the life is, it's where most of the food is also. Wild fruiting trees do very well off water, and aquatic plants such as cattail are in abundance. Bathing on a daily basis will ground you in this lifestyle like nothing else. The greatest luxury are hot springs. They are all over the west in the US, generally free to camp beside, some deep in wilderness areas - and often a great spot to meet similar-minded people.


It's very important to know How to Purify Water so that no one gets sick.

, Nothing will destroy your enthusiasm for this lifestyle like cold. There's simply no reason to be cold and sit in your bag in the tent. In the U.S., focus on the south, places like northern Florida, and southern Arizona and New Mexico are great in the winter - tons of wild land, spectacular, nobody around, mild weather. Over the summers, go north. Check out Montana or the Adirondacks.

, Some have stay limits of up to a month. If you're on the trail, or along the river - free camping is everywhere. But in a car, it's not so easy - you'll have to search. There are still a surprising amount of low-use free campgrounds across the U.S. And often if you go down any dirt road, in National Forest lands and BLM, it will lead to something interesting...


Such as this great camp off Owl Creek down in the Apalachicola Forest of northern Florida...
Or this open field in Oconee National Forest with a grove of persimmon trees...
Or this spot in a meadow off Fontana lake when the reservoir was low...
Off East Bay in Florida under the live oaks...
Off Jones Pond in the Adirondacks...

, Even in densely populated areas, they can find a free place to stop for the night by joining these online clubs: Boondockers Welcome, Harvest Hosts, RV Golf Club and Overnight RV Parking. A whole year's membership is generally less than the cost of one night in a campground., Anything that will increase your comfort level is huge. Without furniture, it gets old sitting on the ground. You can even sleep in your hammocks.

, Even a quick dip in a cold river can go miles toward making you feel clean and refreshed. Feeling clean is very important, and will cut down on the longings for a motel. If there's no water source nearby, sunbathe. An hour in the sun will open up all your pores and make you feel clean. If there is no sun, and it's cold - build a sweatlodge out of saplings and tarps and blankets. But consider that if there's no sun and it's cold, maybe you're in the wrong place!

, You can cook anything you like out on a fire. Try cast iron skillets and baking in a Dutch Oven. Stromboli, cinnamon rolls, lentil stew, pancakes on the griddle, roasted yams in the fire, it is all possible. Everything tastes better cooked over a fire - and considering your Spartan lifestyle, you'll worship every bite. Your appreciation for life and everything it offers will jump 1000%. You can even dry fruits into leathers and smoke your own jerky. If you do not spoil yourself at meal-time, you will start longing for life indoors and inevitably break down.

, Pack as many guides with you of edible plants that you can - take a small library. There is a staggering abundance of wild food out there, if you only look around and get the most basic knowledge of edible plants. Incorporate whatever you find into your diet - this will easily cover any nutrients you're craving for with your limited access to fresh food. It will also connect you to the land, and build some independence. Make sure you eat sustainably, though, leaving some of the plants behind.


Always use the Universal Edibility Test (as described in How to Test if a Plant Is Edible) or something similar to make sure the plant is safe to eat.
Here are some ideas:
How to Harvest Wild Rice
How to Eat Yucca
How to Eat Prickly Pear Cactus



, This is harder than it sounds. See How to Be Laid Back. Find things to do besides just playing and loafing. For instance:


Work on primitive crafts, such as cordage, vine baskets, mats, coconut bowls, sandals, etc.:

Make a pine needle basket.
Try beading and sewing a pair of moccasins.
Start building a primitive shelter, such as a thatched hut.



Paint some of the fantastic scenes you come across, if you're an artist. Small galleries are very open to local work. An income from this could go a long ways towards supporting your minimalistic lifestyle.
Take some time to read literature and philosophy, and try to get a feel for the 'big picture'.

, When you're low on money, go make some more for a while. Do something new and interesting. Tourist areas are always hiring outside people during their period of peak tourism, and the jobs run the gamut. You can also make money gathering and selling wild mushrooms. For example, you can sell lobster mushrooms for $15/lb to chefs in high-end restaurants, and they're a lot of fun to gather. You can even make money gathering seed such as 'desert willow' to sell to companies for reforestation. There's infinite opportunities out there to make some cash and regroup - you don't need to be tied to a job/career to survive.

, Keep a journal of all that happens, as well as your thoughts and moods. Take plenty of pictures. It will become a precious record of one of the most significant times in your life.

Install a carbon monoxide detector in your home.,
Depending on your current configuration, you will need to do one of two things: install a gas line or shut off the gas supply.,
Remove the old gas logs.,
Remove the grate.,
Disconnect gas line from the burner.,
Clean the firebox.",How to Install Gas Logs1," Carbon monoxide is caused when fuels, such as the natural gas used with your gas logs, are not completely burned. Unsafe levels of carbon monoxide cannot be detected by smell or sight and can cause death. For your safety, a carbon monoxide detector should be installed in the fireplace room and each bedroom in the home. The detector will be your only warning against unsafe levels of carbon monoxide in the home.;
,


Shut off the gas supply: If your fireplace is already configured for a gas log application, then be sure to shut off the gas supply before attempting these procedures. Failure to follow this step can result in a fire or explosion that may result in property damage, injury, or even loss of life. Once the gas line is shut off, proceed to Part 1, Step 2.
Install a gas line. If you were using the fireplace for a wood burning application, you must first install a gas line before you can install gas logs. This step should be completed by a certified professional. Improper installation of the gas line can cause property damage, serious injury, or death. Once the gas line is installed, proceed to Part 1, Step 5.

, Put on a pair of work gloves and carefully remove the old logs from the firebox. The logs will typically lift straight off the grate. Ensure you have a box or trash bag to hold the old logs after removal.

, Once the logs are removed, there will likely be a grate installed in the firebox. Remove the masonry screws that secure the grate to the firebox, and place the grate to the side for disposal.

, Ensuring the gas line is shut off first, disconnect the gas line from the burner. Remove the old burner and place aside for disposal.

, Before installing your new log set, thoroughly clean inside the firebox. Sweep up any soot, dirt, or debris, and then use a shop vacuum to remove any finer particles that are difficult to sweep. If the fireplace was used to burn wood, contact a chimney sweep to have the chimney professionally cleaned.

Position your face close to the flame.,
Purse your lips together and blow.,
Stand clear of the smoke.",How to Extinguish a Candle1," Move in until you’re only a few inches away, with the wick at around mouth level. This way, the air won’t have to travel as far to reach the flame, which will allow you to put it out easier.Don’t hover directly over the candle, or the heat rising from the flame may burn you.;
, Exhale suddenly through the opening in your lips. The key is to create a thin stream of air that will put out the candle in one quick gust. Keep blowing until the flame is completely extinguished.If the flame sputters but doesn’t go out, you may not be blowing directly on it.
Be careful not to blow too forcefully—doing so can send droplets of wax spraying, resulting in a big mess or even minor burns.

, When you blow out a candle, it releases a plume of thick, dark smoke. Keeping your distance from the extinguished candle will prevent this smoke from depositing soot on your skin or clothes or causing them to smell.Whenever possible, make it a point to extinguish your candles in a well-ventilated area where smoke won’t collect.
Over the long term, blowing out your candles can lead to unsightly black buildup on the wax or around the the inside of the container."

Applying pipe thread sealant around the gas line connection on the burner.
Attach the gas supply line to the burner.
Fasten the connection tightly using a wrench.

, Place the burner in the desired position inside the firebox. Then use a masonry bit to drill holes in the firebox brick. This will make it possible to secure the burner into place with the masonry screws. Finish the installation by screwing the masonry screws into place.

, If your gas log set came with a grate, install the grate over the burners.

, Once your burner and grate are in place, turn on the gas supply to check for leaks. Spray a water and soap mixture along the gas line to check for leaks. Any leaks will be evident by the bubbles created at the leak site. If leaks are found, take necessary steps to either tighten connections or replace faulty hoses.

, Installation of the gas logs will vary by brand and model, so be sure to reference your installation manual for specific directions. In general, the logs will only fit in the correct configuration. Place each log over the intended pin until all logs are in place.

, If your gas log kit came with accessories, such as ash covered coals and rock wool, spread them around to give the set a realistic touch.

, You’re done. Turn on your gas fireplace and enjoy the beautiful, hassle-free warmth of your gas burning fireplace.

Grab a candle snuffer.,
Place the bell of the snuffer over the wick.,
Hold the snuffer in place until the flame goes out completely.",How to Extinguish a Candle2," Some people dislike the sooty mess that blowing out a candle can leave behind. For these people, a metal candle snuffer can provide a cleaner, more efficient alternative. These make useful tools to have on hand if you want to keep your candles looking clean and new for as long as possible.Snuffers have been used for centuries to extinguish fire lights with minimal smoke.Candle snuffers of various sizes can usually be found wherever candles are sold.

, The bell is the small metal cup at the end of the long handle. When you lower the bell over the flame, it deprives it of oxygen, stifling it gradually. Unlike blowing out the candle, this won’t create as much smoke or soot.Some candle snuffers may resemble a cylinder, pyramid or disc instead of a rounded bell.
Keep your hand a safe distance away from the flame to prevent accidents.

, You may see a small wisp of smoke escape from around the edges of the bell. Keep it over the wick for at least one full second. Afterward, cover the candle with a lid and store the snuffer in a safe, out-of-the-way place.If you don’t hold the snuffer long enough, the flame may reignite, forcing you to try a second time.
Be careful handling metal snuffers while they’re still hot.

Take hold of the wick with a wick dipper or pair of tweezers.,
Press the wick into the melted candle wax.,
Straighten the wick.,
Trim the wick.",How to Extinguish a Candle3," Bring the wick dipper around the sides of the wick, rather than directly over the top. Get a secure grip on the wick and hold it steady.If you don’t have a wick dipper on hand, you could also use another long, slender implement, such as a chopstick or paperclip, to force the wick down.
In some cases, the pressure from the wick dipper or tweezers may be enough to put the flame out on its own., Bend the wick at an angle until it’s fully submerged in the liquid wax. This will kill the flame without producing any unpleasant scents or smoke.Be sure to pull the wick out right away to keep from losing it inside the wax pool.
You’ll have the most success using wick dippers, tweezers and other tools on free-standing candles with minimal tunneling (the sinking that occurs when the wax around the wick burns down faster than the rest of the candle)., Remove the wick from the wax and smooth it out so that it stands up on its own. Be careful not to break it or pull it out of the candle while you're doing this. Let the wax cool before handling the wick any further.

Extinguishing the candle in its own wax has the added benefit of conditioning the wick, allowing it to light easier and stay lit longer during future uses., Once the wax has had time to dry, use a wick trimmer to clip away the frayed, burnt tip. ⅛” (.31cm) is just about the perfect length to keep the wick burning brighter for longer. Discard the burnt wick tip, along with any other debris that may have fallen into the wax—these can present a fire hazard if they reignite.A pair of manicure scissors or nail clippers makes an acceptable substitute for a traditional wick trimmer.Get in the habit of trimming the wicks of your candles every time you use them. A pristine wick burns more evenly, which can greatly lengthen a candle’s lifespan.

"
"
Lick the tips of your fingers.,
Pinch and release the wick quickly.,
Be careful not to burn yourself.",How to Extinguish a Candle4," Run the pads of your fingers over your tongue just enough to moisten them slightly. Most people prefer to use their thumb and forefinger, but any two fingers will suffice. The idea is to wet them just enough to stifle the candle with a light touch.Wetting your fingers will also help protect your skin from the heat of the flame.
If there’s a source of water nearby (like a sink or drinking glass), you can prepare your fingers that way, as well.

, In one rapid motion, grasp the wick between your two fingers. The moisture should cause the flame to die as soon as you make contact. Make sure you let go immediately so as not to take any chances.You may feel a warm sensation momentarily. Once the flame is out, however, the heat will dissipate almost instantly.
The sizzling sound you hear is nothing to worry about—it’s just the moisture on your fingertips evaporating.

, Needless to say, attempting to extinguish a candle wick with exposed fingers is risky, since it requires you to actually touch it. Always exercise the utmost caution anytime you bring any part of your body close to a burning candle. If the flame doesn’t go out, try again or give a different method a shot.

Practice a few times on an unlit candle (with dry fingers) before you try for real.
The inherent danger of using your fingers to put out a candle makes this more of a neat party trick than a practical everyday solution.

Gather ingredients.,
Burn the candle.,
Now mix the salt into the candle.,
You can actually make a candle that has salt in it.",How to Make Your Candles Last Longer4," Get a metal spoon, table salt, and a candle.

, Wait until the candle starts to melt and you have some melted wax. You will need a fair amount.

, Mix it in good, use the metal spoon and try to do it before the candle hardens again. Do not mix in to much salt.

, Burn the candle until it has a small shallow hole in the middle of it, big enough for your light.

, This is good as it stops you from burning the candle, but gives you that candle look. This method is best for hot days or when you don't want the hazard of watching burning candles.

Understand how the smoke-burner stove works based on the design of the combustion chamber (its dimensions, primary and secondary air holes, and either air pumped with a fan or using natural draft without a fan).,
Smoke: There is a chance that your stove might sometimes generate too much smoke, for the following reasons


Chips of wood or shavings are wet.,
Kitchen environment: Always use a well-ventilated kitchen or semi-ventilated or fully open areas.,
Outdoors: shield the stove from the wind using a windscreen.

,
Fill correctly with your chosen fuel: There should be contiguity between pieces of fuel (no voids, but not packed too tightly -- there should be chance for flow of primary air).,
Lighting the fuel: Use small pieces of wood shavings soaked (not too much) in any mild fire oil (kerosene / diesel / vegetable oil / etc.).,
Multigrade fuel: If using multigrade fuel, sort/sieve it and could classify it into two grades for use.,
If a pot skirt is available, use it.,
Kill the fire, when the cooking is done, if the stove will be unattended, empty the remaining fuel and charcoal into a tub of water or into an air-tight fire and heat-proof container to prevent burns, smoke, and carbon monoxide poisoning.",How to Use a Woodgas or Smoke Burner Stove,"


If the stove uses a fan, then it is called a Forced-Air TLUD (Top lit Updraft)
If the stove uses only gravity air pressure, it is called a Natural Draft TLUD.
Follow the instructions provided for each model.;
,

A good water content ranges from only 10-12%.


Excess carbon (in the smoke) 30-40% of stoichiometric air (4.7kg air/kg biomass)
Insufficient air from the primary air source - blocked by the biomass material, or material packed too tightly, or biomass of different sizes (big and small pieces mixed), etc.

, If exhaust fans are available, keep them on during and after cooking until all the charcoal have turned cold or turned to ash.

,, Homogeneous size of biomass pieces / shavings, Avoid wet biomass and bark of certain trees in the biomass.

, Spread a layer of it evenly on the top of the fuel charge, light using a matchstick / lighter, then place the bowl / container for cooking, and switch on the fan.

, Say 1 inch (2.5 cm) size fuel / 2-inch size fuel, etc.


If you want to use two grades of fuel simultaneously use the large size grade at the bottom and then the small size fuel at the top, see that this small size fuel simply does not slip downwards while burning. If it is true wood gas stove, the char-mass produced will have some brittleness / stiffness and the finer biomass will not move downwards. In quasi-wood gas stove the small size fuel might get too much air and be converted into ash from embers that might move downwards generating some amount of excess smoke, which is unexpected.

, It will improve the efficiency of the stove between 20% to 50%.

,


Avoiding steam injury: dump it into a ""large quantity of COLD water"". If you dump into hot water or a small quantity of cold water, a dangerous amount of hot steam may be produced which could cause severe burns to your hands or arms.

Ask FICO for your scores.,
Get your scores from the individual credit bureaus.,
Ask your credit card issuer for your FICO score.",How to Understand Your FICO Credit Score1," You can get all of your FICO scores from the Fair Isaac Corporation’s consumer website, myfico.com.FICO does not provide these scores for free, but they will allow you to order your scores from all three credit bureaus -- Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax -- in one report. A one-time report costs $59.85.;
, You can order your FICO scores from each of the three major credit bureaus separately. Note that credit bureaus may use different versions of the FICO score. For this reason, it’s important to get your FICO scores from all three major credit bureaus. Visit their websites for details on how to purchase your credit reports.Be aware that the credit bureaus often will not allow one-time report purchases. They prefer you to purchase a renewing membership for a monthly fee. You must cancel these memberships in order to avoid being charged the monthly fee.

, Several credit card companies will now provide you with a free copy of your FICO score. The terms and availability varies between companies (and sometimes even between credit card products), so contact your issuer to find out if this is an option.In the United States, these companies include Bank of America, Barclaycard US,Chase, Citibank,Discover,and USAA.
Other credit card issuers may provide other types of access to some or all of your credit scores and reports. Contact them for details.

Understand that you have different scores.,
Visit each bureau’s website to determine how they calculate your score.,
Learn how FICO calculates your FICO score.,
Evaluate your score range.",How to Understand Your FICO Credit Score2," The three major credit bureaus in the US -- Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion -- each use different types of FICO scores when calculating your credit score. They may even use different types of FICO scores for different products, such as mortgages vs. credit cards. You will likely have different credit scores from each bureau. For example, according to FICO, Experian uses FICO Score 2 for mortgages, but FICO Score 3 for many credit cards and FICO Bankcard Scores 8 and 2 for others.
Equifax uses FICO Score 5 for mortgages and FICO Bankcard Scores 8 and 5 for credit cards.
TransUnion uses FICO Score 4 for mortgages, and FICO Bankcard Scores 8 and 4 for credit cards., Each of the credit bureaus will analyze your credit history and calculate your score slightly differently. Your FICO score at each bureau will depend on the information each bureau has about you, and how it uses that information in its calculations.Your FICO scores may also differ from each bureau’s own credit scores because of score ranges. For example, FICO uses a score range of 300 (lowest) to 850 (highest), while Equifax uses a score range of 280 (lowest) to 850 (highest).The name of your FICO score will also vary by bureau. Equifax uses the name BEACON, Experian uses Experian/FICO Risk Model, and TransUnion uses FICO Risk Score, Classic., FICO takes five areas into account when calculating your FICO credit score. Each area is weighted by importance (approximate weights are given below). These areas are:Payment history, 35%. This area investigates your “track record” of good credit behavior. It will consider things such as whether you pay on time, whether any accounts have gone into collection, and how many of your accounts you have no late payments on.
Amounts owed, 30%. This area considers the amount of debt you owe. Owing money on credit accounts will not necessarily give you a low FICO score. FICO usually considers things such as the number of accounts that carry a balance and the percentage of your available credit used. For example, if you have 6 credit cards, and 5 of them carry a high balance, you may be more of a credit risk and your FICO score will likely be lower.
Length of credit history, 15%. In general, the longer your credit history is, the higher your FICO score is likely to be. This is because you have shown yourself to be responsible over a long period of time. However, even short credit histories may have a high FICO score depending on the rest of the factors.You need a minimum of 6 months of credit history to generate a FICO score. There must also be at least one undisputed account.


Type of credit used, 10%. This area examines your retail, installment loans (such as auto payments), mortgages, and credit cards. If you have a good mix, you are more likely to have a higher FICO score because you appear to use credit responsibly. FICO will also consider how many of each account type you have. For example, if you have a dozen credit cards but only one auto loan, this may be an imbalanced credit picture.
New credit, 10%. If you have opened several new accounts in a short period of time, this could damage your FICO score. This area also looks at how long it has been since you opened a new account, and how long it has been since a lender made a credit report inquiry.

, FICO has a score range from 300-850. However, different lenders interpret this range in different ways. Some of these differences may be due to state and federal lending laws. For some lenders, 680 may be a “good” credit score, while for others 720 may be considered “good.”Different lenders are free to choose which FICO score they will use, and from which bureau. For example, ABC Car Dealership may use your FICO score from Experian, whereas XYZ Car Dealership may use your FICO score from TransUnion.
Most FICO and credit bureau scores range between 600-750.
A score above 700 usually indicates that you are a responsible credit manager.
If you can, speak with your lender about what they consider a “good” FICO score before you apply for a loan. This can help you avoid disappointments and rejected loans.

In the United States, each bureau is required to provide you one free copy of your credit report each year under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). AnnualCreditReport.com’s services are not available outside the US.The law requires the credit bureaus to provide you one free copy of your credit report each year. However, it does not require them to provide you with your credit score for free., In addition to reporting any errors or discrepancies to the credit bureaus, you should also contact the lender or information provider and notify them of the error. Both the credit bureau and the information provider are legally required to investigate and correct “inaccurate or incomplete” information in your credit report.For example, if a medical bill has been sent to collections, you should contact the hospital or doctor as well as the credit bureau. If you know the collection agency to which the bill was sent, contact them too.
The FTC has a sample dispute letter that you can use to notify the credit bureau and/or lender of errors.
They have 30 days to respond to your dispute. If they cannot verify the negative information, they have to remove it.

, Identity theft can quickly affect your FICO scores. Thieves can open a host of new accounts using your personal information. It can be very difficult to undo the damage done by identity theft.Shred sensitive documents, such as bills, credit card statements, and other documents with personal information.
Report lost or stolen credit and debit cards immediately.
Report fraudulent activity to each credit bureau and the lender in question.

, Some people think that carrying any balance on credit cards will damage your FICO score, but the opposite is usually true. Making regular payments on very small account balances shows that you are a responsible credit holder. You can keep a good FICO score by managing how much of your available credit you use and making your payments on time.Keep low balances on credit cards and other ""revolving"" credit accounts. Too many cards close to the ""max"" limits can raise a red flag.
Don't have balances on too many credit accounts at once, especially credit cards. This can indicate that you're overextending yourself, and suggests to lenders that you won't be able to pay them.
Don’t close old accounts to raise your FICO score. In most cases, this might actually lower your FICO score because it will reduce your available credit percentage. Any late payments or other negative items from those accounts will still affect your FICO score.Open new accounts only as needed. You should aim for a healthy mix of credit accounts. However, opening new lines of credit to improve that mix will probably not improve your FICO score., You can often negotiate late payments with your original creditors if you are not more than 150 days late on your payments.You can ask your creditor to accept a lower amount, or to waive late fees. They may not cooperate with you, but it is in your best interest to ask. Ask if they will agree to mark your account “paid as agreed” (best) or at least “settled” (second-best).


Sometimes, you may be able to “erase” an account that went to collection by offering to pay the remaining balance. If the company agrees, they can report the account as “paid as agreed” or remove the debt entirely from the bureau’s records., Credit repair services often advertise themselves as a fast and easy “get out of debt” solution. However, their services can be very expensive, and in most cases they cannot do anything for you that you can’t do yourself., There is no “quick fix” for improving your credit score, no matter what some disreputable companies say.


For example, public records stay on your record for years. Liens and delinquencies stay on your credit report for seven years. Bankruptcies can stay on your report for up to ten years.

Are you planning on changing walls, adding new furniture, installing new windows, or keeping it simple with a lick of paint?;
, You may need to prioritize what's possible, but start with a broad brainstorm of what you'd prefer to have.


If you are in school you might want a desk, or some built-in shelves.
If you are a fashionista, you might want a bigger closet. This is a much bigger construction job than just adding some new furniture to the room, but at this stage it's okay to ""dream big"".

, It's time to get more realistic and set your limits. The worst thing to do, is buy everything you like, then run out of money for the things you really want.

, Unless you're hiring a construction crew and doing a large remodel, you'll probably have to let some options go out of the window, based on your budget and DIY skills.


If you are planning a big remodel, you'll eventually need to get estimates from professionals so that you can find out whether your plans are do-able and financially feasible (see next section).

, Talk to the people you live with (if you live with roommates), or a landlord (apartment), or parents (if your a child and still lives with them), and make sure they are okay with your plan.


While this step isn't actually necessary for calculating costs, it's a good step to take, since you don't want to waste your time getting quotes for a job that isn't going to be allowed by the home-owner anyway.

, Go to stores, or go online shopping.


When you are at the stores record the prices of the things you want.  Then you can see how much things cost.
It is much easier to find items and shop in general online.

, If you want to make structural changes to your house contact multiple professionals.


Talk to a range of construction companies/professionals and get quotes from them.
Compare the work they do and their prices. Make sure they all meet local licensing and insurance requirements, and pick the best company for your requirements.

,  Make a detailed list of everything you'd need: new furniture items, supplies, construction costs, etc. Add all the costs up and there is the cost for your bedroom remodel.

Debit and ATM cards linked to your account may have transaction limits.;
, Use online banking to help track your account if your bank offers it. Remember that holds are often placed on second chance account transactions, so be careful not to forget about transactions that aren't immediately reflected in your available balance.


Establish overdraft protection if possible. Even small overdrafts can lead to permanent closure of second chance accounts. Many banks will link your second chance checking account to a savings account, allowing funds from savings to be transferred to cover accidental overdrafts in checking.

, Never attempt to charge or withdraw more than what is in your account. Cards linked to second chance accounts often have restrictions that do not allow transactions to go through without available funds.

, They can offer advice and tips that are specific to your account. Some institutions offer upgrades to standard accounts after you have kept your second chance account in good standing for a period of time. Financial institution representatives can help you get a better idea of what steps you need to take to obtain an account with fewer restrictions.

Learn about wire transfers.,
Process a bank-to-bank wire transfer.,
Complete an international wire transfer.",How to Wire Transfer Money1," A wire transfer is an electronic method of transferring funds from one person or company to another. One common method of sending a transfer is from one bank to another. To send a wire transfer, the sender provides information on the receiving party’s financial institution to their own bank. Once the transfer is complete, the sender’s bank provides a confirmation number documenting the transfer.Assume that Person A wants to send money to Person B. Person A would begin by submitting instructions to his or her financial institution. The instructions would typically include the recipient's bank name, ABA number, the recipient’s account number and the amount being sent.
Bank-to-bank transfers require both the sender and the recipient to be account holders at their respective banks or credit unions.
ABA stands for the American Banker’s Association. An ABA number identifies a specific federally chartered or state chartered bank or savings institution. The sender’s bank uses the ABA number to identify the receiver’s bank.
The ABA number is the 9-digit number usually located on the bottom left corner of an account holder’s check. The number directly to the right of it is typically the account number. You can also find a bank’s ABA number online.
Once the sender’s financial institution receives these instructions, they will send the funds to the recipient. The recipient will typically receive the funds on the same day.
The sender is charged a fee of $20 to $40 for the transfer. The recipient may also be charged a fee.;
, Check your funds. Verify that you have sufficient funds in your account to complete the transaction. You should reconcile your bank account before the transfer. Confirm any outstanding checks or deposits that have not posted to your account. Once you confirm your adjusted bank balance, you can send funds.Deduct both the amount of the transfer and any transfer fees from your bank balance.
Contact your bank or credit union. Depending on the services your institution provides, you may be able to access the forms you need online. If not, you will need to call or visit a local branch. If the process is new to you, call or visit a bank branch.
Complete your bank’s wire transfer form. You will need to fill out information for both you as the sender and for the receiver’s bank. For domestic banks, this will include the ABA number and account number for the receiver’s bank. You’ll also need to indicate the amount you are sending.
Show or verify any required identification information. Before sending the money to another account, a state issued ID (if wiring in person) or verification information (if wiring over the phone or Internet) will be required to complete the transaction.
After your wire transfer is sent, your bank will provide a confirmation number to you. Keep in mind that banks process transfers in the order they are received. You may not receive confirmation immediately. The receiving bank’s wire transfer department needs time to process your transfer.

, For international wire transfers, you will need the receiving bank’s BIC (Bank Identifier Code). One common type of BIC code is a SWIFT code. Both of these codes refer to a unique identifier for a bank. For wire transfers within the European Union (EU), you will need the IBAN (International Bank Account Number). Ask your bank to assist you with this if necessary.You will need to complete a transfer form. The form will require information about the sending bank and the institution that receives the transfer. Ask your bank to help you gather the information you need for the receiving bank.
If you are sending a wire overseas, you may be dealing with a foreign language. Call or visit your financial institution to be clear about the detail of the transfer.
An international transfer will require your transferred funds to be converted from one currency into another. Make sure that you understand the current exchange rates for the two currencies. If your transfer requires the bank to convert US dollars into Euros, for example, make sure that you understand the exchange rate. If not, you may be not transferring the amount you intend to move.

Decide on a cash office.,
Consider some alternatives.,
Go over the PayPal system of sending funds.",How to Wire Transfer Money2," Sending a wire transfer through a cash office is different than a bank-to-bank transfer. No bank accounts are required to send or receive funds through a cash office. Instead of posting funds to a bank account, the receiver uses their personal identification and a confirmation number to access the funds.Go to the office, call, or visit their website. Most retail wire-transfer companies offer services online and over the phone. Fees may vary depending on which way you contact the company.
Check your funds. Once you confirm the fee you will pay, add the fee to your transfer amount. That total represents the amount you’ll need to provide to the cash office.
Provide the information. You will need to give your address, the recipient’s name, and the payment destination. The company will give you a code that you will give to the recipient.
The recipient presents the code when receiving the money, along with photo ID.

, Banks and cash offices are two popular ways to transfer money electronically, but there are many others. It is important to explore your options to find the solution that works for you. You can consider money transfers or an online funds transfer service like PayPal.Look at an email money transfer. Some financial institutions, particularly large Canadian banks, offer email money transfers via a service known as Interact e-transfer. With Interact e-transfer, money is not actually transferred via email, but rather the recipient receives an email with a secret question.
By confirming the email, the funds are send to the recipient's bank account, and the email acts essentially as an e-check.
This is a highly convenient solution, since the sender simply needs the recipient's email address to initiate the transaction. In addition, there is no fee to the receiver, and the sender typically pays only between $1 and $4 dollars.

, PayPal is a dominant and widely used method to transfer money electronically. With PayPal, the recipient is required to have a PayPal account. You can send funds through PayPal using a debit or credit card.The receiver’s account is typically linked to a bank account. Once the funds post to the receiver’s PayPal account, the receiver can move the funds to a bank account.
It normally takes several business days to move available PayPal funds to a bank account. While PayPal is convenient, it may take longer to move funds than a wire transfer.
There are fees deducted from the funds you receive through PayPal. For smaller transfers the charge is 2.9% of the amount sent, plus $0.30 per transaction. Fees are typically higher for international transfers, and receivers should be mindful that an exchange rate would be charged on funds being transferred internationally. As the total dollars you send increase, the percentage fee on amounts sent will decline.

Write a foreign draft or check.,
Wire money through your bank.,
Gather relevant information.",How to Transfer Money From Overseas1," If you have a bank account in a foreign country and you want to send it to a recipient in the United States, you can write a check in the local currency and send it to the recipient in the United States. The recipient may then cash the check at a bank in the United States. However, the recipient may encounter some obstacles. Regulations and policies surrounding personal and business checks differ in countries around the world.Many banks in the United States will not cash a foreign check unless it is payable through a bank in the United States.
It is expensive. If the American bank accepts the check, they will keep a percentage of the exchange rate. Also, they may charge a foreign-check processing fee.
The American bank may impose a hold on the funds. This means the money won’t be available to the recipient until the check clears, which may take days, weeks or months.;
, You can go to your bank and request a wire transfer. A wire transfer is an electronic transfer of funds from one financial institution to another. You will need to know if the receiving bank accepts wire transfers in foreign currency. If not, you will have to wire the money in U.S. currency.Expect to pay a flat fee for initiating the wire transfer. Also, the recipient will pay a flat fee for receiving the wire transfer. The amount of the fee varies by bank.
International wire transfers can take anywhere from three to five days.

, To wire money internationally, You will need to know the recipient’s bank account number and name and address. Also, you will need to now the receiving bank’s name and address, routing number and code.SWIFT codes are international identifier codes that are assigned to every bank by Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) in Belgium.The routing number is a nine-digit code that represents your U.S. bank’s location. You can find it on the bottom left-hand side of your checks."

Burn safe materials.,
Avoid using flammable liquids to start fires.,
Start the fire correctly.,
Clean out the ashes after every fire.,
Keep a fireplace screen in front of the fireplace when in use.",How to Use a Fireplace Safely1," Only burn natural materials in your fireplace; never introduce foreign substances, including cardboard, newspaper, or paper trash. These substances burn poorly, produce a lot of smoke, and release chemicals into the air. Only burn tinder (such as pine needles or tiny sticks), kindling (small sticks or pinecones), and fuel (large logs, up to about 14” long).Burning hardwood (such as maple and oak) will diminish the amount of soot and ash buildup in your chimney. Also avoid burning wood that is wet or still green, as it will produce large amounts of smoke and not burn well.;
, You should never put gasoline into a fireplace. Gas is volatile, and could easily cause a fire to get out of control. If you’re struggling to light a fire, use a small amount of lighter fluid instead, although it’s best to just use matches and tinder. Flammable liquids are risky and raise the chances of a house fire.If your fires aren’t starting consistently, hardware stores also sell small (rough 2” x 2”) fire-starter squares that will burn for about 15–20 minutes.

, If you build your fire efficiently the first time, it will burn for longer, heat your home effectively, and result in minimal smoke escaping into your home. Start by laying your tinder at the bottom of the fire, followed by kindling. Lay the wood pieces in such a way that there will be room for airflow under the fire—without airflow, the fire will go out immediately. Finally, add two or three logs on top; you can add more logs once the initial couple are burning.When you add logs to the fire, make sure to set them gently on top of the already-burning logs or coals—if you throw new logs on, sparks and burning coals will fly off. Add logs one or two at a time, as you don’t want to turn your quiet fire into a bonfire by adding too many logs at once.
Before you place any wood in the fireplace, remember to open the damper. People often forget this step, and a closed damper will result in your fire filling your home with smoke.

, Before lighting a new fire in the evening, you’ll need to scoop out the ash from the previous fire. This will help keep your fireplace clean and attractive, and will prevent live coals from burning in your fireplace while you’re away from the house.You can purchase an ash shovel at a hardware store. Also consider purchasing other common fireplace tools, such as brush and fireplace tongs or prong. The latter will allow you to move burning logs around in the fire, if they’re at risk of falling out.

, A fireplace screen should be at least 3 feet (0.91 m) high, and most common models are be made of fine, crossed wire on a flexible, three-part frame. This screen will catch any live sparks that leap out of the fire, and will also prevent larger logs from falling out.A screen is a necessity if you have small children or animals in the house, as they could easily run or stumble into an open fire. If there are more durable models of fireplace grate available at your local hardware store, it may be wise to purchase a heavy grate in addition to (or instead of) a lighter screen.

Wire money from Western Union or MoneyGram.,
Compare Western Union and MoneyGram.,
Remit funds with PayPal.,
Send money with Xoom.",How to Transfer Money From Overseas2," You can visit a physical office, or you can initiate the wire transfer online. You can fund the transfer with cash or with a debit or credit card. You can send the funds directly to the recipient’s bank account, or to another Western Union or MoneyGram office.You pay in your local currency, and the recipient in the United States receives the money in U.S. dollars. Therefore, know the exchange rate and adjust accordingly so that the recipient receives the correct amount.
For example, suppose you are in Australia and you want a recipient in the U.S. to receive $20, and the exchange rate is 1 AUD (Australian dollar) = 0.6985 USD (U.S. dollar). You would need to send $28.62 in AUD for the recipient to receive $20 USD.
The fees for sending money internationally vary depending on the amount you are sending, how quickly the money needs to be available and the payment type you choose.

, Western Union is the larger of the two companies. It has been established for a longer amount of time, so it has name recognition and people trust the company. Western Union fees can be expensive. MoneyGram fees tend to be somewhat lower. MoneyGram has also built its reputation on international money transfers., PayPal is an online remittance service. Both parties must be registered PayPal users. Also, both must have a registered bank account. To initiate a transfer, log in to your PayPal account and click on “Send and Request,” and then click on “Send Money to Friends and Family.” Enter the e-mail address, mobile number or name of the recipient. You enter the amount in your local currency, and PayPal exchanges it so the recipient receives it in his local currency. The price per transaction depends on the currency you are using. It is generally a percentage of the amount sent plus a flat transaction fee., With Xoom, you can transfer up to $2,999 USD from a bank account for a flat fee of $4.99 USD. It costs more to use a credit card. The money is deposited into the recipient’s bank account within two business days. The exchange rate is fixed at the time of your transfer.Xoom can send money to 56 countries outside of the US and allows you to send money to anyone with a US bank account.
In 2012, Consumer Reports ranked Xoom as the best way to transfer money internationally, beating out PayPal, MoneyGram and Western Union in fees and exchange rates."

The company does not charge a fee; they make money on the exchange rate.Consider OFX, an online forex company that accepts wire transfers from your bank account or you can apply to set up an ACH direct debit. Most transfers take one to two business days and you can track the progress on their app. The fees are minimal — $5 for transfers under $5,000, and no fee for $5,000 or above., If you don’t already have one, open an account with the broker. It may take a day or two to open a new account. Next pay in or transfer money from your bank account to the brokerage account. Give the brokerage the information about the recipient. Research the exchange rate.If you are comfortable with the current exchange rate, then use it to complete the transaction.

, If you need to send a large sum of cash at some point in the future, lock in a favorable rate today with a forward contract. This means that the broker agrees to use a rate upon which you agree today for an exchange that happens in the future. On the date of the exchange, the contract rate is used, not the current exchange rate.You can use this strategy if you think your local currency with weaken before the trade occurs.

Shop around.,
Consider the size of your transaction carefully.,
Use your local currency.,
Choose a longer time frame.",How to Transfer Money From Overseas4," Not all services use the same exchange rate. Also, fees vary from service to service. Transaction fees and exchange rate differences add up quickly. Spend some time researching how much it will cost to complete the money transfer using different scenarios.For example, one service may charge you a higher fee but offer a better exchange rate. Look at the total amount the recipient receives. Sometimes paying a higher fee costs less in total because of a favorable exchange rate.

, In general, it is less expensive to transfer a large amount once than to transfer several small amounts. However, the fees you incur will be based on the amount you transfer. If you are transferring small amounts, use a service that is designed for small amounts and has appropriate fees., You will save money if you transfer the money in your local currency and let the recipient exchange the currency. If you try to exchange the currency ahead of time in order to wire funds in the recipient’s currency, you will spend more money. For larger sums, however, use a foreign exchange service. They always get the best rates on currency exchanges., The faster you want the money transferred, the higher the fees you will pay. It is possible to send money within hours or minutes. However, this service can be expensive depending on the amount you are sending. If possible, allow the transaction to take several days or weeks. If you have locked in a favorable exchange rate, you will end up saving money on fees."

Inspect your fireplace every two years.,
Keep the chimney cap clean.,
Clean your chimney annually.,
Be aware of signs of potential problems with your fireplace.",How to Use a Fireplace Safely2," Parts of the fireplace can break or wear down, and it’s important to note these before the fireplace malfunctions or causes an emergency fire. While the fireplace is cool, open the damper (seal at the top of the fireplace) and inspect the flue (opening connecting the fireplace to the chimney). The flue should be open and clear of obstructions. Examine the hearth to make sure no bricks are damaged or missing, and that the firebox—the interior of the fireplace—is not cracked or damaged.If you’re more comfortable letting professionals inspect your fireplace and chimney, call a local chimney sweep. They will inspect both inside and outside of your house, and inform you if any cleaning or repairs are needed., The chimney cap is at the very peak of the chimney: a small, plate-sized lid that is attached to the top of your chimney pipe to make sure that no small animals or debris fall down the chimney. If it becomes clogged or broken, smoke will not be able to exit the chimney and could back up into your house. Make sure that the cap is in good condition, and is free from cracks, ash buildup, or birds’ nests.Since you’ll need to climb on top of your roof to do this, make sure to observe safety precautions. Firmly ground your ladder before you begin to ascend.

, Even if the chimney cap is clear, ash can still build up on the inside of the chimney pipe itself. This presents a risk, as excess buildup can catch on fire and lead to a dangerous and chimney fire. If your chimney has excess internal ash buildup, during summer months, smoky-smelling air can be drawn through the chimney into the house.To clean a chimney, you’ll need a specific set of pipes and brushes that you should be able to purchase at your local hardware store.
If you prefer not to clean your own chimney, a local cleaning or maintenance service should be able to do the job for you.
Also inspect the chimney flashing (the seal between the chimney and roof). This should be tight and not show any signs of damage or wear., Even if your fireplace seems to be in good shape and has been inspected regularly, you need to be aware of fireplace warning signs. You may smell smoke in the room while a fire is burning, notice damaged wallpaper on the wall by the fireplace (or “hot spots,” where the wall adjacent to the chimney is intensely hot in certain places), or begin to notice rust around the damper or firebox. If you see any of these signs, call a chimney sweep or local fireplace-inspection service before lighting your next fire.You may experience downdrafts when using your fireplace. A downdraft is caused by air rushing down your chimney and pushing smoke and ash out from the fireplace into your home. Your chimney cap should prevent downdrafts, but if they occur frequently, inspect the chimney cap and make sure there are no branches overhanging the top of the chimney, as these can interfere with proper airflow."
"
Keep a fire extinguisher near the fireplace.,
Install smoke and carbon-monoxide detectors.,
Keep the area clear.",How to Use a Fireplace Safely3," This will be your first line of defense if a burning log falls out of the fireplace, or a piece of furniture catches fire.Familiarize yourself with how the fire extinguisher works when you purchase it. Also check the expiration date; if your fire extinguisher has expired, purchase a new one at your local hardware store immediately.


To extinguish a fire without using a fire extinguisher (say, if you need to leave the house or want to go to bed), you can “collapse” the fire on itself—push the logs down to remove the airflow under the blaze, which will smother the fire.
This is not an immediate process and it may still take about 30 minutes for the fire to be reduced to coals, which you can then shovel extinguished ashes on top of to put out.

, In case of fire, always have a smoke alarm in each room of your house. Make sure that the detectors work by checking them once a month, and change the batteries annually.Also install carbon-monoxide detectors in your home. You may not need a carbon monoxide detector on every room, but you house should have one on every level or floor.


If you have children, make sure they realize that these alarms are important devices and not to be tampered or played with.

, In order to reduce the risk of a house fire, keep the area within 5 feet (1.5 m) of your fireplace clear, otherwise you’ll risk these items catching on fire. Don’t set any furniture, animal beds, or pillows in this area. If you have a rug near the fireplace, make sure that it’s nonflammable. If you store firewood and kindling inside your house, make sure that these flammable supplies are set back from the fireplace. It would cause immediate danger if a burning spark were to ignite your entire firewood supply indoors.

Know what you can to do to change your score.",How to Understand a Beacon Score," You can order your credit report and score directly from Equifax's website for $15.95.This score will be Equifax's score based on their proprietary scoring model. Equifax also offers a complete score report that contains scores from all three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian).Be sure that you know which score you are paying for. There is also a more generalized FICO score available from Equifax that doesn't used their proprietary scoring model. It is available for $19.95.;
, The Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) created the basis for credit reporting algorithms.Through their website, you can order your Equifax score as a part of a combined credit report that compares your Equifax score with your TransUnion and Experian scores. This ""FICO Score 3B Report"" is available instantly online and costs $59.85.This is only a good option if you want to compare your Equifax credit score with your scores from the other credit agencies. Otherwise, you are just paying more for features you will not need.

, Recently, some credit card issuers have begun offering credit scores for free to cardholders. Be aware that these credit reports may not always include your Equifax score, and may simply report a FICO score or the specific score of another credit reporting agency. Currently, this service is offered by many issuers, including American Express, Bank of America, and Barclays US, among others., Equifax issues a credit score based on a range from 280 to 850.The lower the score, the lower your creditworthiness. While it is hard to definitely say what a ""good"" credit score is, most credit scores fall in the 600's and 700's. A score above 780 will put you in the top 20% of borrowers, whereas a score below 619 will put you in the bottom 20%.The complete score breakdown by percentage of the general population is as follows:

20% are above 780
20% are in the range of 745-780
20% are in the range of 690-745
20% are in the range of 620-690
20% are below 619



, Many different factors go into determining your credit score, and each have a different weight in the algorithm. For example, almost two-thirds of your score is determined by your payment history and amounts owed. These weights differ by the credit rating algorithm used and may result in slightly different credit scores between agencies.Payment history accounts for about 35% of your score and includes things like proportion of bills paid on time, proportion of bills paid in full, and any public record items (bankruptcies, delinquencies, court judgement, etc.).
Amounts owed accounts for about 30% of your score and includes the amount owed on various accounts in total and versus the original loan amount or available credit limit.
Smaller determining factors include the length of your credit history (about 5-7%), the amount of new credit you have or have applied for (about 10-12%), and the types of credit you use (about %15)., Equifax doesn't include any personal details unrelated to credit when calculating your score. These excluded factors include:


Personal details like your race, age, color, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status
Employment details like your salary, occupation, title, employer, date employed, or employment history
Where you live
Certain types of inquiries such as promotional, account review, insurance, employment-related inquiries, or inquiries when you request your own credit report
Any information not found in your credit file
Any information not proven to be predictive of future credit performance, Certain factors may be seriously lowering your credit score. These range from more obvious factors like high amount of delinquency on accounts or owing too high a proportion of credit limits to less obvious reasons like having opened too many new lines of credit recently or simply having too many active credit cards., Equifax offers a service called Score Simulator that allows you see what effect your future actions may have on your credit score. It also offers a suggested best action to improve your credit score. Note, however, that this service is only available to Equifax members who pay a monthly fee."

Estimate the impact of the exchange rate.,
Learn about the fees.,
Calculate your final cost and the total funds delivered.",How to Transfer Money Fast Overseas2," The exchange rate is the amount of foreign currency you are able to purchase with each U.S. dollar. For example, for every U.S. dollar, you may be able to purchase 0.89 euros, 17.31 Mexican pesos or 6.47 Chinese yuan. Currency exchange rates vary by country and are constantly changing. Money transfer services are required to communicate with you about the exchange rate you are getting. Different services may use different exchange rates, so shop around for the best rate.

The fees will cost anywhere from $8 to $24, depending on whether the money is sent immediately, overnight or within a few days. Your out of pocket expense will be $200 plus the fee.
The amount your recipient gets depends on the exchange rate. Suppose the exchange rate of dollars to Mexican pesos is 17.33. Multiply this by $200 to determine how much the recipient will receive in pesos. So, $200 * 17.33 = 3,466. The recipient receives 3,466 pesos.

Find out whether you can use a notarized power of attorney to give you full rights over the check if the other individual is not available to endorse the check.",How to Cash a Check Made Out to Two People," This determines how the check can be endorsed and cashed.


Checks with names separated by “or,” “and/or,” a comma, or nothing at all can be endorsed and cashed by either individual.
Checks with names separated by “and” must be endorsed and cashed by both individuals.;
, Each bank has its own rules in place regarding checks written out to two people.


Cash the check as you normally would if the check can be endorsed and cashed by either individual. For example, if the check is made out to “Jane Doe or John Smith,” either Jane or John can cash the check without the other individual’s signature.

, Your bank will inform you of its rules and policies for cashing checks written out to two people. For instance, Bank of America requires both payees to share a bank account, while Wells Fargo and Chase require both payees to visit a branch in person to present government-issued identification., In most cases, checks with “and” between names on the “Payable To” line must be endorsed by both individuals, and cashed in person by both people at the bank., This is the best way to handle the situation if one of the payees cannot endorse the back of the check. Alternately, request that the payer write two separate checks to each individual.

, This can result in your funds being withheld or made unavailable by your bank as a result of violating rules and policies.

, Some banks allow you to deposit the check as long as both signatures are present.

, This can be used to your advantage if the other party cannot sign the check or visit the bank in person to cash it with you."

Home address
Phone number
Driver's license number
Check with the bank the cheque will be drawn on to confirm that the person writing the check has an account with funds available to cover the check. Many banks will verify the account the cheque is drawing from if you contact them.;
, It is very important for your name to be written correctly on the cheque. Banks can deny payment if the name does not match that of the person attempting to cash it.If you own a small business, different rules may apply. Many banks will not cash a cheque made out to your small business. They will deposit it to the business’s bank account instead.
If the check is made out to more than one person, all payees (the person or persons being paid) must sign the cheque.

, All of the information on the cheque needs to be complete and accurate. This includes the date, amount of payment, and signature. If the information is invalid or missing, your bank will refuse payment on the cheque.


Check the date. It is important that the date is accurate. The date written on the cheque is the first date at which the funds may be withdrawn. Also, many banking institutions have the right (but not the obligation) to deny payment after a period of six months has passed.Check the numerical amount and written amount.The numerical amount box is located below the date. It represents the exact amount to be paid to the payee. You must make certain that this is the correct amount you are owed and that it matches the written dollar amount located to the left of the box.If the written and numerical amounts are different, most banks will honor the written amount.Check the signature. For the cheque to be valid, it must contain the signature of the owner of the account from which the funds will be withdrawn. It is imperative that it is signed or the cheque will not be honored., On the reverse side of the cheque, there will usually be a line for a signature that says something like “Endorse here.” You must sign on this line before you can cash your cheque.Remember that if there is more than one payee -- e.g., “Pay to the order of Jackson and Leanna Teller” -- all payees must endorse the cheque.A check can be deposited into a joint account with only one of the joint owners signing the check.
Once the check is endorsed, unless there are written restrictions, the check becomes a ""bearer"" instrument so that anyone can cash it.

, When you cash a cheque in person, you will be required to show a valid photo I.D. Driver’s licenses and passports are usually the best choices. In some cases, military or school I.D.s may be accepted.


You may not be required to show a photo I.D. if you cash the cheque at an ATM or via your smartphone.

, Any teller can take the cheque and give you cash. Many banks will cash cheques without charging a fee if you are an account holder with them.


Some banks may require you to deposit the cheque to your account rather than cash it. This is particularly likely if the cheque you are trying to cash is written on an account from another bank.If the bank on which the cheque is drawn refuses to pay your bank -- in other words, the cheque “bounces” -- your bank will reimburse itself from your bank account. Banks will also usually charge a fee for the trouble of dealing with a returned cheque.

, The traditional way of cashing a cheque is to stand in line and wait for a bank teller to assist you. Make sure you have a valid form of photo identification with you.


Many banks prefer that you have your bank debit card with you as well. If you do not have your debit card, you may be required to fill in additional forms to cash your cheque.

, At many larger banks, you can cash a cheque at their ATMs (Automatic Teller Machines). The funds are usually available immediately.

Be aware that if the account the cheque is written on does not have sufficient funds to cover the cheque, the bank is not required to cash it.Some states in the U.S. have laws that require banks to cash cheques drawn on their accounts without charging a fee. You can find out online if you live in a state where this applies., Some grocery stores and a number of large retailers will cash certain kinds of cheques that they believe are reliable. For instance, they will cash payroll cheques or government cheques but not personal cheques (cheques written by individuals drawn from their personal accounts). Merchants often charge small fees for cashing a cheque for you.For example, many 7-Eleven convenience stores will cash cheques for a small fee (which varies by location).As another example, Walmart will cash cheques of up to $5,000USD, for which they will charge a fee of $6. They will only cash payroll, government, and tax cheques., Many financial institutions now offer prepaid cards to people without bank accounts. If you have a prepaid card, you will usually be able to deposit cheques at select ATMs. You may be charged a fee to deposit and withdraw funds, depending on the card.For example, Visa has a reloadable “Payroll Card” that you can get through your employer. You can deposit cheques and withdraw money at any ATM that accepts Visa debit cards.Many large banks also offer prepaid debit cards. Chase offers a prepaid card that allows you to deposit a cheque at any Chase ATM. The card has a monthly fee of $4.95.Prepaid cards are usually available through large financial institutions such as MasterCard and American Express.

, There are many cheque-cashing stores and services that will cash cheques for a percentage of the amount. These should usually be reserved as a last resort, as their fees tend to be quite high.The advantage of cheque-cashing services is that they will usually cash personal cheques. Most retailers will not. However, these services may charge a hefty fee to cash your cheque, so it’s best to try your other options first.If you do not have a bank account and need cash immediately from a personal cheque, cheque-cashing services may be your only option.

, If you do not have a bank account and have someone you absolutely trust, you can make over the cheque to them. They can then cash the cheque with their bank and give you the money.


To endorse the cheque to another person, write “Pay to the order of _______” on the reverse side of the cheque. Sign your name. In some cases, you may also be required to initial near the written and numerical amounts of the cheque.

Never ask someone you do not know intimately to cash a cheque for you. Never cash a cheque for someone you do not know and trust extremely well.

Expect some stress.,
Expect delays.,
Prepare for unexpected obstacles.,
Plan to go over budget.,
Be prepared to disagree.",How to Set Your Expectations for Building Your New Home," It is common for first time home builders to think that they are about to set out on an exciting and fun journey of making decisions and picking out material selections, when the reality number one is that this can be a very stressful undertaking and even more so if you have not spent an adequate amount of time in the planning process. Remember, planning is king.;
, Contractors will not be on your project every single day. Once you have thoroughly planned your new home project you will be talking with contractors and collecting bids. Most follow through well but your contractors will be juggling your project in the mix of many others that they are working on, and scheduling is extremely difficult for these guys so they usually have honest intentions but are forced to work to a stopping point on project B to get to your project A. So expect there to be some delays along the way. Many of these delays can be addressed by setting your expectations with your sub-contractors. Let these guys know your weekly project schedule, give them start and finish dates and let them know up front that you expect them to stay with in their work dates so the other contractors can get in and out as well. Don't expect this to be automatic. Let these guys know up front that you expect to run a tight ship.

, Remember that 95% of the home building process is completed by humans. They misunderstand, they make miscalculations, they miscommunicate, they assume. All these things result in the same, a mistake. Be prepared to work through some typical human error and remember that good planning can iron out most of these encounters but even with the best house plans money can buy, people still make mistakes.

, No one wants to spend more money than they have to so spend as much time as you can in the design process and planning process to nail down your budgeting process. The better you know what you want and need in your house plans up front, the closer your budget will be during construction. However, it is typical to get your project up and running and walk through your freshly framed house, and then begin to see things that you would like to add, delete, and move. Change orders are always very costly so you will be better prepared for this if you already have additional funds built into your construction loan for such changes. And whatever money that you didn't need for your project you simply don't take out and it won't go into your permanent financing.

, This is a very unpleasant part of the construction process but there are so many people involved in the process and it is such a huge undertaking it almost inevitable. Someone is going misunderstand something, and that will always come down to, ""who is paying for this misunderstanding""? These misunderstandings are costly, they usually wind up slowing or even stopping a particular phase of your home construction and sometimes bring the entire project to a stand still. That is why it is so important to have everything in writing, on your house plans, on your contractor agreements and in all change orders. This will reduce the amount of he said, she said and help you move past these mishaps and keep your project moving.

Be sure the wick fits snugly in the burner sleeve.,
Trim the top of the wick with sharp, heavy scissors so it is even with the top of the burner sleeve.,
Fill the lamp font to no more than seven eighths capacity or up to a side filler.,
Put the burner with wick in the lamp and allow the wick to soak for ten minutes, preferably more.

,
Turn the wick down so that it is just proud of the burner sleeve.

,
Be sure the chimney or flue is clean and dry.,
Light the wick.,
Turn the wick down again if the lamp begins to smoke as it warms.,
Extinguish by turning the wick down and placing a hand just behind the top of a chimney, angled down.,
Wipe out or wash the chimney after each use and refill the lamp.,
Pour out the fuel and remove the wick from the burner, if you do not expect to use the lamp for a good while.",How to Use and Maintain Kerosene Lamps," Too tight and the wick may not draw enough fuel, too loose and the flame may flicker or even burn down the wick.;
, Snip off loose threads and cut off the corners of flat wicks evenly.

, Use clean kerosene and wipe up spillage.

,,, Wet chimneys will shatter.

, Place the chimney into the burner and turn up the wick until the flame just smokes. Now turn down the wick until the smoke stops.

, This is normal, particularly with tubular wick lamps. This gives the maximum light available.

, Blow across the top of the chimney. Look to ensure the flame is out.

Research the land you intend to build your home on.Talk to your local Land Records or County Surveyor in order to find out more about the land you want to build on.,
Invest in problematic lots cautiously.,
Split the cost of a large lot with someone else.If you find the perfect piece of land to build your house on, but the official lot is slightly too big for you, you could try to convince a friend or family member or someone else to be your neighbor.",How to Save Money when Building a House1," Ensure the land is free of liens and other financial encumbrances. Choose a reputable Realtor or land developer who can help you find out more about the land you’re interested in and find a parcel that meets your specifications.


Try checking out county websites to find out the value of the land. This can be very useful when you are considering your options.
Look into zoning laws and flood zones.;
, Some people encourage investment in “problem lots” such as hills or lots located on in-fill. Because these lots are undesirable and have likely never been developed before, they generally go for a lower price than a lot that is in close proximity with infrastructure and other homes. Talk to your Realtor about purchasing a problematic lot in your area.


While they might be cheaper to obtain, these lots can cost you more in development costs later. For instance, if you have a rocky piece of land, you’ll need to blast or clear away the rock in order to set a foundation. If the land has a lot of trees on it, you’ll need to clear them, too. If the land is too far from local infrastructure, you might need to pay a lot to connect your home to sewer, gas, and electrical lines.

, This way, you’ll be able to save money by buying a larger lot and splitting it in half (or partitioning it into fractions that you both find agreeable), then having your friend or family member pay you for the portion of land that they opted to live on.


Make sure that you read through the home owners association CC&Rs and the local zoning laws regarding subdividing. There may be a minimum size or a rule against subdividing. Look into whether or not this is an option for you. You may also want to request that a contingency that addresses your intention be included along with the offer.
Also, make sure that you look into what you can legally build on the property. Sometimes you will not be allowed to build certain structures or keep certain types of vehicles on the property, such as boats and RVs.

Choose a stock plan.If you choose a stock plan -- a home that is laid out according to frequently-used blueprints -- the contractor will know exactly how long it takes to build, what materials are needed, and what the dimensions are.,
Build vertically, not horizontally.,
Choose a low-cost look.,
Build a smaller house.Think carefully about your needs when building your house.,
Build a house on par with those around it.If you build a McMansion – a large, gaudy home based on a stock model -- in a working-class neighborhood, you’ll end up taking a financial hit when you decide to sell.",How to Save Money when Building a House2," If you choose to have a custom home built, the contractor will be building a home with dimensions and specifications that they have never tried before. It is possible, in such an instance, that the actual costs will exceed the original estimate.


Stock plans are customizable, too, within certain limits. Talk to your contractor or construction company about special modifications you might be able to incorporate into your stock plan home.

, If you have a 3,000 square foot house spread across a single story, you’ll have a larger roof and a wider foundation than if you chose to build a house with two 1,500 square foot stories. Multistory houses have lower roofing and foundation costs than houses of similar square footage that is spread out over a large, single lot.


However, keep the height of your home less than 32 feet.Building your home taller than 32 feet -- excluding the basement -- can put pressure on the limits of your home’s architecture, and will require special roof trusses. If you want a larger home, build it wider, not taller.
Keep in mind that in some cases, building up may be your only option.

, If you adopt a rustic aesthetic for your home, you’ll be able to leave walls of simple wood unfinished, and could even leave roof beams exposed. A modern, industrial look could also work to keep your costs low if you, for instance, chose bare concrete floors. Both styles would save on construction and materials costs.Avoid investing in high-end finishes, expensive millwork, and fancy decorative components.
Reject landscaping requests. Just before completion, the builder may offer to do the landscaping for you. They will usually charge far more than it would cost for you to do it yourself.
Keep in mind that you should negotiate any extras with the builder when you are developing the contract. For example, if you want to have landscaping done at the same time the house is built, then you would need to include this in the contract. In some cases, the builder may be willing to landscape the yard at no charge.

, If you build a massive house but only spend time in two or three rooms, you’ve wasted a lot of square footage and money.


Meet your needs, but don’t add space that you might not use.
Visit a display home to get an idea of the house you want and what you can afford.

, House prices are determined primarily by the prices of other nearby homes, not by the amount of money you put into it during construction. Look at the other homes in your area and ask your Realtor what they’re worth. Don’t spend more than the average cost of a house in your neighborhood.


A Realtor may be able to provide you with much more information than you can find on your own, such as the average cost of homes in the neighborhood per square foot, the average selling price, and how many days homes in the area have been on the market.

Buy low-maintenance materials.,
Use reclaimed and secondhand materials.Selecting functioning but discarded materials and appliances can save you money when building your home.,
Shop around when purchasing materials.,
Identify which types of upgrades are likely to give you the most value in return.,
Don’t waste materials.Building materials usually come in standard sizes.",How to Save Money when Building a House3," Metal roofing and vinyl siding, for instance, don’t require repainting or replacing. Though they will bring up the initial investment in building your home, they’ll save you money over the long term.Make sure to consider the climate when purchasing your building materials. Some materials may not hold up well in all regions. For example, vinyl siding may crack and deteriorate in a desert climate.
Consider the CC & Rs of your home owners association as well to see if there are restrictions on the types of materials that you may use.

, Bricks, cinder blocks, paint, and a variety of appliances are available at a discount if you know where to look. Check your local newspaper for demolition sales, and search online for home supply stores that are having sales on returns, reconditioned items, or floor models. Online marketplaces like Craigslist also offer many secondhand or surplus housing materials for next to nothing.


Not only is reusing materials economical, it also prevents waste from accumulating in the junkyard.
Keep in mind that you may also be able to negotiate with the builder to have things like appliances included.

, Both building materials (such as nails, boards, and concrete) and finish materials (like flooring, cabinets, and doors) can be obtained at cheaper rates when you compare prices at several different home supply stores.Additionally, look for more economical alternatives to the materials you’ve selected. For instance, marble floors will be more expensive than hardwood floors. Choose materials that are inexpensive to save money.


Many builders will donate materials that they cannot use to Habitat for Humanity. Check to see if there is a Habitat for Humanity store near you where you can purchase discount materials.

, Some upgrades will help you save money, while others merely look nice.For instance, investing in quality insulation is a material choice that can increase your home’s value and keep your energy costs low. A really expensive kitchen cabinet, on the other hand, will only beautify your home, but add little in real value.

, For instance, drywall is available in 4’ by 8‘ sheets. If you want to put up drywall on wall that measures 8’2’’ by 4’3’’, you’ll end up with lots of wasted building material in the end, plus added costs due to the time that cutting and measuring the materials require. Set the dimensions of your home to correspond to standard building material lengths and measures.

"
"
Solicit multiple bids.After selecting your specifications, don’t submit them to just one construction company.,
Do it yourself.,
Work for your construction company.,
Think about how your design will impact the home’s cost.,
Insist on sticking to the budget.",How to Save Money when Building a House4," Research several local contractors and determine if their estimates are usually accurate or if they finish projects with overages. Ask the companies you’re thinking of working with for references and check for reviews of their services online. Send your design specifications to reputable contractors and choose the one that sends you back the lowest estimate.


Look into each contractor’s availability as well. They may be scheduling their work as much as six months out.
Be sure to choose a company with a reputation for finishing their work within the allotted time. Only a certified general contractor should build your home.Make sure to ask to see the contractor’s certificate of liability insurance and also verify with their insurance company that they are insured. You can also request that the insurance company include you as a certificate holder. This will ensure that you will be notified if there is a lapse in policy.

, If you have the know-how and the time, you can save a lot of money by building your home yourself. Act as your own general contractor and you could save five to ten percent on the costs of building your home., Many contractors have barter systems in place where people can work on the house they’re having built in exchange for a slightly reduced rate. If you feel comfortable swinging a hammer, painting the exterior or interior, or doing some basic landscaping, you could propose the idea to your construction company. You might ask, for instance, “Would it be possible for me to contribute to the home-building process in exchange for a reduced contract cost?”


You don’t need to build the whole house yourself. You could choose to just take on particular tasks you know you can handle, such as the painting or lighting installation.Don’t take on tasks you don’t feel adequate to tackle.

, Plan ahead by talking with your developer or construction contractor about alternatives that still satisfy your needs and priorities, but don’t make as big a dent in your pocketbook.For instance, grouping your appliances in a central location will make it easier for the developer to install the right wiring and connections for the home.


Look into your options for energy sources. For example, you might want to look into alternative energy sources and consider how much these sources of energy might cost or save you over time.

, When you change the work order, you’ll add both time and money to the home-building process as the new materials are obtained. Once you’ve developed a plan to build your house and received an estimate, you should stick to it.In addition, carefully monitor the progress of the home’s construction. The contractor may realize that the costs will exceed the estimate in some necessary, unavoidable way.

Choose energy-efficient appliances.,
Orient your house in an an energy-efficient way.Build your house in such a way that large windows covered slightly by a small overhang face the south.,
Choose a shorter mortgage period.If you choose to finance your home with, say, a 15 –year mortgage instead of a 30-year mortgage, you’ll build equity faster.,
Make advance payments.",How to Save Money when Building a House5," When you’re shopping for the right washing machine, dryer, oven, and fridge, look for appliances with the Energy Star logo. This indicates that the appliances have been certified as energy-efficient by the Department of Energy and Department of Environmental Protection. Energy Star appliances can make a home 15%-30% more efficient than a home that does not employ Energy Star certified appliances.This savings can save you on electrical and gas bills over the course of the home’s life.

, This way, the sun’s heat will naturally warm the home during the winter, and the house will stay cool during the summer when the sun sits higher in the sky.

, Plus, your interest will accrue for a longer period.


Equity is the value you get when you subtract what you still owe on the mortgage from its market value. On a long mortgage period, the amount you owe will remain higher for longer, thus reducing your equity.

, Instead of paying the minimum monthly payment on your house, pay ahead on the mortgage to save money over the long term. If you’re paying ahead on your mortgage, you’ll end up with a lower amount of total interest and build equity faster. There are several ways to pay ahead:Add an extra dollar amount with each payment. For instance, if your minimum payment is $500 each month, pay $600 dollars each month instead.
Make thirteen, rather than twelve, payments each year. For example, make two payments each January.
Use extra income – a bonus or inheritance – to pay forward on your mortgage. Make sure that you can put down 20% as a down payment. Otherwise, you will have to pay for mortgage insurance.

This project will quickly grow if you let it. Look at the money in your wallet/bank account and bid it. If you have a spouse, make sure you both have the same dreams. It's a lot easier to understand the sacrifices you're both making for something you both want than for one partner to make sacrifices for the other's enjoyment. And there will be sacrifices.;
, Go to the library and look at magazines appropriate to your needs. If you need another bathroom, stay away from bedroom magazines. Stay away from color and textures. If you can make do with an improvement or conversion of an existing room, do so.

, Unless you are competent at drawing, use graph paper and measure the room you're building/converting. This is to help you better express yourself. The people selling services and supplies can understand a 2-dimensional bathtub in a 5 foot (1.5 m) wide room better than your description.

, Ask for an estimate on each of the parts. If you can do drywall, then you can save money. Don't do roofing unless you already have the skill and tools required, at least. Don't do electricity unless you really can. High school science doesn't count. Look at the cost estimate and reconsider.

, For one room, it may not be worth it. But it won't be very expensive, either. Your city planning office will appreciate the architect's drawing. Part of the value of your architect is that he'll prompt your thinking about the project and offer ideas and suggestions you may not have thought of. A good architect offers a unique, critical and connected view of your project. Talk to your spouse about what the architect thinks and asks you. Also ask the architect for their thoughts on contractors, but know that the responsibility for the contract with the builder will be yours as the homeowner. Ask the architect what permits you will need and ask if s/he can assist you with getting them.

, Even if you are doing the work yourself, there are cost overruns.

, The loan officer may also be able to help with this.

, If you are in the City, there is a city building permit; County, county.

, Request a written itemized estimate for the cost of work, including labor and materials. Note that you may not wish to go with the low bidder, keeping in mind that price is not necessarily quality. Reputations are very important; that's why you were talking to so many people about contractors.

, If portions of the work seem easy, or within your skill range, you may wish to complete them yourself. It's also a wonderful feeling to know that you completed portions of the remodeling, assuming it is completed satisfactorily. Most people that are at all handy can hang sheetrock/dry wall (that white stuff that comes in 8x4 panels.

, Or at least completing the roof before the rains begin. You will have to accept the responsibility of guessing the day for beginning rains. No reasonable contractor, except in Arizona, will promise to complete the work before it rains, but he should be able to finish before October 15, for example. For example, you may specify that the roofing will be complete by October 15th or deduct $5,000 from the cost. You won't get it free.

, Schedule weekly visits with the contractor or foreman to discuss progress. You don't want to get in the way of the work, but you don't want something to progress too far before it gets fixed. This is where that 10% extra begins to disappear.

, You may wish additional electrical sockets, lights, sinks than was described in the plans. For most of us, the physical manifestation of walls is easier to understand than blueprints. Also, if something doesn't seem right, for example a bathroom vent has no outlet, tell the contractor within a day of noticing it. The more the work progresses, the more it will bury those little problems. The more the little problems are buried, the more expensive to fix.

, While you may have the money, the contractor has your home and you hostage. The best is that you both wind up happy with the outcome.

Get bids from 3 reputable contractors, and select the least expensive.,
Buy your own materials rather than having the contractor bring them in.,

Consider doing some of the labor yourself and reduce home-improvement costs.,
Pay for home-improvement projects with cash rather than using a credit card that will incur interest.,
Opt for cosmetic changes rather than more extensive updates and save on home-improvement.",How to Save Money on a Home Improvement Project," Just make sure that the contractors you choose were referred to you. You need someone you can trust who can get the work done at the quote he initially gave you.;
, This way you can shop around and get home-improvement savings. Just have the contractor write down exactly what is needed, and then you can go online and research pricing of materials before buying them. This way you only have to pay the contractor for the labor and he can't add a percentage to material costs.

, For instance, if you are looking to update your countertops, then consider purchasing remnants from a stone manufacturer and see what they have for leftovers. You can save a lot of money by purchasing left over material that manufacturers have a difficult time selling, although your selection will be limited. You can do the same with other materials such as wood flooring, lumber, carpeting and fabric.

, Even if you don't have any do-it-yourself experience, you can still pick some jobs to do yourself, such as removing fixtures in a bathroom or kitchen, or preparing rooms before contractors come in. If there is any way that you can do some of the labor so that you can pay less in that department, then do it. There are so many resources online that can show you how to do certain things, like tiling, carpeting and laying down laminate flooring; you just need to take the time to learn.

, If you save up for a project, you will pay less for it. If you need to get the job done immediately and you cannot wait until you save the cash, then take advantage of a 0 interest deal. Purchase the materials with a 0 percent interest credit card and then save up the cash so that you have it ready to pay the balance off before the interest kicks in. Make sure that you can save the amount by then, however, or you will be stuck with a credit card bill with a high interest rate. If you cannot save the amount, and the improvement project is not needed, then wait and start a home-improvement fund.

, For example, rather than purchasing new kitchen cabinets, consider refinishing your current cabinets if they are still in good shape, and updating them with new hardware. This gives your kitchen a whole new look without having to replace the cabinets.

Nail down an actual start and end date from your contractor.,
Select the right hotel.,
Pack sensibly for your stay away from home.,
Stick to your regular schedule.,
Take a vacation.",How to Survive Staying in a Hotel While Your Home Is Being Renovated," One of the most important ways to survive hotel living is to know when your family “togetherness” will end. Typically contractors may give you an end date, but will most likely be extended beyond that specific day.


Add at least one week onto the contractor’s end date. For your mental health, if your contractor tells you the job will only last one week, get it into your mind that you will out of the house for two.
Request a detailed written plan that lets you know what work should be done on which days. If you are having your kitchen gutted, knowing that day six is counter top day will let you know whether the team is on schedule or running behind when you check on the house.
Collect all contact numbers and information from the contractor. The contractor will be your best resource to getting back into the house. Having easy access to the company and the lead contractor will allow you to stay on top of the timeline.;
, Although you may be inclined to want to save money and stay in a cheap motel (most likely because the renovation is costing an arm and a leg), consider reserving a (or several) rooms at a nicer hotel. You don't need to check into the Ritz Carlton but keep in mind you will be staying there for more than one evening and your comfort will wane as the days/weeks plod on.


Consider booking a suite or a room with multiple rooms and a kitchen. The more like home you can make your new surroundings, the better. Numerous hotels have cropped up across the world aimed at busy executives or families on the go that contain a kitchen, numerous rooms and even an in-room washer and dryer.
Investigate renting a condo or a home. If you think you will be out of your home for more than a month, signing a short-term lease on a home or condo may be the best option. Not only will you be able to spread out more, you may end up saving money in the long run.

, While you may be used to packing “vacation” wear for hotel stays, keep in mind that you aren’t on vacation and will need the same items at the hotel as you do at home.


Avoid over packing, especially if you plan to stay close to home. Instead of bringing everything from formal evening attire to your swimsuit, keep in mind that you can run back and forth and grab items as you need them. Instead, pack for three to four days and then go home an repack. Also, if the weather or your mood changes, you can grab clothing as you need it and not end up with piles and piles of clothing all over the hotel room--too much clutter will send anyone to the funny farm.
Bring creature comforts to the hotel room. Especially for kids, bring favorite toys or stuffed animals to keep everyone comfortable and feeling as if they are at home. If you have a favorite book or if you knit, bring your hobby or reading materials along for long family evenings of togetherness.
If you book accommodations with a kitchen check to see if the kitchen comes equipped with everything you need. For example if you are a coffee drinker, make sure the kitchen comes with a coffee maker. If not, you may want to bring one from home.

, If everyone goes to work and school during the day, don’t slack off because you are staying at a hotel.


Create a morning routine chart. You may be living with only one bathroom so before the kids start fighting about who gets to take the first shower, establish ground rules such as a shower order (including specific times) and the amount of time allotted per shower.
Determine how long it will take you to get to your destination each morning. Most likely you know how long it will take to drive the kids to school from your home, but may be unfamiliar with traffic patterns and the amount of time from the hotel. Try a dry run and then pad travel time by 10 to 30 minutes depending on how far you are from your destination--who knows, maybe you are closer traveling from the hotel.
Establish a specific space for each family member. Since everyone will most likely not have their own room, allot a certain space within your accommodations to allow each family member to keep possessions and/or chill out.
Create a new routine. If you stay at home with the kids and typically spend time cleaning, decorating or gardening, consider creating a new routine so you don’t go stir crazy. Make lunch plans with friends, go to a movie, volunteer at your child’s school, schedule doctor appointments you put off, visit your home to check on the renovation or go to the gym. Sitting around the hotel room will make you go nuts so being busy is key.

, While it may not be financially feasible, taking a vacation from your hotel room can give you a new perspective. A quick getaway from your environment can mix up the monotony of being stuck in a hotel room, even though you will most likely be going from a hotel room to another.


Plan renovations around vacation. Kids on spring break? Schedule your renovation during your spring break vacation so you only have to spend a short amount of time in the hotel near home.
Consider breaking up the gang for a few days. Send the kids to the grandparents’ house or to stay with friends while you and your honey go on a weekend getaway.

Know what you're getting into before you buy.,

Decide how much you are willing to do yourself and what will need the help of a contractor.,
Plan your budget.,
Decide where you will live while you renovate.,
Plan your approach.,
Do a little at a time.,
Do a major project all at once.",How to Renovate a Home," Take a good look at the house and read any inspection reports you receive as part of the sale. Find out whether problems with the house are structural or cosmetic. Will you need to move or repair walls, or just paint them? Are the plumbing and electrical systems modern and in good condition?


If this is a home where you have been for some time, you may want to hire a home inspector to help look for major problems before you undertake to renovate. It could keep you from having to do a job twice.;
, Tour your house with a clipboard or notebook and list all the changes you would like to make. Keep all your contacts, ideas, minutes of your meetings and copies of architectural drawings and prices filed together. Always ask for copies of anything, even work schedules, and keep it filed. Even if you don't read all these, it will keep everyone you deal with on their toes.


Make a pencil sketch of your ideas. It need not be architectural quality or to scale. It can also be what you have saved from the internet or collected from magazines. This is for your bases of discussion with your architect and contractor, if you have them.

, You'll probably choose to do some of each. There is generally no need to hire a contractor to install a towel rod, but you may prefer not to install your own shingles on a steep, second-story roof.

, It is likely that buying the house and necessary things to go in it will leave you low on cash for some time after you buy.

, Will you be able to live in the house, or part of it, while you renovate, or will you need to live elsewhere? Could you camp in the living room while the bedroom still smells of fresh paint and carpet?

, While some parts of home remodeling and home renovation can happen at any time, some activities depend on other activities to happen first.


Identify and address anything that's urgent. Look for immediate safety hazards, such as a broken window. Also look for problems that will cause further damage if not addressed, such as a leaky roof.
Know what depends on other projects.
Tackle major repairs first. It doesn't make a lot of sense to paint a wall you plan to tear down.
Or, start with small projects. If you're planning to do a lot of work yourself and just getting started with home repairs, smaller projects can give you experience and confidence. Small projects can also help you accomplish larger ones or make a space usable until you can do something more involved. Smaller or interim repairs may even be all you can afford at first.
Try to do related projects together. For example, if you have removed carpeting or other flooring, take the opportunity to repair squeaks, water damage, and any other flaws or damage to the sub-floor.

, For long projects that encompass the entire house, such as painting or replacing all the doors (or all the doorknobs), see if it makes sense to go one room or area at a time. This approach will also help you to spread your expenses over time.

, If you are without the use of your only bathroom during a remodel, or if you simply want something out of the way, you may wish to undertake a larger project all at once.

Place the lamp in a dry area.,
Reduce the humidity in your home.,
Put the lamp away when using appliances that create steam.,
Dry the lamp often.",How to Stop a Salt Crystal Lamp from Melting1," Since the lamp is made of salt, it will absorb water and may start melting if it is placed in areas of near sources of water. Keep the lamp in dry places.Don’t place it near showers, bathtubs, dishwashers, or washing machines.;
, Extra humidity in your home may cause the salt lamp to melt. To help with this, you may want to use a dehumidifier in your home to reduce the moisture in the air.This may be especially important if you live in a humid climate.

, Since humidity is the main thing that melts a salt crystal lamp, you may want to put the lamp away into a dry closet or room when using anything that creates steam.For example, you may want to move it somewhere different if you are boiling water on the stove, taking a shower, or washing laundry.

, Make it a habit to wipe down your lamp to remove excess moisture. Use a cloth, towel, or other item that won’t leave lint behind on the lamp.If you don’t want to do this every few days, wait until you notice moisture on the lamp.

"
"
Clean the lamp with a damp cloth.,
Keep the lamp on all the time.,
Place a protective layer underneath your lamp.",How to Stop a Salt Crystal Lamp from Melting2," Though you may be worried about wiping down or cleaning your lamp with any moisture, you can easily do this without melting your lamp. Use a damp cloth or sponge, making sure to squeeze out as much water as possible. Wipe away any dust or other debris. Pat dry.Turn the lamp back on afterwards. The heat will evaporate any moisture.
Don’t submerge the lamp in water. Also don’t use any cleaning products on the lamp.

, If you have problems with your lamp starting to melt, try leaving it on all the time. The heat will help evaporate any moisture collected on the lamp, which can help slow the melting and dripping process.If you don't want to keep it on, place a plastic bag or some other protection over it to reduce the moisture.

, If you cannot get the lamp to stop melting, then place it on top of something to protect your furniture. This may be a coaster, saucer, plastic placemat, or something else that will stop the moisture from ruining your furniture."
"
Use the proper bulb.,
Monitor the bulb.,
Replace the bulb.",How to Stop a Salt Crystal Lamp from Melting3," Salt crystal lamps are supposed to evaporate any water on the surface of the lamp. If it doesn’t evaporate properly, it can start to drip and give the illusion of melting. The bulb should make the lamp warm to touch, but not hot.For lamps 10 pounds or less, a 15-watt bulb should be strong enough. Use a 25-watt bulb for a 10 to 20 pound lamp, and for a lamp more than 20 pounds, use a 40 to 60-watt bulb.

, If your salt crystal lamp melts and drips moisture, check the bulb. If the lamp is melting inside, it may leak into the bulb and cause problems. Notice if the bulb flickers, malfunctions, or gives any other problems., If you are having trouble with moisture on your lamp, replace the bulb. You may not have the correct bulb. Make sure the bulb you are using is a heat-producing bulb. You should be able to buy replacement bulbs that are just like the one that came in your lamp at any home improvement store.If the same thing happens, your lamp may be defective due to damage from the water.

Hire a kid-friendly contractor.,
Erect barriers around the work area if possible.,
Make alternative areas available.,
Explain to your children the importance of staying away from the work area.,
Schedule the work while the children will be out of the home.",How to Protect Children During a Home Renovation," The first step in keeping your children safe during a home renovation is hiring the right contractor. A contractor's style of work can make a big difference in the child safety of a project. For example, make sure your contractor understands that any barriers should be left up during construction, tools should never be left in reach of children, and live electrical work should never be left unattended. Ask your contractor if they have experience working around children, and gauge their comfort level in maintaining a kid-friendly work area.;
, An important aspect of protecting children during a home remodel is keeping them out of the work area. Depending on your home's layout, this will be possible to varying degrees. Plastic drop cloths can be hung across openings to keep dust and debris from spreading and to discourage children from entering the work area. If possible, erect child safety gates across doorways and ask that your contractor step over them.

, If the area being renovated is a room that your kids frequently use, like a kitchen or bathroom, make sure an alternative arrangement is in place. For example, you might set up a compact refrigerator in another room to hold juice and other beverages for your children. If your kids will need to use a guest bathroom while their usual bathroom is being renovated, make sure all of their hygiene products are moved to the new bathroom.

, Older children should be told explicitly to avoid the area being renovated. If you have made alternative arrangements (like setting up a second fridge), make sure you tell the children that you expect them to utilize those arrangements.

, If your children are in school or have other commitments, try to schedule the contractor to perform most of the work during this time. You will still need to keep the kids out of the unfinished area when they are home, but you will not have to worry about your children getting underfoot when your contractor's team is coming and going.

Familiarize yourself with the tasks required by the project.,
Assemble the tools and supplies needed for the project.,
Clean and arrange your workspace before beginning the work.,
Begin the home repair work.",How to Prepare for a Home Improvement Project," The first step in preparing for any home project is to make sure you understand what you will be doing; this will prevent unforeseen messes, setbacks, and trips to the hardware store. This step is of special importance for those attempting a repair for the first time.


The Internet contains a wealth of information regarding home improvement projects. Video hosting sites like YouTube feature many ""how-to"" demonstrations of common home repair tasks. Discussion forums geared towards home improvement can be used to ask specific questions or address concerns as they arise in your project.
One of the most important things you can do when studying a home repair is to make a list of the tools and supplies you will need. This will prevent you from having to stop work midway through a project or trying to improvise when you don't have the right tool.;
, Before beginning work, check that you have everything you will need. This is especially important for tasks that must be completed at a certain speed, such as painting or working with quick set joint compound or mortar.


When assembling your tools, don't forget about personal protective equipment such as safety glasses, a dust mask, and gloves.
When undertaking any project that might require quick and occasional clean-ups, such as painting, it is helpful to keep paper towels and a damp rag handy.

, The final step to take before starting the project is to prepare your workspace. The amount of preparation needed will depend on the type of project.


If your home improvement project will involve any paints, solvents, or other products that produce harmful fumes, make sure your workspace is well-ventilated. Open windows and run a fan to help circulate air.
Finishing projects, like painting or varnishing, will be more successful if your workspace is thoroughly cleaned beforehand. Dust and dirt can easily be stirred up into your workpiece and mar the finish. Dusting, vacuuming, and wiping down any flat surfaces will prevent this problem.
If you have pets or small children, you may want to take steps to make your workspace safer for them. Place potentially harmful tools and products where they cannot be reached easily, and keep doors closed if possible.

, Once you have taken all the preparatory steps, you are ready to begin work. To help prevent messes or damage to your belongings while you work, proceed carefully and vigilantly through the project. If your project will span several days or longer, you may need to repeat some of the above steps each day.

Refinance your mortgage using the ""cash out"" method.,
Obtain a home equity line of credit.,
Obtain a second mortgage on your home.,
Seek a personal loan secured on another asset.,
Pay for the home remodeling with consumer credit.",How to Pay for Home Remodeling," A popular method of funding home improvements is called a cash out refinancing. This means swapping your existing mortgage for a new one, and converting some of your accumulated home equity into cash in the process. This is an especially tactful move if interest rates are low. However, be aware that doing this reduces the amount of equity you have in your home, and thus will extend the amount of time you spend making mortgage payments.;
, Another way of getting cash for home remodeling is by setting up a home equity line of credit. This is an open-ended credit agreement that is secured on the equity in your house. It functions like a credit card in that it has an overall spending limit, and you can carry a balance over from month to month. Using debt secured on your own home equity makes sense for funding remodeling, as remodeling projects often increase your equity anyway.

, A second mortgage, often called a home equity loan, is structured just like your existing mortgage. The key differences are that the term is usually shorter and the interest rate will be higher because the second mortgage is subordinate to your existing mortgage. When pursuing a second mortgage, take on only as much extra debt as is needed to finish the remodeling.

, Loans for home improvement do not have to be secured on your home equity. Lenders are often willing to extend loans secured on other large assets such as cars. These loans will tend to have shorter terms, so you should ensure that you are able to pay the money back in time.

, This is one of the least favorable options for financing home renovations, as interest rates are high and the unrestricted nature of consumer credit can encourage abuse. Aim to use consumer credit only for emergency home repairs, and pay off your balance as quickly as possible. Note that abusing consumer credit can easily damage your credit score and further prevent you from securing home equity loans and lines of credit.

You might try to find neighbors, family members or a local business that might help you decide.;
, The end result would be the drawing of architectural plans that would be needed to proceed with the work. An architect can help with a proposed budget for the work as well. Prepare a detailed contract with the architect so there are no questions or concerns later on. Architects

, The architectural plans have to be approved by the Department of Buildings. This can be a time-consuming process, so plan accordingly. The architect will be able to help in this process. Your architect will play a substantial role in your construction, depending upon the size of the job. Your architect must be capable of performing a controlled inspection and must be registered with the Building Department to do special inspections. The architect, who may have worked with a number of builders, can recommend a reliable contractor.

, Make sure the contractor is licensed and insured with the NYC Dept. of Buildings as well as the NYC Dept. of Consumer Affairs. A contractor can also help you find other tradesmen such as electricians and plumbers. Sometimes contractors will have their own sub-contractors with whom they work closely on projects. Talk to the contractor about this. It sometimes helps the project proceed smoothly if a contractor has control over the subs when they are used to working together.

, A contract should be signed by all parties involved, and insurance certificates should be shared. Once this is squared away, the permits can be processed.

, Obtaining work permits sometimes involves expeditors. These are Building Department employees with on-the-street experience in obtaining permits. There are permit-filing fees, which should be spelled out to you beforehand.

, Once permits are obtained (not before), the work can begin. Make sure enough time is allowed for the permitting process. Contact your architect prior to starting construction, because he/she will have to inspect the excavation and footing.

,, Once the work is completed there will be an inspection required for the Department of Buildings before it will sign-off on the work. Involve the architect or contractor in this step, too.

If you really enjoy doing artful projects, you should try to find a gallery where you can show your works or put them up for sale on the internet.
, Take a good look at the pictures and read the instructions multiple times. Take notes and do some research. Don't be afraid to do research from a multitude of sites featuring different people doing the same craft or kind of project your doing to get different viewpoints and comments on techniques and products.

Be careful with what sources you get your information from. Old books are very useful for learning basic techniques and getting ideas but there are downfalls such as the brands or products in the book are out of production or changed in a different way that are no longer used in today times. Many new books are practically old books that have been spiced up with new illustrations or graphics but may lack explanation of some of new terms and basic techniques. Some are incomplete unless you order the DVD or go to a website for further info. Many shows and magazines are mostly ads and belong in the garbage. Youtube videos can be from anybody from a complete amateur to a skilled professional doing a task.
Try to get advice from a store that relates to your field instead of the clerk or sale associate at the huge supercenter that sells everything but knows little about anything.
Choose the learning format that is right for your brain. Some people learn better by reading and others learn better by watching instructional shows and DVDs. If you learn by dvd better than in a book don't choose that complicated book. With a books it's better often to have one with a multitude of illustration of the steps and one of the complete project. Save the less illustrative ones for more advanced DIY people. It also pays off to have a good reference book for quick lookup of terms used in the trade in case you forget the difference between a Phillip screw and a standard screw. You can also enroll in courses or join a club focusing on the product your doing.

, Will you need someone who assists you? Do you have an appropriate workspace (think of spray fumes or loud machines)? Do you have the necessary time and patience (for example to wait for something to dry before proceeding?)Do you have all the tools? What exactly are the materials and where can you get them? What precautions will be necessary?, Get the highest quality tools you can afford at your budget. Just because somethings expensive doesn't necessarily mean higher quality. Just look for signs of good craftsmanship and find a brand with a decent warranty. You can spend a dollar for straight pins for sewing or nails for hammering but be more serious for investments like a new saw or mixer, sewing machine.

Be careful when purchasing some other not too obvious things. Some cheap tool sets aren't made for really heavy duty jobs.There's a reason why grandma never brought a certain brand of thread.
Also make sure your tools are in excellent condition. Dull blades and scissors will more likely slide and slip rising the possibility of injury and messed cuts. Dull scissors will leave ragged edges in paper or fabric. It's a huge obstacle to have your blender break down while mixing a frosting.

, It's better to buy a little more paint than you calculated than running out of it during your paint job. It's also good to have a back up supply of materials in case of mistakes or for any surprises your project will spring on you., Many DIYs are messy. Paint, glue and even cake dough may get sprinkled on hard-to-clean surfaces, some projects involve nasty debris (saw dust, Styrofoam particles), some produce potentially toxic fumes (spray paint, varnish).It's better to prevent or reduce these problems in the first place by protecting your furniture with old blankets, covering the floor with cardboard, or simply going outdoors. But keep in mind that your neighbor may not be happy about the wind blowing Styrofoam pieces into his swimming pool!, You don't have to be perfect but at least have some sort of system to keep things in order. It's frustrating to have to dig in a messy pile of nails, bolts, screws of all sizes in a pile just thrown in a bag. Keep every size in the same area or container but isolated in separate bags or compartments., It's too easy to make costly and careless mistakes due to mislabeled containers or labels being absent. Many baking/cooking reality show mishaps happen because of mistaking what looks like flour instead is baking soda! Expensive silk fabric in a plain bag get's thrown out later that day because it's mistaken for cheap polyester satin practice scraps., This refers both to your mental state and physical readiness. Make sure you are in the mood to invest time and care in your project. DIY projects demand concentration and patience, you shouldn't be distracted by ruminations about your private life or time pressure. Also take care of your body: Wear safety goggles, a mouth patch and gloves whenever necessary. Don't sacrifice your health for creativity!, Every new material ingredient or even different brand has new specifics you need to become familiar with. If a manual is included online or in print read it thoroughly. If not do reference reading material or video tutorials. You can ask a pro or chat online with one of the trade if needed., Especially if you are trying something entirely new and/or handle expensive material, a test run is recommendable. Test your tools for proper function on scrap wood first before cutting into the main expensive wood.Before you give a table the ""stressed look"", try the technique on the underside, where a beginner's mistake won't be visible later on. Try a cake recipe a few days before the birthday of the person you want to give it to so you can do necessary adjustments. Before cutting into a new fabric you're unfamiliar with practice sewing and cutting on a scrap piece made of the same material., Look over the instructions, supplies and procedures over and over again. Reading the entire project thoroughly will yield new details and little extra steps, terminology or something like a ""mini project"" within the project. Before you start say a crochet project make sure you know how to do all the various kinds of stitches., There is a lot of (admittedly funny) cake fails on the internet. Most of them happened because the baked goods weren't left to cool before applying the decoration or because the cream or frosting wasn't thick enough. When you watch those DIY Nightmare shows on television the participants who hastily and carelessly are the ones who get to major snares and catastrophes in the end or on the way., One classic mistake is not taking precise measure or using the wrong proportions of substances or materials. Many recipes for baking or chemical formulas in paints or building require exact measurements. Make sure you know how to convert measurements and know your way around fractions and decimals when measuring or wrong calculations will lead to disappointment, expenses, and headaches., It's easy to let egos or the cost of a specific material cause a DIY doer to try to change the specific material or rule and take the easy or cheap way out. This most likely will cause trouble in the long run. Before attempting to change the original recipe or specific brand try the original version first. Know the rules and learn the trade and make adjustments later. However if some brands or materials are out of production or prohibited in your region, contact a pro or forum for advice on a suitable replacement., It can happen to everyone and it pays to change things up and be adventurous. Are you tired of going to the same supercenter that sales everything every time to get a bag of nails. A trip to the fabric or crafts store can yield a new wood burning tool, mini drill or knife or even a perfect piece of suede or camouflage fabric for the man cave. A sewing person could benefit from using a large heavy duty tool chest to store all those spools of threads, sewing machine accessories, needles, bulky yarns instead of a tiny sewing box. Don't be intimidated by something outside of your comfort zone rather it's a large tool or dainty lace., Despite the ""yourself"" part of DIY, you don't need to do it all on your own; on the contrary, many projects request an assistant, like re-upholstering a heavy sofa that needs to be lifted and turned. Or you might realize that you are stuck or that something doesn't work out as expected. Ask an experienced person before proceeding, may it be your grandfather, a shop employee or the WikiHow community. All experts at any skill level need assistance one time or another. No one master is a master of everything even in his or her own field.

You don't have to every single thing in a DIY project yourself. If you run into a plumbing problem while remodeling your kitchen and know nothing about the subject get a plumber. If you can't sew a simple stitch don't be afraid to ask your partner/friend/spouse/local expert or service do it for you. If you successfully finished construction the kitchen sink cabinet and don't want to risk breaking or messing up the expensive granite countertop hire the contractors to do this for you. Small charges and asking for help can save you from making costly mistakes.

, There might come a moment when you are frustrated. Maybe things don't work out as they should, maybe you realize that you just don't feel strong enough any more. In that case, leave your project for a while (making sure that the object of your creativity is safely put away) and do something completely different. Have a cup of tea and watch your favourite TV show, take a walk through nature or meet a good friend in the coffee shop. Who knows, maybe your friend can give you the necessary motivation?, Yes, sometimes we have to admit that we can't do it ourselves (DIO?). There is no shame in that - Michelangelo was an amazing painter and sculptor, but he probably could't sew a pillow cover if he tried. You have to try new things to see whether you are good at them or not. If you don't have the necessary talent or patience to do thing A, there's a chance you have it to do thing B. Just keep on getting inspired!"

, If you are a member of a Homeowner's Association it is likely you will also need approval of that Association to proceed with any work. Be forewarned that most Homeowner Associations have design review clauses that cover every aspect of the exterior of the house, including paint color.

, This includes removal of support walls within the building or new openings on the exterior walls of the building.


In almost all cases, basic cosmetic work does require a permit or city approval beforehand. Replacing old faucets or countertops in your bathroom, for example, can be managed without a building permit.

, Each town or city may modify this code, but their modifications must be more restrictive than the CBC. If you are working within an older building you may need to update the entire system within the building.


For example, within buildings more than 75 years old you may find an electrical system that is now regarded as dangerous. A renovation of part of that building may trigger a requirement to update the entire electrical system.

, Homes which are designated as ""historic"" are usually either 50 years old or have a special function or backstory. Homeowners of historic buildings can routinely expect longer delays in the processing of their building permit requests.


As with ""normal"" houses, owners who are simply making an electrical, water heater, or other cosmetic fix may not need to obtain a building permit for their renovations. It's best, however, to check with the city beforehand.
""Historic integrity"" may need to be maintained with homes in designated historic preservation districts.This means that it needs to look reasonably like what it looked like originally. If you plan on adding roofing, windows, siding, or exterior remodel or a historic house, consult with the city about what's expected.

, The first thing any plan checker will do is review the submittal for completeness. An incomplete submittal will only delay your project. If you are not able to obtain some of the documents required, check with the Building Department to see if they have them in their files. If not, you will need to have them prepared by licensed professionals. Many older buildings do not have surveys, site plans, or even building documents on file or available to the owner.

, Many Building departments are understaffed and the review process takes more time than it used to. A positive interaction with the Building officials will help you get the review completed as quickly as possible and help you get past any problems that develop in the review process.

, Once the permit is obtained the work covered by the permit must be inspected by the Building department. Each permit will include a list of the required inspections. Do not proceed to cover up work that is to have been inspected or you will find yourself removing all of that work to expose the work that was to be inspected.


All deviations from the approved documents must be reported to the Building Department. The deviation must be approved by them and there is likely to be an extra fee for them to review that work.

, Once all of the work is complete, be sure to get a ""final inspection"" from the Building Department. This means all of the work is judged to be in conformance with code and to be properly constructed. This is an important document that will increase the value of your building. Undocumented work will decrease the value of your building.

Discuss the reason for your renovation.,
Talk about how the renovations will impact the family budget.,
Discuss the timing of events.,
Ask for ideas.",How to Involve Your Family in Your Renovation Plans1," Major changes to your home and schedule cannot be discussed in bits and pieces. Set aside some time in everyone's schedule to talk about renovation plans.;
, Understanding the ""why"" behind any action is a good way to build support for a plan.


Let your family know that the decision to renovate is based on your desire to stay in the home for a long period of time, or because you need a finished basement for extra family space or due to some other issue or problem that needs resolving. Invite questions and talk openly.

, You do not have to give your kids a spreadsheet with line item details, but let them know that a lot of money will be spent and they might need to earn their own money or cut back on some of the things they want.

, Give your family members time to adjust. You do not want to announce a major kitchen renovation the day before the family fridge is torn out.


Put together a timeline so everyone knows what to expect. Caution that the renovations might take longer than expected.

, Instead of telling your family members how everything will look, solicit their input. If they get to have a say in the color that goes on the walls or the tile that gets put on the new floors, they will be more receptive and helpful.

Assign duties.,
Share your space.,
Keep everyone out of the way.",How to Involve Your Family in Your Renovation Plans2," Let everyone pitch in to get ready for the renovation, whether it is cleaning out a room, storing furniture or packing up valuables.

, You might need to let the kids watch television in your bedroom, or ask the teenagers to bunk with the preschoolers, depending on your renovation.


Remind everyone that it is temporary. Refer to the timeline and make a game out of counting down the days until life gets back to normal.

, Discourage children from playing with the workers and if you are doing most of the work yourself, ask relatives or friends to babysit while the majority of the work is being done.


Eat outside or at restaurants if your kitchen is being renovated. Avoid any bathrooms that are having work done and spend as much time outside of the house as you can while renovations are going on.

Let in the light.,
Invest in new appliances.,
Replace scuffed, marked, or stained floors.,
Pay attention to the little things.,
Walk through your home with a real estate agent.",How to Increase the Value of Your Home1," Time and time again realtors stress that a fresh coat of paint is the easiest way to increase the value of your home. That said, a bright purple room may be off-putting to potential buyers. Go for neutral tones like beige or muted green with simple white baseboards to appeal to a wide range of buyers.If you are on a budget then paint the most commonly used rooms first, like the kitchen, living room, and main bathroom.
Avoid both bright colors like pink or yellow and dark shades like navy or chocolate brown, as these are polarizing choices for certain buyers.;
, Wallpaper is a big turn-off for potential buyers because it is a hassle to remove if they don’t like it. Stick to neutral paint colors to get the maximum value for your house.Some wallpaper, especially in small rooms, can be effective if chosen correctly. Stick to calm, simple patterns over big and bold images.

, A 2007 HomeGain survey found that lighting was the number one thing potential buyers used to separate good homes from great ones.You can add attractive lighting in a variety of ways:


Install mood-enhancing dimmer switches.
Put in a skylight or sun tubes (glass holes in the roof that allow in sunlight) to bring light in naturally.
Remove large and stuffy curtains.
Replace old light bulbs with energy-efficient LEDs for a clean, modern look without breaking the bank.

, A new oven, washing machine, or fridge tells a buyer that the home is up-to-date. Old appliances, however, can signal that your home is in need of costly repairs or improvements, lowering value. Buy one new appliance if you can’t afford multiple. Having one shiny, high-end appliance like a dishwasher gives the impression that all of your appliances are high end.


However, a new stainless steel oven will look odd if the rest of the appliances nearby in are worn, retro styles.If you are on a budget, look up new ""faces"" for your appliances. Often the front plate of an oven or dishwasher can be removed and replaced with a new one if you call your manufacturer and ask for a replacement., Old carpets, scratched wood floors, and dirty tiles can all cause your house’s value to plummet when it goes on the market. Rip up the old flooring and add tile, clean wood floors, or a new carpet. Spending $1,000 on a new floor increase your home value by $2,000.Start in ""high-value"" rooms like the kitchen or the living room if you want new floors. These are the first rooms many buyers notice.
Get tile for small, frequently dirty floors (bathroom/kitchen), hardwood for the living or dining spaces, and carpet or wood for bedrooms.Recent trends have shied away from carpets, as most consumers now prefer hardwood floors., Even the smallest, cheapest fixes can make your home sparkle and sell for more. Switch out the shower curtain for a clean glass shower door. The more question marks you eliminate for potential buyers the more likely you are to sell your house for the right price. Some quick fixes include:


New rug for the entryway.
New lighting fixtures.
New faucets and handles.
Clean and re-grout tiles in the kitchen and bathroom., Professional realtors know trends in your area and can work with your budget to get the best return on your investment.

Refinance your mortgage to obtain cash for home repairs.,
Obtain a home equity line of credit.,
Seek out a second mortgage.,
Determine if you qualify for a government loan.,
Use a credit card for small, emergency repairs.,
Borrow from your 401(k).",How to Finance Home Repairs," A popular way to pay for home repairs and renovations is through a ""cash-out refi,"" which is simply a way of swapping your existing mortgage for a new one and converting some of your home equity to cash in the process. Your current mortgage lender can help you understand your options for refinancing. Note that liquidating your equity in this way will generally cause your monthly payments or mortgage term to increase.;
, A home equity line of credit functions like a credit card, with an open-ended term, a credit limit, and a minimum monthly payment based on your outstanding balance. This type credit makes sense for financing home repairs or remodeling projects because these projects tend to increase your home equity anyway.

, A second mortgage can be an unattractive option as it can tend to overburden you with debt, but for home repairs with an end in sight they are helpful. A second mortgage is a loan secured on your accumulated equity. The interest rate will be higher because your primary mortgage lender is given preference over your new lender in case of insolvency; for this reason, try to keep the size of your second mortgage as small as possible.

, In the United States, the Federal Housing Administration runs a loan program called Title 1 for homeowners with very little equity. These loans are made by banks and backed by the federal government, and can be used to finance essential repairs such as structural and electrical problems.

, While credit cards typically carry higher interest rates than loans secured on your home equity, they make sense for funding small home repairs. A credit card is available for use immediately and requires no paperwork, unlike other financing options.

, Many employers allow borrowing from your 401(k) to fund home repairs and renovations. This option is low-hassle because the money is already yours, so there is no paperwork or credit check. However, you are required to pay the borrowed money back into your 401(k) before leaving the company.

Perform any necessary maintenance and repairs.,
Spend money on your kitchen before any other room.,
Install matching cabinets and countertops.,
Knock out walls or remove large fixtures to make your house more open.,
Know that only insulated closed rooms add to your square footage.",How to Increase the Value of Your Home2," Nothing can turn away a potential buyer like the knowledge that they will have to sink $2,000 into new plumbing when they move in. Address the basics of your house, (drafty windows, leaks, rusty rain gutters, etc.) or any expensive renovations you make will go unnoticed., The kitchen is the most important room in the house when it comes to home value. This is the room most buyers focus on, and you can expect to get up to 85% of your remodeling costs back when the house sells.


A fresh coat of paint that hides splash marks can cheaply update a kitchen.
Find or buy a place to tuck away your dishes and cookbooks to make your kitchen look clean and spacious

, This is a very high-value fix, especially if done with updated appliances. Begin in the kitchen before updating the bathroom or bedrooms. New cabinets can completely transform a room for the better, giving the appearance that the whole room had a makeover. For a cheaper fix, hire a resurfacing company to clean and stain your old cabinets, making them look like they just came from the hardware store.Marble or granite counters are expensive but tend to last longer, remaining beautiful with age.

, The number of square feet in your house is a major indicator of your home’s worth. But you can create the illusion of more space by eliminating clutter as well. Homeowners like big, wide-open floor plans because they can imagine how their own stuff will fill the house when they move in.Knock down inessential walls.
Remove the island in the middle of the kitchen to open up the house.
Install swinging French doors to allow airflow between rooms like the kitchen and dining room.

, Adding a screen-in porch is an expensive undertaking, but it might not actually help your house’s value in the long run because it cannot be counted as part of your square footage.Finishing the basement, however, can reap rewards when it is time for resale.


If you have the money, consider adding additional rooms to your house. Larger houses, without fail, sell for more money. Additions, however, are expensive to construct and may take several months to complete.
In general, improving your current house will lead to a greater return on your investment than adding new sections."

Install energy-efficient windows.,
Re-paint your front door.,
Consider solar panels.,
Update your siding.",How to Increase the Value of Your Home3," Modern windows make your house look beautiful and provide insulation to save on heating and cooling costs. New double-pane windows are pricey to purchase ($75-$100), but they save you money in the long run and will significantly increase the value of the home by making it more energy efficient.

, The front door is the first thing potential buyers see, and repainting a door is a cheap way to make a great first impression. Focus on your entryway to intrigue buyers before they even walk into the house., Green technology is in, and energy efficient houses have a big leg up in the marketplace. Solar panels make your house seem modern and cutting-edge, and signal to potential buyers that they will save money after they’ve bought the house.


Solar panels can lead to tax breaks for homeowners, which will quickly increase the value of your house.
On the other hand, solar panels might be a big concern for the buyer. If you're paying high lease rates to a third party, when the panels break, who will fix them? Also, the cheap imported panels are being leased for 20 years, but they sometimes only last for five to eight years.

, New vinyl siding is one of the top ways to increase the value of your house, and you can usually make back all of the costs during a sale. Not only does new siding usually give your house a facelift, but it usually helps with insulation and heating costs.


Upscale siding, like fiber-cement boards of PVC lumber, can actually make you money on a sale, often returning 3-5% profit."

Add shrubs or flowers along the edges of your house.,
Clean up the path to the front door.,
Install a new mailbox.The box at the end of your driveway might be an afterthought during remodeling, but it can be the first thing anyone sees.,
Work on a healthy lawn.,
Keep your landscaping simple.",How to Increase the Value of Your Home4," Start near the front door and add small plants around the edges of your house to make it open and inviting. This only costs a few hundred dollars, but an attractive lawn brings in more buyers and drives the value of your home up before anyone even steps through the front door.


Trim or replace overgrown shrubbery if it's already planted.
Use bright, colorful flowers like Hibiscus, Brown-Eyed Susans, Azaleas, or Zinnias., You want to make anyone walking into the house feel like royalty on the way in. Some simple ideas to make your walkway the red-carpet of house sales include:


Plant flowers along the walkway.
Install small lamps along the concrete. You can buy self-powered solar lights at most hardware stores that are made to be placed outside., If it is dilapidated, rusty, or falling down then people will assume the same about your house. You can easily buy and install your new mailbox by yourself and make it sparkle for a few dollars.


Stain the wooden post so that it does not rot.
Plant small flowers, like Marigolds, around the base of the mailbox.

, This can be difficult in some climates, but healthy grass is green, devoid of weeds and covers the entire lawn. Use ""Weed & Feeds"" which are specially formulated products that fertilize grass and kills weeds, to get rid of small patches of weeds and water your grass at least 1-2 a week.If your lawn has large bare patches, consider getting your lawn professionally seeded or installing sod (already grown grass) to make your lawn pop.

, Avoid going overboard, like adding a soccer field or an enormous, lush garden, which can signal to buyers that your house is “high-maintenance.” More important than a dazzling garden or water fountain is a clean, inviting lawn.


Cut your grass regularly so that it is trim and clean looking.
Pull up any weeds the flower beds.
Use a weed whacker to trim away tall grass next to the house, driveway, and walkways.

Don’t put the house on the market until you are ready.,
Clean your house until it sparkles.,
Remember to clean the outside of the house as well.,
Remove traces of pets.,
Don’t make large renovations before selling.,
Remove personal items.",How to Increase the Value of Your Home5," The first 2 week on the market is when a house generates buzz and interest. If you are still fixing the roof or painting the walls when the first buyers show up you are losing your best chance to sell the house. Wait to put your house on the market until it is clean and updated.

, This is the easiest way to increase the chance your house sells for the amount you deserve. The cleanliness of a house is the first thing a potential buyer will notice, and it won’t matter how great your countertops look if they are covered in crumbs. If you are low on time, hire a cleaning service the day before you show the house to make sure everything is sparkling.


Dust the surfaces.
Clean the floors and remove any stains.
Wipe down the refrigerator, oven, and countertops in the kitchen.
Clean out toilets, showers, and baths.
Empty your closet partially – all buyers love seeing how much storage space they might have., You should take the same care to clean the outside of your home as the inside. Keep your grass trim and clean up the gardens and flowerbeds regularly to make a good impression as buyers enter the driveway.


Take the time to wipe down the outsides of the windows.
If the sides of your house are dirty, rent a pressure washer to blast away grime from the siding.

, Pets, pet toys, litterboxes, and hair all give a house the illusion of dirtiness, which can significantly lower the value of your home. Clean up your pet’s mess and put all pet supplies out of sight as you show your home to make the best impression., Unfortunately, adding a new bedroom and bath to the back side of your house won’t increase the value enough to pay back what you’ve spent. Focus instead on little renovations, which can return more money than you spent when it is time to sell. Large renovations often cost more money than they add to house’s value., Tons of family photos, knick-knacks, and personal items are a big turn-off for potential buyers. While you want to your house to feel homey, you don’t want it to seem so personal that the next owner can’t see themselves living in it. Hide any toys, books, computers, or keepsakes when people come see your house and limit the number of family photos scattered around the house if there is a picture of you on every wall.

Search high and low.,

Sign up and reap the rewards.,
If all else fails, just ask.",How to Get Trade Prices on Building Supplies for DIY Projects," Thankfully for anyone about to undertake a DIY project, searching for products doesn't mean trawling a trolley up and down endless shopping aisles anymore. Everything you need is now only an internet connection and a few clicks away. Simply typing what you need into your preferred search engine will provide you with a long list of links to your desired product. Often you’ll be able to find a wide range of varying prices for the same product online.;
, This is where comparison sites come in handy to save time. If you have a specific supplier in mind but don’t have time to search across the web, use a comparison sight to get various product prices displayed all on the same page. It’s important to remember however that certain websites may not be signed up to comparison sites, so it’s worth carrying out your own searches as well.

, Ask yourself if the supplies you want are the ones that actually need? Many building merchants offer unbranded or lesser-known brand substitutes at a cheaper price, and these often work as well as the expensive branded products.

, Traditionally, if you ever wanted to receive a discount or get trade prices you’d have to buy in bulk – even in the age of the Internet, this is still very much in evidence. So if you’re planning an extensive project, even if you’re not in the trade per se, you can still find many building products and supplies at reasonable prices. Or indeed you can find a service provider that will do this on your behalf.

, Some building supply websites present the opportunity for users to sign up and become a member, which then grants them exclusive discounts and access to previously unavailable promotions. This is a great and often inexpensive way to save money, and also keep up-to-date with the latest offers.

, As old fashioned as it may sound, sometimes it’s one of the best methods. Most online suppliers may not be able to offer you products at exactly trade price, but many should be happy to come to some kind of agreement if you’re buying plenty of supplies and regularly visiting their site. Send them an email and see what they can do for you.

Do a basic cleaning.,
Get rid of clutter.,
Do a deep clean.,
Eliminate odors.",How to Increase the Value of Your Home Inexpensively1," Nothing will give you a better return on your investment than a little elbow grease. A cleaner house will look more appealing to your realtor when he or she helps you set a price, as well as to the appraiser the bank sends out when you have an offer. Here are some ideas:;
, Make your house look more spacious by eliminating junky or unnecessary items. Get rid of battered furniture, decaying knick-knacks and piles of paper - or, if you can't stand to part with anything, throw your stuff in a storage unit until after the house sells. Remember that it's better to show a somewhat barren house than one that's filled to the brim with clutter.

, Once you have more room to work, undertake a thorough housecleaning. Not only should you do usual chores such as mopping or dusting, but focus on rarely-cleaned areas such as baseboards, grout and heating vents. Steam clean your carpets, and wash walls and windows. Wipe down the blinds, and remove any broken screens. Pressure-wash any siding on the outside of your house, as well as the sidewalks and driveways. If you don't have the time to undertake such a project, consider hiring a professional cleaning service. Many of them specialize in residential properties for lease or for sale.

, A common saying among realtors is, ""If you can smell it, you can't sell it."" Sometimes, people can't detect how their house smells because their noses are so accustomed to it. If you think your home smells fabulous, have a trusted friend confirm or deny this as soon as they walk in the door. If you keep pets, thoroughly shampoo carpets and furniture, and wash all bedding - you're not selling the bedding or the furniture, but they're capable of smelling up the house just the same. If you smoke, do everything you would for pets in addition to washing (and possibly painting over) the walls and ceiling as well as you can.


When you know your realtor will be showing the house, try to make it smell good by baking something delicious beforehand (which you can put on the counter for your guests) or lighting a candle. If you don't have candles or time to bake, pour a few drops of vanilla on an empty cookie sheet and put it in the oven at 200-250F. It will make your house smell like warm cookies.

Determine whether or not you even need an architect.,
Search for an architect through the American Institute of Architects website.,
Choose several candidates, and schedule time to meet with them.,
Consider hiring a design-build firm.,
Assess the fee situation.,
Read the contract carefully.",How to Hire an Architect," If your renovation does not require the reconfiguring of any walls, you may be better off simply hiring a contractor. Contractors will be able to handle most home updates by themselves. Replacing fixtures and finishes like cabinetry, flooring, paint and lighting is a contractor's bread and butter. However, if the floor plan of your home will change, you should hire an architect.;
, The AIA site has a great ""Find an Architect"" feature that will let you search for architecture firms by location. Check out the websites of some nearby firms. Look specifically at their past projects, and compare the scope of those projects to yours.

, Don't just randomly pick an architect and move forward; interview several candidates before making your choice. Tell them about your design plans, get a feel for how they work, and most importantly, be sure you'll be able to work smoothly with the firm or the individual you hire. You will be working closely with them, so it is important to have a good relationship.


If you already have a trusted contractor in mind, ask him to recommend an architect. Contractors work with architects all the time and will be familiar with the ones practicing locally. Don't overlook the importance of your contractor's opinion; the relationship between the architect and the contractor can make or break a project.

, Design-build firms are companies who keep both designers and contractors on staff, thus streamlining the design/construction process and improving communication. If you don't already have a contractor in mind, this is a good option. Design-build is a rising trend. There are now many design-build firms that specialize in small projects like home renovations.

, Once you have decided on an architect but before you sign a contract, ask how fees are configured. The firm may want to negotiate a fixed sum, or they may charge a percentage above the cost of time and materials. In the latter case, make sure to get a guaranteed maximum price written into the contract. This specifies the most you will pay the architect, which ensures that he/she won't run way over-budget by taking too long or selecting overly-expensive materials.

, Once the contract is drawn up, make sure you understand and agree to all its provisions before signing. Consider having a lawyer look over the contract with you.

Spruce up the yard.,
Add a fresh coat of interior paint.,
Put up fresh curtains and blinds.,
Install modern light switches and outlet covers.,
Up the wattage.,
Check the square footage.,
Add wood trim and cornice for a cheap and easy do it yourself idea that can add tons of ""wow"" factor to the look of your home.",How to Increase the Value of Your Home Inexpensively2," Get rid of trash and yard waste. Keep your lawn in good condition and mow it. Trim the hedges, get rid of weeds, and mulch the flower beds. If you don't have much to work with, plant some flowers or buy small shrubs. Anything more than that is a waste of money.

, Painting your walls can instantly brighten up your house and make it appear well cared for. First, patch up any holes, no matter how small. To get a silky smooth finish, apply a coat of primer. After the primer dries, lightly sand it with a fine grit sandpaper (220 grit). Apply the first coat of latex paint, and then lightly sand that layer also. Wipe the walls down with a damp cloth after each sanding session. Then, apply the final coat of latex paint.


Favor white ceilings and off-white or beige walls with white baseboards. Not only will these colors throw more light around the room and make it appear larger, they're easy for potential buyers to imagine over.
Choose an appropriate finish. Semi-gloss paint will make your walls seem brighter. If your walls have imperfections, such as dents in the drywall or cracks in the plaster, use eggshell finish paint to hide those imperfections. It is a low-lustre finish that can be lightly washed.
Upgrade the interior walls to a level 5 finish in order to give your rooms a ""luxury"" appearance. Simply use 60 grit sandpaper to lightly score the surface of the walls. Add two coats of joint treatment (USG Total or All Purpose works great), one after the other. On the second coat, sand lightly with 220 grit sandpaper. This will give you a level 5 finish over any textured wall.

, Blinds and curtains are relatively inexpensive. Over time, the sun fades the colors from your blinds and curtains, so new ones will make a better impression than old ones.

, Some modern switches can be easily installed using the wires already running to the old switches. Just be sure to turn off the power to the room or entire house before doing any work. New outlet covers look nice, and give the impression that the electrical wiring in the house is newer than it really is. Dimmer switches are especially desirable.


Beware: It can be illegal to replace the outlets with the three-prong type while the wiring is for two prong (not grounded). This could lead to trouble if the buyer's home inspector catches on.

, In the main areas of the house, such as the living or dining room, swap out your lightbulbs for ones with slightly higher wattage. Just make sure you don't exceed the maximum specification for lamps and other lights. (You could use compact fluorescent light bulbs in order to make the room brighter without getting new fixtures, plus they save electricity, meaning they save you money.)

, Sometimes your home's square footage will be higher than what your county assessor has recorded. Because homes sell for hundreds of dollars per square foot, even a small increase will allow you to list your home for more money. If you have a tape measure and some graph paper, you can verify the square footage of your home by yourself. Measure the around the entire house, noting any abutments and including the porch and garage. Use one square of graph paper per foot. Then, divide the perimeter into smaller rectangles and triangles - for instance, a bay window might look like a rectangle with two acute triangles on each side. Measure the area of each piece, and add it up to get the square footage of your house. You can also hire a residential appraiser to evaluate the square footage - the service could pay for itself if it was measured incorrectly before.

, Simple ceiling trim and armchair railing are the easiest and most typical upgrades found in newer homes. To make an even bolder statement, paint the walls a neutral, flat color and paint the trim a high gloss white.

Visit the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website featured in the Sources section of this article, or call the BBB for feedback on a particular contractor at 1-703-276-0100 in the United States or at 514-905-3893 in Canada. (Though this point in case of USA Builders only)
Consult with an organization that focuses on improving or that regulates the business of contracting, such as the National Association of Home Builders. Organizations such as these may provide you with the contact information for reputable contractors who belong to the organization.
Verify that the residential contractor who was referred to you worked on a task similar to the task you are hiring them for. For example, if you need to choose a residential contractor to work on your roof, you may not want to hire a residential contractor who specializes in installing air conditioning systems.;
, Some states or regions may require residential contractors to obtain a license prior to practicing contracting business.


Consult with your state or region's licensing regulator to determine if a contracting license is required by law to practice business.
Visit the ""Contractor's License"" website provided to you in the Sources section of this article, then click directly on your state. You will then be taken to a webpage that indicates if a license is required by the state, as well as contact information for the contracting regulator.
Ask the residential contractor to show you their license or certification prior to hiring them.

, Hiring a residential contractor with insurance or worker's compensation may protect you from lawsuits or from paying expenses in the event the contractor is injured while working on your property.


Ask the contractor to provide you with proof of insurance. In most cases, residential contractors are required to have an insurance policy before they can legally perform contracting work.

, This will allow you to determine if other consumers have had positive experiences with the contractor.


Obtain a list of references or past clients from the residential contractor. The references can be clients with either positive, or negative experiences.
Contact each reference and ask them for details about their experience with the contractor. If any references had issues with the contractor, obtain details about the problems and their outcomes. This will allow you to determine if the contractor is experienced with handling and resolving problems that may arise while on the job.

, These factors may allow you to determine the value offered by each residential contractor.


Ask each residential contractor about the types of materials they will use, the amount of time it will take them to complete the project, and a complete list and description of each fee. Some contractors may charge you lower prices if they are using materials that are lower in quality.

, A reputable contractor will provide you with a detailed contract that outlines the terms, policies, guidelines, and timeline of the project.


Ask a friend, family member, or acquaintance familiar with contracts for help with understanding and reviewing the contract terms. This may prevent you from signing a contract with terms that are unethical, unprofessional, or less than favorable.

Understand what is involved.,
Weigh the pros of staying.,
Weigh the pros of leaving.,
Consider both lists to see where the balance comes out.,
Go with your instincts.",How to Decide Whether to Renovate or Shift," It is important to know what you might be getting yourself in for if you stay and renovate or you leave and up size. On the whole, it is cheaper to stay in your home unless you are over-capitalizing on your property or the house you are considering shifting to is the same price or cheaper than the price at which you are selling your current property. Then there are other considerations, such as the financial, time and emotional costs related to leaving - including removals, re-connections, re-directions, school shifts etc. Unless you are staying in the same suburb, upheaval counts heavily against moving and favours staying. On the other hand, living through renovations is stressful and financial blowouts above estimates are not uncommon, let alone delays and builders doing several shifts between properties and never being available when you need them.;
, It can be really helpful to create a list of reasons for why you want to stay and renovate. Here are key positive considerations:


Existing mortgage has low interest rates, repayment amount is low
Less fees are likely to be involved in staying over leaving (e.g., lawyer's fees, real estate agent's fees/commissions etc.)
Established life in local community - neighbours, friends, school, clubs etc.
Existing access to urban infrastructure such as public transport, shops, schools, libraries, gyms, doctors etc.
Existing improvements you have already made, e.g., insulation, heating, cooling, older extensions, carpets, upgrades etc.
Sentimental attachment to your home
Plenty of space upwards or outwards to extend without loss of amenities

, In the same vein, consider creating a list of the pros for leaving. Here are key considerations:


You will get more space without having to add on
You will not have to deal with tradespeople, builders, architects etc. and lose home privacy for a time or suffer noise, mud, dust etc. effects from renovations
A move might reflect changes in the family structure - older children and older parents may be best accommodated by getting a home that provides more private space for teens and parents
The shape or era of your existing house has never pleased you
Some issues appear unsolvable, such as mould infestation, proximity to industrial facilities etc.
""Tacking on"" an extension to your existing home will probably spoil its character
Renovations will end up over-capitalizing on the property given the area you live in and the current market values

, Perhaps there are things on the list for staying that you cannot see in your current situation. For example, you may have a lovely home but no space to extend, or your neighbours will probably object if you seek planning permission to build an upper level to your home. Perhaps, however, some of the reasons for leaving your home can be overcome with good planning and advice. For example, additional space gains can often be made to an existing home in an aesthetic way that provides little inconvenience if you head off to the cottage for a month or two during the worst of the renovations. It is important to talk to your architect and/or builder about the possibilities before giving up on fixing your existing home. A financial adviser or lawyer can also assist with advice on the potential for over-capitalization and this may be enough to allay any concerns.

, Sometimes it is as simple as it being time to leave the place you have spent many years in. Energy can be renewed and family spirits lifted by a change of view, location and lifestyle possibilities. If you are feeling that it is the right time to move on, this may be the top motivating factor that leads you to move on.

Check with friends who have done similar work to the job that you are contemplating.,
Before you even start calling the contractors, check for references.,
Call contractors and get bids.,
Select the best bid.,
Call the references given by the contractor you picked.,
Verify that the contractor you choose is licensed.

,
Read the contract carefully.,
Obtain a liability of insurance certificate made out in your name.,
Make sure that the contractor obtains any necessary building permits.,
Once you are satisfied with the contract, sign it and give the contractor his deposit by check.",How to Choose a Home Improvement Contractor," See how satisfied they were with the contractor. If you don't have any friends who had that type of work done, look in another location, like NeedTo.com, Yelp, the Yellow Pages, or even Craig's List;
, On social media sites, reviews come up when you search for a service. You can also check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB)in your area. See if there are any unresolved complaints with a given contractor. Choose one that has no record of complaints, or one where the complaint was resolved to the consumer's satisfaction. Be aware that a new contractor or one that changed his legal name to dodge complaints may not have any record of complaints with the BBB, so it is important to follow all of these steps.

, Be sure to give the job details the same way with each contractor so you won't be comparing ""apples and oranges"". Get a list of references, that is recently completed jobs the contractor has done that are similar to yours.

, The best bid is not always the lowest, as the quality of materials may differ. Examine the proposals carefully.

, See how satisfied the customers were with the job. If there were complaints about the job, or the contractor was unable to give any references, consider the ""second best"" bid instead.

,, Make sure that the contractor has liability insurance and that his employees are covered by workman's compensation. Ask questions about anything you don't understand, and don't be shy about asking for changes to the contract. You are the customer.


Make sure the contract lists specifics of your job. List brand names of supplies, type and quantity of items to be installed, etc. Will your contractor do the painting after something is installed or subcontract with somebody else, or leave you to secure the painting?
Include cleanup and debris removal in the contract.
Note any follow-up or guarantees the contract provides.

, The insurance companies give these out on a regular basis. Do not be timid to ask for it. It is the only sure proof of insurance no matter what is written on the truck!

, If he/she will be digging, make sure he/she checks underground utilities.

, If you decide to give a cash deposit, be sure to get a receipt.


On many projects there is no need to give a deposit. In any case, do not let the payments get ahead of the job. Payment should be done on a completed basis: say the job is 25% done (the contract should describe what that is), then pay 25%, etc. The only exception is for customized material which a contractor cannot return.

Speak up if anything is unclear.",How to Avoid a Home Improvement Dispute," This will depend on the scope of your home improvement project. Most home improvements will involve a general contractor who manages every aspect of the project, including the hiring of subcontractors.In contrast, smaller projects involving one specific type of work might only require a specialty contractor, such as a mason or electrician.


It’s important to know the kind of contractor you’ll need; a specialty contractor might tell you he can handle a more general project, but if they're not qualified for the work you need this can lead to misunderstandings and disputes.;
, Let the people around you know you’re looking to start a home improvement project. Many of them should have had dealings with contractors and can point you to those they trust. They might also know which contractors to avoid.

, After receiving references from those close to you, you’ll want to research a contractor’s reputation. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) provides ratings for local businesses and makes complaints from consumers available to the public. Use this resource to check contractors in your area. You can also use review aggregator sites like Yelp to get insight into the quality of a contractor’s work.


A contractor with low ratings on these sites has either been the subject of several complaints or has questionable business practices.
Any customers that have had disputes with contractors will typically make their voices heard. This will help you avoid difficult contractors.

, Reaching out to more than one contractor gives you a better idea of what price to expect for a specific project. You can compare each contractor’s services, ensuring you get the best deal for your project. Compare the services and timeframe outlined in each bid, as well as examining how each contractor plans to use the available funds. This will prevent unexpected costs that can create disputes.


Unlike a quote, a bid implies that you are seeking prices from multiple contractors; they will be aware that there is competition.Remember that the lowest price is not necessarily the best option. Contractors who underestimate the cost of a project might surprise you with hidden costs later, leading to a possible conflict.

, While not all states require this, it’s important to research a potential contractor’s qualifications while evaluating their bids. This prevents surprises like a contractor not being able to perform some of the work needed or worse, performing work they are not qualified for. You can check your state’s requirements for contractors through your local building department or consumer protection agency., It’s crucial to know as much information as you can before hiring a contractor. When contacting a contractor’s references, ask about the services provided during the project as well as how satisfied the clients were with the work afterward. This is especially relevant if the work done for them is similar to your project.


Be suspicious of a contractor who isn’t able to or refuses to provide references. This may indicate inexperience or disputes with earlier clients.

, These are particularly useful if the contractor doesn’t provide their own contract. They allow you to get an idea of the items that should be included in a contract. If your contractor does provide a contract, you can compare it to online templates to ensure it includes all the necessary requirements.

, Different home improvement projects can require a number of permits. Make sure you and your contractor are in agreement concerning who will be responsible for acquiring the permits and paying for them.Then ensure this is recorded in writing in the contract. This avoids misunderstandings that can lead to disputes.

, Many home improvement disputes revolve around payment, whether it be the amount paid or the timeframe.Ensure the contract specifies all required deposits, payment amounts and deadlines.

, Clear mediation solutions in the contract can help defuse disputes before they start. While legal aid is a clear option, there are inexpensive, less adversarial alternatives: mediation and binding arbitration.Having these outlined in the contract can give you an idea of the relationship you can expect from your contractor.


Mediation involves a neutral party trying to bring both sides of a dispute to a compromise. The decision isn’t binding, and both parties can walk away if the mediation isn’t suitable.
In contrast, a decision reached through binding arbitration is final. Both parties have to accept the arbitrator’s decision and there is no possibility for appeal.Thus, it’s important for your contract to outline which of the two methods will be used to prevent misunderstandings.

, You need to understand the contract thoroughly before you decide to sign it; it’s a legally binding document that will define your home improvement project. Other contract items to pay close attention to are:


Description of the work to be performed, materials and equipment used. This is your best sign that your contractor understands your project exactly.
Start date, end date, and potential delays. This section outlines acceptable delays and ensures you won’t have construction lingering in your home longer than expected.
Extra work stipulations. This ensures that no extra work happens without the contract needing to be altered and signed by you and the contractor.

, A contractor working on your property needs to have accident and liability insurance covering themselves and anyone working with them. This protects you in the unfortunate event of a worker being injured while working on your project. Make sure you get a copy of this certificate.


You can also check with your home insurance company to determine if you’re protected in the case of damage to your property. This can be your backup if the contractor’s insurance doesn’t cover this., If you have any questions regarding the contract or paperwork provided by your contractor, ask questions. It’s important to go into a home improvement project with a clear understanding of what’s involved; you don’t want any surprises down the road.

Educate Yourself.,
Check Contractor References and Past Experience.,
Consider hiring a 'Green' company.,
Read contractor reviews.,
Make a List of questions that the Contractor must answer.,
Show the Contractor what you want completed.,
The cheapest offers are often the most expensive.",How to Choose the Best Contractor for Home Improvement," It’s important to educate yourself about the work you want to have completed prior to meeting with contractors. This way, you’ll have a deeper understanding of renovation lingo, you’ll be able to provide the contractor with enough information to prepare an estimate that meets your goals, be able to interpret any estimates that you receive, and to figure out whether the contractor is overpricing their work.;
, To select the best of the best, you will need to check company’s procedures, specifications, references and the way they communicate with you. If the construction company or contractor does not know how to communicate well with you (even when the others have no problems), then the possibility for misunderstandings in the project increases, and that means higher costs and less satisfaction.

, Today, houses are cheaper to heat and cool and more comfortable than it was a case a few decades ago. If you want to regain the money you've invested in refurbishing or building a house, consider connecting with a green company that understands your needs and has the knowledge how to manage your task.

, Look for contractors affiliated with the Better Business Bureau, National Association of the Remodelling Industry (NARI), National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA), National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) or any other local building or remodelling association. Look at each Contractors website to see what type of work they perform, any examples of already completed work and their qualifications.

, When you look at the specifications of potential contractors, make a list of questions, which you want to be answered. Those, who respond to your e-mail or call you, should have an advantage over the others. Nevertheless, consider whether your questions were answered clearly. This is particularly important for issues that you are not clear about or you did not understand. Here are some questions you need to ask each contractor: Did the Contractor omit a portion of the scope of work? If so, have them revise the estimate. Are they using lesser quality materials (paint, cabinets, tile, etc.)? How long will it take to complete the work? Are they insured with a General Liability policy? Can they provide a minimum of 5 to 10 references from previous projects? Are permits necessary and if so, is the cost included in the estimate? Is the Contractor willing to let you visit several of their jobs? What type of Warranty does the Contractor provide? If they do not understand what you are talking about, ask more questions. Good builders are the ones who know how to solve a problem. However, those who insist on answering your questions and want to explain you every little detail are the best.

, During your meetings, hand over your information that you compiled and walk the job with each of them. Be prepared to answer numerous questions. Some will be easy to answer and others may need some additional research on your part. Either way, try to stick with your initial scope of work and do not deviate because it will only make it more difficult for you to interpret the figures on each bid. Ask each Contractor how long it will take them to prepare the estimate and make sure they honour those dates. If they don't, that should be a red flag.

, Price should not be the deciding factor when choosing contractors. People often choose the lowest bid and ultimately discover that the contractor has not done the job properly. High quality papers require a certain price. It may cost you more, but the job will be done smoothly and within the standards of eligibility.Cheaper can offer more chop at the end, because you'll eventually change the order, to correct errors or the contractor to cancel the job. If you ask for three bids for your project, you'll get three different prices. If a contractor is 15 percent more expensive than another, ask him why. Maybe it includes more items in his offer. If it is cheaper by 15 percent, maybe he forgot to include something very important to you. Remember, you have the right to ask a contractor what you want and they must know how to explain the offer.

Perform some basic landscaping to boost your home's curb appeal.,
Focus on basic safety upgrades.,
Install a cohesive set of fixtures throughout your home.,
Spend the bulk of your renovation money in the kitchen and bathrooms.,
Know which home renovations to avoid.",How to Add Value to a Home Through Renovation," One of the cheapest and easiest ways to add resale value to your home is to improve the landscaping in the front yard. Planting some new flowers, repainting your patio's trim, and making your lawn look its best are easy ways to make a good first impression on buyers; this can yield more offers and a higher price tag.;
, A simple renovation that consistently earns almost the entire investment back is replacing your front door with a steel-reinforced door. Similarly, replacing an old garage door with a sturdier model will yield an almost 100 percent return. Potential buyers enjoy the safety and security offered by these inexpensive upgrades.

, Small items such as light fixtures, door knobs, and faucets are often overlooked during a home renovation. However, replacing these fixtures with similarly styled products can lend your home a remarkably cohesive look that is more dramatic than the sum of its parts.

, Kitchen and bathroom renovations consistently provide high returns on investment, usually in the range of 70 to 80 percent.


When renovating your kitchen, avoid the temptation to introduce expensive, top-of-the-line appliances and fixtures. You will realize a higher return on your money by focusing on replacing old and worn flooring, wall coverings, and cabinetry with new mid-range products.
Focus most of your attention on your master bathroom if you have one. Potential buyers like to see the master bath as an oasis of sorts, so updating the finishes and fixtures in this room will yield a high return.
If your home only has 1 bathroom, consider adding a second bathroom or powder room if possible. Expensive as this renovation can be, it will likely add considerable value to your home.

, Some home remodeling projects are notorious for adding very little to your home's resale value. For example, home office renovations and installing a swimming pool tend to show very low returns. Swimming pools or other high-maintenance additions can even turn potential buyers away from making offers altogether.

Visit your local building department after you have researched your local building codes and inspected your home yourself.",How to Tell if Your Home Has Code Violations," The International Code Council Commercial and Residential Building codes are revised and updated in three year cycles, and by knowing when your home was built you will be able to see what changes have occurred in your jurisdiction's building codes after it was built. Here are some general changes you might look for:





 

Changes in wiring standards, such as the elimination of the use of aluminum wiring in residential construction, with the exception of service entry wiring, and the requirement for ground fault circuit interrupters near wet locations. Other substantial changes in the electrical trade have also been made.
Changes in site plan requirements to decrease flooding problems and to reduce storm water pollution have been implemented in many jurisdictions.
Wind load and snow load requirements to strengthen structural elements for homes have been developed to prevent damage in severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, blizzards, and earthquakes.






Energy efficiency improvements have been addressed, although they may not be specifically written into building codes. The use of insulated or double-insulated HVAC ductwork is required in many areas, and minimum standards for wall and ceiling insulation may apply in your area.
Roofing installation and shingle wind resistance standards apply in many areas subject to high winds. Flame spread limits or nonflammable roofing may be required in areas subject to wildfires.;
, You should be able to find this information at your local building inspection office or zoning and building department. You can also ask experienced builders in your area. They will have a vast store of knowledge in building codes, since they are required to know the current codes, and will likely remember changes they have seen over the years., If the builder is still in business, he or she may have records of the date of construction, and may even have contract drawings and copies of permits required at the time of construction. These will give you very specific information about the construction of your home. Check the records at your local building department for plans, permits, inspections and so on.

In some cases, the builder may no longer be in business or even alive. If the business is still around, ask the inheritors of the business if they're able to help. Alternatively, in many cases it will be possible to obtain drawings, plans and other useful materials from your local planning authority or municipality responsible for building codes and resource consents.

, Many real estate transactions and home sales require these inspections, and a licensed, trained inspector should know what code requirements apply to your home.

When hiring an inspector, be sure to choose someone with a lot of experience and good industry reputation. If the building inspectors are required to be registered or to belong to a professional body, be sure to ask for these indicators of assured quality.
If your home was inspected as part of a purchase, reread the report, or consider having a new inspection performed if it has been many years since you moved into your home.

, While it isn't practical to remove brick from a wall to observe the installation of masonry anchorages or brick ties (usually required by code), you may be able to look for hurricane clips on roof framing members in your attic, and while you are there, you can also check the depth of attic insulation, strapping of wiring cables, installation of junction box covers, and other roof/attic construction details., You may want to hire an electrician to remove the dead front of the panel to inspect the wiring connections to breakers (or fuses), so the type of wire (copper vs aluminum) can be determined, the size of wires, and the existence of grounding legs for circuits.

Having a qualified electrician check the state of the wiring in older houses can be very important. In some cases decades of (often illegal) incremental DIY fixes to wiring or a total lack of replacing aging wires in such homes can present a fire hazard and potential electrocution problems. An electrician will be able to tell you immediately whether or not major fixes will be needed.

, Do the frames have wind load labels, and is the glazing double or triple glazed to provide insulation and to resist impact? Are there visible fasteners to assure you they are securely installed? Other window features like Low E coatings may be more difficult to confirm. Tempered or safety glass on the other hand must have a manufacturers designation, designating the type of glass and the safety glazing standard with which it complies. This designation must be visible at final installation and be acid etched or otherwise applied so that it cannot be removed without being destroyed., It is difficult for a layman to determine if lead solder was used to connect copper pipes, but if you see a dull, grey plastic pipe with aluminum crimped couplings, there is a good chance your house, or parts of it, were fitted with polybutylene pipe that has since been removed from use, since chlorine in the water is known to cause deterioration of the internal chemical structure of polybutylene piping and the associated acetal fittings and will cause leaks. Since the pipe is being compromised from the inside, it is virtually impossible to know the condition of the polybutylene piping., Check the area it is located in to make sure it has sufficient ventilation, as these may cause a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. If the gas water heater is located in a garage, make sure that the pilot flame is a minimum of 18 inches (45.7 cm) above the floor.

Check the water heater to see if it is fitted with a pressure relief valve, the valve should be plumbed to the exterior of the building.
Make sure that, if you are located in a seismic design category C,D,E or F (you can find this out at your local building department), the water heater is strapped at the upper 1/3 and lower 1/3 of it's vertical dimensions to resist horizontal displacement during a seismic event.

, Does the clothes dryer have a metal exhaust duct with a smooth inner surface? Is the length of the duct 35 feet (10.7 m) or less (minus up to 5 feet for each 90° elbow)?

See if the plumbing fixtures for the washing machine are strapped and the drain line is routed into the sanitary sewer system of your home. Some local building codes allow gray water discharge in certain areas, but most do not permit direct discharge onto the ground outside your home.

, Ask the staff there if they provide a courtesy re-inspection of your home to check compliance to local codes. They may offer a free inspection service, or they may inspect your home for a nominal fee, depending on how the office is operated."

Please read all steps, tips and warnings completely before attempting.,
Identify the reason that a lamp (lighting fixture) won't function.,
Determine value of the fixture or cost of replacement.,
Use extreme care to prevent burns.,
Test the bulb(s) in known a working lamp to determine if they are ""good"".,
Unplug (or otherwise disconnect) the fixture from the power source.,
Remove the lamp (if not already out) from the socket or holder.,
Install the lamp.,
Test the recent adjustments / cleaning.,
Remove the base of the fixture or other area to access the wiring compartment or switch.,
Inspect for burned, broken, or loose wires.,
Use a Multimeter or VOM (Volt-Ohm Meter) for additional testing if the fixture still does not function.,
If you can use a VOM and have one, then (with the fixture plugged in) measure the transformer output usually 12volts, if nothing there, then measure the transformer input 120 volts, if you have the 120 volts, then the transformer is bad most likely.

,
You must take the on/off switch into consideration and with POWER OFF test it for continuity.

,If no 120 at the transformer input, then your power cord or plug is the cause and you have to examine it and test it for continuity (unplugged of course)

,
You can purchase transformers, and bulb sockets from your local electrical supply store, maybe even Radio Shack, or you can search the web and there are many places that handle these parts.

",How to Repair Your Halogen Lamp,";
, The most common are:


Bulb burned out.
Bulb socket oxidized, burned, corroded, or otherwise broken so as to prevent proper electrical connection with the bulb contacts.
Transformer has overheated and a winding has ""shorted"" out or ""opened"" up.
The control (on / off or dimmer switch) if present, has failed.
The cord cap (plug), cord set (that which brings voltage from the wall receptacle to the fixture), or wiring between the control and the transformer or transformer to lamp socket has open, or shorted. Look for wire and insulation that is discolored, burned off, broken, etc.

, The time and / or cost of the repairs may not warrant repair. Warnings below should also be reviewed before attempting.

, Allow plenty of time for a lamp to cool before troubleshooting. The lamps, while hot, can cause significant burns. The lamp operating temperature can be about 1,000 °F (538 °C).

, Never handle the glass of the lamp with bare hands. Use a cloth or wear gloves when handling the bulb to avoid contact with skin. The oils from the skin that would be left on the lamp will result in early lamp failure. If unable to test by swapping, assume the lamp is good.

, Shutting it off with a wall switch is NOT considered ""disconnected"".

, Examine the socket or holder electrical contacts. If they appear burned, discolored, oxidized, etc., gently scrape the contacts slightly until shiny metal becomes visible.

, Inspect the socket or holder contacts where they touch the lamp. If they appear loose, you can try to tighten them by squeezing them together (gently) with needle nose pliers (after removing the lamp). Check that any area of the contact previously cleaned of discoloration, etc., is aligned with the points of contact to the lamp.

, With a good bulb in the fixture, plug it in to power to see if functions.

, Unplug (or otherwise disconnect) the fixture from the power source. Shutting it off with a wall switch is NOT considered ""disconnected"". Accessing the wiring compartment depends on the fixture. Some require a plate, screws, or other protective barrier to be removed. Sometimes it may be a simple piece of cardboard glued to the bottom of the fixture base. Try to remove it causing a minimal amount of damage, as it will be needed to be reinstalled when done. Under the base cover (cardboard) you will find one or more of the following: transformer, power cord and the control switch (unless you are working with a pole lamp Torchiere type where the on/off/dimmer switch is in the pole).

Add the finishing touches.",How to Recover Lampshades," You will want to work at a table, as you will need a flat surface that you can spread all of your materials out on. You should consider putting newspaper down on the table and on the ground surrounding your work station because spray adhesive can stick to almost any surface and could do damage to your furniture or floor., Only do this if you are using a lampshade that already has fabric on it (rather than just plain liner fabric like most standard lamps have). Remove the trim (if there is any) by pulling on it; it should come off easily. Using scissors, puncture the old fabric and gently cut sections away from the frame. Make sure you don’t cut the liner fabric.Depending on the adhesive used to adhere the fabric to the frame, it may be possible to cut away sections then use your fingers to pry the remaining fragments from the wire of the frame.

, You will want to make sure that the paper is flat and wrinkle free. Roll your lamp shade along the paper, tracing the path it makes with a pencil. It is important to keep track of where on the lamp you began rolling so that you get an exact measurement.

, You will want a bit of extra fabric so you should add a half inch along both of the long sides of the shape you have traced from your shade, and one inch to one of the short sides., You will use this pattern as a stencil for the shape you will cut out of your fabric.

, When recovering a lamp, you will want to choose a fabric that is lightweight and relatively thin. If the fabric is too heavy, the light from the lamp won’t be able to shine through (thus making the lamp obsolete).


Another thing to keep in mind is the pattern of your fabric. While lamps that have an equally sized top and bottom will work with any fabric, lamps that have a small top and a larger bottom look a little odd when wrapped in a pattern that is vertically linear. The vertical lines of the fabric tend to look like they are falling into the back seam.

, Make sure there is no bunching or wrinkling and that the material is completely smooth on the flat surface. You want it to be smooth so that you do not accidentally cut across a wrinkle and end up with an uneven fabric cover for your lamp.

, Make sure that the paper is flat against the fabric. If you want, you can use pins to hold it flush against the fabric.

, Using a fabric pen or some other drawing tool that you will be able to see on the fabric, trace around the paper stencil. Take great care to be as accurate as possible. The reason you draw on the back of the material is so that your markings don’t show on the finished product., Using fabric scissors, gently cut the material along the lines created with the aid of the fabric pencil. Remove any remaining fabric from the work surface., It is very important that you do this in a well ventilated area, as spray adhesive can make you very ill if you breath in too much of it. Remember that spray adhesive is incredibly sticky (and permanent) so make sure you do not get it on anything besides the fabric.


If you bought an adhesive-backed fabric, you do not need to spray adhesive onto the fabric. Use the adhesive webbing to adhere the fabric to the lampshade frame. This is managed by using an iron to heat the webbing, move it into position on the frame, then cover the webbing with the fabric. Smooth the fabric as it is moved around the sides of the webbing and the frame until the shade is completely covered.

, To do this, center your shade on the fabric so that the edge of the fabric and the existing seam of the shade are lined up. Roll the shade along the fabric, making sure to smooth the fabric down and get out all of the wrinkles.If you are using a patterned fabric, it is also important to make sure that you pattern is lined up straight when you stick the fabric to the shade.

, You will have extra fabric to wrap your lamp in. Instead of just leaving the edge of the fabric visible, fold the extra fabric over so that it creates a straight seam. Use a hot glue gun to adhere the seam to the lamp shade. Make sure you only use a little bit of glue--if you use too much, it could leak out from under the seam (which is not the best look).

, In order to give you lamp a finished look, you will want to fold the extra fabric and the top and bottom of the shade so that the fabric sticks to the inside of the shade. Make sure they stay tucked up and under by gluing them down with a hot glue gun.

, To really make your lampshade look store bought, add a lining around the bottom edge of the lamp. Simply use a hot glue gun to stick a thicker piece of fabric along the top and bottom edges of your lamp. You can also add fringe, rickrack or other types of materials to cover the hems on the top and the bottom of the newly covered lampshade."

Some lamps will have one-piece frames and some will have a set of two rings: a washer top and a bottom wire ring, generally. If you're unhappy with what you have at your disposal, new lampshade wire rings are available at some craft supply stores.

This project will be constructing a drum shade--the fancy name for a circular shade. These are generally made up of two separate rings.

;
, Making your own drum shade can be pretty easy as long as you have high-quality, durable materials. Get everything in order before you get started. There will be no last-minute trips to the store on your watch.

Styrene
Wire rings
Bulldog clips
Fabric glue
Bias tape
Scissors
Paintbrushes

, Maybe you have all the materials, but are they the right sizes? Check out your lamp rings first; they're the hardest to replace.


Your fabric needs to be at the very least one inch (2.5 cm) wider and longer than the width and circumference of your lampshade. You can either measure the circumference with a measuring tape or use the 'ol handy 3.14 x diameter trick.

For example, if the diameter of your lampshade is 14 inches, 3.14 x 14 = 43.96, the circumference of your lampshade. So, you should be working with material that's at least 45 inches long.


You can choose how far apart you want your rings to be to determine the width . A little more than a foot (31 cm) is standard.

, Once you've measured your fabric, you can cut your styrene to fit it.









The styrene should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) narrower and 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) shorter than your fabric.

Styrene doesn't stick well to synthetic fibers -- use linen, cotton or silk for your fabric.



, This customizes your lamp, hides any old, rusting wire, and coordinates even the inside of the lamp with the room. Be sure to wrap the rings and spokes.









Bias tape comes in different colors and patterns; you can even make your own.

Use quick-drying fabric glue and apply to the rings, not the tape. When you come to the end, just cut it off and adhere.

, Place it on the fabric as you go to ensure it's bubble free and straight.









Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of extra material on 3 sides--both long sides and one short side. Make sure the 4th side is flush to the styrene.

, Put glue on the 1/2 inch of fabric that is exposed and place on top of the other side. You should now have a circular form of material in your hands.









Put weights in the center on the inside and let dry for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes are up, roll it along your table to see that it stays in a tube-like shape.

, Those are the kind that are black, metallic, and are generally used to hold papers together. Rest the wire rings between the ""arms"" of the clips.


Use 4 or 5 clips on each side. Rest the weight of the lamp shade on the rings clipped on the bottom.

, Start at the top, using your paintbrushes to spread a light layer of glue on the exposed 1/2 inch of material. Remove the clips as you go and replace over the glued area.

, The first time you go around, don't be concerned with tucking it perfectly. Tuck it loosely at first, then circle back to smooth out the kinks.









Repeat these two steps for both ends. Take 15 minutes between the top and bottom to allow for drying.

, You'll be surprised how easy this can be to do. If your frame bends while you're messing with it, just bend it back to its original shape, no harm done.


All paneled shades use frames, not rings. A paneled shade can be triangular, rectangular, square, hexagonal, or bell shaped. This tutorial can be used for any of these shapes.

, The spokes are the vertical wires that create the shape of the panels. If you'd like to go above and beyond, you can wrap the outside frame as well.


Use a hot glue gun and place a drop of glue at the beginning of your tape and one at the end to attach. Repeat this process for each spoke.

, Allot 1/4 of an inch (.63 cm) for seam allowances. This is important: If your frame is uniform all the way around, one panel will suffice. But if your shade is, for example, rectangular in shape, create a pattern for each size of panel.


Use chalk or a marking pen to trace the spokes that form the panel shape onto the muslin.Take pins to the frame to keep it tight.

, You'll end up with as many pieces of fabric as you have sides to your frame. Again, if there are panels of different sizes, be sure to cut out fabric of different sizes and remember that 1/4"" seam allowance!


If you are also using a lining, cut that out, too, to the same shape and size.

If your fabric is heavy enough, you may forgo the lining altogether., With right sides together, sew the panels together with 1/4"" (.63 cm) seams. If you have different sized panels, make sure they're sewn together in the proper order.


Do this for the lining, too, if you're using one.

, Turn the fabric right side out and stretch it over the frame. Adjust it as necessary and whipstitch (or overcast stitch) the extra fabric of the seams to the tape-wrapped spokes with a needle and thread.

, Pull your fabric taut and, using a few drops of hot glue, secure it only to the frame. Trim the excess fabric as need be.

, Pin the lining inside the lampshade with the wrong sides together. Align the seams to the spokes as you did with the fabric, and blind stitch the lining to the inside. Hand-sew invisible stitches to form a neat, finished edge.If you're not so sure whether you want to fuss with a lining or not, hold your material up to the light. If the right amount of light already passes through it, don't worry about it.

, Available at all craft supply stores, decorative trim (beads, tassles, you name it) can add the finishing touches onto your own personalized shade.


This can be done with a bit of hot glue in a matter of minutes, so why not?

Take the measurements of your frame.,
Cut strips of fabric.,
Hem, trim, or edge the fabric with ribbon.,
Attach the strips to the top and bottom of the lampshade.,
Adjust the strips and add trim (optional).",How to Make Lampshades3," How far is it between the top and bottom wires? How far is it around? If you are working with a paneled shade, simply take the measurement of each panel; if you are working with a circular shade, measure the circumference (3.14 x diameter).


This is necessary to find out how long and wide your strips of fabric need to be and the amount that will cover your entire shade.

, This is where the shade becomes all your own. Use one style of material for a battered, distressed look or use all types of coordinating colors and patterns. Just make sure they're long enough!


Add one extra inch for the seam allowance. This is needed to wrap around the wire frame.
If your lamp is 20"" (51 cm) around, make sure you have fabric that, in total, amounts to at least 22"" (56 cm) wide. You need adequate overlap to keep the wire frame from showing. Of course, greater overlap than that is always safe, too. If each strip of fabric is 2"" (5 cm) across, have at least 11 strips of fabric ready.

, This ensures that it stays neat, doesn't fray, and looks professional.


The edges will only be seen from the inside of your lamp. If you're pressed for time or simply can't be bothered, a simple trim is fine.

, Using your 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on either side, affix the strip to the top of the shade with a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread. Repeat for the bottom.


If you use a hot glue gun and glue the material to the wire, you will not be able to gather the fabric when it's finished.
If you use a staple gun, it's a good idea to add decorative trim around the top and bottom to obscure those tiny metallic lines from view.

, You can gather the material together if you stapled or used a needle and thread. Adjust the material to achieve the look you want.


Beads, tassles, or extra ribbon can be added onto the top and bottom of your shade to hide any less-than-perfect areas or simply to add more flair.

Look for fireflies near water.,
Catch fireflies early in the evening.,
Leave the flashlight inside.,
House the fireflies in a jar with a safe cover.,
Keep the fireflies captive for only few hours.",How to Make a Firefly Lamp1," Fireflies live in various habitats and various regions of the world. They are most often found near standing water, especially water sources in forests, fields, and the areas in between. Ponds, streams, and marshes are good places to look, especially if there is tall grass nearby.In seasonal areas, they are usually most prevalent right after the rainy season.
In the U.S., fireflies are found in most states east of the Rocky Mountains.;
, The secret to catching fireflies is starting just before sunset. Most fireflies will start to glow before it’s completely dark, and the day’s final rays of sunlight will help you see them when they’re not lit up as well. Further, fireflies only glow for about an hour after sunset.Use your hands instead of a net, as nets are more likely to injure the fireflies. Make cups with both of your hands and close them around a firefly like you’re trying to cover a tennis ball.

, Artificial light will cause fireflies to glow less, and it will make it harder for your eyes to adjust to the darkness. If you do wish to use a light for safety, opt for a camping headlight with a red light setting.Remain quiet and move calmly while hunting fireflies. In addition to artificial light, loud noises and sudden movements will frighten them away.

, Any type of translucent jar will work. Glass is best for enjoying the light the fireflies produce. Do not use the jar’s lid - with or without holes. Instead, fasten a thin piece of cloth or a very fine metal mesh around the jar’s top with a rubber band.Before placing the fireflies in the jar, place an apple slice and a piece of paper towel soaked with water at the bottom of the jar. This will keep them fed and hydrated.

, Place the jar itself in a warm, dark, and moist location. Keep artificial light away from the jar, as this will diminish the insects’ desire to glow. They will glow the most if they are placed in a location where they can see other fireflies glowing.Let the fireflies go the same evening you catch them. They will glow the most right after your catch them, and will glow less and less until released.

Fill a glass jar with string lights.,
Make a light fixture out of a metal can.,
Position electric firefly jars in prominent locations.",How to Make a Firefly Lamp2," You can use the string lights commonly used to decorate Christmas trees to make a lamp that emulates the appearance of fireflies in a jar. Get a glass jar of any color and shape. A simple mason jar with a metal lid can work, but so can a glass jar with a flip-top lid.The easiest option is turning the jar upside down and running the plug out of the jar’s opening.
You can also add a hole for the plug end of the string lights to leave the jar. Depending on the material, it may be easiest to poke or drill a hole in the lid. You can also get drill bits made to drill holes in glass.
Alternatively, use battery-operated lights and hide the battery storage area within the jar, perhaps beneath the lid. This will give you a stand-alone light fixture you can put wherever you like, and even move around.

, Filling a metal can with string lights can create a lighting effect on the walls of a room that looks a bit like fireflies glowing in the distance. Coffee tins are especially good, as they have strong metal and the opening does not have sharp edges. Remove any product label, and use a marker to cover the can in dots that are about the length of paper clip away from one another.Paint the can, if you so desire, in whatever color or pattern you wish. Spray paint will be the easiest and fastest method.
Fill the can with a string of lights and run the plug out of the can’s opening, or make your own hole elsewhere.

, For instance, place metal firefly jars somewhere they can project light onto the surrounding walls. Glass or metal firefly jars can be hung from the ceiling, or placed on tables around a room. These fixtures can make especially enjoyable porch decorations, allowing you turn the overhead fixture off and immerse yourself in firefly-like lighting.


If you intend to place your electric firefly light outdoors, consider powering them with solar-powered string lights. Fasten the solar panel to the top of the jar and simply place the fixture on an outdoor table for an automatic evening light source.

Use glow stick liquid to make a multicolored firefly jar.,
Add glitter.,
Shake the jar.,
Place the jars somewhere dark.",How to Make a Firefly Lamp3," Another way to make a firefly jar without actual fireflies is by coating the inside of a jar with glow stick liquid. Acquire a glass jar with a resealable lid, such as a mason jar. Clean and dry the jar, inside and out.Crack glow sticks to activate them. Cut off one end and empty them into your jar. Use several different colors, but add them one at a time.
Try to avoid direct contact with the liquid from a glow stick. That said, the liquid is considered non-toxic and will only cause mild skin irritation. Wash it off with soap and water if contact occurs
If a substantial amount of the liquid somehow gets in someone's mouth or eyes, flush with water and contact poison control.

, Glitter will both reflect and refract the light in the jar, creating an ambient, magical effect. Add a bit of glitter and swirl the jar in between each time you add liquid from another glow stick. You can also simply add as much glitter as you want at any point, but doing so incrementally helps the glitter mix with the glowing liquid.Different colored glitter may add a further layer of color and complexity to your jar.

, Once you’ve added as many glow sticks and as much glitter as you want, cap the jar and carefully shake it with both hands. Continue shaking until the glowing liquid and glitter is dispersed evenly on the inside walls of the jar.For a smaller jar, a half dozen glow sticks may be plenty. For larger jars, you may want to use as many as a dozen glow sticks.

, The jars will glow the brightest as soon as they are made, and will slowly lose their glow. Try making a few and placing them in the corners of a dark room for an especially enjoyable lighting effect.For maximum appeal, place the jars near a blacklight. Blacklight can also be used to “recharge” a glow stick firefly jar.
Aside from novelty shops, light bulb retailers, and online, you can also find handheld blacklight bulbs and fixtures at pet supplies stores.

Hang a lamp over the floor.,
Have another person help you decide on the height.,
Practice walking across the room or sitting down at the table while your partner holds the light in place.",How to Determine The Proper Height For A Pendant Lamp,"


Think about what you want from the pendant light. Is it meant to provide a bright light for working or a soft mood light? A chandelier might overwhelm a small space while a more utilitarian lamp could look too harsh for your living area.






Decide if the lamp's purpose and design will match the room's décor. A light fixture made of chrome or stainless steel will look sleek and modern. Blown glass gives an artistic feel. Chandeliers are more romantic and elegant.





;
,


Consider the size of your light. As a general rule of thumb, a larger light can be moved higher while a smaller light can be moved lower.






Consider the size of the room. How tall is the ceiling? Rooms with unusually high ceilings require lights that are bigger and hang lower.






If you are hanging the light over a table or a kitchen island, think about the size of that as well. If you have a large table, you can get away with hanging your lamp slightly higher up. Also, look at the shape of your table. Is it round, square, or rectangular? If you have a rectangular table, an island, or a counter, you will likely need more than one hanging pendant light.







,


Start with 28 to 34 inches (71.1 to 86.4 cm), measuring from the bottom of the hanging light and the surface of your table. This range will be your base measurement. Use it as a rough guideline when planning the placement of your light.






When hanging a light over a table, be sure to plan for the height of the people that may use that space. Nobody wants a light glaring in his or her eyes or knocking them in the head while they are chopping vegetables.







,


Plan for roughly 84 to 96 inches (213.4 to 243.8 cm) from the bottom of the light to the floor. You should provide at least 1 foot (0.3 m) of clearance for the person walking below.






Calculate according to the height of the ceiling. For an 8-foot ceiling, a pendant lamp should hang about 12 to 20 inches (30.5 to 50.8 cm) below. For each additional foot of ceiling height, add 3 inches (7.6 cm).







, One of the best ways to decide on the perfect height of your pendant light is to get someone else to lower or raise the light while you stand a distance away to see how it all looks.

, This will allow you to make sure the lamp is not blocking your view, knocking into your head, or interfering in any way with your routine.

Hang the chandelier.",How to Make a Chandelier1," Use a sewing needle to weave heavy-duty thread through a series of eight sequins. Create three to four dozen strands.


Push the thread through the same side of each sequin in the strand. Then, repeat the process by knotting the thread and weaving it through the opposite side of each sequin.






The sequins should be flat against the thread when done.






Use gold and silver sequins. You can either create solid strands of gold and solid strands of silver, or you can mix the colors on each strand.






Use light or clear thread for the best results. You could also use metallic thread that matches the color of the sequins.






If you would prefer an asymmetrical look, you can alternate the number of sequins on each strand, varying the length from 6 to 10 sequins.






The exact number of strands you need will depend on how large your chandelier will be and how full you want it to appear.





;
, Create varying strands of clear glass ornaments by tying heavy-duty thread, fishing line, or clear jewelry line to the top wire of each ornament.


Attach the thread to the top wire of the ornament, where the hook would usually go. Knot the thread to hold it in place.






The number of ornaments to a strand should vary from about two to six per strand. Create more strands with two to three on them since these will go around the outer edge.







, Use spray paint to paint the frame white.


This is only optional. If you like the current color of the frame, you do not need to paint it.






You could also paint the frame black, gold, or silver. For a brighter, less traditional appearance, you could paint the frame any color that matches the décor of your room.






Only use spray paint that is approved for use on metal.






Make sure that the wide part of the lamp shade frame is large enough to fit over the existing ceiling light base you plan to attach the chandelier to. The frame will be turned upside-down when hung.







, Turn the frame upside-down. Tie and knot the sequin strands to the wide part of the frame and the ornament strands to the small ring and ""Y"" wire stretching across the smaller ring.


Arrange your sequin strands in whatever order you would like. For a nice, full look, you should position the strands so that the distance in between each one is slightly smaller than the diameter of each sequin.






Arrange the ornament strands so that the shorter strands are attached to the ring while the longer strands are attached to the ""Y"" wire.







, Measure a length of ribbon to fit around the wide ring of your metal frame. Cut and sew the ribbon over the ring.


You can use any color ribbon you want, but it should be opaque enough to conceal the ends of the tied sequin strands.






Attach the ribbon to the wire using a needle and thread. Place the ribbon over the wire. Pull your threaded needle through the ribbon, around the wire, and back through to the front of the ribbon. Repeat this process until the entire ribbon is attached.






If necessary, you can temporarily hold the ribbon in place with craft glue or hot glue as you sew. You should not rely on the glue permanently, though.

, The process may vary depending on how your existing ceiling light base is set up, but these instructions apply to a standard base.


Start with a light base that currently has light bulbs in it. Since there is no light source in this chandelier, you will need to rely on an existing light source.






Make sure that the light is currently ""off"" to prevent yourself from getting shocked.
Cut a length of heavy-duty wire that matches the circumference of the light base. It should be able to fit beneath the light base snugly.
Attach four or more strands of heavy-duty fishing line to this wire circle. Attach the other end of each strand to the wide ring of your chandelier beneath the ribbon.
Unscrew your light base slightly. Slide the wire ring you created under the base and screw the plate firmly in place over the wire.
Check the light fixture and the chandelier to make sure that both are firmly held in place.
This completes your chandelier.

Paint a wire planter basket.,
Cut out and stack the parchment paper and wax paper.,
Iron the paper together.,
Repeat the paper ironing steps.,
Cut out circles of wax paper.,
Cut and attach ribbon to the planter basket.,
Glue the paper capiz shells onto the ribbons.,
Hang the chandelier over an existing ceiling light.",How to Make a Chandelier2," Use spray paint to color the basket frame.


Make sure to use spray paint that is approved for use with metal.






White, black, silver, gold, and bronze paints have the most traditional appeal, but you can use any color that matches with the décor of your room.







, Cut a 36-in (91-cm) piece of parchment paper and three 18-in (46-cm) pieces of wax paper. Lay the parchment paper out on an ironing board and place the three pieces of wax paper inside. Fold the parchment paper over the wax paper to sandwich the pieces in.


The parchment paper helps the wax stick together and stay within the layers of paper. It also creates a smooth, finished surface on the wax paper.






If you do not have an ironing board, you can lay this out on a clean dish towel in the middle of a hard floor or table.







, Use a low setting on your iron. Pass the iron over the paper sandwich several times to melt the layers of wax paper together.


Remove the layered wax paper from the parchment. The wax paper should stick together, but it should not stick to the parchment paper.







, Continue creating stacks of three-layered wax paper until you use an entire roll of wax paper.


For large planter frames, you may want to use half of a second roll, as well.
You do not need to use new parchment paper for each layer. The parchment paper can be reused.

, Use a circle cutter to cut 2.5-in (6.35-cm) circles out of each layered sheet of wax paper. Cut as many circles as possible.


If you do not have a circle cutter, you could use a cookie cutter or other circular stencil that measures roughly 2.5 in (6.35 cm) in diameter. Trace around the stencil using a craft razor or blade.






Cut the circles out over a cutting mat. It may help to tape the wax paper to the mat as you work to prevent it from sliding around.







, You will need to cut out anywhere from 90 to 120 strands of ribbon.


You can either attach the ribbon in single or double layers. The method you use will determine the needed length of each strand.






Single-layer ribbon should be about 7 in (18 cm) long and double-layer ribbon should be 16 in (41 cm) long.






Use a hot glue gun to glue the end of a single-layer strand of ribbon over the horizontal bar of the basket.






Fold a double-layer strand of ribbon in half. Knot the ribbon over the horizontal bar of the basket.






Attach your ribbons to each horizontal bar of your basket frame, starting from the bottom and working your way up. There should be very little excess space in between ribbon strands.

, Use a small dot of hot glue to attach the top of each shell to the ribbon.


Only attach the shells to every other ribbon and alternate between two and three shells per ribbon.






The shells on each strand should overlap by about 1/4-in (0.635-cm).






Start with the bottom layer and work your way up to the higher layers.






Continue until the layers of ribbon on each tier have been decorated with the capiz shells.







, For best results, choose a simple light fixture that extends low enough to sit in the top of the planter basket.


The light from the existing fixture will appear to ""glow"" against the paper capiz shells.

Gather your materials.,
Paint each disc with nail polish.,
Make a paper template for your discs.,
Transfer the template marks onto each disc.,
Drill the holes into each disc.,
Link the discs together.,
Hang your discs on the chandelier frame.",How to Make a Chandelier3," You will need a recycled chandelier frame, lucite discs, nail polish, and stainless steel jump rings.


The chandelier should have a cylindrical shape and hooks that go around the entire fixture. Cut costs by buying one at a thrift store or by getting a beat up one by someone who's ready to throw theirs away.






The lucite discs, also known as plexiglass, plastic, or acrylic glass discs, should be 4 in (10 cm) in diameter and about 1/8-in (3 mm) thick. You need two discs for every hook on your chandelier frame.






Use cheap, slightly sparkly nail polish. There's no need for anything too expensive; cheap nail polish should work fine. Get creative with your color choices.






The stainless steel jump rings should be 20g rings that are about 1/2-in (1.25-cm) in diameter. If you do not want to buy the rings, you can make them yourself by wrapping heavy-duty wire around a 1/2-in (1.25-cm) tube of lip gloss.







, You will need two colors of nail polish. The light color goes on first, and the darker color goes on second.


Pour your first color onto the disc in a spiral swirl. Quickly spread the polish using the nail polish brush so that it coats the entire disc. Once the polish is spread, smooth it out by brushing it in another spiral from the outside moving in. Only use your wrist as you swirl the polish and make the swirl one continuous line.






Pour a small puddle or four to five drops of your second color into the middle of the disc. Smush it around using the polish brush, working from the inside out. Lightly swirl the nail polish around so that it gradually fades into the first color. The second color should only cover about 1/3 of the surface.






Let dry.






If you are unsatisfied with the look of your disc, apply a small amount of nail polish remover to a cotton ball, remove the polish, and try again.

, Trace the outline of one disc onto thick paper. Cut it out and mark where the holes should be.


This template allows you to determine where you need to drill each hole in your lucite disc.






Fold the paper template in half so that you can locate the exact middle.






Use a marker to draw a big hole roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the edge and along the center line. Draw a smaller hole about 1/4 in (0.635 cm) away from the opposite end along the center line.







, Place the template beneath each disc and use a marker to mark the template hole dots onto the disc.


The dots should be placed in the same position. Even with nail polish painted on each disc, you should be able to see the dots through the lucite.







, Any standard drill should work.


To drill the large hole, first drill into the large marking with a small drill bit. Widen the hole with a medium drill bit, and widen it again with a large drill bit. Do not drill the hole with a large bit from the start, since doing so will likely crack the lucite.






For the smaller hole, drill the hole using a small drill bit.






Half the discs should have both holes drill into them while the other half only need the small hole drilled in.

, Attach two discs together using one of your stainless steel jump rings.


Link the discs together by joining them at the small holes.






You will likely be able to open and close the rings with your fingers, but if not, use a pair of pliers.







, Attach each double-layer of discs on the chandelier frame by hanging them on the frame's hooks.


Each hook should have a set of discs hanging from it.






Hang the discs by their large holes.
It may help to already have the chandelier hanging in place before you attach the discs.
This completes the chandelier.

",How to Make a Portable Reading Lamp1," Make sure that the milk jug is clean, to avoid bad odors.;
, Screw the lid on tight to prevent spills.

, Face the lamp inward.

, Simply switch on the headlamp. A gentle reading light will diffuse throughout the area where you're reading.


This lamp will sit solidly inside a tent, a camping vehicle, a car, on a camping or picnic table, or wherever you need it.






The light from this hack is much gentler on your eyes than other portable lights and you should find reading by it very comfortable.

Measure the length of two of the glowsticks end to end.,
Cut half of the pipe along to the length you marked in step one.,
Make the base end.,
Insert two glowsticks side by side into the half part, from the cut part.,
Tie the ties around the half pipe to keep the glowsticks in place.,
Slip the pipe cap on the end of the half pipe.,
Use.",How to Make a Portable Reading Lamp2," Mark this length on the plumbing pipe.

, Saw this one half of the length off, then sandpaper the cut part to ensure neatness and remove any parts that catch. You will be left with a long fully round pipe end attached to the halved pipe end.

, Choose a base length and mark it on the piece of pipe that is still fully round pipe. Cut this end of the pipe to the desired length. Place a pipe end cap on the base.


If you're not sure how much to cut, decide whether you want to use the light standing up or lying down. If it lies down, the base end can be short. If you want it to stand upright, it will need to be longer to account for the weight and height of the light end. Alternatively, cut short and fill with pebbles or river stones before capping, to provide a base weight.

, Then insert two more above these two, to the end of the pipe half.

, Tie them around where the two sets meet, ensuring that you capture the glowsticks behind the ties so that they cannot fall out. Tie them so that you can easily slip the old glowsticks out and add new ones when needed.


Cable ties, thin gauge wire or similar can be used.







, This completes the light.

, Snap the glowsticks. Shake well before snapping.


Replace the glowsticks as needed. Bring quite a few to see you through the length of time you need the light for.

Choose a suitable yogurt drink or probiotic drink container.,
Fill the yogurt drink bottle with water.,
Place the flashlight onto the bottle mouth.,
Secure the flashlight to the bottle.,
Firm out the tape and ensure that it is sitting securely against both the bottle and the flashlight.,
Test the flashlight lamp.",How to Make a Portable Reading Lamp3," The sizes of these little containers vary somewhat, so select the drink bottle by testing whether the flashlight will sit on the mouth of the bottle without falling into it. Also choose a suitable flashlight; it should have a strong beam but should not be too expensive, as the duct tape will likely ruin its finish when you decide to pull the contraption apart later (which will be essential if traveling, as you don't want the contents of the bottle sloshing onto the flashlight).

, Keep the outside dry, or wipe it down to remove water droplets.

, Face the light end downward onto the bottle and balance it evenly on the mouth.

, Cut a suitable length of duct tape, around 15cm/6"" in length or so. Wrap it around the join between the flashlight and the bottle's mouth, where there will be a small crease. The aim is to even out this crease and create a smooth line, so repeat the cut and wrap for the tape around two to three more times.


Given there is water in the bottle, this can be a little tricky. It needs to be done on a flat surface, keeping the bottle upright and straight.

, If there are any sources of give or weakness, secure more tape to that part.

, Stand it upright, with the bottle at the base and the flashlight facing upward. Turn it on; expect the light to be weak but it'll be sufficient to read by in the tent or to write your day's activities down in your journal.


If it won't stand on it's own right, get a huge blob of poster tack and stick it on the base to keep it in place. Or, use Velcro strips and add the other strip to a small wooden base for attaching the lamp to.

Alternatively, lean it against a book or a pair of socks; this will dim it a little though.

Prep the area and gather your materials.,
Draw a circle on your ball (or balloon).,
Make your gluey mixture.,
Coat the ball in cooking spray.,
Feed the string into the glue mixture.,
Pull out the ball.",How to Make a String Pendant Lamp1," This DIY project is rewarding, but it is time consuming and messy. Clear a big, wide space and line your surfaces with a tarp or newspaper. Grab all your materials now and let's get started. You'll need:









An inflatable ball (beach, exercise, or balloon)
String (twine, hemp, yarn, etc.)
White glue
Corn starch
Warm water
Cooking spray
Disposable gloves (if you don't want to get in on the action yourself);
, Use something round (like a Tupperware lid) to guide your tracing. This will end up being the hole that you install the light bulb through (or change), so make sure it's big enough for your hand to easily fit through while holding the bulb.









You'll also be using this hole to take out the ball upon completion. About 6-7"" (15-17.5 cm) should be adequate.














, This should be a bunch of white glue, a handful or two of cornstarch, and some warm water; you nailed it when it has the consistency of thick cream. Use a wide-brimmed bowl or tray.









As an alternative, you can use wallpaper paste. It works just as well.

, If you can hang the ball at this juncture, great. If you can't, you have to make do. Be generous with the spray -- the ball should end up being so covered you would prefer not to touch it.









Petroleum jelly works here, too. That's just a bit more handsy. The same principles apply.

, Go about a yard or two at a time, squeezing off the excess with your thumb and forefinger. Wrap your string around the ball haphazardly, criss-crossing in whatever pattern (or non-pattern, really) you think looks good. One 220 foot (67.1 m) spool should suffice for an average-sized beach ball.









Don't cover the circle you made! That is a no-go zone. You need that open and string-free for attaching later.













If you are using a light-colored string, use as much string as you want. But know that if you are using a dark-colored string, you may want to use less so the light can shine through once in use.













Let it dry overnight. When you find it in the morning, it'll be rock-hard and nothing like you left it.














, Deflate it and take it out -- now you know why you bothered to lube it up in cooking spray or petroleum jelly. It's all worth it now.









If it's too big, stick your hand through the circular space with some scissors and cut it up into manageable pieces (if it is an exercise ball it will have sand in it, so be careful where you do it). Pull it through the circle opening (the same opening used to change the bulb) very carefully.

Cut a piece of wire.,
Attach the wire and assemble your lamp.",How to Make a String Pendant Lamp2," If you have an old lampshade lying around, see what makes up the skeleton of it -- a wire can easily be had from there. If not, got to your local hardware store.









You'll need a piece of wire much longer than the width of your opening. It must attach at both sides and the ends must wrap together.

, Take one end of the wire and twist it around the edge of the opening on your new lampshade. Then, take the middle, wrap it around the base of the lamp, and twist the other end back onto the ball. Tada!









If the hole you made in your ball is just too big, flip 'er over. Cut a small base into what used to be the top but is now the bottom, and repeat. Problem solved.

Have your hanging socket ready.,
Start making cuts.,
Attach your creation.,
Color it if you prefer.",How to Make a String Pendant Lamp3," Here's where all your options come in and it gets a bit confusing. If you're not keen on tackling this part, you can always hire an electrician. Also: make sure the fixture is turned off!









If you don't have a hanging socket already, you can make one. Or just buy one from IKEA -- they're pretty cheap. Making one is only advised if you have a handle on what you'll be doing. If you think you have it, you'll need:

3 plain canopy kits. That will serve to hold the cable in place and to mount it to the ceiling
1 outdoor-grade extension cord at least 1' longer than you will need
1 porcelain socket with metal cap
2+ twist on wire connectors
Wire stripper/snips



, You'll need a hole at the other end of your globe to initially place it onto the fixture. Make a few snips directly opposite the original hole, but nothing too big. If it's too large, the ball will fall right off!









To support the new hole you just made in your globe and to keep it from breaking under its weight, cut out a plastic ring to go around your bulb, at the top of the fixture. This can be from an old, cheap lampshade or a Tupperware container lid -- anything that can be cut into a ring and has a bit of strength to it, really.

, Place your dome around your bulb and slide in your plastic ring between the globe and bulb. If you don't like the look of the hanging wire, place a shower rod around it before installing your lampshade.









If one side of the ball is more aesthetically pleasing than the other, just rotate it! That's the beauty of the pendant lamp.

,









Simply remove the wire and bulb set. Grab a can of spray paint and add color.

Post-date the check if necessary.,
Fill in the “Pay to the Order Of” line.,
Include optional information on the “Memo” line.,
Sign the check.",How to Write a Check With Cents," The amount box is located on the right side of the check, below the “Date” line and to the right of the “Pay to the Order Of” line. It has a symbol to the left of it indicating the currency — $ or £, for example. In this box, write out the amount of the check you want to write using numbers.


Separate the dollar amount and the cent amount with a decimal point — 47.50, for example.

, You may write a check in which there are no cents to be paid — for example, 47 even dollars. In this, case, you still need to indicate that there are “zero” cents to be paid. You do this by continuing to include the decimal point, but following it with two zeros: 47.00

, In America, for example, this blank line ends with the word “dollars.” On this line, you will write out the amount to be paid in words, rather than numbers. The dollar amount is always written out as words, and the cent amount written as a fraction out of 100. This is because there are 100 cents in a dollar, so if the check amount includes 45 cents, it is 45/100 of a dollar. While this is the basic rule, there are a few different ways to format the actual content of the line.


Written dollar amount + “and” + fractional cent amount: forty-seven and 50/100.
Written dollar amount + “dollars and” + fractional cent amount: forty-seven dollars and 50/100.
Some people choose to draw a straight horizontal line after the fractional cent amount to fill out the line: forty-seven dollars and 50/100 —————. This prevents other people from adding to or changing the amount you write.

, and so on (one million, two billion, etc.) If you have a compound number like 47 (as opposed to 40), you should always place a hyphen between the two parts of the word when writing it out.


Correct: forty-seven
Incorrect: forty seven or fortyseven

, An amount for several hundred, thousand, or even million dollars should still be written out in words on the appropriate line. This might mean you have to write with very small script, so make sure you have enough room.


Correct: two million, five hundred fifty-two thousand, eight hundred forty-seven dollars and 00/100 ——.
Incorrect: 2,552,847 dollars and 00/100 ——————.

, In the top right-hand corner of the check, you’ll see a short line that says the word “Date.” On this line, enter the appropriate abbreviation for the date on which you’re writing the check.In the United States, the abbreviation follows the order of month/date/year: January 11, 2015 is written as 1/11/15.
However, in many other parts of the world, the month and date are switched to date/month/year: the same date would be written as 11/1/15.
In some Eastern Asian countries, the date might be formatted as year/month/date: 2015/1/11.
Note that using the wrong format can make a big difference — January to November. Be sure to use a format appropriate for the country in which you are banking.

, For different reasons, you may not want the check to be cashed immediately. For example, you might need to write a check to a friend today for an amount larger than your available funds. In that case, you can “post-date” the check, meaning you enter a date in the future so that the check cannot be cashed until that date. This can be helpful if you need to wait until payday before a check amount can be withdrawn.


Note that post-dating checks can be illegal if you manipulated the date with the intention of defrauding someone.However, if you post-date the check for legitimate reasons, the practice is perfectly legal.

, This line is right above the line where you filled in the textual amount of the check. Here, you will write the name of the person or company to whom you’re writing the check. Always use the full legal name of the person or company, as nicknames might cause problems when they try to deposit the check.For example, if your friend John Smith goes by the name “Buddy,” use the legal name rather than the nickname.


To be safe, always ask who a check should be made out to. The person who will deposit the check will be able to give you the proper legal name.

, The Memo line is at the bottom left-hand side of the check, and it can be left empty unless you have specific information you’d like to share there. Often, people use this line to note the reason for the check: “Babysitting,” “Groceries,” or “Happy Birthday!” This will help you remember what the check was for if you need to account for it at a later date.However, you can also use the memo line to provide the person receiving the check with information they might need to file and process it.


If you’re paying rent to a landlord with many renters, you might list your address in the memo to remind them which unit you rent.
If you’re paying a utility bill, you can include your customer account number on the memo line.
The memo line is optional, and can be left blank.

, The signature line is directly across from the memo line, at the bottom right-hand corner of the check. It’s very important that you provide your signature exactly as it looks on the signature card you provided the bank when you first opened your account.If you’ve changed your signature significantly since opening the account, you should let your bank know. Otherwise, the person trying to cash the check might run into problems cashing the check, or even be accused of trying to forge your signature.


Never sign a blank check. If you lose it, anyone could pick it up, then fill in their name and a large amount of money. If the check has your signature on it, they could steal a lot of money from you!

Remove the ashes and debris from the fire box.,
Open the screen and glass doors (if so equipped) as wide as possible, and place a large piece of cardboard or a drop cloth in the firebox.,
Have someone operate the damper as you watch to see that it closes and opens smoothly and fits securely in the brackets.,
Place a drop cloth or large piece of cardboard in the firebox with the edge taped up or propped at the front to protect the room from material dropping down from the top of the chimney.,
Climb a ladder to the roof of your home, and go to the location where the chimney projects up.,
Shine your flashlight down the flue and look for a dangerous buildup of creosote, a combustible brown or black by-product of wood that accumulates in chimney flues.

,
Using a stiff brush with a long handle attached, start at the top of the chimney brushing the sides, and work your way down.,
Fashion an extension tube for a shop vac using a length of PVC pipe so that it can be dropped down to remove the debris you have dislodged from the flue.,
Look at the place the chimney adjoins the roof, especially if it comes through the roof on three or four sides.,
Climb down the ladder and return to the fireplace.",How to Inspect a Fireplace Chimney," Brush the sides and bottom with a stiff broom or chimney brush. Vacuum out the loosened ashes and if possible remove the andirons.;
, Lay on your back and slide into the box as far as you need to so that you can shine a flashlight up the flue. You are looking for cracks in masonry, or burn out holes in a metal ""insert"" type box, as well as the condition of the damper.

, You may want to wear safety glasses here, as the damper may be coated with creosote and ash buildup, which can drop in your eyes. When you are finished checking the damper, be sure it is in the closed position.

, Close the screen and glass doors if so equipped.

, If it has a rain cover or bird screen, you will need to remove this. Before removing it, be sure to have flashing material on hand to seal it back when you reattach it after you finish.

,, Unless you buy or rent a chimney brush, you probably will not be able to completely clean the inside of the chimney, but should be able to dislodge enough of the buildup to let it operate safely.

, Most chimneys have a smoke shelf and damper door which prevent this material from dropping all the way to the fire box floor. After cleaning, use the flashlight to examine the flue for cracks and gaps. Most chimneys are constructed with either a metal pipe flue or a clay chimney liner that comes in 2 foot (0.6 m) sections. If you are satisfied there are no visible cracks, replace the chimney cap if it is so equipped, using the sealant for the flashing removed earlier.

, There will be a flashing here to waterproof the roof system, and often it will become corroded or collect debris which can cause roof leaks, and now is a good time to take a look.

, Remove the drop cloth or protective barrier you installed to prevent the soot and ash brushed from the upper flue from being scattered in your room. You should be ready to replace your andirons and build a pleasant warm fire to enjoy.

Find suitable plastic spoons.,
Disassemble the spoons.,
Place all of the removed spoon heads in a pile or in a bowl.,
Prepare the light shade or lampshade.,
Determine the pattern you'd like for the light shade or lampshade.,
Hot glue the spoons to the shade.,
Make a circlet of spoons for the bottle neck area.,
Insert the electrical elements through the bottle neck as required.,
Hang the light shade up or assemble over a lamp base.",How to Make a Light Shade With Plastic Spoons," Maybe you have a collection of plastic spoons already cluttering up the junk drawer––if so, they might be just the ticket. Otherwise, plastic spoons can be purchased from dollar stores, supermarkets and stores stocking outdoor barbecue/catering gear. It is recommended that you stick to plain white for the first project, as white tends to work with almost any décor and can be shifted around the house if needed. If you have your heart set on a particular color though, be sure that all the spoons match in hue.


Choose spoons all in the same size unless you're absolutely clear how to interweave different sizes of spoons. If you do use different sizes, plan a pattern in advance to avoid the end result looking haphazard.;
, For this project, you'll only want to use the actual spoon head or scoop, while discarding the handle. To neatly remove the spoon head from the handle, place the spoon on a flat surface suitable for cutting into (self-heal craft mats are an ideal surface). Using the Exacto knife to cleanly dislodge the spoon handle from the spoon. Slide the knife neatly across the base of the handle, aiming for an even removal. It may take a few goes before you develop a rhythm that works––just discard any spoons that break unevenly.








, Consider using a large container to keep the spoon heads in one place for quick access. And don’t throw away the handles––you may decide that you'd like to use them to garnish or enhance the shade or lamp stand later.








, What shade will you use? There are two basic options, the first being an existing shade in need of updating, the second being a repurposed plastic bottle turned into a shade. In this article, the plastic bottle version is prepared as follows:









Clean out and dry a plastic bottle of a size suitable to form a light shade. Generally a larger plastic bottle is more suitable (see next). Keep the lid on the bottle for the moment.
Using the Exacto knife, cut out the base of the plastic bottle. This is the part of the shade that will hang downward. Insert the globe into the bottle to ensure that it fits without touching the sides anywhere. If it doesn't fit, find a larger plastic bottle.
If you choose to use an existing light shade or lampshade instead, ensure that it is clean. A clean surface is important for good adhesion of the spoons. You can simply wipe over the shade with a damp cloth but if you need to remove stains, mild dish soap and warm water should do the trick. Allow to dry completely before proceeding.

, Using the spoon heads, you can aim for a neat interlocking, shell-like pattern that allows the spoons to rest evenly a little over each other or you could try having the spoon heads face outward. For best results, lay out the spoons first to ensure you like the pattern, then trial a temporary pattern on the shade itself using tape or poster tack to hold the pieces in place. Don't be afraid to try different patterns and directions to create interesting effects––this trial will reassure you that the pattern looks good. For the trial:









Lay the first layer or row of spoons around the bottom of the bottle. Then pile the next spoon (tip first) over the first layer of the previously affixed spoon heads.
Use a small amount of tape or poster tack to temporarily adhere each spoon to the shade. Add enough spoon heads until you're satisfied that you have a suitable pattern ready to go.

, Once you're happy with the pattern you've tested, fire up the hot glue gun. Work evenly around the plastic bottle (or existing shade) to adhere the spoon heads:









Use a clean dab of glue on the top of the spoon (closest to the handle). Hold firmly against the bottle shade for a few seconds until you are confident the spoon has adhered. On the other hand, if you're gluing the spoons to face outward, add the glue to the back of the spoon at the point where it will attach to the bottle.
Continue working around the entire bottle until it is completely covered and you cannot see anything underneath the spoon heads. They should all sit around the bottle evenly. It's important to make adjustments as you go because once the glue has dried, the spoon heads are there for good.
At this stage, should you wish to bedazzle the light shade, you can do so by adding costume gems, rhinestones, etc. in a neat pattern on the spoons. It's recommended that you don't overdo this!

, To hide the bottle neck area where the electrical cord will be placed, make a circlet of spoons around the neck. This means placing glue into the middle inside of each spoon and attaching the next one until a neat circle has formed. You don't have to make this circle as tight as the bottle's neck itself; it just has to hide the bottle neck from anyone viewing the lamp from beneath.









If you're using an existing shade, the circlet may or may not be necessary. Judge it by whatever shape the shade is.

, It might be helpful to keep the bottle lid and pierce a hole through it to hold the electrical cord neatly in place. Whether or not this is a useful aspect will depend on the size of the bottle neck, the size of the cord, etc. Judge it by the sizes and need for steadiness of your particular materials.








, Switch on the light and enjoy the ambiance created as the light shines through the spoons.

Determine whether the chimney needs to be cleaned.,
Check the chimney for animals.,
Measure your chimney flue.,
Buy chimney cleaning supplies.,
Dress in appropriate clothing.,
Prepare your house for the cleaning.,
Remove the damper from the chimney flue.",How to Clean Chimneys1," Chimneys should be cleaned at least once a year, and more often if you use your fireplace frequently.


Take a flashlight and peer inside the chimney flute. Use a pencil or plastic knife to scrape off a bit of the creosote that has accumulated on the side of the chimney. If it's 1/8-inch thick or thicker, it's time for a cleaning.
If you only clean your chimney once a year, do it in the fall, before the burning season begins. Otherwise, you risk sparking a chimney fire the first time you light up your fireplace in the winter.;
, If it has been awhile since the last time you used your chimney, check for critters before you begin cleaning. Birds, squirrels and raccoons like to nest there, especially in the cooler months. Shine a flashlight up the chimney from the fireplace, and if you find an animal, take steps to have it removed.

, To clean your chimney, you'll have to use properly-sized tools. Measure the sides of your chimney from the bottom, through the fireplace. You could also climb up a ladder and measure it from the top.


Determine the size and shape of the flue. It will be either square or round, 6"" or 8.""
Determine the height of the chimney. If you're guessing, it's better to overestimate, so you have more than enough extra rope or piping to make sure the chimney brush can reach the entire length of the chimney.

, Go to the hardware store and buy the following items in preparation for cleaning the chimney:


A chimney brush, either wire or plastic. Use your chimney's measurements to buy the right size.
Chimney brush extension pipes, to help you clean the whole length of the chimney. Alternatively, you could buy a weighted rope designed to be used with the chimney brush, or a rope pulley system.
A smaller stiff wire brush.
A plastic tarp or drop cloth for use inside your house.
A ladder tall enough to reach your roof, if you plan to clean your chimney from the top down.
A broom and dustpan.
A dust mask and goggles.

, Wear old clothes that you don't mind getting messy with soot. Cover your hair with a bandanna. You may want to wear work gloves to protect your hands. Use a dust mask and goggles to prevent soot from getting in your mouth and eyes.

, Drape the drop cloth or tarp around your fireplace, extending it out into your living room several feet. Use sheets or tarps to cover furniture with light fabric. Roll back your expensive rugs.

, Locate the damper handle inside your chimney, and use the small wire brush to clean it off. Detach it from the chimney and set it aside on the drop cloth, so it won't obstruct the chimney brush as you proceed with cleaning the chimney.

Inspect the chimney.,
Determine the correct diameter of the liner.,
Measure the length from the top of the chimney crown to the area where the bottom termination should stop.,
Purchase a stainless steel flexible chimney liner from your local hardware supplier.,
Remove the liner from the packaging, and straighten it on a flat surface.,
Determine whether to use an insulation blanket or a pour-in insulation.,
If using the blanket liner, measure the circumference of the bottom termination connector, and multiply the number by 3.14.,
Cut the blanket insulation from your chimney liner installation kit to the calculated measurement.

,
Lay the cut insulation flat on the ground with the foil-side down.,
Glue the wrap to the liner with adhesive spray as you go.,
Secure the seam with 1 long, unbroken piece of foil tape to complete the insulating layer.

,
Unroll the wire mesh from the installation kit, and cover the entire insulated liner, including the bottom connector.

,
Attach hose clamps to 1 end of the liner to hold the mesh in place.,
Check the instructions on the liner kit.,
Attach the rope found in your installation kit to the pulling cone or directly to the bottom connector, whichever applies to your specific kit.

,
Climb to the roof, and position yourself near the chimney.,
Throw the pulling rope down the chimney for the second person to guide down the liner.

,
Position the bottom connector at the rooftop opening of the chimney, and make sure it is centered to prevent damage to either the chimney or liner.,
Complete the installation when the bottom connector has reached the appropriate position for your chimney height.,
Instruct the second person to hold the bottom connector into place.,
Secure the quick connect clamp tightly around the liner.,
Fit the cap onto the collar of the top plate, and use your monkey wrench to tighten the hose clamp band on to the top plate collar.,
Climb down from the roof, and return to the fireplace entrance or chimney bottom.

,
Attach the appliance connector to the liner and the bottom termination point.

,
Locate the tee snout on the liner bottom.,
Fasten together the tee snout and tee body using the pre-attached metal, and wrap it around the backside of the tee body.,
Connect the tee snout to your heating appliance.",How to Install a Chimney Liner," Use a light source on a string (or an inspection camera if you have one)to look for bends, or restrictions that could interfere with pulling the liner through.;
, If for a wood stove/insert, consult the owners manual for proper sizing. For an open fireplace, look for a chart or calculator online.

, To ensure you have enough liner, add an additional 12 inches (30.5 cm).

, The liner should come with a kit that contains all the pieces needed.

, Hook up the bottom connector to the bottom of the liner. Fasten a hose clamp to the connection with a wrench. Don't fasten it too tightly.

, If there is more than 2"" clearance between the liner and chimney wall on all sides, the blanket liner is best.

, Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to be sure you have enough. The overlap can be trimmed later if necessary.

,, Center the liner on top, and wrap it with the installation. As you pull the chimney liner insulation closed, leave a minimum of 1 inch (2.5 cm) overlap so that you can secure it with tape.

, In 12 inch (30.5 cm) increments, seal the seam with foil tape. Repeat this process until you have completely covered the liner with insulation.

,,, From the other end, pull the mesh taut over the liner. Fasten the remaining host clamps on that end, and make sure to keep the wire meshing tight. Use your tin snips to remove any mesh that overhangs the liner.

, Specific instructions on how to pull the liner through the chimney may vary slightly from the guidance here. When in doubt, always follow the manufacturer's instructions. The most difficult point is typically the damper in the top of the fireplace.

,, Have a second person feed you the liner from ground level, and return to the bottom of the chimney to assist you in the installation process.

,, Slowly guide the liner downward. The second person should aid in this process by gently pulling the rope to help the liner's descent.

, If necessary, cut the top of the liner with your tin snips to equal 4 inches (10.2 cm) higher than the chimney crown.

, Seal the chimney crown with silicone caulking. Place the chimney's top plate over the installed liner, and press it firmly into the caulk to seal it.

, Use the pre-drilled holes on the top plate to screw the connection together with 4 tap con screws.

, Make sure the connection is secure to complete the top termination.

,,, Use your tin snips to cut a hole in the insulation and meshing where the tee snout will connect to the tee body.

, Cover the connection with the leftover liner insulation.

, Complete the connection by attaching it to the heating appliance.

Find a suitable lampshade to decorate.,
Decide how you want the lampshade to look like in the end.,
Consider priming your lampshade.,
Combine different methods for a fancier lamp.",How to Decorate a Lampshade1," Some lampshades are easier to work with than others. When choosing a lampshade, consider the following:

Glue and paint sticks better to lampshades that are made fabric or paper than lampshades that are made out of plastic or glass.
Cone, box, or tube-shaped lampshades are easier to work with than domed or asymmetric lampshades.
Lampshades that have a smooth surface are going to give you more freedom than ones that already have a textured surface (such as being covered in beads, glitter, trim, or sequins).;
, Do you want to decorate the entire lampshade? Or do you just want to add a trim to the top and bottom? Get out a piece of paper and sketch out a few designs.

If you are having trouble coming up with a design, look at pictures of lampshades online or in a catalogue.
Consider basing your lampshade off of a certain theme, such as Asian, Mexican, tribal, nature, or holiday.

, If your have a dark colored lampshade and want to cover it with a light colored paper of fabric, some of that dark color might show through. This might not give you the result you want. To get a better finish in the end, paint your entire lampshade with a white primer. You can use spray paint, a foam roller, or a paintbrush. This will help the lighter colors on your paper or fabric show up better., For example, you can paint or cover your entire lamp with fabric first. Then, you can add a trim to it to give it a final touch."

Fill out the check correctly.,
Consider sending a certified check.,
Understand the conversion rate.",How to Write a Check on a US Bank to a Canadian Payee1," This may seem like a no-brainer, but when you're trying to send a check abroad, even the smallest error in date, amount, or payee can cause complications. Follow all of the standards correctly to make sure no unforeseen circumstances prevent the check from being cashed.


There aren't any notes or differences you'll need to make for the check to be cashed and accepted by a standard Canadian bank.;
, Although your personal check will work just fine, a certified check can be issued by your bank. These are as good as cash and directly drafted and backed by the bank. These are useful when the person receiving the money wants a guarantee that the money is covered by a person they are not entirely familiar with. This may cost a small fee, but generally if you have an account at the bank, it should not cost any processing fee but each bank can differ., Every USD is worth approximately 1.31 Canadian dollars, but this rate can fluctuate. For example, $20 USD would be $26.18 CAD. Therefore, if the person or organization you're writing the check to is expecting a certain amount in Canadian dollars, make sure the amount is correct.


Note the currency you're using. The currency of the check is based on the bank that it is drawn from. If the funds are drawn from a U.S. bank, the funds are denoted in U.S. dollars (USD). If the funds are drawn from a Canadian bank, they are based in Canadian dollars (CAD).

Set up the ladder and climb to the roof.,
Assemble the brush and one section of pipe.,
Dissemble the brush and extensions, or detach the rope.,
Clean the bottom of the chimney.",How to Clean Chimneys2," Assuming you've ascertained that your roof is safe to stand on, and that you're comfortable doing so, set up your ladder right next to the house. Fill a satchel with the chimney brush and extensions, sling it over your shoulder, and climb the ladder.


If you feel any trepidation at the thought of climbing a ladder or standing on your roof, clean your chimney from the bottom instead, using the method outlined below.
If you're unsure about the quality of your roof, or if your roof is slanted and you're not sure you'll be able to keep your balance, use the other method.

, Attach the first piece of pipe to the brush. Insert the brush into the chimney. Using up and down motions, begin to scrub the flue clean. Add another section of pipe to enable you to extend the brush further down the chimney. Continue in this fashion until you've cleaned the length of the flue.


If you are using the rope and weight method, attach the weighted rope to the brush. Hold the end of the rope and lower the brush into the chimney. Lift it up and down in a scrubbing motion along the entire length of the flue.

, Place the supplies in your satchel and climb back down the ladder.

, Use the small wire brush to clean the bottom of the flue that you may have missed with the brush.

Clean the chimney from the bottom up.,
Use a pulley system with a partner.",How to Clean Chimneys3,"


Assemble the brush and one section of pipe.
Attach the first piece of pipe to the brush.
Insert the brush into the chimney through the fireplace. Using up and down motions, begin to scrub the flue clean.
Add another section of pipe to enable you to extend the brush further up the chimney. #*Continue in this fashion until you've cleaned the length of the flue.

,


Buy a pulley rope system to be used with your chimney brush. Two ropes are attached to the brush, one on the top and one on the bottom, and the brush is operated from both the roof and the fireplace.
Assemble the pulley system with the brush. Have one person take it up a ladder to the roof.
The person on the roof should hold one side of the rope, and drop the other side, with the brush in the middle, through the flue to the other person waiting below.
Working together, use the ropes to pull the brush up and down, scrubbing the entire chimney flue.

"

Clean the flue's entrance.,
Use the brush and dustpan to clean up the debris from the fireplace.,
Use the brush and dustpan to sweep up debris from the tarp or drop cloth.,
Dispose of the soot and creosote in accordance with your local laws.",How to Clean Chimneys4," At the very bottom of the chimney, often located in the basement, you should find a small door going into the area under the flue. The creosote and soot will have collected there. Use a small spade to shovel it into a bucket. Reattach the damper handle.

, Empty it into the waste bucket.

, Empty it into the waste bucket.

, Since creosote is a flammable substance, it should not be thrown in the trash.

"
"
Consider covering your lampshade with objects you have laying around the house.,
Create your own artwork using a permanent marker or a fabric pen.,
Add a trim to the top or bottom of the lampshade.,
Cover the inside of your lampshade with glitter.,
Spray paint the inside of your lampshade gold to give it a warm glow.,
Glue fake flowers all over the lamp for a puffy, tufted look.,
Glue doilies all over the lampshade.",How to Decorate a Lampshade2," You don't have to do all of the steps in this method. Choose the one you like best.

, You can draw simple designs like spirals or flowers. You can even write down the words to your favorite poem, song, or book passage., You can use ribbon, rickrack, braided trim, beaded trim, feather boas, bridal lace, or even a sequin trim. Use fabric glue or hot glue to attach the trim to your lampshade, and cut the excess off.


Fabric glue and hot glue set quickly. It might be a good idea to apply the glue only an inch (2.54 centimeters) at a time.
If you have a trim with beads dangling from a ribbon, consider gluing the ribbon to the inside of the lampshade. This way, you won't see the stitching, and the dangling beads will be sticking out from underneath the lampshade.

, The glitter will reflect the light and make it seem brighter. Coat the inside of your lampshade using a white, liquid glue. Dump some glitter onto the glue and roll the lampshade around to spread the glitter. Set the lampshade right-side-up and let the glue dry. If you are worried about the glitter shedding, brush on some clear, glossy Mod Podge, or spray it using a clear, glossy, acrylic sealer.

You must use a glossy Mod Podge or acrylic sealer. If you use matte, the glitter won't sparkle.
You can use chunky glitter or fine, scrapbooking glitter. You can find both in an arts and crafts shop.

, Shake the can until you can't hear it rattle anymore. Then, spray the inside of the lamp using light, even strokes. Be sure to overlap each stroke by a little bit to prevent any gaps. If you need to apply a second layer, wait for the first one to dry first., Put a drop of hot glue on the back of the flower, and press it against the top of the lamp shade. Glue the second flower right next to the first one, so that the petals are touching. Keep gluing flowers until the entire lampshade is covered and no fabric is showing.If you are using flowers that come on a stem, pull them off the stem first. They should just pop off. If they don't, snip the flowers off as close to the base as you can using wire cutters., Choose several tatted or crocheted doilies. They can be all the same size and color, or they can be different ones. Spray the back of a doily with spray adhesive, then press it onto the lampshade. Add as many doilies as you want.

Consider overlapping the doilies by a little.

Consider priming your lampshade.,
Tape off any areas you don't want painted.,
Consider drawing some designs onto your lampshade using a hot glue gun.,
Pour some paint onto a paper plate or paint palette.,
Start applying a thin layer of paint and let it dry.,
Apply a second coat of paint once the first one has dried.,
Remove any tape and allow the paint to dry before using it.",How to Decorate a Lampshade3," If your lampshade is a very dark color and you want to paint it a lighter color, you might want to prime it first. This is because many lighter colored paints are translucent and the darker color may show through. You can prime your lampshade by painting it with a white paint primer. You can use a paintbrush or a foam roller to apply the paint. You can also use a white primer spray paint.

Be sure to let the primer dry before you move on to the next step.

, Use painters tape or masking tape to do this., This will create a raised effect on the surface of your lamp after you paint it. You can make little dots, squiggles, or swirls. You can draw spirals, vines, leaves, or even birds., The best type of paint to use is fabric paint or acrylic paint. If the paint is very thick, you might end up with some visible brushstrokes. You can remedy this by mixing a few drops of water into the paint., Don't worry if some of the original color of the lamp shows through. You will be painting on another layer or two. It is better to apply paint using many thin layers rather than one thick layer. This will help prevent brushstrokes in the finished piece., You will notice that the original color is disappearing. If necessary, apply a third layer., Most paints will dry to touch within 20 minutes, but this does not mean that the paint is fully dry or cured. Some paints will require 2 to 4 hours before they are fully dry. Because each brand of paint is different refer to the label for exact drying times."
"
Consider painting your lampshade a solid color first.,
Choose your stencil.,
Place your stencil against the lampshade and tape it in place, if necessary.,
Pour some paint out onto a paper plate or palette.,
Dab the paint onto the stencil.,
Allow the paint to dry before applying the second layer, if necessary.,
Pull the stencil off while the paint is still wet.Use both hands to pull the stencil off upwards so that you do not smudge the wet paint.,
Allow the paint to dry before applying the stencil to another area.If you want to apply more designs to your lampshade, then wait until the paint is dry to the touch; this will usually take about 20 minutes for most brand of paint.,
Touch the designs up using a thin brush, if necessary.,
Let the lampshade dry completely before using it.",How to Decorate a Lampshade4," You don't have to do this, but it can give your lampshade a while new look. For example, you can paint your lampshade turquoise and stencil some white designs onto it. You could also paint your lampshade white, and stencil some gold designs onto it., Do you want a pattern that covers the lamp completely? Or do you want to stencil on a small design (such as a flower or bird) here and there?, Some stencils have an adhesive back, so they should stick to your lampshade on their own. Other stencils are not adhesive and will move around. To keep that from happening, place your stencil where you want it, then secure it with a piece of painters tap or masking tape on each side of the stencil., The best types of paint to use are fabric paints or acrylic paints., Use a foam brush or a stencil paintbrush, and dab the paint on using a light, tapping motion. Do not apply too much paint at once, or the paint may drip under the stencil. Don't worry if the lampshade's color shows through the stencil; you can always apply a second layer., Sometimes, one layer of paint will give you enough covered. Other times, however, a single layer is not enough. If you still see some of the original color peaking through, apply a second layer, and if necessary, a third.,, Try not to cover up a previously-painted area with your stencil. This might cause the paint to smear if it is not fully dry., Sometimes, the paint does not reach the edges of the design, and you don't notice this until is it too late. If there are any bare patches in your design, take out a thin paintbrush and some extra paint. Carefully fill in those patches using the thin paintbrush., Refer to the label on your paint bottle for specific drying times. Some paints are fully dry and cured in as little as 20 minutes, while others require 2 to 4 hours. Some need more time than that before you can use them without worrying about ruining the finish."

Know what fees might be involved.,
Understand hold and wait periods to cash and send foreign transactions.,
Know how conversion rates will affect your payment.",How to Write a Check on a US Bank to a Canadian Payee2," Sometimes your bank may charge you a percentage, or flat fee per foreign transaction. These fees can come from your bank or the bank cashing the check, depending on their individual policies. This could make it so you end up paying considerably more than you had originally intended, if there is a large tacked on to the final amount.Sometimes if your bank charges a fee, you can get around it by using special accounts or services tailored for foreign transactions. Make sure you know what options are available before writing the check. If you are writing many checks and are hit with fees, sometimes as much as $40 dollars per check, this can really affect your bottom line. You will also want to know whether the receiver will have to pay a fee so you can accommodate for this in your transaction.

, Every bank will have their own regulations, but there can be a holding period before the funds are released, sometimes as much as 28 days. If you are making a time-sensitive payment, make sure you know the holding period of both the Canadian recipient, and your own bank. If both banks have a waiting period, these will need to be taken into account. If you are in a time-sensitive situation, you may want to look into other methods like wiring the money, credit cards, or online services like PayPal.

, Sometimes you may think you're paying a certain amount to the payee, but the conversion rate will make the payment too much or not enough. Make sure you understand how the cross border payment will affect the amount using a calculator that is current on conversion rates.

Use a money order.,
Consider a wiring service to send money across the border.,
Use PayPal or electronic money transfers.",How to Write a Check on a US Bank to a Canadian Payee3," An electronic check simplifies the process by taking away the need for any sort of paper check. E-checks pass through an Automatic Clearing House (ACH) and will grant a Canadian merchant the ability to accept funds from an American consumer with a valid checking account.Different companies will have their own ACH that the funds pass through. Use one with experience sending money from the U.S. to Canada, like DebitWay or Sage.

, Money orders are as good as cash. They may charge a nominal fee, but will have no issue being written or cashed on either side, since it is written on a subsidiary of the bank. This too may cost a fee, but if you weigh against a check cashing fee, it may save you money., You can wire money directly into their bank account if you have the proper information. You can also use a wiring service, like Western Union. Western Union is a great and common way to send money to Canada. They will charge a fee, it is fast and can be picked up by the recipient at any Western Union location., PayPal is an easy way to send money all over the world. They will charge a nominal fee if it is a business transaction. They will also have a conversion option so you can clearly see how much money is being exchanged. PayPal can take a few days to reach their bank account, so you'll want to communicate accordingly.

Look in your local PennySaver or YellowBook.,
Look up each contractor on the Internet, and see if they have reviews.,
Call the contractor during business hours.,
Make an appointment for the estimate.,
At you appointment, note several things: was the contractor on time, and if he was going to be late, did he/she call?,
Thank the contractor, and inform him that either you'd like to think about it, or you'd like him to do the job.,

If you have a computer, you can Google keywords such as ""chimney repair"" and insert your zip code to find a local contractor.;
, Sometimes these reviews can be found on YellowBook online (YB) or Yelp, Yahoo, or Google. Read the reviews, and choose one or two that have the best reviews. Look for quick worker, good prices, quality workmanship.

, Speak to the contractor or his secretary, and ask questions, such as, is the estimate free? Can he do the work on the spot? Will he allow me to have some time to think about it? Will he provide me an estimate with a price that is firm? Describe your problem in detail. Problems with chimneys range from needing a simple cleaning to requiring extensive masonry work. You may need a cap, crown repair, re-pointing (sealing the mortar) or even a liner. be specific.

, Be sure that you will be home during the appointment. It helps if anyone who would make decisions about these repairs be home to discuss estimates with the contractor.

, Is the contractor's truck clean and well organised? Did the contractor go up on the roof, and did he examine the whole chimney? Did he provide you with a free estimate quickly, and explain what he wrote on it? Did he pressure you to do the job immediately?

, Confirm payment methods, and either say goodbye, or sign the paperwork. Be sure that the estimate has the correct information on it, such as the work to be done, any guarantees of materials and labor costs, and a clause offering you 3 days to think about it even if you do sign the contract. If it doesn't request clarification on the paperwork before signing.

, Don't interfere, but make sure that you're seeing him prep and actually do the work - for a cement repair, that he's mixing cement, for a cap repair, that he's using a brand new cap, for a chimney cleaning - that it takes 20 minutes or over. Once the work is down, request pictures of it (if you can't see it yourself) and have the contractor show you what was done before paying him. If you haven't decided, it's time to call the second contractor on your list.

, Googling your problem will help you to gain valuable information on your specific needs.

, Write the name of the person or company you're sending the check to next to the line that says ""Pay to the Order of."" If it's a company and you're not sure exactly what it's called, make sure you get that information right before you write the check. You can also just pay the check to ""Cash,"" but be careful, because that means that anyone can cash it.

If it's to an individual, include both their first and last names. If they are a 'Jr.' or a 'Sr.' you should include this as well.
If the check is going to an organization, write out its full name. Do not use acronyms unless explicitly given permission.

, Write the exact amount, using dollars and cents. If the check is for twenty dollars, write ""20.00.""
, Make sure you also express the amount of cents if there are cents, or write ""even"" at the end of the amount so that another person doesn't add more money to the amount.

Some banks will accept a current address hand-written onto a check with an old address, but contact your bank first to make sure this is acceptable.;
, If you have an online banking portal, log in to make sure you have the necessary funds in your account before you write and hand over the check. If you don’t have online access to your account information, stop by the bank or an ATM and check your balance that way.


Failing to verify funds before writing a check has serious consequences. First of all, your payees won’t get the money you intended for them. Second, your bank and the payees’ bank will charge you an insufficient funds fee for bouncing the check. Such fees can be high, so it’s always worth it to double-check your account before committing yourself., Not only is colored ink harder to read, but it can also nullify the check or trigger unwanted safety measures like fraud alerts.Some ball point pens deliver ink in such a way that it smudges easily, which can obscure important information on the check and, if it smudges to the point of illegibility, even cause the check to get rejected. You can avoid unwanted smudging by making sure that you select a pen and ink that doesn’t bleed easily.
Never use a pencil to write a check. It can be easily altered to reflect an amount or payee which is different from your original intention., Check the spelling of your payees’ names and make sure you know the proper amount to assign to the check.


While most financial institutions will accept and cash checks if a payee’s name is misspelled, you shouldn’t bank on this likelihood.Avoid any potential delays or confusion by double-checking your payees’ information beforehand.

, In the date field on the check, write today’s date. This is important because it dictates how long the payee will have to deposit or cash the check.


Most banks will refuse to cash or deposit a check that is more than six months old, so make sure your payees know to use the check as soon as possible., This determines whether you’ll separate the names using “and” or “or” on the “Payable To” line.


Use “and” if you want both individuals to sign the check. Alternately, use a plus sign or comma in place of “and.”Choosing this option means that neither party can do anything with the check unless they have express consent and cooperation from the other payee, so it’s a good idea to use this option if you aren’t very familiar with the payees’ relationship or whether or not they have a joint account.Use “or” if you want only one of the parties to endorse the check. This means that either payee can cash or deposit the check with only their own endorsement. This is a good option if you know your payees very well and can be sure neither party would use the check without the other’s knowledge. In this case, it makes the process more convenient for the payees, since either of them can deposit or cash the check at any time.Be aware that, even if you decide to use “or” to link the payees’ names, the bank might use their discretion to require both parties to sign in any case. This policy varies from bank to bank and is designed to protect both bank and customer from fraudulent activity., Separate the two names with either “and” or “or,"" depending on what you decided regarding how many payees should have to endorse the check.


For example, if paying two individuals with different last names, write “John Doe and/or Jane Smith.”Find out if the two payees have the same surname. If so, you won’t need to repeat the last name on the “Payable To” line. For example, if paying a married couple, address the couple as “Mr. and Mrs. John Doe” instead of “Jane Doe and John Doe.” If the couple is married but keeping distinct last names, or if the two payees are linked by business purposes, you will need to enter both their full names.

, While it used to be customary to write checks in cursive, modern practice permits either cursive or block letters.The most important thing is legibility: use whichever writing form that you do best.

, This includes the numerical dollar amount, written dollar amount, and your own signature., Write down the number of the check you’ve just written, as well as its amount and the payees in your paper register or online service such as QuickBooks. This will allow you to keep track of your expenditures and balance your checkbook even if the payee hasn’t cashed or deposited the check yet.If you write a lot of checks, you should keep a memo or other notation system which describes the purpose or purchase of each check.

Choose your material.,
Choose an appropriate lampshade.,
Cut your material into small squares.,
Cover a small patch of the lampshade with Mod Podge.,
Press the first square down onto the Mod Podge and smooth it out.,
Keep applying the squares until the entire lamp is covered.,
Allow the lampshade to dry.,
Seal the lampshade to protect your work.,
Let the lampshade dry entirely before you use it.",How to Decorate a Lampshade5," For this project, you will be gluing bits of paper, fabric, or tissue paper to create a patchwork or paper mache effect. Tissue paper will give you a translucent effect, whereas paper will give you the most opaque one.


You can use scrapbooking paper, map pieces, or pages torn from an old book.If you want the text appearance that book pages can give you, but don't want to tear up any books, then consider using newspaper instead.

, Almost any shape will work for this method. You might want to use a lighter colored lampshade, however, especially if you plan on covering it with tissue paper. Because tissue paper (and certain types of fabric) is so thin, the original color of the lampshade will show through. A lighter color, such as ivory or white won't make much of a difference, but a darker color, such as black, burgundy, or navy, will. You might not even see the colors of your tissue paper.

If you can't find a light colored lampshade, you could paint your current lampshade white. Keep in mind, however, that the light may not pass through the lampshade as well anymore. You'll end up with a softer glow.

, Try to keep the squares proportionate to the lampshade itself. For a very small lampshade, try cutting the squares 1 by 1 inch (2.54 by 2.54 centimeters). For a larger lampshade, try 3 by 3 inches (7.62 by 7.62 centimeters)., The patch should be a little bit bigger than the size of your square. Use a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply the Mod Podge. You will be working in small patches so that the Mod Podge does not dry out.

If you do not have any Mod Podge, you can make your own by mixing 1 part white school glue with 1 part water.

, You can smooth it out using your fingers. If you don't like getting messy, you can also use the paintbrush or foam brush you were using earlier., You can line them up side by side to create a quilt-like effect. You can also apply them at different angles to create a patchwork or paper mache effect. Whatever design you decide on, try to overlap each square by a little; this will help prevent any gaps from showing up in the finished piece.

Be sure to cover both the top and bottom rim of your lampshade. Do this by folding the excess paper or fabric over the top/bottom of the lampshade, and pressing it against the inside. This will give you a clean, finished-looking edge.

, This can take anywhere from a few hours to a day, depending on how dry or humid it is., You can do this by brushing more Mod Podge over the lampshade using a foam brush or a paintbrush. You can also spray the entire lampshade using a clear, acrylic sealer. This will help protect your work, and prevent it from peeling. If necessary, wait for the first coat to dry before applying a second one., This can take anywhere between a few hours to a whole day. It depends on how much Mod Podge you used, and how dry or humid it is."

This method will not work on this sort of lampshade. Instead, click here to learn how to cover your beveled lampshade., The best type of fabric to use would be something thin and lightweight so that the light can pass through it. If the fabric is too heavy, the light won't shine through, and will only come out the top and/or bottom of your lampshade.

Lightweight fabrics include cotton and silk. Heavy fabrics include satin, brocade, velvet, and canvas.
You can also use paper for this as well.

, If your lampshade is a very dark color and you are planning on using a lighter color of fabric, you might want to paint the lampshade white first. You can apply white acrylic primmer with a paintbrush or a foam brush. You can also spray the entire lampshade using a white primer spray paint., The paper should be taller than the lampshade, and wide enough for the lampshade to roll across it. You will be using this to make your template., If the lamp is wider at one end, place the lamp at a slight angle. If the lampshade is a perfect cylinder, then place it parallel to the edge of the paper., Stop when you reach the seam again., Use a ruler to make the lines even. If your lampshade is wider at one of the ends, you will end up with something that looks like an arch. If your lampshade is the same width at the top and bottom, you will end up with something that looks like a rectangle., It does not matter which side of the fabric you are pinning it to. What you do want to keep in mind, however, is the pattern and grain of the fabric.

The fabric must be smooth. If there are any wrinkles in it, you must iron them out.

, You need this extra space, because you will be folding it over into the lampshade., You can use regular fabric scissors or pinking shears., Use straight, even strokes. Try to overlap each stroke by a little to prevent any gaps., Make sure that one of the cut straight edges is lining up with the seam of the lampshade. There should be ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of extra fabric above and below the lampshade. You need this extra fabric because you will be folding it over later on., Keep rolling until you have 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of fabric left over., Fold the edge in by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Press it down onto the lampshade. It should overlap the raw edge by a little., Place a line of glue inside the lampshade, just beneath the wire rim. Carefully fold the top and bottom seam over the edge of the lampshade, and onto the inside. Run your finger along the fabric to seal it.

You may notice that your lampshade has metal bars either on the top or bottom. You fabric will lay across those bars instead of laying smoothly across the lampshade. To prevent this from happening, take your scissors and cut a slit into the seam. Press the fabric down to either side of the metal bar., You can also use hem tape. Try to use a color that matches your fabric color, or the inside of the lampshade. Place a line of glue all the way around inside the lampshade, right on top of the fabric hem. Press the ribbon or hem tape onto the fabric. If you come across a metal bar, then try to slide the ribbon under the bar, instead of over it."

Under the law, the bank can still do this if the stop payment order was not received in time, or if you didn't provide full and correct information about the check.For example, suppose you wrote a check to a company called ""Jerry's Jams and Jellies, LLC,"" and that's the name you put on your stop-payment order. However, you actually wrote the check to ""Jerry's Jams."" Your stop-payment order might not stop that check from going through. At that point, you would need to contact the bank. If they tell you that the information on the stop-payment order was insufficient, you can argue that they reasonably should have known that ""Jerry's Jams"" was the same thing as ""Jerry's Jams and Jellies, LLC.""
The check also might go through anyway if, for example, you entered the wrong check number, or you wrote the wrong amount on the stop-payment order. Keep in mind this doesn't need to be a significant difference – if you were off by even a few pennies, the bank may still honor the check despite your stop-payment order.

, In most cases, your stop-payment order will expire six months from the date it was issued. At that point, you'll need to assess the situation and decide whether you want to renew the stop-payment order for another six months.Keep in mind that if you decide to renew the stop-payment order, you typically must go to a bank branch again in person to sign the official forms, and you'll have to pay another fee.
Under federal law, banks are not obligated to pay a check that is more than six months old. However, the still may charge your account.If the check is still unaccounted for, you may want to renew your stop-payment order.

Assess the potential damage.,
Visit a bank branch in person.,
Set up a new checking account.,
Destroy your old checks and debit cards.,
Transfer recurring payments.,
Move your funds.",How to Stop Payment on a Lost Check2," The fees for a stop-payment order may be so high relative to the face value of the check that a stop-payment order doesn't make any sense. Or, if one or several checks were lost or stolen, the potential financial harm may be great.If the costs outweigh the benefits of getting a stop-payment order, it may make more sense for you simply to close your checking account. Although switching bank accounts can be a hassle, you won't have to continue to pay stop-payment fees, or have to worry about whether that check will go through anyway.
Closing your checking account also might be a good idea if the check was for a significant amount of money. Although the stop-payment fee is relatively low in that case compared to the amount of the check, if the check was honored anyway it would be a much bigger deal.

, If you decide you want to go ahead and close your checking account and open a new one, you should speak to someone at the bank in person. They will get the paperwork you need and help you do this more efficiently.Make sure to bring with you information about your account, such as your account number, and a government-issued photo ID. You may want to check with your bank before you go to make sure you don't need anything else, such as proof of your address.
If you have any other checks out, or purchases that haven't hit your account yet, you may want to make a list of them so you know how much money to keep in your old account. Despite this, your bank may require you to keep a specific minimum amount of money there for 30 days before they finally close the account.
If you have a joint account, the other account holder typically will need to be present when you make arrangements to close the account.

, Generally, it's a good idea to go ahead and set up a new checking account while you're waiting for confirmation that your old checking account ha fully closed. That way you can start the process of switching things over.For example, if you get paid by direct deposit, you may want to start having your checks deposited in your new account rather than your old one.
With some banks, you can go ahead and set up a new checking account online, but you may want to do it in person regardless so you can explain your situation.

, Once you have a new checking account, you want to make sure that you don't use your old checks or debit cards by mistake. Not only do you risk a returned check, but your bank may extend the waiting period before your account is closed.Make sure you dispose of old checks and debit cards properly so you're not at risk if they fall into the wrong hands. Use a paper shredder, if you have one, or cut them up into tiny pieces.

, If you have any subscriptions or bills set up on automatic payment, you'll want to switch these over from your old account to your new one. Check your most recent account statement and make a list.If you have recurring payments that only happen every few months, you may want to go back several account statements to make sure you have everything.
Your bank also may be able to provide you a list of recurring payments you've authorized. If you have a joint account, you also want to check with the other account holder to make sure they don't have any recurring payments authorized.

, Once your bank finally closes your old account, they'll send you a letter confirming the account has been closed, typically with a check for your final balance. You can simply deposit that check in your new account, or you may be able to make arrangements with your bank to have the final balance in your old account automatically transferred to your new one.

Monitor your accounts.,
Create a file to organize your information.,
Get a copy of your credit report.,
Set an initial fraud alert on your credit.,
Submit an identity theft complaint to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",How to Stop Payment on a Lost Check3," Particularly if you've lost more than one check, or if your purse or wallet was lost or stolen, you need to be vigilant for other possible unauthorized activity. If you spot anything unusual, notify the bank or credit card company as soon as possible.Keep in mind that you're not liable for unauthorized charges, but you have to act quickly to ensure that the entire amount is refunded to you.
If you lost any credit or debit cards, you may want to go ahead and cancel them and have new cards issued, just to be on the safe side.

, If you suspect your identity has been stolen, take a moment to gather everything in one place and make log sheets that you can use to keep track of phone calls, emails, and other interactions with bank, credit card, or government officials.As you go through this process, you need to get written documentation of every interaction that takes place. Since you may have to provide the same information to more than one person, it's a good idea to keep it all together.
Set up a filing system for originals of all correspondence and other personal documents, as well as copies. Print a blank calendar that you can use to mark deadlines related to the possible identity theft and have all of those in one place.

, Under federal law, you are entitled to one free credit report each year. Use this free credit report to determine if there has been unauthorized activity that affects your credit, such as someone opening a new credit card in your name.You can get your annual free credit report at www.annualcreditreport.com. This is the only official website to order your report, and was set up by all three credit reporting agencies together. The website also has information about how to identify unauthorized transactions and other ways to spot identity theft.
If you spot unauthorized or incorrect activity on your credit report, contact the credit reporting agency that issued the report and follow their instructions to correct the listing or get it off of your credit report.
Keep in mind that if there's something unauthorized on one agency's report, it may be on all three. Not all companies report to all three agencies, but many do. And while the one agency may remove the item, they aren't responsible for alerting the other agencies to the problem. If you find problems on one report, you probably need to check the other two as well.

, There are three nationwide credit reporting agencies in the United States. You only have to contact one of them to place a fraud alert. The one you contacted is then responsible for contacting the other two.You can contact Equifax at 1-800-525-6285, Experian at 1-888-397-3742, or TransUnion at 1-800-680-7289. Say that you are a victim of identity theft, and ask to have a fraud alert put on your credit file. There is never a fee for having a fraud alert put on your credit file.
Once your initial fraud alert is in effect, it will stay on your report for 90 days. During that time, any business must verify your identity before issuing credit in your name. An initial fraud alert also entitled you to one free credit report from each of the three credit reporting agencies.
After the 90 days is up, you can renew it for another 90 days if you want.

, If you have discovered identity theft, you should report it to the FTC. Once you have your FTC affidavit, you should report the incident to the police (if you haven't already).You can create a complaint and affidavit with the FTC by visiting IdentityTheft.gov. From the home page, just click the link that says ""Get Started."" You also can make your report by calling 1-877-438-4338.
Before you start your complaint, get all the information together that is associated with your identity theft. This should be easy if you've created a separate file. When you create your affidavit with the FTC, you will need to include as much detail as possible.
On the website, you also can create your own personal recovery plan. Based on your situation, the FTC provides information and steps you need to follow to undo the damage.

Some banks have preferred vendors, but you can also order from a variety of websites.Your bank may have a specific vendor that offers personalized or unique checks. It’s a good idea to check with the bank, either online or in-person, to see if they have a preferred vendor, since that may be cheaper in many cases.
If you know you want specific themed checks, you’ll likely need to look elsewhere than your bank to get them. You can find websites online that can offer nearly every color, design, pattern, or theme you may want.

Be prepared to pay for your order online.,
Make your privacy preferences known when ordering checks.",How to Order Checks for the First Time3," You can get either single-page checks or duplicate checks. The duplicate checks give you a copy of the check you just wrote for your personal records, while the single-page checks offer only a single check without a copy for your records.Single page checks are usually best if you’re writing checks for most personal reasons, such as paying bills. Additionally, most banks offer a digital version of your check on their website, so you should be able to get an image of the check online if necessary.
Duplicate checks may be a better option if you have a business account. Your bookkeeper may want copies of the check so a hard copy of each check is filed away.

, You can get a variety of images on your checks, including characters, pictures, or different fonts and styles. It’s important to choose a check image and style that matches your checking needs.


If your checking account is mostly a personal account, you can have more fun with your check’s image. You may want to have images of your family members, logos of your favorite sports teams, or famous movie or television characters on your checks.
When choosing checks for a more professional account, you’d want to choose something that is personalized, but a little more professional. An embellished, but polished font or style may be a better choice than a cartoon character in this case.

, This way, you will be able to see how many boxes you should order. The final price is generally lower for larger quantities.If you write checks a lot, you may want to go ahead and order a large quantity of checks. They won’t go to waste and you will save money by ordering more.
For people who don’t use checks often, it may be a better idea to use smaller quantities. You can order checks in quantities as low as 100 if you don’t think you’ll use them up quickly.

, Before completing the order form for your checks, you’ll need to have these numbers available. You cannot order checks without these key identifying numbers.Your routing number should be at the bottom left-hand corner of your check. It is a nine-digit code on any checks. If you don’t have any checks from your initial set, you can contact the bank to get your routing number.
The account number should be to the right of the routing number. This account number should also be in your checkbook or written down somewhere else so you know what it is at all times.

, If you’re ordering checks online, they’ll need to be shipped to you. Most of the time, the shipping and handling charges should be relatively minimal or even free.Some online retailers will offer free shipping and handling.

When buying from a vendor, you’ll have to pay for the checks directly, usually with a credit or debit card. Additionally, many first-time orders are given a discount.
A few banks refuse to honor checks printed by outside print houses. Inquire with your bank before ordering from someone else to verify whether this is the case.

, Some check and stationery printing firms will share your information with the direct mailers that send junk mail. You want to make sure that your information is not shared outside of the check company.


Many outside check companies have a small padlock icon on the check or on their website. This tells you that your personal information, as well as your checking account information, is usually secured.The Check Payment Systems Association (CSPA) also has a list of authorized check printing companies that are secured.

Wait for your checks in the mail.,
Save a check to use to reorder checks.,

, This is especially important so there will not be a time when you don't have them available. When you're down to your last few checks, it's probably a good time to order them.


If you write a lot of checks, you probably should order plenty at first, since it'll be cheaper. About a month before you need new checks, place your order so you will have them when you run out.

Once you've found a low-cost check service, you may want to search online for reviews of that service/company to ensure that they are not a fraudulent or scamming company., If you're ordering through a third-party vendor, you'll need to provide the website with your account information. Unlike your bank's website, the third-party vendor will not be able to simply link with your bank account. If you already have existing checks from your bank, your information will be on the checks. If not, you may need to contact your bank to learn this information. You'll need to provide:


your bank's routing number (the nine-digit figure located in the bottom left-hand corner of a check, bracketed by a vertical bar and a colon)
your checking account number (located in the bottom-center of a check, usually preceding the individual check number of that check)your address and possibly your phone number
the number you want your checks to start on (optional)
the date you opened your checking account (not always a requirement, but may be, depending on the state you live in), Depending on where you order checks from, they will most likely be cheaper than you'd pay through the bank.

The cost, delivery options, and delivery time will vary, depending on which service you use.

, Once your checks arrive, you should ensure that they are safe and secure. You can do this by looking for a padlock icon on the checks.

Learn when cashier's checks are needed.,
Visit your bank.,
Speak to a bank teller.,
Sign the check.",How to Order Checks4," For most purchases, you can write a personal check to cover the cost, and that amount will be deducted from your checking account. For larger purchases, though - for example, paying a down payment on a house or car, or for some security deposits - you'll need a cashier's check.


A cashier's check is purchased at the bank, and the amount is withdrawn from your account immediately. This helps ensure that the check will not bounce or be cancelled prematurely, as it basically guarantees payment by the bank to your intended recipient., You'll most likely need to request a cashier's check in person at your bank, though some banks may let you order a cashier's check online if you're already a customer.If you need to visit the bank in person, you can simply go to your regular bank location, or search online or in a phone book to find a location near you.


If you do not currently have a checking or savings account at any bank, you may still be able to request a cashier's check by paying cash to the bank of your choosing, with an additional fee for the service.
You may want to call a bank first to find out if you can request a cashier's check if you do not have an account at that bank.
You'll need to bring a valid photo ID with you in order to request a cashier's check.
Cashier's checks may have a cap.

, Once you arrive at the bank, let the bank teller know that you need a cashier's check. You'll need to tell him or her how much the check should be for and to whom it should be addressed.


Cashier's checks usually come with a fee. If you are a customer with that bank, your payment will likely be less than that of someone who is not a customer. For example, at Bank of America, if you have a checking or savings account you will be charged $10 for a cashier's check. If you do not, you'll be charged $20., Once the bank teller has made out your check and you've paid any fees for a cashier's check, you'll need to sign the check. Then you'll be on your way. You can use your cashier's check to make whatever payments you need to.

Also, if you owe money to the bank and it listed on your ChexSystems report, but you have paid it, you can indicate this to ChexSystems in your statement and have it removed.
Remember to be professional and businesslike in your statement. This statement will likely be seen by banks in the future, and you need calmly and factually state why you believe the information on the report is unfair and poorly represents you as a banking user.
Do not include profanity, or the names of other businesses or people.

, This step can be done before or after you contact ChexSystems to dispute, and is one of the most important things you can do to clear your record. If your ChexSystems report indicates you owe money to a bank, try your best to pay the owed balance off. Sometimes, the balance you owe may be a very manageable amount you forgot about, or that is within your ability to pay.


If the owed amount is large and is outside of your current means to pay, contact your creditor. Creditors are extremely negotiable, and are often willing to accept a smaller amount back, rather than no amount at all. If you owe $1,000 and are only able to pay $700, contact your creditors and say you would like to make yourself right with the bank, and are able to pay $700.

, After you have paid the amount, be sure that your bank notifies ChexSystems to have the balance removed from your report. Once the balance is removed, your ChexSystems report will be cleared (unless you had other issues on it), and you should be able to get a bank account at another institution.

Try to find a “second chance” bank.,
Use Bank On to find second chance bank accounts.,
Enroll in CheckWi$e.,
Make a list of bank branches in your area.,
Call and ask to speak to the branch manager or other bank official.",How to Get a Checking Account if You're Listed in Chexsystems2," If you are unable to get your record on ChexSystems cleared, there are other options available. One of these options is to get a second chance checking account, which allows individuals to rebuild their financial history. Second chance accounts sometimes have additional requirements (like taking a money management class) but they will allow you to have a bank account and after a year or two possibly move to a regular account.Many major banks do not have second chance checking accounts (although some do), but there are plenty of credit unions and community banks that do.
If you are looking for institutions in your region that offer second chance checking accounts, NerdWallet.com offers an exhaustive list of providers by state. You can locate the list at: http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/checking/second-chance-checking/


, A possible resource is Bank On, a nationwide program designed to help un-banked and under-banked Americans find low-cost, no-cost, and second-chance bank accounts. It is a collaborative effort between state governments, financial institutions, and community organizations. Visit the Bank-On website to see if there is a Bank On program in your region.If there is, contact them and inquire about what banking products and resources are available in your region to help you get a checking account. A local BankOn program will likely have innovative and local solutions to help you regain access to an account.

, This is a personal finance course developed by the American Center for Credit Education that can help you get a break from your bank. Once you complete it, you will be permanently registered in a national database, demonstrating to banks and credit unions that you are serious about managing your finances.Not all states offer this program. Search on Google for “CheckWi$e” plus the name of your state to see what’s available. If you don’t have any luck, contact your local municipality, BankOn program, or even financial institution to learn if there are similar programs available.

, You'll do better if you stick with the smaller, local banks and avoid the big banks. You may also have better luck if you check local credit unions as well. Credit unions act essentially as banks, except they don't have to pay stockholders and are generally much more lenient. Many credit unions will open an account for you if you can reasonably explain why you haven't paid a ChexSystems debt, and some credit unions will not pull a report on you even if you do have poor history.

, Sometimes there's nothing like a face-to-face conversation to get things working in your favor. Most businesses want your business, but if you don't look good on paper, they'll be wary.


If you present yourself, in person, as someone who is decent, with an honest reason for your past performance and evidence that you're not liable to be a problem in the future, they'll be much more receptive to working with you.
Make sure to clearly explain why you have had financial issues with previous checking accounts, what steps you have taken to rectify those issues, and why those issues are unlikely to happen in the future. If you went through a bout of unemployment for example, indicate this. Also indicate if you have taken any actions to pay back previously owed bank debt.

Avoid overdraft at all costs.,
Practice caution with check writing.,
Create a Budget.",How to Get a Checking Account if You're Listed in Chexsystems3," Going into overdraft -- or withdrawing more than you have in your account -- can lead to being listed in Chexsystems. There are a few helpful tips that can reduce your odds of going into overdraft in the future.


Monitor your accounts frequently. If you see your account balance approaching zero it is important to reduce spending you can easily control. If you have essential bills coming due, consider using your credit card or line of credit so your account does not go into overdraft.
It is very important to note that using credit to pay bills should only be done in emergency situations. If you regularly are running out of money in your checking account and needing to rely on credit, it means that your expenses are exceeding your income. If this is the case, it is absolutely essential that you look at options to increase your income (if possible), and if not, that you reduce your expenses so they are equal to or less than your income.

, If you need to write a check, always confirm two things. Firstly, confirm that you have adequate money in your account to cover the check. Secondly, confirm that the money will remain in your account indefinitely until the check is cashed. Writing bad checks can easily get you listed in Chexsystems.


Consider opening two checking accounts. One for your day-today transactions,and another specifically for check writing. When you need to write a check, transfer the amount into the checking-only account, and do not touch the money at all costs until the recipient cashes the check.
Only write checks for amounts that you either currently have, or that you are 100% certain you will have. If you are writing a $100 check, and know you are getting paid $500 in the next week, do not write the check unless you are absolutely certain you can afford to use $100 of that $500 to cover the check.

, Learning budgeting skills is an excellent way to ensure your expenses are within your income every month. There are plenty of resources available online to teach you how to make a budget. In addition, there is also software available that can be useful.


Look for budgeting software like Mint. Mint, as just one example, allows you to sync your bank accounts with the software, and can closely track your expenses each month to ensure you stay within your income.
When you create a budget, you will often need to reduce your expenses. When doing this, it is helpful to think of what you want versus what you need. Reducing wants can be an excellent way to find savings.
For example, a cable package may be a want, but it is likely not a need especially if you already have internet. As another example, eating is certainly a need, but eating out once a week is a want and can likely be reduced to once a month (or even less frequently depending on your particular situation).

Be sure to exclude any preceding MICR characters when determining your routing number.
Following your routing number, the next set of numbers, up until the next MICR character, is your account number.
The number following the MICR character at the end of the account number should match your check number.

Get proof of the cashed check.",How to Get a Cashier's Check," You cannot get a blank cashier's check. You must have a payee. A cashier's check has the payee information completed on the check itself. Unlike a money order, on a cashier's check you can't write in the payee information yourself. It may be useful to take the payee to the bank with you, so that you have all the information you need.


On the check itself, be sure to give the first and last name of the payee as it appears on their identification. If you are not sure of this information, ask the payee.
If your cashier's check is getting used to pay an organization and not an individual, be sure to find out how to complete the payee information according to the organization's guidelines.
Cashier's checks are a better option than a money order for larger payments, because money orders often have maximum limits, but there will be no maximum limit on a cashier's check amount.
Find a large bank that issues cashier's checks to the general public, and bring cash funds, if you do not have a bank account.;
, You need to know the exact amount before you get the check. In many cases, the amount is printed on to the check when you receive it from the bank teller. But in any case, the amount will be filled in by the cashier, so you will have to tell him exactly how much to put on it. The cashier will sign the check after verifying you have the funds in your account (or with you) to cover the amount of the check.Bring any documents that show how much you need the check to be written out for, to ensure you have this information with you when purchasing the check.

, The bank you purchase your cashier's check from will require you to show identification. Banks guarantee a cashier's check with their own funds. For this reason, they will ask to verify your identity, access your account, and ensure you have the money necessary to cover the check amount.It may be beneficial to bring multiple forms of ID, particularly if you need a cashier's check for a large amount.

, Deposit enough money into your account to cover the amount of the cashier's check. If you are purchasing the check from a bank where you don't have an account, bring the amount in cash. You will have to pay a small fee to pay for the service the bank provides.If you are a customer of the bank where you purchase the cashier's check, you may receive a discounted price for the service.
If you are not a customer of the bank where you purchase the check, you may have to pay a higher fee (typically some percentage of the check amount). Banks are not required to issue these checks to the general public.
Some upper-level bank accounts may qualify for free cashier's check service.

, Any bank can issue a cashier's check, but the best option for you will be the cheapest option. Check with your bank to find out if you qualify for any special pricing or fee waivers.


Compare prices between different banks to get the best deal.
The top ten banks in the United States have an average cashier's check fee of $9.10., A bank teller will prepare a cashier's check for you on the spot—you do not need an appointment. You will, however, have to meet face-to-face with a teller to get the check.The teller may have to sign the check for you, he may use a stamp, or another method of verification.

, The amount of the check you are purchasing plus the bank's fee will be debited from the account into which you deposited the funds.If you are not a customer at the bank where you purchase the check, present your cash for the check's amount plus the bank's fee.


Find out fee costs ahead of time to ensure you have the cash to cover the full amount.

, Make sure to get a receipt in case you lose or damage the check; unlike a personal check, you can't simply tear it up and write a new one. The receipt will have the check number and date, allowing you to contact the bank in case you should lose the check for any reason.Be sure to keep your receipt in a safe place at least until the check has cleared.

, The bank has sophisticated ways of tracking your check, to be able to tell whether the check has been cashed or not. Databases can be searched for the check number, and, if it is not found, this tells the bank that the check has not yet cleared. Simply present your receipt at the bank for an update about whether your check has been cashed by the payee.


If the check never reaches its destination for any reason, the bank can cancel the original check and resend payment.
Check with the payee periodically in addition to the bank to see if the check has reached its destination.

, You can get proof of the check's having been cashed with a copy of the front and back of the check from the bank. A fee may be required for this service. In the event that the person who cashed the check is not the payee, the bank can get the money back and initiate criminal proceedings against the person who cashed the check illegally.


Lots of fraud is committed via cashier's checks, so keep a close eye on your cashier's check to be sure it has reached its destination using the tracking tools the bank has at its disposal."

, If you'd like to work with someone locally, instead of at a call center, you should visit your bank and talk to someone who can provide you with your routing number.

Gather your checkbook.,
Ensure that your name and address are printed on the slips.,
Locate your account number.,
Write your name, account number and date.,
Fill in the date.,
Sign the slip.,
Enter the amount of cash you're depositing.,
Write down the amount for the check(s) you'd like to deposit.,
Note the first line below Checks.,
Fill in the subtotal.,
Write down how much cash you'd like to get back.,
Visit your bank.",How to Fill out a Checking Deposit Slip," Then, look to the very back of your checkbook, behind all of your checks. That's where you'll find your slips. The deposit slip pages are usually of a different color than your checks, and have Deposit Ticket/Slip written above your name and address.


If for some reason you can't locate your deposit slips, or you simply don't have any, go to your bank and ask a teller for more slips.;
, Your checks have your name, address, and sometimes phone number written on them. The same information should be present on your deposit slips. Look to the upper left side corner of your slips to make sure your information is displayed correctly.

, Much like your name, address, and sometimes phone number, your deposit slips should have your account number printed on them. Look to the bottom of the slip, and locate two separate strings of numbers. The first set of numbers is your routing number, and the second set is your account number.


If your information isn't already displayed on your deposit slip, you need to fill it in. Follow the next step.

, It's unlikely that your slip won't already contain this information. But if it doesn't, or you got a blank slip from your bank, make sure to fill in this information. You'll see a few blank lines on the upper left side corner. Fill in your name, the date, and your account number.


If you're unsure about your account number, you might be able to look it up online through your bank's site. You can also go to your bank, and ask a teller to provide that information.
Use black or blue ink, rather than a pencil or colored ink.

, If you've already taken care of writing the date on the slip, you can skip this step. If your deposit slip already contained your personal information, look to the left side of the slip. Write the date of when you wish to use the slip in the space provided, next to Date.

, Sign your name in the space provided right below the date.


The space for your signature will say: Sign here if cash received from deposit.
If you don't wish to receive cash back from this transaction, you can leave this space blank.

, Look to the right side of your deposit slip. You'll note various columns composed of rows of blanks alongside your slip. The very first line will say Cash next to it. If you're depositing cash, write down the full amount in the box lines next to Cash .

, Right below the Cash line, you'll see two lines of boxes provided for check deposits. These lines might be labeled as Checks with blank lines in front of the box lines, or not at all. In any case, the lines following the Cash space are reserved for deposits made in the form of a check.


Write the check number(s) in the blank lines, and the amount in the box lines.

, Following the check deposits, you'll see a line labeled as Checks or Total From Other Side. This simply means that if you have more than two checks, you can enter them on the back of the deposit slip. Then, write the combined check total on the front side where it's indicated.

, Below the line reserved for the total amount in checks, it'll say Subtotal. This is where you write down your cash deposit amount plus your combined check deposit amount. Add the sums up, then write it down next to Subtotal.

, The line below Subtotal will be labeled as Less Cash. This is where you indicate how much cash you'd like to receive from this deposit slip. If you don't want any cash, enter 0 in this line.


If you entered cash to receive from the deposit, subtract that amount from the Subtotal. Then, write down the amount on the very last line labeled as Net Deposit.

, Take your deposit slip, checks and cash, and visit your banking institution. Proceed to the teller, and hand her or him your deposit slip and funds.

You'll need to transfer the amount requested for the cashier's check from your account to the bank's account.

Decide if you have made a major error, or if there is a good chance the check will not be accepted when it arrives at a bank.,
Write the word “void” in large, capital letters from the bottom left to the top right.,
Enter the voided check into your check registry so that you can account for it later on.,
Write a new check using the next check in your book.",How to Fix Mistakes Made when Writing Checks2," Remember that you are likely to incur a fee for a returned check, so it’s good to err on the side of caution and void it if you have doubts.

Consider your options.,
Confirm that the person you want to endorse the check to, the third party, will accept a signed-over check.,
Confirm that the third party's bank accepts such checks and know the bank's particular procedures.,
Be prepared to go in person with the third party to his/her bank.,
Sign the back of the check as usual, except keep your signature in the top section of the endorsement area.,
Print ""Pay to the Order of"" and the third party's name in the middle section (or second line) of the endorsement area.,
Do not have the third party sign the check until it is deposited or cashed.,
Give the check to the endorsee to deposit in his/her bank as usual.,
Open a bank account, deposit the check, then pay the third party.,
Ask the original check writer to void the check and write a new one to the third party.,
Ask the original check writer to add ""or bearer"" after your name on the check (and future checks written to you).,
Use a check-cashing service.",How to Sign over a Check," Because of increasing banking and identification security regulations in the United States, you will likely have difficulty finding a bank that will accept a third-party check.If you have a banking account and can deposit or cash the check written to you, it is almost certainly going to be easier for you to do that, then write your own check (or hand the cash) to the the third party.
Signing over a check may seem like it would be more convenient (by cutting out the middleman, so to speak), but is unlikely to be so anymore.
Look into electronic transfers of funds to your third party, either through your existing bank accounts or a service such as PayPal, if you are seeking another convenient option.
If you: 1) have a check written to you; 2) don't have a bank account; and 3) need to pay a third party the amount of the check written to you, this is the only real scenario in which you might want to try to sign over a check. See Part III of this article for other options in this scenario.;
,


Ask the person if he/she has used a third-party check at his/her bank before. This will improve your chances of success, since there are no laws requiring banks to accept third-party checks.

, If you cannot contact the person immediately but know his/her bank branch, you can call the bank's customer service number to inquire about special endorsements of this kind.


Ask if any special procedures are required by the bank to accept the third-party check. Some banks have enacted their own rules governing these procedures, such as requiring that both parties have accounts at the bank to ensure the funds can be transferred.

, Completing the signing process in person may be required by the bank and will almost certainly improve your chances of success regardless.


Bring proper identification, especially if it is not also your bank.

, If there are three lines, sign the top line. This is not the time for a flamboyant ""John Hancock"" signature, because you will need the entire space to complete the process.

, If you are pressed for space, you can try using ""FBO"" (For the Benefit of), but you may want to check with the bank first.


Write neatly, especially the third party's name. Check for spelling.

, Have the third party (the endorsee) sign the check in the bottom section (or third line) of the endorsement area. If he/she is not present, place an ""X"" to indicate where he/she should sign, and/or attach a friendly reminder note to the the check.

, So long as the bank accepts the third party check, the deposit process should be exactly the same as for a check written directly to the person

, As noted, you're likely only considering signing over a check because you don't have a bank account. If it is possible for you to open an account, do so, because it will make this situation (and likely others) simpler.

, This is more likely to work with your Aunt Edna than a mega-corporation that sent you a rebate check, of course.

, Checks with ""or bearer"" written following the name of the payee can be deposited or cashed (typically, depending on bank policies) by whomever presents the check.


The third party should be prepared to present identification when depositing or cashing the check, depending on the policies of the financial institution, especially if the check is for a larger amount.
Checks written out to ""cash or bearer"" or just ""bearer"" will work similarly.

, You will pay a fee in return for this service, but you will walk out with cash that you can use to pay your third party.


Check-cashing charges generally range somewhere between 1% and 12% of the check amount, so shopping around for the best deal can pay off. Some national retailers, including Walmart, provide this service.You will need a photo ID to cash the check.

Read the payor's information.,
Read the check amount.,
Make sure the written amount matches up with the numerical amount.,
See if the check includes a memo.,
Find the check number.,
Locate the date.,
Differentiate between the routing number and account number.",How to Read a Check," You can find the name of the bank on the check. You might need to know this information if there's any issue with the check going through. The name of the bank can appear in a variety of places on a check but is usually recognizable as a bank name. It may be the name of a major bank, like Chase or Bank of America, or a local credit union. Look for a name that is of a business or institution and not an individual. Banks usually have words like ""bank"" or ""credit union"" in the name., The payor signature is what authorizes you to deposit or cash the check. The signature should be written on a line in the lower right corner of the check., Most checks include information on the payor in the top left corner. This usually includes the payor's name and might include her address. If you want to make sure the signature matches the owner of the checks and bank account, you can look for payor information on the check., The check amount appears twice on the check, once in words and once in digits. First, read the amount as written in words.


Towards the center of a check, there should be a line below the recipient's name with a numerical amount written out in words. The payor writes the amount a check is for to make sure there's no confusion at the bank. They also include the amount of change, if any, as a fraction.For example, say the check is for $400.00. In the line, the payor would write, ""Four hundred dollars and No/100."", Once you've read the amount the check is for, make sure this matches up with the numbers written on the check. Just to the right of where the amount is written out, there will be a small box with a currency sign next to it. The recipient will have written the amount the check is worth, in numerals, in this box. Returning to the above example, this box should contain the numbers ""$400.00.""If the two amounts are not the same, the amount written out in words is the amount that will be honored.For example, if the amount written out is ""Four hundred dollars and No/100"" and the amount in digits is ""$400.99,"" the check will be redeemed for $400 in cash(the amount written out in words).

, Some checks include memos. These can be found on a line on the bottom left corner of a check. The memo usually includes information on why the check was written. For example, a rent check may include a memo that says something like ""For December Rent.""Language in the memo field is legally binding on the person cashing the check in rare instances.

, Most checks come with a check number. Checks come in books and are all numbered. The check number indicates which number check the recipient was on when he wrote the check. The check number is usually in the upper righthand corner of a check. It also reappears along the bottom, the last in a series of number sequences you'll find on a check., Near the top of the check and to the right, you will find the date. This is the date the check was written by the payor. It usually appears in a small box labeled ""Date.""The date of the check is important. While banks can honor checks older than six months, they are not legally required to do so., Along the bottom of the check, you will see two numbers. These numbers are the routing number and the account number.


The first number, which will be nine digits long, is the routing number. Routing numbers are numbers assigned to individual banks. Their purpose is to track where money that is exchanged in a transaction comes from and goes to.The next number, which ranges in length, is the account number. This is the number associated with the payor's individual bank account."

Check with your bank to make sure your phone is supported., Just like online deposit, you likely need to enroll in the program to deposit a check. However, often if you enroll in one, you are enrolled in the other. Even if you don't need to enroll in the program, you will need to download the mobile app to your phone. You should be able to find your bank's mobile app in the app store by searching with its name., Sign the back of the check with your name. You may also need to add the bank account number or your member number, depending on the bank. Check with your bank for the requirements. Be sure to keep your endorsement in the space assigned to it on the back of the check., Select the mobile banking app on your phone. Once it opens, log into your account., Your mobile banking account will have many options, including viewing your bank accounts. Find the area for mobile deposits. It should be on the main screen, but it also may be under a heading such as ""Tools"" or ""Deposits.""

, Following the directions on the screen, take pictures of the front and back of the check. Usually, the app will require you to accept the picture of the front before moving on to the back, meaning you may need to take each picture more than once to get it right. Some applications automatically detect the check, as long as it is on a dark background. Try to capture the whole check, and line up the check as squarely as possible.

, Some banks will ask you to type in the amount of the check. Others will just ask you to verify the amount the software automatically pulled from the check. Make sure they match up.

, Once you have the photographs and amount correct, submit the check. You may need to wait for the check to be reviewed.Other banks will deposit the amount instantly. Check with your bank to find out its policy.


Look for a confirmation email to let you know your check was deposited.If you don't receive an email within a day or two, check your account for the deposit. If it's not there, contact your bank., When you receive confirmation the check was deposited, write ""void"" or ""processed"" on it according to your bank's policy. Most banks ask that you keep the check for a certain amount of time, such as 2 months."

Excel spreadsheets are organized by rows and columns.You can install a desktop version of Excel on your Mac or PC. Or, you can use a free online app for your smartphone, tablet or computer. Each of these versions functions a little bit differently.Excel has been in existence for many years, and every year or so, Microsoft releases a new, updated version. Each of these versions also works a little bit differently.In Excel, rows run horizontally and are ordered by number. Columns run vertically and are ordered by letter. Each box where a row and column intersect is called a cell. The cell is named according to its row and column. For example, a cell in the fifth row of column D is named D5 (column D, row 5).Understand the difference between a worksheet and a workbook in Excel. A worksheet is a single spreadsheet. A workbook is an Excel file that contains one or more spreadsheets. Each worksheet in an Excel workbook is in a separate tab. By default, new Excel workbooks have three tabs. You can add more if needed.
To make a basic check register, you only use one tab.
To create a function for categorizing expenses in a check register, you will use two tabs.;
, How you open the spreadsheet differs depending on the type of computer and operating system you are using.


On a PC with an operating system older than Windows 7, begin by clicking on the start menu in the lower left hand corner of your desktop. From the popup menu, click on Programs. From the next popup menu, click on Microsoft Office. Then click on Microsoft Office Excel. At this point you will have a blank excel spreadsheet on your desktop.On a PC with Windows 7 or newer, click on the Windows icon in the lower left hand corner of your screen. Then click on the Microsoft Excel tile to open Excel. You will see a page with your recent files listed on the left and template options for new documents on the right. Click on the first template option, Blank Workbook, to open a new Excel spreadsheet.
To open Excel on a Mac, click on Excel in the dock. Click “File” in the menu bar. Click “Open” and then click “New.” This will bring you to a new, blank spreadsheet.

, Use labels that you would find in an ordinary paper check book register. Create columns for the date, check number, the payee and a description or memo. After that, create columns for debits (which are payments or withdrawals), credits (which are deposits) and the balance forward.Enter the word “DATE” in cell B1 (column B, row 1). This is where you will enter the date of the transaction.
Move one cell to the right to cell C1 (column C, row 1). Type “ITEM #”. Here you will enter the check number or the type of transaction, such as “ATM” or “deposit.”
Move one cell to the right to cell D1 (column D, row 1). Type “PAYEE.” This is the person to whom a check was made payable or to whom money was paid.
Move one cell to the right to cell E1 (column E, row 1). Type “DESCRIPTION.” Record any details you want to remember about the transaction.
Move one cell to the right to cell F1 (column F, row 1). Type “DEBIT.” This is where you record money that leaves your account, also known as outflow.
Move one cell to the right to cell G1 (column G, row 1). Type “EXPENSE CATEGORY.” You will leave this blank for now. Options for this column will be created in a later step.
Move one cell to the right to cell H1 (column H, row 1). Type “CREDIT.” This is where you record money coming into your account, also known as inflow.
Move one cell to the right to cell J1 (column J, row 1). Type “INCOME CATEGORY.” As with the expense category column, options for this column will be created in a later step.
Move one cell to the right to cell K1 (column K, row 1). Type “BALANCE.” This is the current amount in your account after all transactions have been recorded.

, To make the column labels easy to read, format them so they are in bold font and give the row of register labels a different background color. To do this, first you select the range of cells that you want to format. Then you select the formatting options.Find the formatting options in the “HOME” tab of the toolbar ribbon. When you open a new workbook, the “HOME” tab is open by default.Select cell B1 (DATE) and drag the cursor across all of the labels, through cell K1 (BALANCE).
In the upper left hand corner of the toolbar, click on the “B” for the bold formatting option.
To change the color of the background, click on the paint bucket icon to see the palette from which you can select your background color.

, The default size of some of the columns will likely be too small to hold the data you will put in them. For example, the “PAYEE” and “DESCRIPTION” columns could hold long names or lengthy memos. Also, column A, which has no data and is just a spacer, should be very narrow.Click the header for column A to select the whole column. In the upper right hand corner of the toolbar in the “HOME” ribbon, click on the “FORMAT” button. From the drop down menu, click on “Column Width.” Enter the number 2 and click on “OK.” Now column A is very narrow.
Widen column D, “PAYEE.” Select column D by clicking on the header. Hover the cursor over the border between columns D and E. The cursor will change from the arrow to the resizing cursor. The resizing cursor looks like a cross with arrows. When you see the resizing cursor, left-click and drag your mouse to the right to make the column as wide as you want it to be.
Repeat the same procedure to widen column E, “DESCRIPTION.”

, Select the entire first row by left-clicking on the number 1 on the left border of the page. In the upper left hand side of the toolbar on the “HOME” ribbon, click on the “center” formatting button. This action centers all of the data in the selected cells. You will notice that the column labels are now centered in their cells., In order to see the formatting changes you make, enter four rows of data into the cells. Begin with the opening balance, and then enter three more transactions.


In cell B2, add a date for the opening balance, for example 9/27/15. In cell D2, which is the “PAYEE” column, type “Opening Balance.” In cell K2, which is the “BALANCE,” type the amount of money you have in your account as of the date you entered in cell B2.
Add three more transactions. Try to have a mix of debits (such as checks written or ATM withdrawals) and credits (such as deposits).
Notice the inconsistent formatting of the numbers in the cells. The date column may be formatted to read “9/27/2015” or “27-Sept.” The columns in which you entered dollar amounts may have the wrong number of decimal points. Formatting will clean all of this up., Make this column display the dates in a consistent way. Excel provides different options for formatting the date. Select the one that you prefer.Click on the header for column B, “DATE.” This selects the entire column.
Right-click on the column, and select “Format Cells.” The “Format Cells” window will appear.
Select the “Number” tab. Under “Category” choose “Date.” Select the format you desire for the date and click on “OK” in the bottom right corner of the window.
While this column is still highlighted, center the data in these cells by clicking on the “center” icon in the upper left hand corner of the toolbar in the “HOME” ribbon.

, The data in this column should be centered. Highlight all of column C by clicking on the header for the column. Click on the “center” icon. Notice the test data you entered in this column. It should be centered in the cells.Check the formatting for columns D and E, “PAYEE” and “DESCRIPTION.” By default, Excel formats cells so that the data is aligned to the left. This should work well for these columns. Double check the sizing of the columns. Now that you have some data in these cells, adjust the column width to make the columns wider or narrower if necessary., You can choose to show the dollar sign if you desire. You can also make your debits appear in red font if you want.


Select column F. Right-click on the column and select “Format Cells.” The “Format Cells” window will appear. In the “Number” tab, select “Accounting. “ Choose “2” in the “Decimal places” option. Select the dollar sign in the “Symbol” option.
Repeat for columns H and K.
To make your debits appear red, click on the header for column F to select the entire column. Right click on the column and select “Format Cells.” When the “Format Cells” window appears, select the “Font” tab. In this tab, click the down arrow next to the “Color” option. From the palette, click on red.

, Insert a formula into column K that does the math to calculate the running balance. Note that you did not need a formula in cell K2. This is where you entered your opening balance.


Click on cell K3. Now click on the formula bar at the top of the spreadsheet. This is where you will type in the formula that tells the cells to perform a calculation. Type the formula =SUM(K2-F3+H3). This tells the spreadsheet to take our opening balance (cell K2), and subtract a debit if one exists (cell F3) and add a credit if one exists (cell H3).Suppose your opening balance was $200, and your first entry was a check you wrote for $35.00. The $35.00 is recorded as a debit in cell F3. The formula you entered in cell H3 takes the opening balance and subtracts the debit, leaving you with a balance of $165.00.

, Select cell K3. Right-click and select “Copy.” Select cells K4 and K5. Right-click and select “Paste.” The formula is now copied into these cells. You should see that the running balance has been calculated in column K for all the rows of test data that you entered.

, You could copy the above formula into cell K6. But since you haven’t entered any data in this row, the running balance from cell K5 will also appear in cell K6. To clean this up, create a conditional formula that leaves the cell blank if no transactions have been entered, but displays a balance if they have been entered.


In cell K6, enter the formula =IF(ISBLANK(B6),"""",SUM(K5-F6+H6)). This tells Excel that if cell B6, in the “DATE” column, is blank, then cell H6 should be blank. But if cell B6 is not blank, then the balance should be calculated., The AutoFill automatically fills in formulas in adjacent cells so you won’t have to enter the “BALANCE” formula over and over again.Find the AutoFill handle in the active cell. Observe the small, dark square in the bottom right corner of the active cell. Hover over it and the cursor will change to the AutoFill cursor, which looks like a thin plus sign.Click on cell K6. Hover over the AutoFill handle and the cursor will change to the thin plus sign. Left-click and hold the AutoFill handle. Drag the cursor down to cell K100 (column K, row 100).
The formula has now been copied into all of the cells in column K through row 100. The row and column numbers in each cell have been automatically adjusted so the formula calculates correctly., Create categories of transactions to keep track of how you spend your money and the types of income. Categories could be related to income taxes, such as property taxes or charitable giving. You could also use the categories to create a charts to easily visualize financial activity in your account.

, This is where you will store all of the potential income and expense categories for your check register. Rename one of the tabs in your workbook “Categories.” Double click on the current title of the tab to highlight the name. The current name will be something like “sheet2” or “sheet3.” When the name of the sheet is highlighted, you can type in the new name of the tab. Type “Categories.” .In cell B4, type the word “Categories.” Format the cell to have bold font and change the alignment to center.

, In cell B5, type “*** Income ***”. Think of all of the categories of income you have or may utilize in the future. In cell B6 and continuing downward, enter all of your income categories.


The most common income category would be “Wages.” You might need multiple wage categories if you have more than one job.
Other income categories you might want to include depend on your financial circumstances. If you own stock, create a category for “Dividends.” If you receive child support, create a category for that. Other categories to add include “Interest Income,” “Gifts” and “Miscellaneous.”

, Leave a cell blank under your last income category. Move one cell down and type “*** Expenses ***”. Enter all of the expense categories under this section heading.


Be as broad or as narrow as you wish with your expense categories. Expense categories might include “Mortgage,” “Rent,” “Insurance,” “Car Payment,” “Gas,” “Electricity,” “Phone” and “Entertainment.”

, Select cell B5. Highlight from cell B5 all the way down through all of your income and expense categories. Find the cell name box in the upper left hand corner of the window. It is to the left of the formula box. It will say “B5,” which is the name of the first cell in the highlighted range.

You can also create a password to further protect your check register from other users.Just make sure it's something that is easy for you to remember, or you write it in a secure place; if you forget the password you will be unable to access the worksheet.

, By default, once a worksheet is protected, all of the cells become locked. So to begin, you need to unlock the cells into which data will entered even after the worksheet is protected.Select cells B2 through J100.

Fill out a deposit slip.,
Endorse the check.,
Ask the teller to deposit the check into your checking or savings account.",How to Deposit Checks1," You'll need to bring the check, a valid ID, and your account number with you to make the deposit.;
, These should be readily available at your bank, usually in a stack on a table with pens and other slips. You can also request one from the teller, but the process will move more quickly if you do this ahead of time.


You'll need to fill in your account number, the amount of the check, how much (if any) you want in cash, savings, and checking, and the total amount of the check.

, First, go through the elements written on the front and back of the check to ensure the check’s validity. Check that the following items are written and completed in a legible manner, and are true and correct: name and address of the person or entity issuing the check, date of issue, your name, amount of money being given written in both numeric and alphabetic form.


Both signatures are required for the check to be considered valid.

Void and destroy the check.",How to Deposit a Check Online2," Most national banks offer this feature, though some local banks do not. You should be able to find information about this feature on your bank's website.Some financial institutions only offer remote check deposit capture to clients with business checking accounts or accounts with high minimum required balances.
Be sure to check what your bank requires. Other banks may require that you pass certain credit checks before being able to use this feature., Your bank may require you to enroll in the online depositing program. This step is required usually if your bank wants you to pass a credit check first., Generally, it's safer to use a scanner in your own home, but you can also use a scanner at a library or at work. Basically, you need to be able to scan the check into your computer. The bank will use this scan to read the check, so it must be clear.

, Most banks require that you at least sign the back of the check to endorse it. Sign on the back of the check in the endorsement area.Others require you to add the account number for the account you want to deposit the check into. You also write this number on the back of the check in the designated endorsement area.
You may also need to add your member number, depending on the bank. For instance, Digital Federal Credit Union requires a member number., Go online to your bank's website. Log into your account. Find the deposit online portion of the website, which is usually under the account tools. Pick the account you want to deposit the check to, which you will likely find in a drop-down menu., Most banks will ask you to pick a scanner. Usually, you will only have one scanner hooked up to your computer, so this choice shouldn't be difficult. If you have more than one, make sure you are picking the correct scanner and that it is turned on. You can find the name on the front or top of the scanner., Use your scanner to scan the front and back of the check. Normally, the bank's software will initiate the scan as you click through the process.Some banks may require the checks to be perfectly square on the scanner, so you may need to adjust or re-take the scan according to your bank's guidelines. In fact, some banking software will analyze the image to make sure it's correct before you submit it.


Some banks require that your computer be connected to the scanner while you're logged in. In other words, you can't save a picture of the check for later.
On the other hand, some banks let you upload pictures of the check, even if they are from earlier. Check your bank account to find out what your bank allows., Though not all banks require you to do so, you may be asked to type in the amount. Simply type the amount the check is made out for in the box.

, Most checks are reviewed after being submitted. Some banks deposit the amount the next day, while others do it instantly.You should check with your bank to see how long it takes to credit your account.


If yours does not deposit automatically, you'll likely need to wait for a confirmation email.If you don't get an email, check your account for the deposit. If it's not there, contact your bank by phone.

, Different banks have different recommendations for what to do with the check after you are done. Some want you to write ""void"" on the check, while other prefer ""processed."" Definitely wait for confirmation that the check was deposited before performing this step. In addition, some banks request that you keep the check for at least 2 months before you destroy it."

Look at the edges.,
Check the bank logo.,
Find the check number.,
Examine the MICR line.,
Feel the paper.,
Notice the signature.,
Check for irregularities.",How to Spot a Fake Check1," Most checks that were written by a legitimate business have one edge that is rough or perforated. Examine the sides of the check to see if all sides are smooth. If they are, it might have been printed on a computer., Look on the front of the check for the logo of the bank where the checking account is held. If you don't see a logo, the check is likely fake. If the logo is faded or faint, this is probably evidence of the logo being copied from another source. This signals a fake check as well.


If the logo seems legitimate, look for an address. You need to check the validity of the bank address, which you can do by going online to the bank's website or calling the bank. Make sure each part of the address is correct.
If the check has no address or just a PO Box, the check is likely a fake., Any legitimate check issued by a bank has a check number. The check number appears at the top right hand corner of the check. If the check does not have a check number, the check is fake.


If it does have a check number, check the number against the number in the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line. The MICR line is the line of numbers at the bottom of a check printed by the issuing bank that gives all the relevant numbers for a check. From left to right, the long string of numbers contains the routing number, the account number, and the check number. The check number should match the numbers on the far right of the line. If it doesn't match, the check is likely a fake.
If the check number is low, from 101-400 on a personal check or 1000-1500 in a business check, the check may be fake. This signals a new account, and 90 percent of fake checks are written from new accounts., The MICR line appears at the bottom of every check issued by a real bank. Rub your finger over the line to check the feel of the ink. Also look at the ink's quality. The special ink used for the MICR line is dull and should print smoothly. If it is raised or shiny, the check is fake.


You also need to examine the routing number in the MICR line. This will be the first series of numbers in the MICR line. Go to the Federal Reserve Bank Services website and search the routing number of the institution issuing the check. If it exists, check the information of the bank against the name and address given to you by the Federal Reserve. If it doesn't match, you likely have a fake check., Real checks are typically printed on thick, sturdy stock paper. Rub your fingers along the check. Notice the thickness of the check. Bend the check back and forth, noticing the resistance the check gives. If the check is thin and flimsy, it is likely a fake check.


Fake checks are also typically printed on shiny paper. If the check is not printed on matte paper, it might be fake.
You can also try an ink test. Dampen your finger and run it across an inked area of the check. If the color smears, it was printed on a color printer and is fake., Most signed checks have a consistent signature. Look for gaps in the signature, a digital appearance or shaky and erratic pen strokes. These are signs that may indicate the signature was forged or scanned from another source and printed.


This doesn't always mean it is a fake check, but you should look for other clues if the signature seems forced.There are some instances where a stamp is made up to sign checks, which can make it look printed or irregular. Be aware of this issue.

, A few irregular aspects of a check can show it as being fake:


Look for an address of a payee. Notice if it is typed instead of printed on the check.
Check for spelling or typing errors within any of the printed areas.
Match the amount of the check with the spelled out amount.
Pay attention to areas where things have been added or erased from the check. If you see anything out of the ordinary in these areas, you might have a fake check."

Make sure you trust the person who wrote you the check.,
Endorse the check right before you're ready to cash it.,
Cash the check as soon as you can.,
Cash your check with your bank teller.,
Deposit your check at the ATM of your bank.,
Use a mobile depositing app.,
Take your check to the bank the check is being cashed from.,
Cash your check at a retailer.,
Go to a specialized check-cashing company only as a last resort.,
Sign the check over to someone you trust.",How to Cash a Check," This is the most important thing. If you end up with a bad check, you'll have a lot more trouble trying to retrieve the money that is rightfully yours. So, make sure that you're given the check by a trusted person; if you're asking for compensation from someone you've never met before or someone who you met on craigslist who wants to buy your furniture, then it's better to ask for the amount of money in cash if you can. But if you do have a check, make sure you have the following information:


The correct first and last name and address of the person who is giving you the check
Contact information for the person who wrote you the check so you can reach him or her if you have trouble cashing it
The name of a legitimate bank where the check is being cashed from;
, To endorse the check, you'll just have to flip it over and sign the line with the ""x"" to the left of it. This line will be found at the top of the check, and you'll sign it sideways. Do this right before you go to the ATM or the bank, so that your check cannot be cashed if you lose it. If you don't endorse the check, that makes it harder for the bank to accept it from a person who wants to cash it for ulterior motives.

, Some checks, like those that are paid by employers or are not personal checks, have an expiration date on them. But even if they do not have an expiration date, banks are not required to accept checks 6 months after the date they are written on, so you should cash them in a timely manner to make sure that you can get the money you deserve as quickly and easily as possible.

, This is the easiest method to getting the money you have earned quickly and safely. Your bank will most likely need a verification of your account and your driver's license or an identification card of some sort, so be sure that you bring these necessary supplies with you when you visit the bank. Never sign the check before you arrive at the bank; instead, do it in front of the teller as you cash it for ultimate security., This is another way to cash the check you've been given. Essentially, you'll be depositing the check into your bank account; it can take up to three business days for the cash to go through, but if you already have some money in your account, you can just withdraw the amount you need in the meantime. Either way, this is a quick way to ensure that the money goes into your account. Here is how you deposit a check at the ATM of your banking company:


Insert your debit card
Type in your PIN and press Enter
Select ""Deposit Check""
Insert the check into the check deposit slot
Confirm the amount on the check
Withdraw the money from the ATM once the check goes through (or sooner if you have more money in the bank already)

, This is a new method that many banks, such as Chase and Bank of America, are using to allow customers to deposit a check as easily as possible. To do this, all you have to do is download your bank's mobile banking app, take photos of the front and back of the check, and then confirm the amount on the check. This is similar to depositing the check at the ATM except that you don't have to leave the house.


Once the check clears, though, you will have to leave the house to withdraw the money you deposited.

, If you don't have a bank account of your own, then this is a great method. Just bring a photo ID and the check to the teller at the bank where the check was cashed from, and you will be able to cash the check for yourself. Just remember that many banks will take a processing fee, which can cost $10 or more. This bank will also try to get you to open an account at their bank.

, Often times, large grocery store chains, other large franchises, and most Walmarts have places for you to cash your personal or payroll checks for minimal fees. You can take the check to a local 7-Eleven or another local retailer. This can cost less that doing the same thing at a bank you don't bank with or at a cash-checking service. 7-Eleven lets you cash checks at a .99% convenience fee, for example, and Walmart charges just $3 for checks under $1000.Again, don't sign and endorse the back of your check until you are in front of the person who is cashing it for you.

, You should only use this method as a last resort simply because these firms charge the most money for cashing personal and payroll checks. On the upside, these stores are often the quickest ways to get your cash immediately and may even be open, depending on what firm it is and where it is located, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Once again, though, the commission that these check-cashing places take is often hefty due to the extra risk they take by cashing nearly any and all checks brought to them.


These places know that they are working with customers who need the money from the check ASAP and are willing to take advantage of their desperation.

, By signing the back of your check over to someone you trust and know well, they can just as easily go into their own bank and cash it themselves. Of course, the stipulation here is that you should only ask someone you truly trust to do this for you. In most cases, you should probably accompany them to the bank when they are cashing your check, though it is not necessary for you to be present.


All you have to do is write, ""Pay to the order of their name"" and sign below. After this, most banks will have no problem cashing the check if the person you sign it over to has an account with them.

Make sure that the check information is correct.,
Find the grey lines on the back of your check.,
Sign your name on one of the grey lines.,
Take your check to your bank to cash or deposit it.",How to Endorse a Check1," The person who gave you the check needs to have written your name, their signature, the date, and the amount of the check (both as words and as a number). Without all this information, your bank may not be able to process the check.


If the person who wrote your check made a mistake, go to the person and request a new check. Some banks will accept a check that has been corrected with initials, but this can also look suspicious. Getting a new, correct check will make it less likely that you will encounter any problems at the bank.
If someone wrote a check to you with incorrect information, then the old check will have to be voided. It is also a good idea to shred any checks that you cannot use.;
, Flip over the check and look for the grey lines located on the upper part of the check. Sign your name on one of the lines as it is spelled on the face of the check.Most checks say ""do not write, stamp, or sign below this line"" beneath the endorsement area, because the bank needs this space to document their completion of the check.

, To deposit or cash your check, all you need to do is sign on one of the grey lines. Nothing else is required to endorse a check.If more than one person is listed on the check and their names are connected with and, then both people have to sign the check in order to endorse it. If the names are separated by or, then just one person has to sign the check.Make sure your endorsement is within the endorsement area to prevent confusion or error at the bank.
Make sure the name you sign matches the name on the check. For example, if the front of the check says ""Bob Johnson,"" don't sign your name ""Robert Johnson."" Likewise, if your name is misspelled on a check (e.g., Sara Jones, if your real name is Sarah Jones), then sign the check as it is written on the front of the check. You can then write the correct spelling for your name below it.

, Ask the bank teller to deposit the check into one of your accounts, or simply exchange it for cash. Keep in mind that an unrestricted endorsement (a signature alone) means that anyone who has the check can cash it. Because of this, you should protect a signed check like you would cash. Consider waiting until you get to the bank where you will deposit your check to sign it.If you don't have a bank account, you can cash your check at the bank of the person who issued you the check. The bank's name should be written on the face of the check. Note that the issuing bank may or may not charge a fee for cashing your check."

Visit one of your bank's Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).,
Swipe your ATM card or debit card and login to the ATM with your Personal Identification Number (PIN).,
From the menu, select ""Deposit."",
Insert your checks.,
Compete other transactions if you wish.",How to Deposit Checks2," Make sure your check is filled out clearly and legibly, and that you've endorsed it ahead of time. It's important that you select your own bank's ATM. While most cash machines and ATMs will dispense cash to anyone with a debit card who is willing to accept the fee, the other ATM deposit functions will only work for members of that bank specifically.


Credit union members who regularly do shared drafting at other locations will have to use an ATM from their particular credit union, not a shared draft union.

, If you don't have this information you'll need to go into the bank and speak with a teller.

, A list of your checking and savings accounts should show up next. Select the account into which you'd like the check deposited. Next, you'll have the choice between cash and check next. Select check.

, There should be an insert slot with directions about orienting the check (face up or face down, etc.) printed on the machine. Follow the directions and insert your checks. Next, the ATM will scan the checks and will ask you to confirm the information on the check as it has ""read"" it. Examine it carefully to ensure the ATM has the correct amount, account number, and other information.


Some Bank of America ATM kiosks allow you to insert up to ten checks at a time, but read the directions on the particular ATM carefully before you try to insert more than one.

, At this point, the ATM will provide your current balance and ask if you'd like another transaction. You can either withdraw cash, print a receipt, or deposit cash.

Visit any credit union.,
Don't fill out a deposit slip.,
Deposit the check into your checking or savings account.",How to Deposit Checks3," If you're a member of a local or federal credit union, you can deposit checks not only at any branch of your own union, but also at any branch of any credit union.

, Get in line with your valid, endorsed check and tell the bank teller you'd like to deposit your check, but you're a member of another credit union. You'll need to provide the teller with your check, a valid photo ID, your account number, the name of your branch, and possibly the address of the main branch of your credit union.


There are hundreds of credit unions, and some have very similar names: ""Teachers Credit Union"" and ""Teachers Federal Credit Union"" are completely different, for example. The teller is probably unfamiliar with your specific credit union, so make sure to provide them with address when they're searching the database for yours.

, This is also a good opportunity to withdraw cash without paying the fee credit union customers normally pay at ATMs.

Download a mobile deposit app.,
Open the app and select Deposits.,
Select an account into which you'd like the check deposited.",How to Deposit Checks4," Check to see if your bank features a mobile deposit app for your tablet or smart phone. Chase, Bank of America, and Citibank and other banks have developed apps for mobile devices that make depositing a check as simple as taking a picture. If one is available, download it onto your phone or mobile device.

, You should be taken to a screen with options marked ""Front of Check"" and ""Back of Check."" Use these to photograph the front and back of your endorsed check, respectively.

, Fill in the amount of the check using the app, and check to make sure all the information is correct on the confirmation screen. If it is, click ""Deposit this Check.""


You can elect to receive email or text confirmation when the check is deposited.

Determine the designated routing location in your area.,
Mail your endorsed check with a deposit slip to a routing location in your area.,
Never mail cash.",How to Deposit Checks5," If getting to a branch of your bank or enrolling in online banking is too difficult from your current location, you can mail the check and a completed deposit slip to your bank's designated routing location. You'll need to check with your bank to determine where to send the check. Call the toll-free number on your bank card and speak with a representative to figure out where to send the check.


Bank of America, for instance, lists an address in Phoenix, AZ for all members living in AZ, CA, ID, IL, IN, MI, NM, NV, OR, TX, and WA, and an address in Tampa, FL for members in all other states. If you're mailing the check overnight or via FedEx, however, the address changes. You'll need to look online or speak with a representative on the phone to get the correct address for your bank and location., Make sure you've got a valid endorsed check and a deposit slip from your bank filled out with your information. You may need other information, like a photocopy of your ID, so it's a good idea to speak with a representative from your bank before sending a check through the mail.

, You can't deposit any cash into your account this way, so make sure you're just mailing checks. There is typically a fee associated with this kind of transaction, however, so make sure you've exhausted all online and ATM options before you try to mail a check to deposit.

Gather needed information.,
Verify payment status.,
Consider the cost.,
Deal with stolen checks.,
Deal with an unstopped payment.",How to Cancel a Check1," To cancel a check, you must have the legal authority to do so either as an owner of the account or as a legally recognized agent. You will also need certain information to make a cancellation request with your bank:


You need the name or names of the owners of the account on which the check was written. This includes all names on a joint or company account.
You will also need your phone number and the address as it appears on the check.
Make sure you write down the account number on which the check was drawn, the check number, and the date written on the check.
You also need to have the amount for which the check was written and the name of the party to whom the check was made payable.
Your bank will also ask you the reason for the stop payment request, so make sure you know why.;
, Check with the bank to see if the check has cleared. This means that the person you wrote the check to has been paid the amount it was written for. You can ask the person or company that it was issued to. You should also verify the status of the check with your bank. This can be done over the phone or online. You cannot cancel a check that has already been paid.


The cancellation does not take effect immediately. It generally happens at the end of the following business day in most cases.
If it has not cleared, no information is needed from the recipient of the check before making a stop payment.

, There is usually a charge for the service, regardless of whether payment is actually stopped or not. This varies from bank to bank. Depending upon your relationship with the financial institution, fees may not be required or will be forgiven.


If you know there will be a fee, you may not want to place a stop payment because of the extra cost. If a check is worth less than the amount of the fee, let the payment go through. If you receive an overdraft fee, it is about the same price as a stop payment fee at most banks.
Be aware that overdraft fees can be incurred again and again if the money is not replaced., There is no fee for placing a stop payment on lost or stolen blank checks. If your check book is stolen, get a police report right away. This is especially needed if there was more than one check stolen. Then take the report to the bank at the branch where you do business. You may want to consider closing the account and opening another one.


If you want to close your account, the bank will have a manager or a loss-prevention specialist to help you. They can flag your account for special care. They can also help you to transition to a new account as necessary. , You may not always be able to put a stop payment on a check. It also may not always be convenient to do so. A stop payment cannot be processed if you paid with a cashier’s checks or if the check has already been paid. It also cannot go through if there was not enough time to process the request. If you can't cancel the check, try contacting the payee directly. Request that they do not deposit the check or to arrange for reimbursement in another form."

Develop a policy for accepting checks.,
Do not send money to people you don't know.,
Double-check companies.,
Do not spend the funds before the check is verified.,
Avoid working-at-home scams.,
Shy away from foreign investments.,
Refrain from taking unsolicited grants.",How to Spot a Fake Check2," If you run a business, it's essential that you make stringent rules for accepting checks. Do not rely on just a physical examination of the check to protect yourself from fraud. The following are common guidelines for check policies:Checks must be from a local or in-state bank
Checks should not be written and accepted for more than the purchase amount
Checks should not be accepted that are starter checks, unnumbered checks, or non-personalized checks
The customer's complete name and address must appear on the check
The date must be accurate
The check should be signed in your presence and verified with the signature on a photo identification (driver's license, military ID, or state ID)
You may want to write down the person's driver's license number

, If you get a check in the mail that claims that you won a sweepstakes you never entered or that you won the lottery, you should be wary of the check. Often these scams say that this check only represents part of your winnings and is the first of many. They also ask you to send money for taxes on your winnings. This is an obvious sign of a scam. You should never send money to anyone you do not know.


A legitimate company or sweepstakes will never ask you to send money to them. Taxes on such winnings should always be paid directly to the government.
Also never send money through wire transfer under these circumstances. This is the same as sending someone cash. Once the scammer picks it up from the wire service, there is no way to get your money back once you realize it is a scam.

, Many check scams use legitimate businesses as a cover for their corrupt ventures. If you recognize a real company attached to a check you receive and the check looks real, contact the company. Don't use any of the information that was sent with the check. These details could have been created by the person scamming you. Look for information about the company from an independent source to verify if the check you received is real.


Research the company on the web or look up its number in a phone directory. Most businesses will let you know if they sent you a check or if they are participating in a sweepstakes.

, A fake check isn't always spotted by a bank. You may be able to cash a check, even if it is fake. A bank may not know a check is fake until the bank tries to clear the check. This process can take weeks. If you cash the check or deposit the check and then spend the funds, you will be responsible for paying the money back to the bank. It does not matter that the check is a scam or that you were unaware of it being fake.


Do your due diligence to ensure the check is legitimate. Then wait until the check is cleared by the bank before spending the money.
The bank holds you responsible for determining the legitimacy of a check before you try to cash it.
If you fail to comply with the bank's request to return the money, your accounts can be frozen. The bank can also take legal action and sue you for the money.
You can also be charged with fraud, even if you were unaware of the circumstances.

, Some check scams seem like job offers. If you are contacted to be a mystery shopper or an account manager at home, this is likely a scam. Most legitimate companies that hire mystery shoppers will never send you checks or money orders ahead of time.The scammers will likely tell you that all you need to do is deposit the checks or money orders they send you. You take your pay as cash from the checks when you deposit them. Never deposit checks for someone you don't know or try to make money fast by working at home for an unknown business.


Mystery shopping is a legitimate business, but it is not a get-rich-quick opportunity. You are only paid after you complete the necessary tasks and send in a survey form. If you are ever asked to buy something, the company will always reimburse you.
If you think it might be a legitimate mystery shopping opportunity, check with the Mystery Shopping Providers Association.This kind of scam can also apply to many other scenarios where you do a small amount of work from home. A legitimate company would never ask you to deposit checks on their behalf or pay you in such a way., Many scams will write you and ask you to invest in a foreign company or property. They will then send you an check that is an advance on your profits. This is a scam. Never cash a check that is supposed to be an advance on a foreign investment.


You should also avoid investing in anything that you do not perform extensive research on beforehand., If you receive a notification that you received a grant that you did not apply for, this is a scam. Grants are always awarded for a specific purpose. They are not a form of free money. A scam organization may send you a check advance of the amount and ask you to send in some form of payment to get the rest of the grant. The check sent to you is fake and you will lose any money you send to the organization. Real grants are never given unsolicited. You must always apply for grants to receive them.


Grants are also typically given in conjunction with an organization or institution where you will be performing some kind of research, paper, or study."
"
Write ""For Deposit Only"" on the top endorsement line.,
Sign the check on the next line.,
Include your bank's name and your account number.",How to Endorse a Check2," This type of endorsement restricts the way the check can be used, specifying that only the person listed on the face of the check can cash or deposit it.By using this restrictive endorsement, you ensure that if you lose the check or need to have someone else deposit it for you, no one but you will be able to use the funds.


This type of endorsement is most effective if you are mailing your check for deposit, or are giving it to someone else to deposit on your behalf.

, Make sure that you conserve enough space to write the rest of the information you need. This signals that you wish to exercise your rights to the check writer's promise to pay. Your signature is required no matter what type of endorsement you exercise.


Note that if the signature is above ""For Deposit Only,"" the check technically becomes a bearer instrument and could be modified by someone else.

, On the next line down, you can write your bank’s name and your bank account number. This will ensure that the check can only be deposited at the bank you specify, and to the account you have chosen. Make sure you write the number of the account you want the check deposited into.


This is a restrictive endorsement because it specifies the account that you wish the check to be deposited to. This kind of endorsement is useful when you have someone else deposit your check, such as an employee. Anyone who has access to your check will only be able to deposit the check into your account.
While it may be a good idea to protect your check with a restrictive endorsement in some cases, you should also protect your bank account information. Your bank account number is important, and you should protect a check that you have endorsed with your account number to avoid identity theft or fraud. Place the check in a sealed security envelope and only allow people you trust to make deposits for you.

Write ""Pay to the Order of"" on the top line.,
Sign your name.,
Ask the person to sign the check.,
Go with the person to the bank if necessary.",How to Endorse a Check3," After this, write the name of the person you are transferring the check to on the next line. This step transfers the rights to the check's funds from you to the person you have chosen.This step is like writing a brand new check to the person, but he or she will have to sign the check as well.

, You will need to sign your name underneath the printed name of the person to whom you are transferring the check. The person will then have to sign below your signature as well, so try to leave some room above the last grey line.

, Once you have signed your name, the person who you wish to transfer the funds to must also sign the check. He or she should sign the check right under your signature.


After signing the check, the person you have transferred the check to may deposit or cash the check.

, The authorized party should be able to deposit the check, but some cautious banks may require your presence. This may be the case for a large amount or if the person you are transferring the check to is from outside the country.You can try to let the person deposit the check alone first. If the person who you assign the check to can't cash or deposit the check, then you will have to go to the bank with him or her.

"
"
Endorse the check with your business information.,
Add any restrictive endorsements.,
Write your name and title.",How to Endorse a Check4," Write on the grey lines in the endorsement area on the back of the check. On the first line, write the name of your business.


For example, write ""Jim's Hardware Store"" on the first line of the check.
Use this method when a check is made out to your business rather than just to you.

, If you want to add any restrictions, then you can do this before signing the check. Just like personal checks, you can add a restrictive endorsement to your business check, indicating you only want it deposited at the business' bank in a specific account, or you can transfer the rights to the check from the business to another individual or business.


For example, writing ""For Deposit Only"" with your bank and account number ensures the check can only be deposited in one of your business' accounts.
If you want to transfer the check, you can write ""Pay to the Order of"" and the name of another person or business. Once you have written the transfer endorsement, the transferee must endorse the check in order to cash or deposit it.

, If you have not added a restriction, such as ""For Deposit Only,"" this creates an unrestricted endorsement on your business check, meaning that anyone who has access to the check can cash or deposit the check.


For example, you can write ""James Smith, Owner"" beneath your business name.
For your endorsement of a business check to be valid, you must be authorized by the business to do so. Your business account will include the names of the authorized agents, who can make payments and deposits on behalf of the business.
Remember not to add the endorsement until you are ready to cash the check, to protect your check from theft. Once you have signed the check with your title and business name, anyone who has access to the check can cash it as the holder.

Understand what a routing number is.,
Understand the Checksum algorithm.,
Use the Checksum algorithm to find a missing check digit.",How to Calculate the Check Digit of a Routing Number from an Illegible Check1," The routing number is located in the bottom left hand corner of a check. It is a nine-digit number that uniquely identifies you bank and the location where your check was printed.The first four digits are the Federal Reserve routing symbol. This identifies where your check was printed. There are 12 Federal reserve districts and different cities in each district.The next four digits are assigned by the American Bankers Association (ABA). It identifies the financial institution where you opened your account.The ninth digit is the check digit. It is calculated using an algorithm. The check digit is used to validate the 8-digit bank routing number. You can verify the authenticity of a check digit by running the algorithm yourself and comparing the check digit you calculate with the one that is printed on the check.;
, This is the algorithm that is used to validate the authenticity of the routing number. It is a series of multiplication and addition operations performed on the digits in the routing number. With a valid routing number, the sum of the algorithm should be evenly divisible by 10.It is also known as the “Modules 10, Straight Summation” method.Write down the nine digits of the routing number without any non-numeric characters, such as dashes or spaces.
Multiply the first digit by 3, the second digit by 7 and the third digit by 1.
Then, multiply the fourth digit by 3, the fifth digit by 7 and the sixth digit by 1.
Then, multiply the seventh digit by 3, the eighth digit by 7 and the ninth digit by 1.
Add up all of the products, and your answer should be evenly divisible by 10 with no remainders.
For example, using the routing number 789456124, do the following calculation, (7 x 3) + (8 x 7) + (9 x 1) + (4 x 3) + (5 x 7 ) + (6 x 1) + (1 x 3) + (2 x 7) + (4 x 1).
This equals 21 + 56 + 9 + 12 + 35 + 6 + 3 + 14 + 4 = 160. The answer is evenly divisible by 10, so the routing number is valid.

, If the check digit is missing or illegible, you can use the first eight digits to calculate the ninth digit. Knowing that the final result must be evenly divided by 10 allows you to back track and figure out the missing or illegible digit.For example, suppose you only had these first eight digits for the routing number: 02100002. Use the checksum algorithm on the first eight digits, (0 x 3) + (2 x 7) + (1 x 1) + (0 x 3) + (0 x 7 ) + (0 x 1) + (0 x 3) + (2 x 7) = 29.
Find the next highest number that is divisible by 10. In this case the next highest number divisible by 10 after 29 is 30.
Subtract 29 from 30 to get the check digit.
30 – 29 = 1. The check digit is 1.
If the you do the algorithm with the first eight digits and you get a number that is already divisible by 10, then you know that the check digit must be 0.

Take care of other transactions.,
Determine the timeline.,
Deal with the Payee.",How to Cancel a Check2," Once you have all the necessary information, you need to contact your bank, credit union, or savings and loan. You then need to request a cancellation. This can usually be done in by phone or in person in the branch. Make sure you have all the information handy. You don't have to be the person who signed the check, but your name needs to be on the account.


Save your time and theirs by preparing first.
The average amount to cancel a check at the bank is $30 to $35. Check with your bank to find the exact amount you will have to pay.
You shouldn't have a problem stopping payment. The bank is obligated to take the request regardless of the reason you give. They usually just want to know if they need to be on the lookout for fraud., If possible, placing a stop payment online can be easier, faster and cheaper than doing so in person. You can do this through your online banking website. Since your bank already has most of your information attached to your account, it is much easier than trying to do it in person. You should confirm the account number the check was drawn on. You then have to enter the check number, the amount it was written for, who it was written to, and the date written on the check.


This option may result in fees $5-$10 lower than in person.
You can typically find this option from your online banking homepage. If you cannot find it, enter ""Stop Payment” in the search box and follow the links to “Request Stop Payment.” Then you can enter the above information. , You can stop payments on other types of activity on your account other than written checks. Holds can be placed on pre-authorized debits or electronic checks using the same procedures. You just need different information. You will need to know the company name, account number, amount of the transfer, and the Automated Clearing House Merchant ID. You can use the company ID instead. Both of these numbers can be found by looking at the last transaction you had with the company.


You will need to do this 3 business days before the payment is due. This allows time for the cancellation to be processed.
A computer in responsible for taking care of this process. This means that the information needs to be complete and correct. There will not be a person there to figure out the missing information., It is important to ask your bank when the stop payment will take effect. This can be immediately, within 24 hours, or at the end of the next business day. It depends on your bank and the situation. You should also ask how long it stays in effect. Banks will generally get rid of stop payments from the system after 6 months. This can vary.


Make sure you know when the stop payment will be lifted. This will help you avoid unpleasant surprises in case the check is cashed after this time has gone by.
You may also want to place a new stop payment if needed after this time period. , Now that the check is cancelled, you need find other way to arrange payment. Depending on the reason for canceling the check, you may want to make other arrangements with payee of the check. You will probably want to request that the check be returned to you in most cases. You know that stop payment will not remain in effect forever. Getting the check back will make it impossible for it to be cashed once the time period has ended. With this, you avoid having to place a new stop payment again in the future. That means you will not have the cost and hassle again.


If you need to keep the check for your records, you should void the check. Do this by writing VOID in big letters across the check. You should also draw an X from corner to corner. This will make sure that the check can never be cashed.
If you don’t need to keep the check, tear it up. You should not just throw it in the trash. It could be found by someone and cashed after the stop payment date has passed.
There may be some legal ramifications if you stop payment of a check. Make sure you understand the liability of such an action before you go through the trouble of cancelling the check."

Prevent bounced checks and unnecessary bank fees.",How to Balance a Checkbook," You know that extra little notebook that comes with your checks, and slips right into your checkbook? It's designed to help you keep track of your all your income and expenditures and all your transactions, from deposits, ATM withdrawals, debit card usage, fees, to any checks you write.If you do not have a check register, you can buy or make one. A ledger, graph paper, or even a blank sheet of lined paper will do.

, Log on to your account online, call or visit your bank, or visit an ATM and get the current balance on the account you wish to track.Write this balance in the box at the top of the page or on the empty first line with the note ""balance forward"".
There may be checks or electronic debits that haven't cleared yet, so today's figure, while correct, will not account for debits that have not been processed yet. If you're not sure of your exact, current balance, keep an eye on your account and check the balance in the next several days.

, Write down any debit (money being taken out) or credit (money being added) to your account. There should be two columns in your checkbook — one for debits and one for credits. Place the dollar amount being taken away in the debits column and the dollar amount being added in the credit column.Record all checks that you write. Write down the check number, the date, the payee (who you write the check to), and the amount of the check.
Record any withdrawals or payments you make from that account. If you withdraw money from the bank or ATM, or if you purchase something at the store or online using an ATM or debit card, write down the amount of the purchase. If there is a fee for using the ATM, write down that amount also.Record any online bill payments. If your online bill payment service gives you a confirmation code, you may wish to jot this code in your check register next to the payee information.
Record any deposits into your account. If the transaction changes the amount of money in your account, always write it down!

, Doing this will help you can remember what each transaction was for when it is time to balance your checkbook.


Use specific categories like food, utilities, mortgage, dining out, etc.

, Try to touch base with them often about any transactions done using the account so you can each record the payments and the current balance of the account in your individual checkbooks.


If you are balancing multiple accounts, keep a separate register for each account so they are easy to track.

, You can do this after a transaction, or less frequently, such as when you sit down to do your bills.If you have a history of bounced checks or an overdrawn account, you should re calculate your balance after every transaction or every other transaction.
Subtract the amount of any expense, payment, check, or withdrawal from the total. Include transfers out of the account in this subtraction.
Add the amount of any deposit, credit, or transfer into the account to the total.
Subtract all your debits from your credits. You should end up with a positive number. Write the new balance after each transaction in the rightmost column.

, When your bank statement arrives, compare your check register to your statement and check off which transactions have cleared.Add any interest that the bank has paid you.
Subtract any fees that the bank has charged you.
Check that the transactions in your account register match what is on your statement. Make sure your recorded balance matches what the bank thinks you have, not including any transactions that haven't yet cleared and aren't listed on the statement.

, If you find any discrepancies between your numbers and your bank's numbers, figure out where they came from and correct them.Double-check your math. Make sure you added and subtracted everything correctly since the checkbook last balanced correctly.
Look for missing transactions. Did you forget to write something down? Has something not cleared or have you recorded something that happened after the statement date?
Subtract the balance in your check register from the balance on the statement. Does the amount match the amount of one of the transactions? If so, that transaction has probably not been accounted for correctly yet.
If the difference between the balance in your checkbook and the balance on your statement has an even number of pennies, divide the difference by 2. Does this new amount match the amount of one of the transactions? If so, that transaction was probably added instead of subtracted or vice versa.

, The money taken out for checks and other payments may not be taken out immediately. If you think a check or other payment has not yet cleared, subtract the amount of that check from the bank's balance and see if it matches yours.


One way to stay on top of this is to check your account regularly and put check marks next to every check that has already cleared.

, Call or visit your bank to discuss any suspicious charges or charges that are not accounted for in your checkbook and you do not remember making and discuss possible refund options.Always make sure you report any suspected fraud on your account, even if it may end up being a charge you simply forgot about or threw away the receipt for.

, Once everything is balanced you may want to draw double lines under the balanced amount in your check register. That way the next time you go to balance you have an idea of the last known correct amount in your register.This will also remind you where an error is in the check register for the next time you balance your checkbook.

, Balancing your checkbook probably seems like something only your grandpa does in today's modern age. But many financially responsible people still balance their checkbook so in the rare event the bank commits an error, you can recognize it and get it corrected.Think about it: If all you do is look at your bank or credit card statement to make sure your monthly transactions are correct, it will likely be difficult to tell if your bank makes a mistake. And their mistake will then be your loss.

, Because you know exactly what you have in your bank account based on your balanced checkbook, you will be able to budget your money easily and avoid spending money you don’t have on things you don’t need.Keeping your relationship with your money honest will prevent you from overspending or under budgeting and help you save.

, If you're writing a check, chances are you may not have your current bank statement in front of you, so you may not know how much money you have in your account. Having a balanced check book will help you determine whether you have the necessary funds to write the check and feel assured the check will not bounce.Most banks charge a bounced check fee. Some banks waive fees if you have direct deposit set up for your paycheck. Ask your bank if you're not sure about the fees they charge.
Keep in mind deposited checks, depending on the amount, will take some time to “post”; that is, the money may not appear in your account immediately. Some banks offer provisional credit from the deposit, such as releasing $300 or $1000 of the funds and holding the remaining amount for 2 - 5 business days, and some don't offer any provisional credit.

If possible, choose a checkbook calculator with latches. The latches hook onto the checkbook cover and helps to prevent the calculator from slipping out of the checkbook.;
,


If you are managing more than one bank account or card, select a calculator that can handle several accounts. For example, if you have a checking account, savings account and a credit card, select a calculator that will allow you to manage all three accounts.
Select a checkbook calculator that allows password protection. Using a password will keep your financial information safe in the even your checkbook is stolen. After setting up your password, be sure to store it in a safe place.
Choose a checkbook calculator that is aesthetically pleasing. Checkbook calculators come in a variety of colors and styles. For example, you can choose a calculator that has raised or flat buttons, or is battery or solar powered.
Some checkbook calculators also have a sales tax feature, which makes calculating your exact purchase amount easier.

,


Many check printing companies also make checkbook calculators. Purchasing a checkbook calculator from the same manufacturer as your checks will ensure the checks will fit into the checkbook calculator case.

Learn the history of check routing numbers.,
Understand the Federal Reserve routing symbol.,
Understand the ABA institution identifier.,
Understand the check digit.,
Understand the fractional form of the routing number.",How to Calculate the Check Digit of a Routing Number from an Illegible Check2," Prior to 1910, banks had no uniform system for identifying checks written from different banks. In 1911, the American Bankers Association (ABA) published a book listing all of the nation’s financial institutions and assigned identifying numbers to each of them. They established the Routing Number Administration Board govern the use and retirement of routing numbers.The two forms of routing numbers still in use today are the fractional form and the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) form.
The MICR form is used for automated processing of checks. The numbers and symbols are printed with special shapes that can be read by automated reading equipment. This font is used on all U.S. and Canadian checks, deposit slips and e-commerce drafts.The fractional form is outdated and was used when checks were hand-sorted. It still appears on checks along with the MICR form and it can be used if the MICR number is illegible. You can find it in the upper right hand corner of the check.
The MICR form routing number is printed in the lower left hand corner of the check in a 5/8-inch band.

, The first four digits identify the location where the check was printed. The first two digits refer to one of the 12 Federal Reserve districts. The third digit identifies a specific office of the Federal Reserve bank within the district. The fourth digit refers to geographic areas within a territory., Each financial institution receives a unique four-digit identifying number from the ABA. This makes up the second four digits of the routing number. The ABA institution identifier may be anywhere from one to four digits. Because it must take up four digits in the routing number, a number with less than four digits will have zeroes before it on the check., The check digit verifies the accuracy of the routing number. It helps to maintain the integrity of electronic and telecommunications transactions. It can be calculated with the algorithm, or programmers can use a Java Script code to validate the routing number., This appears in the upper right-hand corner of the check. It is a multi-digit fraction that has a hyphenated numerator and a three- or four-digit denominator. It includes the Federal Reserve routing symbol and the ABA institution identifier."
"
Understand why banks need to read routing numbers on checks.,
Banks use routing numbers to automate several common financial transactions.,
Find your routing number.",How to Calculate the Check Digit of a Routing Number from an Illegible Check3," When processing your check, financial institutions need a reliable way of identifying your bank. It is important that they do not confuse it with other banks.Sometimes banks have similar names, so relying on the name of a financial institution alone could result in confusion.
Some banks may have more than one routing number, depending on its location or the type of check being used. But no two banks will ever have identical routing numbers.

, Routine tasks such as direct deposit and automatic bill transfers rely on accurate routing numbers. The routing number is also used to facilitate money transfers, such as cashing checks or wiring money.Since the numbering system and MICR form are consistently used across all financial institutions, these automated tasks can be processed with hardly any delay.

, The routing number is printed on the bottom left-hand corner of your check. Also, some banks may publish their routing numbers online. This is helpful for customers who need the routing numbers for wire transfers or other transactions.Having your bank’s routing number so easily available is not a security risk. It only becomes a security risk if someone has your routing number and your account number.

Do not use glasses with jagged cut tops or broken shards. While you don’t need the glass to be in perfect condition, it does need to be free of cracks and other vulnerable areas that could make it prone to further damage. Also ensure that you choose the right stemware. For example : A champagne flute can't be used because it's too thin unless if you have a thin candle.


There muse be enough of a stem left to stick into the ground. If not, you'll need to glue a dowel or something similar onto the glass bowl to make up for the lack of a stem.;

Choose from a variety of decorative candle lanterns in different shapes, styles, and designs.,
Always look for the glass protection.,
Use outdoor lanterns to achieve a beautiful effect created by the dim, flickering light of the candles.,
Use outdoor candle lanterns to line a driveway, pathway, or any other area where you'd like people to walk.,
Use candle lanterns to brighten a gazebo or other garden structure being used for late evening meals and entertainment.

",How to Use Outdoor Decorative Candle Lanterns," From glass candle lanterns to metals based decorative lanterns, there is a design likely to work for your needs.


Four-sided metal lanterns with glass windows are the most common types of candle lanterns. The windows should move easily for placing a candle inside.
Wooden decorative lanterns are an equally good choice. Housing a large clear glass pane, these lanterns usually have two slopes on both sides where lower slope contains a steep angle than the upper slope.;
, Regardless of the shape and size, the main highlight of every decorative candle lantern is its glass windows. This is the means by which you can prevent the candle from blowing out when outside, as well as having its light clearly seen wherever it's placed outside.


The glass can be engraved in various stylish patterns and designs, while some are decorated with metal silhouettes or have historical designs imprinted on them.

, Use for an evening celebration outdoors or a romantic candlelit dinner on the beach, where using a candle without covering is impossible.

, This can be excellent for Halloween, to guide trick and treaters to your door safely.

Select a clear glass jar or cup.,
Choose the colored tissue paper.,
Dip the paintbrush into the Mod Podge, allowing excess Mod Podge to drip back into the container.,
Add the tissue paper pieces to the outside of the jar or cup.,
Continue onto the next sections until the whole jar or cup has been papered.,
Add the sealant layer.,
Allow to dry completely before use.,
Slip a tea light candle into the jar.,
Place the peaceful lantern wherever it's needed.",How to Make Peaceful Lanterns Out of Jars," The jar or cup must be wide enough for a candle to be placed inside of it with ease.;
, You can have a single color or you can mix up a few colors, or even make a rainbow effect. Obviously, the more colors you have, the more effort you'll need to put into arranging them in a suitable pattern as you attach them. Cut the tissue into neat squares or other suitable shapes.


Cut with care. Tissue paper tends to tear easily.

, It is really important that there is just enough Mod Podge on the brush, not dripping with it, as it may tear the tissue paper if saturated.


It helps to rub the brush against the side of the pot to remove excess Mod Podge.

, Paint the jar with Mod Podge in sections at a time. Perhaps begin at the base and work your way up, or vice versa, turning the jar to complete one section at a time. Once an area of the jar has been painted with the Mod Podge, affix tissue paper pieces to it with care. Overlap the tissue paper to make clean joins.

, Be sure to cover the base of the jar or cup as well. Allow to dry completely.

, Once again, dip the paintbrush into the Mod Podge, ensuring that there isn't an excess of Mod Podge on the paintbrush. Paint gently and carefully over the tissue paper on the outside of the jar or cup.


As you paint, be sure to paint down any pieces of paper that might be sticking up at an awkward angle. This will neaten the whole effect.

, Once dried, the peaceful lantern is ready for use.

, If battery-operated, turn it on before adding it. If a real candle, place it first, then use a long-handled match to light it.

, This lantern will windproof any flame, so it can be used outdoors as well as inside. It's ideal for mood lighting, as a table centerpiece or to simply glow away at an outdoor party.

Select the jar.,
Draw a design.",How to Make a Bejeweled Tea Light Candle Holder1," The best type of jar is one that is short, squat and has a wide mouth. Suitable jars would include large baby food jars, salsa jars and small, wide condiment jars.


Wash out the jar, remove all labels and glue blobs and let dry.;
, Based on the artificial gemstones, sequins, buttons, glitter and whatever else you've got to decorate with, plan the design you'd like for the jar. It helps to draw it on paper and match the decorative elements to the drawing, checking that you have enough pieces to complete the design. This will make it easy to follow when putting the jar together.


A simple but very effective design is to arrange a gemstone at even intervals around the center of the jar. Then, use a marker suitable for writing on glass to create a border around the gemstones. This is the design that will be used to explain the process for the remainder of the article.
If using for a wedding, party or other special occasion, try matching the colors to the theme of the event.

"
Draw the marker design on the jar first.,
Glue the jewels in place.,
Add any extras.,
Allow everything to dry completely.",How to Make a Bejeweled Tea Light Candle Holder2," If you're drawing anything on the jar, do it before gluing on the jewels. It'll be harder to do this if anything is already glued onto the jar.


In the example for this article, draw two horizontal lines spaced apart evenly right the way around the middle of the jar. Leave enough room within the two lines for adding the gemstones. Then, draw evenly spaced vertical lines all the way around the middle, in between the two horizontal lines.

, Following your plan, glue each jewel in place and hold firmly in place for at least 10 seconds, or as long as instructed by the glue manufacturer.


For the example in this article, glue each jewel at even intervals around the band you've drawn on the glass jar, inside the horizontal lines.

, You don't have to add more than the bejeweled objects. However, there is no harm in adding more things if you'd like, such as glitter or sequins. Follow your plan.

, When it's dry, it's ready to use.

Pick up enough mason jars to light up your party.,
Obtain your lighting element.,
Grab a pair of sharp scissors.",How to Make Mason Jar Glow Stick Lanterns1," Preferably new jars so that all you will need to do is wipe out the inside and outside with a damp rag. If you are removing food from the jars, rinse well and either put them in the dishwasher or scrub with hot water and soap. Allow jars to dry before beginning your project.









Make sure each jar has a well-fitting lid. You will need to top the jar with the lid and shake to create the illumination. If the lid doesn’t fit properly, the glow stick material could spill.;
, Purchase several glow sticks--approximately one per jar.








, You’ll want to make a clean cut along the top of the glow stick in order to extract the liquid.








"
"
Wipe jars clean and then dry.,
Cover your work area with newspaper or a drop cloth.,
Hold the glow stick directly over the mason jar and snip the top with the scissors.,
Pour the glow stick liquid directly into the mason jar.,
Replace the mason jar lid and screw on tightly.,
Shake the mason jar to activate the glow stick material and cover the mason jar with liquid.",How to Make Mason Jar Glow Stick Lanterns2," If you are working with new mason jars, all you’ll need to do is use a microfiber cloth to wipe the inside and outside.








, Even though you may not spill glow stick material, you don’t want to take any chances. Take precautions before you break open the sticks.








, Make sure you don't end up having to make several rough cuts as it could create a mess. A sharp pair of scissors should produce a clean cut along the top of the stick.








, Hold a paper towel in the opposite hand so when you are done pouring you can grasp the open end with the paper towel and swiftly (and cleanly) discard the empty glow stick.








, A tight fit is very important in order to avoid a huge mess.








, The coverage will provide for more of a glow and remain illuminated for several hours.

Get a solid-colored paper lantern and open it up.,
Draw a tail fin shape onto a sheet of construction paper, then cut it out with a pair of scissors.,
Make the base of the tail.,
Attach the fin to the lantern.,
Draw two side fin shapes, then cut them out.,
Attach the fins to the side of the lantern.,
Cut two circles out of white construction paper, and two circles out of black construction paper to make the eyes.,
Attach the eyes to the fish.,
Thread some string through the top of the fish so that you can hang it.,
Hang the loop from a hook wherever you want.,
Get a solid-colored paper lantern and open it up.,
Trace a circle that is the same size as the smaller opening on your lantern onto a sheet of tissue paper.,
Trace a larger circle around the first circle.,
Cut the circles out, then save the ring.,
Use a glue stick to glue the ring onto the smaller opening.,
Cut two circles out of white tissue paper, and two smaller circles out of black cardstock or construction paper.,
Glue the black circles onto the white circles, then the white circles onto the lantern.,
Cut out two top fin shapes out of tissue paper.,
Glue them together, except for the bottom ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters).,
Fold the loose ends of the fin down to create two flaps, then attach it to the fish.,
Cut out two side fins out of matching tissue paper, then attach them to the sides of the fish.,
Cut out two tail shapes out of matching tissue paper.,
Glue them together, except for the bottom few inches.,
Fold the loose ends out to create flaps, then attach them to the back of the fish.,
Use a needle to thread clear string through the top of the fish.,
Tie the string into a loop, then hang your fish.",How to Make Goldfish Paper Lanterns," Most goldfish are orange, but yours can be any color you want.;
, Make the base of the tail straight so that you can attach it to the lantern. Be sure to draw the tail ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) longer than you want it to be.


Choose a color that closely matches the color of your lantern.

, Fold the base of the tail down by ½ to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.54 centimeters) to make a flap. Cut a slit into the middle of the flap, all the way down to the folded edge to create two flaps. Leave one of the flaps the way it is, and fold the other one to the back of the fin. You will now have two flaps, with each one pointing in a different direction. This will not only allow the tail to flap about, but also make it easier to glue on., Turn the lantern so that one of the holes is facing up. Use a hot glue gun or double-sided tape to attach the tail to the side of the lantern.

, To make the fins even, stack two sheets of construction paper one on top of the other first, draw your fin shape, then cut it out. You don't need to make the base of the fins flat or straight.

, Find the middle of the lantern, then attach the bottom tip of the fin with a drop of glue or a small piece of double-sided tape. Repeat this step for the other side of the fish with the other fin.


Don't glue the entire fin down. You want it to stick out.

, Make sure that the black circles are smaller. You can also use printer paper and cardstock for this.


Another alternative would be to use large googly eyes; make sure that they are proportionate to your fish!, Position them in front of the side fins and just above them. You can attach them using double-sided tape or a hot glue gun. If you are using googly eyes, however, a hot glue might be the better option.

, Thread a piece of string through the bar in the top hole of your lantern, then tie it into a loop.


If your lantern doesn't have a bar, poke two small holes in the top of the lantern, just below the ring opening.

, These lanterns make great decorations for underwater themed parties and rooms. Be careful not to get them wet, however!

, The smaller your lantern is, the easier it will be to work with. Look for something that is about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) in diameter. Most goldfish are orange, but you can make your goldfish any color you want.

, Choose a different color than your lantern. It can be lighter, darker, or even a contrasting color.


Make the circle as even as you can. If possible, use a pencil to trace around to smaller opening of the lantern.
If both of the openings are the same size, simply choose one of them.

, How much space you leave between the two circles depends on the size of you lantern. The bigger your lantern is, the more space you will need. Start with ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and go from there.

, Discard the inner circle, or save it for another project.

, This will create an open mouth for the goldfish. If you have any excess tissue paper hanging over the opening, you can trim it off with a pair of scissors, or fold it into the lantern and secure it with more glue., If you don't have any white tissue paper, you can use white printer paper instead.

, Glue the white circles above the ""mouth"" and slightly to the side.

, Stack two sheets of tissue paper, then cut a fin shape out; this way, you will end up with two matching fins. Use a color that matches your lantern.


Most top fins will be long and somewhat skinny. Make sure that yours is at least 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) tall.

, Use a pair of scissors to trim of any overhanging tissue paper. The double tissue paper layer will help the top fin stand up., Place a strip of double-sided tape to each flap, then place the fin on top of the fish. Run your finger across the top of each flap to seal the tape.

, You can use a glue stick or double-sides tape for this. Make sure that you are only gluing the bottom edge so that the fins can flap around. You don't have to create double layers for these or fold any flaps.


The side fins can be as long and flowing as you'd like.

, Stack two sheets of tissue paper, then cut a tail fin out; you will end up with two identical shapes. You will be fitting the tail over the back hole on your lantern, so be sure to add ½ of the hole's width, plus an additional ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters).

, How much you leave unglued depends on the excess amount you added. Once again, use a pair of scissors to trim off any overhanging pieces of tissue paper., Position the tail over the back opening. Fold the excess tissue paper over the edges of the opening, then glue or tape them down onto the body of the fish., Be sure to go under one of the metal ribs to prevent the tissue paper from tearing.

, This fish makes a great decoration for parties or underwater themed rooms. Be careful not to get it wet, however!

Blow out the candle's light.,
Reach into the candle with a knife, when the candle is burned down to the point where the wax is only 1/4 to 1/3 thick.,
Use a paper towel to wipe out the candle jar.,
Place a dishcloth, folded four ways, into the bottom of a saucepan large enough to hold the jar.,
Fill the jar with room temperature water right to the top so that it overflows.,
Turn on the heat under the pan no higher than medium.,
Check the water temperature using a probe or stick thermometer.,
Use a ladle or small dipper to carefully pour hot water into the full jar, making it overflow into the pan.








,
Turn off the heat from the stove, and let the water settle to room temperature.








,
Let the remaining wax solidify on the water's surface.








,
Pour the remaining water through a sieve and knock the wax chips into the trash.








,
Scrub the inside of the jar with a bottle brush and hot, soapy water.",How to Clean a Candle Jar1,"






;
, Push the point into the wax several times in a line until the candle puck cracks. It should come out in one or two pieces. These can be remelted for other candles later, so save them.








, This should remove some of the carbon or oil film found on some non-paraffin wax candles. This will also remove most of the flakes and chips of wax left over from removing the wax puck.








, Place the jar on the cloth.








, Add room temperature water to the pan so that it comes up to the side of the jar.








, Do not leave this jar unattended from here on in. Depending on the candle, the waxes melt at different temperatures. The column candles that you often see in Hispanic stores or in roadside memorials melt at very low temperatures, some can be spooned out at room temperature. This wax is not good to add to other waxes.








, Turn the heat down when the temperature reaches 140° - 160°. Paraffin, bees wax, and soy wax all melt at different temperatures. You don't want this to just be melted, you want the wax to be as liquid as possible. The wax chips should all be melted and floating on the top of the water at this point.








,,,,, You shouldn't need an abrasive cloth. What's left should come right out.

Choose your mason jars depending on how big you want the light to be.,
Find a pendant or hanging light kit from your local hardware store.,
Buy funky, fun bulbs that fit in your jar and match the light kit's specification.,
Clean and dry your mason jars with soap and water.,
Optionally, color your jars before adding bulbs for tinted lights.",How to Make Mason Jar Lights1," You can find vintage mason jars at antique stores or find canning jars online or in kitchen supply stores. In some locations, they sell canning jars by the dozen at supermarkets. Canning jars come in varying sizes, including 8 oz., 1 pint and 1 quart. The bigger the jar, the bigger your bulb can be and the brighter the light.


For the average bulb (60 watts), a normal 12-ounce jar should be perfect.;
, These kits are commonly sold in order to light paper or other lanterns. Ikea, in particular, sells a kit designed for simple DIY projects like this, but other retailers should have kits as well. They can be hung from a hook, strung along ceilings or walls and plugged into an electrical outlet.

, Look at the wattage requirements for the light kit. Each socket should specify what watts are required. Then, as long as the bulb fits, you can use any design or light type to fit into your kit., Clean them out the best you can, then dry them by hand to prevent water spots from forming. Make sure you get any dust and dirt off the inside of the jar.








, You can color clear canning jars with food coloring and Elmer's glue. Pour 1 cup of glue into a disposable bowl. Stir in the food coloring that you want to use until it is mixed well. Apply it to the inside of the mason jar with a foam brush. Allow it to dry overnight.You can also use decoupage glue; just be certain that whatever glue you use is easy to apply and dries clear.
You can also spray paint your lid and light fixtures to match if you want a more elegant light. Try a copper, silver, or gold spray paint."

Unscrew the connector from the end of the light kit.,
Trace the end of the hanging light kit on the top of the jar.,
Use a hammer and small nail to punch a hole in the lid somewhere on your line.,
Continue punching holes around the circle until you've ""cut"" out the hole for the light.,
Thread the light fixture into the hole in your lid, then screw the connector back on.,
Optionally, use modeling clay or super glue to close the seam between the light fixture and the lid.,
Screw your light bulb into the light fixture, then screw the top into the jar.,
Place hooks in the ceiling where you want your pendant lamp to hang.,
Call an electrician to install pendant lights within your ceiling or walls.",How to Make Mason Jar Lights2," This is the big, circular piece the holds the light in place. Take it off, leaving just the cylindrical light fixture at the end of your light kit for now., Take the end of your hanging light (where the bulb is screwed in) and trace it out on the lid of the mason jar. You'll need to punch through this top to get the light in.









Make sure you're using both parts of the lid -- the round, flat piece and the circular ""cuff"" that screws on.

, This is the simplest set of tools to use, but you can also use a power drill if you have one on hand. Punch a small hole into the lid using the nail or your drill, then remove the nail.









Punch along the inside of your tracing line. You'd rather make it a bit too small at first than too large.

, Use your hammer and nail to keep working around your traced circle until it falls out.








If you have a pair of tin cutters or strong scissors, you can use these to speed up the process., Make sure that the wire runs out of the jar and the light fixture points into it. If you need, use the back of your hammer to bend back any sharp or rough edges in the jar. The connector, however, should keep the whole light fixture in place on the lid.









If the hole is a little small, push and twist to try and get it through and keep a nice tight seal between the light and lid.

, While few people will notice a rough cut on the top of a light, you can tighten this connection easily with a hard, quick-drying adhesive. While it will not affect the light much, it can prevent the fixture from wiggling around if your cut isn't snug.

, Turn it on to make sure it works, and voila!








, If your pendant light cord is covered in thick plastic, you may be able to knot it and hang the light from a hook from the knot for more support.


Aim to install your hooks in a ceiling beam. They can fall if they are simply screwed into plaster.You can also make 2 or 3 similar pendant lights and knot the chords together. Hang them from 1 sturdy ceiling hook to create a larger light fixture.

, If you want your mason jar lights to hang directly from the ceiling, you should not try to install them on your own, unless you have extensive experience with electrical wiring. Alternatively, you can string the cord along your wall or ceiling, outside of the wall plaster, and plug it into an electrical outlet."

Form a base for your lantern.,
Cut paper panels.,
Glue the first panel to the wire frame.,
Glue the remaining panels.,
Decorate your lantern (optional).,
Finish off your lantern.",How to Make a Japanese Paper Lantern1," The most important thing to buy is bendable metal wire. This can usually be found at arts and crafts stores, as well as hardware stores. Instead of forming your own metal structure, you can also buy pre-made metal wire structures which can save you time. You will also need to buy:Tissue paper (different colors)
Super glue or hot glue
Scissors
Hole-punch
String
Wire cutters
Acrylic or watercolor paint (optional);
, Unless you are exceptionally skilled at making wire forms, you’ll need a guide. If you want a rounded lantern, find an appropriately sized ball, bowl, vase, tin can, etc. to wrap the wire around. If you want a polygonal lantern, either find a suitable object to wrap the wire around or make a unique mold out of scrap materials., Start by wrapping the wire once around the bottom end of your form. Continue wrapping around your frame in a spiral until you get to the top. Since the amount of wire you need will depend on the size of the lantern and tightness of the spirals, it may be a good idea to use wire directly off the spool instead of cutting it in advance.








Leave an opening at both the top and bottom of your wire frame. A totally enclosed lantern will trap heat and become a fire hazard.
Try to keep your wire wraps about 1/2 inch apart from one another.
Be sure to leave a length of free wire at either end of your mold.

, Be prepared to resize and reshape the frame when you’re done, as it may spring open slightly after removal. Depending on the shape, you may need to pull your wire frame completely open in order to retrieve the mold. Do this gently so that you can reshape it easily when you’re done.







, Where the top- and bottom-most spirals end (and become extra wire), attach the extra wire to the nearest spiral in the frame to preserve the shape of the opening. You can do this by either wrapping the wire or with a soldering iron.








This should only use a bit of your extra wire. Make sure you have some left for additional structuring.
For more information on soldering, visit: How to Solder Wire Sculptures


, Be sure to choose the opening that will have the lamp cord (if hanging) or lamp base (if upright) sticking through it. Your exact design will depend on the structure of the lamp you put the lantern on.








If you plan to hang your lantern, run the extra wire at the top of the frame straight across the top opening, looping it once in the middle before wrapping or soldering it to the other side. When the lantern is ready to hang, you will run the lamp cord through this loop, tying a knot underneath to hold the lantern in place.
If your lantern will sit atop a lamp, run the extra wire at the bottom of the frame straight across the bottom opening, looping it once in the middle before wrapping or soldering it to the other side. Be sure the loop is large enough to accommodate the structure that will poke up through the bottom of the lantern.
Depending on the lamp, you may also need to do make structural adjustments to the opposite opening of the lantern.

, With a polygonal frame, this will be relatively simple because your paper will be roughly rectangular. With a round frame, you'll have to experiment with small strips or almond-shaped panels of paper. When it comes to round frames, the smaller the pieces of paper, the smoother the final look will be. As you cut each piece, lay them gently against your wire structure to see how the paper fits against it.








Decide how many panels you need. For a square or rectangular frame, you can either create a separate panel for each side or wrap the entire sides with one sheet.
Cut the panels a little larger than they need to be so they can overlap. Don't worry if you make a mistake and miss a spot. You can always come back and cut a new piece of paper to cover the empty spot.

, It is best to use either hot glue or super glue, as regular school








Once you are done, let the structure have a few minutes to dry completely.

, From here on, you will be able to glue at least one edge of each panel to the neighboring panel. Remember to wait until each panel is dry before adding another. If you realize you do not have enough paper strips to cover the entire structure, go back and cut some more. There should be no remaining space between strips when you are done.







, Lanterns often have characters or designs painted onto the sides. You may also want to paint your paper a solid color, or perhaps stripes. You may even want to add a traditional Japanese design, such as flowers, nature, or native Japanese animals.For more information on how to watercolor paint, visit: How to Paint With Watercolors.
For more information on how to paint with acrylics, visit: How to Acrylic Paint.

, This step is only for those hanging their lanterns. Use a hole-punch to punch a hole into the paper of your lantern. You will want two holes at the top of your structure, one directly across from the other. Cut a piece of string that is at least 12 inches long (length will vary depending on how and where you will hang the lantern). Feed the string from the outside in, into each hole. Tie a knot on each end of the string to hold the lantern as it hangs.

, Lay your piece of construction paper on a flat surface that is safe to paint on. You may want to lay some old newspapers down first so that you do not damage your painting surface. If you are using acrylic paint, apply a small amount of paint to a clean paper plate. Dip your paintbrush into the paint, and apply it to the construction paper in small brushstrokes.








If you are using watercolor paints, add a tiny bit of paint to a paper plate. Then, fill a jar of cool water and keep it next to the paper plate as you paint. Add a small amount of water to the paint on the paper plate. Dip your brush into the paint and dab it onto the construction paper in small brushstrokes. Continuously add water when the paint starts to dry up.

While you can paint any design you wish, traditional Japanese designs usually include flowers, nature, and animals native to the country of Japan. If you wish to go the more traditional Japanese route, you can visit https://learnodo-newtonic.com/famous-japanese-artists-and-paintings as a general guide.
After you have painted your design, give your piece of paper at least a day to fully dry.

, First, you will need to fold your paper in half length wise (join the short ends of the paper together). Make a solid crease, either with your hand, or a semi-heavy object like a paperweight. Take your ruler, and mark a 1








Next, take your ruler to the folded edge. Make a small pencil mark every 1/2 inch (should be 23 marks in total for a piece of paper 12 inches wide). Then take your ruler, and line up each of these marks, with the 1/2 inch line you previously drew. Connect each of these marks to that 1/2 inch line.
Take your pair of scissors and cut along each of these lines. However, do not cut the 1/2 inch line you drew near where the short edges meet.

, After you have finished cutting, open your folded paper up. Take the two long ends of the paper and bring them together with your hands (overlapped by about 1








After the paper is compressed slightly, and you have joined together the two long ends, hold the lantern in position.
Staple the long edges together. It might be best for you to hold the lantern in the proper position as another friend or relative staples the ends together.
After you have the ends stapled together, you can then go back over the joined edges with clear tape. This will keep your lantern from falling apart.

, Each of the strips should be a different color than the rest of your lantern (the strips themselves can be the same color as each other). Use a ruler to measure out two rectangles that are 1








Apply some glue (super glue or regular glue) to the backside of one of the strips. Wrap the strip around the top of the lantern, where you did not previously cut into. Hold the strip there for five minutes, or until the glue is dry.
Repeat the previous step, except this time, wrap the second strip on the bottom of the lantern.

, Use a hole-punch to punch two holes through the top part of your lantern, one directly across from the other. Next, cut a piece of string at least 12 inches long (length will vary depending on how and where you will hang the lantern). Feed each end of the string through the top, inside of the lantern, each end going through one of the holes. Pull the string through each hole and tie a knot on each end. Your lantern is now ready to hang."

Gather your materials:


Glue (stick or liquid is fine)
Glue dots and/or tape
Scissors
Piece of blank paper
Felt pens (for drawing)
Thicker paper or thin cardboard for the lid and base
Rope or twine (for hanging)
A battery-powered tea light candle (aka an electric tea light);
,
Draw a design on a blank piece of paper.,
Fold the paper into vertical strips, like a fan or accordion.,
Curve the folded paper into a circle and fasten the ends together.,
Cut 2 circles out of thicker paper for your lid and base.,
Fasten the base on to the bottom of the lantern.,
Poke 2 small holes in the lantern for rope.,
Cut the rope and fasten it to the lantern.,
Cut a hole in the lid and feed rope through it.,
Place an electric tea light in the lantern.,
Enjoy your homemade lantern!",How to Make a Lantern1,", It can be a design of your choosing. A standard piece of white printer paper will work fine. Use felt pens — paints and pencil crayons will block the candle’s light more.


If you’re feeling creative, you can use other colors of paper. Just make sure the paper’s not so thick that the candle’s light can’t shine through it.
The thinner the paper is, the better, although tracing paper will be too thin — you still want it to be strong!
A colorful design with strong black lines will look nice.

, To do this correctly, make sure you always have your first fold sitting at the top of the stack of folds that you’re making. It shouldn’t fold under any other paper — all the other paper should fold under it.


Think of it as kind of a back-and-forth motion: each time you make a new fold, the sheet of unfolded paper will be in front of or behind your folded strip.
The more careful and precise you are with your folds, the better the lantern will look.
Feel free to experiment with the width of the folds to see what you like best.

, To fasten the ends together, apply glue or tape to the last fold on one side of the paper, and place the last fold of the other side of the paper on top of it.


You could use double tape on both folds so that when you overlap them, they’ll be extra secure.
Be sure to hold the sides together for a moment to ensure that they’re securely fastened.

, These should be the same size. To know how large to make them, place your lantern on top of the paper you’ll use, and lightly trace around it.


Cut just inside the line you draw so that the base and lid won’t stick out from your lantern.
Make sure the paper is sturdy enough to support the weight of an electric tea light and the lantern itself.

, You can do this with a good glue or tape, or a combination of the two for added sturdiness.


If you're worried about the glue being strong enough to keep the base fastened to the lantern, consider using melted glue from a hot glue gun instead. Just be careful that you don’t burn yourself!

, Use a pen, hole punch, or the tip of your scissors to poke 2 small holes near the top of the lantern (1/2 to 1 inch down from the top is good).


The holes should be right across from each other so that the lantern hangs evenly.
Imagine if you poked a stick straight through one side of the lantern and it came out the other. This is how you want the holes to sit.

, Think of it as putting a handle on the lantern. You’ll attach the “handle” to the lantern by feeding the rope through the holes in the sides of the lantern, and then tying knots.


Start on the inside of the lantern and tie knots in the rope on the outside of the hole you’ve fed it through.
The length of your rope will depend on how low you want the lantern to hang, which will depend on where you want to hang it.

, Cut a hole in the center of the lid and then slide it down over the rope so that it sits near the top of the lantern, just inside of it.


To keep the lid from coming up too easily, you can place a couple of rubbery glue dots on the rope so that it holds on to the lid when the lid presses down on it.
You do want the lid to be easily liftable as this is how you’ll access the candle, so don’t fasten it permanently to the lantern.

, If you’re going to use the lantern right away, you can already turn the tea light on.


Note that in the image an actual tea light is shown, but using an actual tea light is not advisable as it presents a fire hazard.

, If you do decide to use a real candle in this lantern, make sure that you don’t hang it somewhere windy; if the lantern is tilted with a real candle inside it, it could easily catch on fire.

Grab a piece of construction paper in the color of your choice.,
Start making creases.,
Unfold the rims.,
Cut slits from the middle to the rims with scissors.,
Unfold the paper.,
Construct your handle.,
Add embellishments.",How to Make a Lantern for the Holidays1," You may want to choose one that identifies the holiday, such as green for Christmas or orange for Halloween.


For this specific project, you'll need to cut the construction paper so that it is 6 inches by 9 inches (15.2 by 22.9 cm) in size. Though, for the record, any rectangular size, within reason, will do.;
, Fold the paper in half lengthwise. Crease with a bone folder or straight edge for an angled, oriental feel. Avoid creasing if you want something more romantic and softer.









Then, fold the top, open edges down by 1/2 inch (1.3 cm). Crease with a bone folder. These will be your rims at the top and bottom of the lantern, once it is finished -- you will not be cutting into them.

, Glue a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) strip of decorative scrapbooking paper in a holiday design to your rims. You could also use a complimentary color of construction paper. And, of course, you may leave them the original color, but the extra spark really makes them pop.








, This is easiest if you hold the paper so that the folded edge is facing downward. Space your slits approximately 3/4 of an inch (1.9 cm) apart. If your last slit is too thick or too thin, that's fine. You can combine it with the first slit when you wrap it around.








, Curve the paper around, so that it is a cylindrical shape, with the center fold sticking out in the middle. Overlap the ends of the lantern. Staple the top and bottom rims where the paper overlaps.









If you prefer, you may use tape or glue. Just try to keep either from being visible.

, Cut a 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) by 6 inch (15.2 cm) strip of construction paper. Staple it to two points inside the top rim. You may also forego the handle entirely (but then how will you hang it up?) or make a smaller one that stays closer to the lantern itself.








, You can glue on glitter, stickers, snowflakes, stars or other decorations to your lantern to make it even more eye-catching. Even just one star or sticker really spruces up the ""holiday-ness"" of your lantern.









Make a series of homemade hanging lanterns and string them up to create a lantern garland.

Fold the paper.,
Cut the paper.,
Make a tube.,
Make the handle.,
Attach the handle.,
Enjoy the finished product.",How to Make a Paper Lantern1," Take a piece of paper and fold it in half lengthwise. It can be of any size and weight. A piece of regular printer paper will do just fine, but so will cardstock or scrapbook paper.The lighter the weight of the paper, the more likely the lantern will be to collapse under its own weight.









You can use a solid color piece of paper or a piece of decorative scrapbook paper to make the lantern more festive.;
, Cut along the folded edge, but not all the way to the end. It's up to you how long you want the slits to be. The longer the slits, the more light will shine through and the more flexible/floppy your lantern will be.









You can also decide how large you want your strips to be. The number of strips will completely change the look of your lantern. An inch or so (2.5 cm) apart is fairly standard.

, Take the two ends of the paper and wrap them around to make a round tube shape. Use a piece of tape or glue to stick it together. Make sure to secure the entire length of the lantern! Tape everything from the inside so it's not visible.









You can also use a stapler to connect the two end pieces of the lantern.

, Cut off another piece of paper to make a handle. If you used a piece of printer paper, your handle should be about 6"" (15 cm) long and 1"" (2.5 cm) wide. If you're hanging it, however, you don't necessarily need a handle -- it can be hung through the base on ribbon or string.









If you're hanging the lantern, however, you don't necessarily need a handle -- it can be hung through the base on ribbon or string.

, Using glue or tape, secure the handle to the inside of the top of your lantern.









If your lantern is too straight-edged, bend it a bit. It will slowly give to the form you're putting it in. The heavier the paper, the more you'll need to force it into shape.

, You can put a candle inside, hang it from the ceiling, or use it as a centerpiece.









Since the lantern is made of paper, only put a tea candle or votive in the center if you have a glass to put it in. Place the candle in the glass and put the lantern around the glass to light it up. It's best if the glass is deep so the flame doesn't sear the edge of the lantern and start a fire.

Only use a candle inside if you are sitting the lantern on a flat surface, not if you are hanging it or using the handle.

Gather your materials.,
Make sure your work surface is flat, clean and smooth.,
Lay out your materials.,
Measure how much polyester filling you need.,
Sprinkle some moss into the empty Mason jar.,
Add your moss to the outer layer of polyester filling.,
Don’t go overboard.,
Remove some filling from the middle of the lantern.,
Place the tea light inside the lantern.,
Place the lid on the jar and test the lantern.,
Decorate the jar.,
Enjoy your lantern!",How to Make a Lantern2," You can purchase most of these things from a dollar store and a craft store:


Pint-sized clear Mason jar(s) with lid(s) (wide-mouthed jars are recommended)
Polyester fiber fill (toy stuffing)
Moss (a variety pack in different colors would be ideal)Twine or hemp cord in a color (or colors) of your choosing
Electric tea light (must be electric)
Scissors
Fabric to cover jar lid (optional)

, This is not a project you want to do on carpet or a lacy tablecloth, as bits of moss will get everywhere and the polyester filling will pick up any crumbs, lint or other debris.

, Have a few clumps of polyester filling and moss in front of you, plus your open mason jar(s), with the lid(s) nearby. You’ll also want to have your electric tea light ready.

, To do this, simply grab some filling and place it inside your Mason jar. The jar will need to be well packed with filling, but you’ll need some space right in the middle to place your electric tea light.

, The bottom of the Mason jar will be the top of your lantern. To make sure it’s well covered with moss, sprinkle some into the jar before adding your polyester filling.

, Decide on what moss, or combination of moss, you’ll use inside the lantern, and then place it on the polyester filling. There are a couple of ways that you can do this:


Remove the polyester filling from the Mason jar and roll it around in the moss, then add additional moss and hold it on to the filling as you lower the filling into the Mason jar. From there, you can use your fingers to place any additional moss between the filling and wall of the jar, until you’re happy with how it looks.
Keep the filling in the jar and, holding the jar on its side, use your fingers to gently place bits of moss between the filling and the wall of the jar, until you’re happy with how it looks.
Note that you only need to place the moss on the outer layer of filling. You’ll only be able to see the moss that shows through the glass walls of the Mason jar, so don’t worry about putting moss anywhere except for between the filling and the jar’s walls.

, Avoid the temptation to completely cover the walls of your Mason jar in moss. Too much moss will block the light from the electric candle.


More moss may look nicer when the lights are on, but when the lights are off, the filling will simply look like a twinkling fairy light behind a lovely forest pattern.

, Use your fingers to carve out a core inside the lantern. This is where your tea light will sit. Be sure to leave enough filling that it firmly holds the moss against the walls of the jar.


Carving out a hole slightly larger than the tea light will work fine.
It may take some experimentation to see what’s perfect. After trying the lantern out, if you want the light to shine through more vibrantly, you can remove a bit more filling.

, You’ll want the “flame” to be facing the bottom of the jar, which will be the top of your lantern.


Add a small amount of filling to the jar once the electric tea light is in. This will help hold it in place and keep it from jiggling around.

, Once you place the lid on the jar, turn it upside down so that the jar is sitting on its lid. Everything should stay in place. If it doesn’t, add more filling.


At this point you can also test the lantern by turning on the electric tea light and making any adjustments you want to make in order to get the look you desire.

, Once the lantern is done, wrap some twine around around the neck of the jar (just below the ridges that you screw the lid on to) and tie it in a bow.


If you don’t like the way the lid looks bare, you can glue some fabric on the lid and wrap that in twine instead.
It’s recommended to use a neutral or earthy shade of twine to match the natural mossy colors of the lantern.

, It’s not much to look at in the day, but it’s lovely in the dark. Follow these instructions to switch the lantern on and off:


Stand it up (lid up), open the lid, remove the piece of filling that holds the electric tea light in place, switch on or off the tea light, then replace the filling and the lid.

Removable adhesive paper
Scissors
Glass frosting/frosted glass spray
Candles (votives or tea lights are recommended)
Heavy wire (optional)
Wire cutters (optional)
Pliers (optional)
Sand, sea salt or epsom salt (optional)
Wire hangers (optional)

,
Ensure that your jar is clean and dry.

,
Draw designs on the non-sticky side of removable adhesive paper.,
Cut out your designs and stick them to your jar.,
Spray the jar with glass frosting spray.,
Allow the glass-frosting spray to dry.,
Remove the adhesive designs from the outside of the jar.,
Place a candle inside your lantern.,
Add a handle (optional).,
Enjoy your lantern!

",How to Make a Lantern3,",, You can use stencils or free-style it — just make sure your designs are easy to cut out!


You can also use stickers whose shapes you like, as long as don't mind throwing them away.

, Be sure to stick them to the outside of the jar.

, Ensure that you’ve sprayed the jar evenly, and that you’ve covered the designs that you’ve stuck to the jar.

, Make sure it’s completely dry before you move to the next step. It may take less than 10 minutes to dry, depending on the spray.


The drying time should be clearly stated on the back of the spray can.
If you’re unsure of whether the spray is dry, touch the glass. It should feel dry.

, Once the glass frosting spray is completely dry, you can remove the adhesive designs.


This will leave you with a frosted glass lantern with clear spots where the designs were.

, To keep the candle stationary, you can nestle it into some sand, sea salt, or epsom salt.

, If you want to hang your lantern, you’ll need to add a handle. To make a handle:


To determine the length you need, wrap a piece of strong wire around the mouth of the jar, just beneath the ridges where the lid would screw on. Next, pull the wire upwards and loop it over the jar to the desired size of the handle that you want, then cut the wire.
Wrap one end of the wire around the jar’s mouth, bend the wire up as if making a handle, and then secure the end of the wire to the start of the handle by bending it into a loop with pliers.
Bend the free end of the wire into a handle and then secure it to the wire that sits around the jar’s mouth, on the other end of the jar, by using pliers to bend it into a loop around that wire.

Gather your materials:Card stock paper in colors, patterns, and textures of your choosing
A pencil and good-quality eraser
A thumb tack
Scissors or a paper cutter
Double-sided tape
A styrofoam or foam board (for poking holes)
Design stencils (optional)

,
Decide on the size of your lantern.,
Draw your design on the card stock paper.,
Use a thumb tack to make holes along the lines of your design.,
Erase the pencil marks.,
Roll the card stock into a cylinder and fasten its sides together.,
Place your paper cylinder over a lit candle.,
Enjoy your lantern!

",How to Make a Lantern4,", You’ll be making this lantern by drawing on a piece of card stock, poking holes in it, taping it into a tube, and placing it over a candle. Before drawing on the card stock, decide on your lantern’s size and, if necessary, cut the paper to size.


You may want to choose the size of your lantern based on the candle you plan to use.
You can also choose the size of the lantern based on the card stock you have or where you want to use the lantern.

, Use a pencil to very lightly sketch in your desired design right at the center of the card stock. This will be the front of your lantern.


You don’t have to limit yourself to the front of the lantern. You can also do a larger design that goes all the way around, or off to the side. It’s up to you!
It may be tempting to get ambitious with your design. Just remember that the more holes you poke, the more time it’ll take you to make your lantern!
Remember to sketch lightly so that it’s easier to erase the pencil markings once you’ve poked your holes.

, Try to keep the space between holes as even as possible. Do this until the design is complete.


You’ll want to place the card stock on a piece of styrofoam or foam board for this step, so that the thumb tack has a firm surface it can fully sink into.
One to two millimeters between holes would work well, but it doesn’t have to be exact — you can eye it!

, Use a good, soft eraser to remove the pencil marks along your designs. A thick, soft white eraser will work well.


Be sure to press gently as you erase the pencil marks, and do not hold the paper against a hard surface as you erase them, otherwise the holes you’ve made may close up a bit.
If the holes do close up a bit as you erase the pencil marks, it’s not a big deal — just use a thumb tack to gently push them outward again.

, To fasten the sides together, place double-sided tape on the back of one side of the paper, and on the front of the other side so that when they overlap they’re extra secure.


If you have a large candle, you can wrap the card stock around the candle to get the shape you want.

, Place a votive into a glass votive holder and light it, then place the cylinder over the lit votive. To reduce the fire hazard, you can use an electric candle.

Buy a lightweight paper.,
Cut the paper to size.,
Decorate your lantern while it is still flat on your craft table.,
Place a piece of double stick tape behind the entire vertical edge of one of the paper's edges.,
Form your base.,
Light a votive and place it in a sturdy glass holder.",How to Make a Lantern for the Holidays2," Translucent paper works well for this project and allows the most light to shine through. If that's not an option, grab a brown paper bag from your pantry.


Some decorative papers can be expensive, so if you are looking for a budget-friendly lantern craft, brown paper lunch bags are your best bet. These are usually 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) wide and approximately 7 inches (17.8 cm) tall. Decorate the lunch bag as you would the decorative paper.

, It needs to be approximately 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) high and 9 to 10 inches (22.9 to 25.4 cm) long. 9 inches (22.9 cm) in length is preferable; however, you may need to make the base wider if you need to fit it around a large votive holder.


Cut another strip of paper that is 1 inch (2.5 cm) tall and 10 inches (25.4 cm) wide. This will serve as your base, keeping your lantern sturdy.

, The following are ways you can decorate your table top lantern:









Paint watercolors onto your paper. Choose a holiday theme so that it reflects the season.
Use light markers or brush pens to draw words or images onto your paper.
Collage the paper with holiday designs from other scrapbook papers, wrapping paper, or magazines.
Use holiday stencils on construction paper. Cut out the stencil and glue the image onto the paper, or you can place the stencil directly over the paper and paint the design onto your paper.

If your paper is sturdy enough, you could cut holes into the paper in a pretty design to emit even more light through. However, tissue paper may not be strong enough to use this idea.



, The thinner the paper, the more you'll want to avoid glue -- so double stick tape is necessary.









Then, wrap the lantern around to form a cylinder. Align the opposite edge below the tape and stick it together firmly. Run your fingers along the edges to ensure all of it has adhered.

, Place a piece of double-sided tape along your 1 by 10 inch (2.5 by 25.4 cm) strip. Adhere it to the bottom of your lantern for extra stability. Your lantern is now ready to be displayed!








, Place your lantern around the glass holder and it will light up through the top. If you are using a brown paper bag, then carefully stick the glass votive holder inside the paper bag lantern.

Make two paper circles.Using any round object, trace a circle on two pieces of paper and cut them out with scissors.,
Fold the first circle.,
Draw lines on the paper.,
Make a hole.,
Cut the lines.,
Unfold the paper.,
Complete the other circle.,
Glue the circles together.,
Pull the lantern pieces apart.",How to Make a Paper Lantern2," Make sure the two circles are the same approximate size.


You can use any size circle. Just remember that the bigger the circle, the bigger the lantern. You can use a plate, the lid off a tub of ice cream, the bottom of a bucket, or any other round object.
You can also use any kind of paper you want: regular white printer paper, colored cardstock, decorative patterned paper, etc.

, Take one of the circles and fold it in half. Then, fold it in half two more times. This will give you a finished product that looks like a slice of pizza (a long triangle with a rounded top).

, Following the curve of the top of the paper (the pizza crust), draw alternating lines on the paper that cross the full length of the paper, but don't quite meet the opposite side.Start on the left side and draw a slightly curved line that stops shortly before (approximately 1 inch to 1/2 an inch) the right side. Then, below the line you just drew, start on the right side and draw a slightly curved line that stops shortly before the left side.


Continue this alternating pattern until you reach the bottom of the paper (the point of the triangle).

, Cut off a tiny bit on the point of the triangle, making a hole in the center of the paper.

, Use scissors to to cut the paper along the curved lines that you drew. Try to stay closely on the lines, but don't worry about being too perfect. Just make sure you don't accidentally cut across one line into the path of another.

, Making sure not to rip any of the delicate strips you just cut, unfold the paper until you are back to the open circle shape.

, Repeat steps 2-6 on the second circle that you cut out so that you end up with two identical cut-up circles.

, Use some glue to adhere the two circles to one another only on the outermost ring. Make sure you do not glue the inner parts of the circles together. Let the glue dry.

, Gently pull each side of the lantern so that the pieces spread out to reveal the beautiful design you cut into it.


Tie a string in the top (through the hole and the outer ring) and hang the lantern somewhere to enjoy it.

Pick a color.,
Make tissue paper circles.,
Cut out the tissue paper circles.,
Cover the bottom of the paper globe lantern.,
Make the bottom row of tissue paper circles.,
Cover the entire paper globe lantern in tissue paper circles.",How to Make a Paper Lantern3," For this project, you'll need quite a bit of tissue paper. The tissue paper will cover the entire paper globe lantern in a pattern, so you'll need to acquire enough tissue paper to do this.


You can use all one color tissue paper, or choose to make your lantern multi-colored. Pick whatever color combination you desire, or whatever makes sense for how you intend to use the lantern.

, Use any circle-shaped object (a coffee can lid, a small salad plate, etc.) as a pattern to trace circles on the tissue paper. Depending on the size of your circles, you'll need about 100 tissue paper circles.Trace your circle pattern on your tissue paper, keeping the circles as close together as possible to avoid wasting too much excess tissue paper.


Don't make your circles too big or too small. If they are too big, the lantern won't be very billowy; and if your circles are too small, you'll be making much more work for yourself than necessary. Aim for something the size of a coffee can lid.

, Use scissors to cut out all of your tissue paper circles. Handle the tissue paper carefully because it is very thin and will tear easily.

, Take one of your tissue paper circles and glue it to the bottom of your paper globe lantern. Make sure that you glue it centered directly on the bottom so that your pattern can remain even as you move up the globe.

, Starting at the bottom of the globe, make a ring of tissue paper circles by gluing only the top edge of each tissue paper circle to the paper globe lantern.Make sure that the bottom row of tissue paper circles hangs lower than than the paper globe lamp to give it that flowing, whimsical look.

, Repeat Step 5 until the entire paper globe lantern is covered in tissue paper circles. As you move up with each row, ensure that about one inch of the row below is visible underneath. This will give your final product a layered, patterned look.

Gather your materials:White paper bags (3.5 inches by 6.5 inches recommended)
A bone folder (to help fold the top of the bag down)
Pencil (optional)
Stencils (optional)
Craft knife (also know as an X-ACTO blade, optional)
Small piece of cardboard (optional)
Wire for hanging (22-gauge, cut into 17-inch strips recommended)
Grommets and grommet pliers
Electric tea lights

Place a tea light inside the bag.,
Enjoy your lantern!

",How to Make a Lantern5,", To do this, fold the top of the bag over in a slow, circular motion, moving around the bag.

, Pull out the gussets (the folded-in parts) on both sides of the bag and work the bone folder around the top fold until the fold is clean and the bag is flat (with the gussets out and flat too)., Use a pencil to stencil in a design on the front of the bag, then cut out the shape with a craft knife. Place a piece of cardboard inside the bag as you cut to protect the back of the bag.


If you don’t want to make a design on the bag, you can move down to the step in which you add grommets to the sides of the bag.

, Place 1 grommet in the middle of each side of your bag, roughly 1/2-inch down from the top of the bag. To find the center, use the crease from the mid-line of the gusset as your guide.


Note that it’s not necessary to hang your lantern. Some people simply drop a tea light into a white bag and leave it at that!

, To fasten the wire securely to the bag, pull it through the grommet and then twist the end of the wire upwards along the rest of the wire.


Before you had a tea light to the bag, make sure that the wire is securely fastened to the bag.

, An electric tea light is highly recommended, as a regular tea light can pose a fire hazard, particularly if the lantern is hung somewhere where it might be jostled.

Decorate the lantern.",How to Make a Chinese Lantern1," This paper lantern is simple and fun to make. It's made entirely out of paper, which makes it an easy and inexpensive craft. Here's what you'll need:


2 sheets of paper (1 red and 1 yellow, same size)
Scissors
Ruler
Pencil
String
Glue, tape, or stapler
Hole puncher
Gold glitter, sequins, gold paint, etc (optional)
Red/yellow paper streamers (optional);
, Use your ruler and pencil to draw two strips along the long edge of the paper. Cut those strips out with a pair of scissors. Set the two strips aside.

, Take the two short sides of the yellow paper, and bring them together to form a tube. Overlap them by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure them. You can use glue, tape, or a stapler. Set the yellow tube aside.

, Place the red paper down on the table in front of you and bring the two long edges together. Flatten the paper so that you end up with a long, skinny rectangle. The folded part of the rectangle should be facing you.

, Make sure that the folded edge of the rectangle is facing you. Then, use your ruler and pencil to draw a straight line across the rectangle. This will be your cutting guide. You will be cutting towards this line in a latter step.

, They need to be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart, and going from the folded edge up to the horizontal guide line you just drew.

, Stop when you get to the horizontal guide line. Do not cut past this line, or your lantern will fall apart. You will end up with something that looks like a fringe.

, Bring the two short edges together to form a tube. Overlap the edges by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure them. You can use glue, tape, or a stapler.

, The yellow tube will be a little bit shorter than the red tube. This is good. Squash the red tube until the top and bottom edges of both tubes line up. Secure them together. You can use glue, tape, or a stapler.

, Overlap the edges by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Try to align the seam with the seam on the red tube. This will give you a nice trim. Secure the yellow strips with glue, tape, or a stapler.

, Use a hole puncher to poke two holes into the top of the lantern. Make sure that they are straight across from each other. Thread a long piece of string through both of the holes, and tie the ends together in a tight knot.

, You can hang your lantern up now, or you can decorate it further. Try not to add too many decorations, however, or your lantern will become too heavy. Here are some ideas to get you started:Cut strips of crepe paper or party streamers. Glue them to the inside of the bottom edge of the lantern. Try alternating red and yellow colors.
Draw some designs along the top and bottom edge of the lantern using glue, and then sprinkle gold glitter over the designs. You can also use a gold marker.
Glue some sequins or rhinestones along the top and bottom edge of the lantern.

Because it requires so much glue, however, you will need to give it some time to dry. If you are in a hurry, this might not be the right choice for you; the lantern will need at least a day to dry. Here's what you'll need to make this lantern:


Balloon
Tissue paper (white and red/yellow)
Scissors (optional)
Paintbrush or foam brush
White school glue
Water
Black or gold permanent marker (optional)
String
Hole puncher
Battery-operated tea light

, Not too big or it may pop.

, You will need some white tissue paper for the first few layers; this will make your lamp glow brighter. You will also need some red or yellow tissue paper for the last two to three layers. You can even use both colors, if you want. Be sure to keep the white tissue paper separate from the other colors.

, This will be your papier mâché paste. Make sure that you are using white school glue, as the clear type won't work.

, Dip your paintbrush or foam brush into the glue mixture and dab some glue onto the balloon. You don't need a lot of glue—just a thin layer. This will give the tissue paper something to hold on to.

, You can use your fingers, if you don't mind getting dirty, or your paintbrush/foam brush. Try to get the paper as smooth as possible.

, Be sure to leave some room near the bottom of the balloon where the knot is. You can to be able to reach inside the lantern, once it dries and you pop the balloon.


Consider keeping your balloon in a bowl; this will help keep it still and prevent it from rolling all over the place.

, Be sure to let the first layer dry a little bit before you add another. If your balloon starts to get too soggy, set it aside. You may also notice that after enough layers, you may not need to use much glue if at all; the lower layers will help soak up the upper layers.

, You are adding so many layers to make your lantern sturdy. If you don't use enough layers, your lamp will turn out flimsy.

, This may take 1 to 2 days. The lantern must be completely dry before you move on to the next step, or it will cave in on itself.

, You can use a black or gold permanent marker to draw a Chinese character on the lantern. You can also draw designs on the lantern using glue, and then sprinkle gold glitter over the glue. If you use glue to decorate the lantern, be sure to let it dry before moving on to the next step.

, This is now the top of your lantern. If the lantern caves in on itself, simply reach inside, and pop it back out into shape. At this point, you can also use some scissors to clean up the edges of the tissue paper.

, They need to be straight across from each other, or the lantern won't balance right.

, Tie the ends of the string together into a tight knot.

, Switch on a battery-operated tea light and drop it into the lantern. You don't want to use a real candle or a light bulb, as both can lead to a fire. Use the string to hang the lantern.

Gather your supplies.,
Find a short, squat jar.,
Clean the jar well, and dry it off.,
Cut or tear red tissue paper into small pieces.,
Paint the entire jar using Mod Podge.,
Cover the entire jar with tissue paper, including the neck.,
Wait for the jar to dry, then paint it with another layer of Mod Podge.,
Trim the excess tissue paper off.,
Paint the top edge/neck of the jar black.,
Decorate the jar.,
Let the lantern dry completely before you use it.",How to Make a Chinese Lantern3," This lantern is a little bit different from the rest. You can't hang it anywhere, because it is made from glass. You can, however, use it as a real candleholder. Try not to get it wet, however; you can wipe it clean with a damp cloth, but if you leave it sitting in water, the Mod Podge will flake off. Here's what you'll need to make this lantern:


Short, squat jar
Red tissue paper
Mod Podge
Paintbrush or foam brush
Paper plate or palette
Scissors
Black paint
Gold glitter, glue, sequins, markers, etc (optional)

, You want the jar to be low with a wide mouth. It should be almost round or square in shape.

, Use soap and warm water to wash it. You can also wipe it down with a cotton ball soaked in some rubbing alcohol. If there are any labels on the jar, be sure to remove them, or they will show up when you are done.

, The pieces should be proportionate to the jar. For a very small jar, make the pieces about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) big. For a larger jar, try something that is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) big.

, You can use a paintbrush or a foam brush. If you are working on a large jar, you can paint a small section first.If you don't have any Mod Podge, you can mix one part white school glue with one part water.

, Use your fingers or your paintbrush/foam brush to smooth the paper down so that you don't get any wrinkles. Try not to overlap the tissue paper too much, or the light won't shine through as well.


It's okay if the tissue paper extends past the neck. You want the next to be covered, so that the paint will have something to stick to.

, This will seal the jar., Use your scissors to trim off the excess tissue paper from the top of the jar., Squirt some black paint out onto a paper plate or a palette. Dip your paintbrush into the paint, and paint the entire neck of the jar black. This will resemble the top of the lantern.

, Use a black marker or glitter glue to draw some symbols onto the lantern. You can use Chinese characters, dragons, yin-yang, and so forth. You can also glue on some sequins or loose glitter onto the lantern as well.

, You can use a real tea light inside the lantern, or a battery-operated tea light.

Choose a safe launch site.,
Launch during good weather.,
Open your lantern.,
Fill your lantern with air.,
Light the fuel source.,
Let go and enjoy!,
Make a wish (optional).",How to Launch a Sky Lantern," In the vast majority of cases, sky lanterns are perfectly safe and fun. Usually, the sky lantern climbs gently into the sky, the candle or rag inside eventually runs out of fuel, and the balloon floats harmlessly to the ground. However, because they're powered by an open flame and are often made of flammable tissue paper, there's always the chance, however small, that a sky lantern can burn out of control. Use common sense when choosing a launch site. Here are just a few things to consider:


Pick a spot free from obstruction. Parks and wide open fields are great for this purpose. There should be no trees, roofs, power lines, or other possible obstructions in the immediate area when you launch your sky lantern.
Don't launch sky lanterns in areas where dry timber is present. Because of the small risk of fire, it's best not to launch sky lanterns where dead wood, foliage, or grass is present. Keep in mind that sky lanterns can drift fairly far before they land, and though the internal flame has usually burnt out by this point, there's still the risk that embers may remain.
Finally, know your local laws. Don't launch sky lanterns in areas where it's illegal. Most local jurisdictions have laws regarding fireworks and other types of entertainment involving open flame. Obey these laws - it's not worth getting a fine over.;
, Sky lanterns are meant to hang tranquilly in the sky, providing a beautiful sight for miles around. Try to launch sky lanterns during calm, clear, still nights. Don't launch sky lanterns when there's a strong wind or a chance of rain. Inclement weather can put a damper on your festivities by making it difficult to launch a sky lantern in the first place or even knocking your balloon out of the sky.

, When you're ready to launch your lantern, gently check to ensure the hole at the bottom of the balloon is open and the balloon material is secured to the frame. At this point, if you haven't done so, you may attach your candle or fuel-soaked rag by securing it to its seat at the bottom of the frame. For wire frames, this usually means pulling the wires through the center and twisting around the fuel source.

, Before launching, you want to ensure your balloon is fully inflated with air so that none of the material hangs inward. Not only does this make it easier to get the lantern off the ground, it also makes it less likely that the balloon's material will drift over the flame and catch fire. Grab the balloon by the bottom of its frame and gently swing the lantern back and forth (as you would with a trash bag) until it's full.

, Whether you're using a fuel-soaked towel, a candle, or another fuel source, it's time for ignition. Keeping the balloon vertical, light the fuel and allow the hot air from the flame to inflate the balloon. It may take a minute or two for your lantern to become buoyant - as you wait, hold on to the sides to keep the balloon open and vertical.


If you're worried about the possibility of your sky lantern immediately collapsing and burning up, don't be afraid to have a hose or a bucket of water on hand.

, Wait until you begin to feel a gentle upward tug, then simply let your balloon go - there's no need to throw it. Your sky lantern should float up into the night sky as it gives off a beautiful warm glow. Enjoy this peaceful, magical experience.


If the thought of watching your sky lantern slowly drift out of view makes you sad, tie a light, non-flammable string to its frame so that you can hold on to it like a kite.

, In some traditions, sky lanterns bear the wishes of the person or family who created them. If you or your family would like to partake in this fun tradition, you may make a wish as your lantern drifts into the sky or write your wish on the material of the lantern before you launch it.

Make sure your lanterns match the room.,
Decide if you want to light the lanterns.,
Choose hooks.,
Decide on the configuration.,
Mark the placement of the lanterns.,
Hang your lanterns on drywall or wood.,
Think about using adhesive hooks, especially on tough surfaces.,
Thread your lanterns with fishing line.,
Plug in electric lamps.,
Make sure never to use candles with your lanterns.",How to Hang Paper Lanterns1," A beautiful configuration of lanterns won’t impress your guests if the colors are clashing or mismatched. Make sure that the lanterns you hang match any patterns, colors or themes present in your room. Take a trip to a nearby Chinatown or shop online to find the perfect colored lanterns.Match colors with similar colors. Categories of colors, like earth tones, jewel tones or warm/cool colors should be matched to similar colored lanterns. For example, a red couch would be well accented with warm colored lanterns, like orange and yellow. If your bedroom has a navy blue bedspread, match it with cool colored lanterns, like light blue, white or dark green.Match patterns. Paper lanterns come in a variety of colors, and some even have patterns. If you have floral patterns on a chair or bedspread, find a complementary patterned lantern online. Try to match diamond patterns, spiral patterns, or plaids. Be careful that the lanterns don't clash or overload your room with the pattern, however.;
, Some lanterns are purely decorative while others contain small lamps or lightbulbs. Decide whether you want to use the lanterns as accent lights in your room, and then search for the right kind of lanterns. Many come with pre-wired plug-in lightbulbs or battery powered LED lamps., To hang your lanterns, you’ll need hooks. Because paper lanterns are relatively light, you won’t need anything too large or heavy duty. Look for small, screw-in hooks at a local hobby store or at hardware store. Look for hooks small enough that they won’t be noticed, and consider buying some that match the color of your walls., You’ll want to decide where the hooks will hang before you do any drilling. Visualize your room and the way you want the lanterns to hang. You may want to hang them in a row across the room, in a corner in a bunch, or over a bed or chair. Look at websites like Pinterest to get some ideas, or ask a creative friend for help., Using a pencil, make marks on the wall or ceiling that your lanterns will hang from. Visualize what they’ll look like in those places. Remember, you can make and erase the marks as many times as you want, but once a hole is drilled, you’ll have to fill it in if you’ve made a mistake., Most homes in America have interior walls and ceilings made of drywall. Drywall isn’t meant to bear a lot of weight, but since paper lanterns are lighter than paintings or mirrors, you can go ahead and screw your hooks directly into it. Alternatively, if you want to hang your lanterns from a wood surface like a cabinet or a shelf, you can use the same method.Drill a pilot hole. While you may be tempted to screw the hook in by hand, it’ll be much easier if you drill a pilot hole. Choose a drill bit that’s the same size as the inner core of the hook, not the width of the threads. Power up your drill and drill straight into the wall, making sure your hole goes all the way through the drywall.
Screw in your hook. Place the hook into the hole, then begin screwing it into the wall. Apply pressure as you turn the hook clockwise, stopping when the base of the hook is flush with the drywall.

, Some homes have walls or ceilings made of plaster or brick, which are hard or almost impossible to drill through. For these surfaces, consider using adhesive hooks. They aren’t quite as sturdy as hooks that screw into the wall, but they’ll work for something as light as a paper lantern. Their strong adhesive will keep them attached for years and they’re easier to use if you’re nervous about using a drill., Your lantern is going to hang from a hook, so it needs a line to hang from. You can use twine or fishing line to hang the lanterns, depending on how “invisible” you want the line to seem. Find twine at a craft store, or check out an outdoor/adventure store for some inexpensive fishing line.Cut the line to the right length. If you want all of your lanterns to hang at the same height, make sure that you cut all of the lines to the same length. If you want them to be staggered, play with line lengths a bit to see what combination looks best.
Tie a small loop at the end of your line. Most paper lanterns have a rigging device inside, shaped like a “C”. Because of this small hook, you don’t need to tie the line onto the lantern directly. You can simply tie a small loop at the end of the line and then slip it over the “C”. Make sure your knot is tight so it doesn’t come loose and let the lantern fall.
Tie another loop at the top of the line. Tie the same knot at the top of the top of the line, then slip it over the hook.

, Some lamps have small lightbulbs inside that need to be plugged in. These can be a bit trickier to hang, because the cord will have to be hung as well. For these lamps, you’ll need to screw in additional hooks and loop the cord through them, all the way to an outlet. Use an extension cord if the original cord isn’t long enough. Look into buying battery powered lamps to avoid the unsightly cables altogether., Paper lanterns may have traditionally held candles instead of lightbulbs, but any open flame is unsafe, especially indoors. Use LED lamps or small lightbulbs in your lamps to avoid any accidents with open flame. Many lanterns come pre-lit for your convenience."

Screw on your solar lid and enjoy your light!

",How to Build a Solar Lantern," You can choose from different color LED lights that will be powered by the solar energy you are collecting. Once you've decided, purchase all the items, listed under the Things You'll Need.;
, Familiarize yourself with the parts as this will make it easier for you to build the lantern.

, A good recommended length to work with is 3 inches or just a bit longer for all the black and red wires. This ensures you have enough length to re-strip the wires as well.

, To do this, insert the newly cut end you just cut into the number 18 size stripping hole below where the cutting blade is on the wire stripper/cutter. Only strip about 1/2in to 3/4in. This will be enough length to tie together in the wire nut. Grip the handles, pull the wire back and the wire stripper should remove the plastic covering the wire. If it doesn't strip, you need to make sure you have the wire in the correct sized hole.


When pulling back to strip the wire, do not grip the circuit board and pull as this can result in pulling the wire out of the circuit board. Pull by gripping the wire only.

, Install batteries as instructed on battery holder.

, To connect the wires, bring both ends of red wires together, straighten out the exposed wiring so they easily insert into wire nut(the one from the battery charger and the one from the circuit board) and insert the ends with the wire exposed into the wire nut. Twist the wire nut clockwise as if you were tightening. (remember righty tighty, lefty loosey). After you twist clockwise to tighten the wires together, you can pull wire nut off. Your wire ends should be wrapped together creating a secure electrical bond.


It is very important you connect it to the battery section of the circuit.

, It is very important you connect it to the BATTERY section of the circuit!

, The hole should be large enough for the two black and red wires coming from the solar panel to fit through.The hole should also be made about a 1/2 inches off the edge of the lip of the lid. This will allow the panel to lay flat on the top and will also make sure you can glue the battery holder on the other side of the lid.

,, After you twist clockwise to tighten the wires together, you can pull wire nut off. Your wire ends should be wrapped together creating a secure electrical bond. Like steps the previous steps it is important to connect these wires to their correct destination on the circuit board.

,, Your LED lights should now be on. They are currently running off the battery power as your circuit board is set to battery as the default mode. If your lights do not come on, check to make sure the tiny switches on the circuit board are in the ""on"" position which is towards the center of the board. Also check to make sure your wires are all connected properly.

, Apply a small amount of the instant glue to the batteries and press onto the bottom side of the lid. Hold until it stays on its own.

,, Apply a small amount of glue to the bottom of the panel (the side that does not look like a grid and has the wires coming out of it) and press and hold the panel to the top of the lid for about a minute. It might not lay completely flat which is okay. Make sure it stays in place though.

, You can now put anything into your mason jar to accessorize your solar lantern. Ideas include - stones, succulent plants, marbles, flower pedals.

Some lanterns have easy-to-remove glass, while others may require minor disassembly with a screwdriver before you can get the glass out.;
, Avoid harsh chemical soaps, since these are more likely to scratch or warp the glass.

, Use a soft cloth or sponge. Anything rougher will very likely scratch the glass.

, Gently wipe the surface of the glass with a clean paper towel as you rinse it. If you still see soot residue, proceed with additional cleansing.

, Vigorously shake the bottle to combine the two liquids.

, Use this towel to wipe down the glass. Apply a gentle pressure, just firm enough to scrub away the ash.

, The glass should be completely dry. This should remove the soot, but if you still notice ashy residue, additional cleaning may be advised.

, The tub should be just big enough to fit the glass panels or globe.

, Prevent the panels from overlapping as much as possible. The glass needs to be exposed in order to get the full effect of the treatment.

, The fizzing should remove much of the soot.

, Allow all sides of the glass to get exposure to the new solution.

, The cleansers in the denture tablets will still be active long after they stop dissolving.

, Wipe it dry with a clean microfiber cloth.

, By now, all traces of soot should be gone. The glass may appear foggy, however, which could still hinder the way light shines through the lantern.

, Glass-top stove cleaners are preferable to window cleaners, since stove cleaners are more likely to withstand hot temperatures and less likely to be flammable. Gently wipe the glass with a clean paper towel or microfiber cloth until it appears dry, transparent, and streak-free.

, Doing so will allow it the chance to completely dry.

, Slide or screw it back into place as necessary.

Choose the right lanterns for your outdoor area.,
Decide where to hang your lanterns.,
Drill any necessary holes.,
Tie your lanterns up.",How to Hang Paper Lanterns2," There are a lot of decisions that go into decorating a deck or backyard, just like a living room or bedroom. The main things you want to think about are durability and color scheme. You’ll need to find special outdoor lanterns that fit the look you’re going for.


Use outdoor lanterns. Paper lanterns are great for use indoors, but they can be damaged by water. Look for lanterns specifically made for outdoor use: they’ll typically be made of nylon or silk. You can find them online, at home improvement stores, or at patio decoration outlets.Pick a good color scheme. Unlike an indoor area that is already decorated, you’ll have a bit more free reign in choosing the colors of your lanterns. Match them to your deck furniture, or go big with bright colors like red, blue or yellow. White lanterns can give your backyard a relaxed or dreamy atmosphere when it gets dark., There are many places to hang them: in the air, on a fence or off of a railing. Each will give your backyard a different vibe, and it all depends on your personal preference. Depending on your choice, you’ll need different tools and supplies.


Hang your lanterns high up. If you have large trees, you can hang your lanterns from them for a cool effect. If you don’t want to hang them from trees, or you don’t have any, buy poles to hang your lanterns from. Some companies sell poles specifically for hanging lanterns on, but you can hang them off of any type of pole, as long as there’s a place to attach a hook.Hang them from a fence. If you have a tall fence, you can simply tie the lanterns right onto the boards without a need for hooks.Hang them off of a railing. If you want to hang your lanterns from a wooden railing, you’ll need a drill and some small hooks. If your railing is wrought iron, you can easily tie them on.

, If you’ve chosen to hang your lanterns from a surface that requires hooks, you’ll need to drill a pilot hole to help start the hook. Choose a drill bit with the same diameter as the core of the hook, then drill straight through the wooden railing. Pull out the drill, then screw your hook in, pushing clockwise until it’s flush with the surface of the wood., Once all of your hooks or poles are installed, you’ll be able to hang the lanterns. Use twine or fishing line so that the line doesn’t distract from the effect of the lantern. Tie a small loop at the end of your twine, then slip it over lantern’s hanger. As with the other end of the line, tie a sturdy knot around the fence, tree branch, hook, or other surface.

Decide on a theme.,
Choose hooks that work for your surroundings.,
Choose a configuration.,
Tie strings for your lanterns.",How to Hang Paper Lanterns3," Whether you’re planning a wedding, a family reunion or a simple barbecue, you’ll want your lanterns to fit with a theme. White lanterns work well for weddings, while bright colors will brighten up a summer party. Search online for the perfect kind to fit your theme.


Pick a holiday-specific color scheme. Christmas events generally feature red and green, while Easter parties use pastel colors like light pink, light purple and light yellow.
Look for event-specific lanterns. Some paper lanterns have printed patterns specifically for holidays, like Menorahs for Hanukkah, hearts for Valentines day, or pumpkins for Halloween.
If you're having a party to celebrate a game day, use colors from the sports team your group favors., Parties can be held in a variety of different venues: tents, picnic shelters, even boats. You’ll need to find fasteners that work for your situation, and most importantly, they’ll have to be easy to remove. Think about using adhesive hooks, or try tying your lanterns directly to rafters or tent supports., Decide the placement of the lanterns and the heights at which they’ll hang. Look online for ideas to match the setup that you are planning for. Sites like Pinterest have many example photos to help your creativity along.Consider hanging them high up above your guests’ heads where they won’t be in anyone’s way.


Tie lanterns across beams or supports. If your event setting has a shelter or tent, hang lanterns across the supports to create a large canopy of lights.
Tie lanterns in bunches. Bunched lanterns hanging at different heights create great focal points at your party. Choose a point on a beam or support and tie five to ten lanterns in the same area, all at different heights. Try mixing the sizes of the lanterns to make your bunch even more eclectic feeling.
Light a path with lanterns. Hang the paper lanterns low to the ground on short poles to create a cool effect. Use poles made for hanging potted plants, or make your own small poles with hooks. Then place the poles along a path or sidewalk to light the way to your party.

, Once you’ve decided how high you want your lanterns to hang, it’s time to tie them up using twine or fishing line to create an “invisible” floating effect. Tie a sturdy loop at one end of the twine, then slip it over the lantern’s hanging device. Then, tie the other end directly to a beam or loop it over a hook.

Tie the fabric into a tight knot.,
Center the two 24"" (60cm) pieces of florist's wire over the knot.,
Wrap the wires around the knot, and twist them tightly to make them secure.,
Place the candle over a lighter or other open flame until the wax melts down into a liquid state.,
Place the knot into the hot, melted wax and let it soak for three to five minutes.

,
Remove the newly created wick from the wax.,
Wrap the aluminum-foil strip around the knot in the center of the wick.,
Cut three bamboo skewers in half lengthwise using either a razor blade or a utility knife.,
Line the split bamboo up end to end on a table to make a single long strip.,
Secure the overlapping connection points together with non-flammable tape.,
Tape the ends of the foil-wrapped wires that protrude from the wick to opposite sides of the bamboo frame.,
Hang 16-20 pieces of kitchen paper towel (or about half that of tissue paper) on a clothesline using clothespins (pegs).

,
Place a plastic or canvas drop cloth under the paper to catch any drippings.

,
Spray both sides of each piece of paper thoroughly with the fireproofing spray.,
Draw a vertical line 40"" (about 1 meter) long down the center of the brown craft paper.,
Draw a horizontal line 12"" (30cm) long at the base of the vertical line.,
Draw a second horizontal line that is 22"" (1/2 meter) long approximately two thirds of the way up the vertical line.,
Connect the two horizontal lines by sketching a line that curves gently inward before meeting the vertical line.,
Draw a second line mirroring the line that you just drew to connect the left tips of the two horizontal lines.

,
Sketch mirroring lines that connect each end of the upper horizontal line to the top of the vertical line.,
Cut the shape that you've drawn out of the brown craft paper using scissors.,
Lay the 16-20 fireproofed paper pieces on a flat surface.,
Use a non-flammable glue to seal the overlapped ends of the papers together.,
Lay one 2-piece panel of paper towel/tissue paper over the brown craft paper pattern.,
Repeat this step with the remaining 2-piece paper panels.

,
Connect the pointed tips of the paper towel/tissue paper panels together.,
Attach the opening of the paper bag to the bamboo frame.,
Fold the end of the paper bag upward to cover the frame.,
Take your lantern outside at night or at dusk.",How to Make Sky Lanterns," Trim the end pieces so they are approximately 1"" (2.5cm) on each side. The end pieces will become the wicks of the candle that will propel your sky lantern much as a flame propels a hot air balloon.;
, The two pieces should be perpendicular to each other with their midpoints overlapping on top of the knot.

, The four wire ends should be approximately 9"" to 10"" (23 to 25cm) long on each side so that they are long enough to reach the lantern's bamboo frame. Set the wire-wrapped knot aside.

, You should also place a plate or a tray beneath the candle to catch the wax as it melts.

,, As it cools, the wax will harden.

, Twist the ends of the foil strip around the metal wire so that they cover the wire completely.

, Run the split bamboo through the flame of a candle while subtly bending it; this will make the bending job easier and you should be able to form a a full circle in less than five minutes., The bottom end of one skewer should overlap with the top end of another skewer to create a 1"" (2.5cm) overlapping connection point.

,


Bring the right and left tips of the long strip together. Again, create a 1"" (2.5cm) overlap with the tips.
Secure the tips together with tape to make a circle.

,


The wires should cross the exact center of the circle so that the circle is divided into four equal quarters. The candle should be centered in the middle of the circle and supported by the wires that are attached to the bamboo frame.
Twist the wires around the frame. Wrap the wire connections with tape to make them more secure.







,,,


Avoid spraying the points where the clothespins are holding the paper. Otherwise, the paper will tear.
Allow the pieces to dry before you continue working with them.

, Use a tape measure or a ruler to measure your line precisely.

, The line should be perpendicular to the vertical line, and the base of the vertical line should touch the midpoint of the horizontal line so that you have 6"" (15cm) on either side of the vertical line.

, The second horizontal line should be parallel to the first, and the vertical line should also cross through the midpoint of the horizontal line so that you have 11"" (28cm) on either side of the vertical line.

, The line should extend from the right end of the bottom horizontal line, curve inward and then stretch out to meet the right end of the second horizontal line.

,, This will finish the shape of your pattern, which should look like the pointed blade of a tropical ceiling fan.

, This shape will serve as the pattern for creating your balloon.

,


Set out two rows consisting of 16-20 pieces of kitchen paper towel (or 8-10 pieces of tissue paper).






The top, shorter width of one row of papers should touch the bottom, shorter width of the other piece of row papers.






Overlap the connected ends of the papers by about 1"" (2.5cm) so that you can glue them together.







, Allow the overlapped seams to dry while they lay on the flat surface. When gluing the paper, gently spread it out––do not blot––this way, you can avoid glue marks in the paper (and blotting can cause weakening in the balloon body's adhesion).

, Center the pattern piece beneath the paper towel/tissue paper and cut the paper towel/tissue paper with scissors so that it matches the exact size and shape of the pattern that you've placed beneath it.

,, Glue the tips together so that they are secure, leaving the base open to create a large bag.

, Tuck the frame about 1"" (2.5cm) inside the opening of the bag.

,


Glue the folded end to the inside of the balloon to secure the frame to the balloon.
Allow the glue to dry completely before attempting to launch the lantern.

, Light the wicks, which are the ends that protrude from the wax-dipped knot, and hold the lantern for a few seconds until the wicks catch fire completely.


Make your wish. Then, let go of the lantern.

Prepare your leaves.,
Cut four 8 by 16-inch (20.32 by 40.64-centimeter) rectangles out of wax paper.,
Fold the rectangles in half widthwise to make 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) squares.Make sure that you are folding the sheets with the wax sides together, otherwise, they won't stick when you iron them.Run your fingernail along the folded edges when you are done to sharpen the crease.

,
Place the leaves face-down inside the folded paper.,
Cover the sheets with an ironing cloth, then iron them until the wax melts and sticks.Place your first panel on the ironing board, and cover it with an ironing cloth.,
Wait for the paper to cool, then tape the panels together to form a long strip.,
Consider giving your lantern a border.,
Fold the strip to make a cube, then tape the first and last panels together.,
Use the lantern.",How to Make Leaf Lanterns1," Find some leaves outside, rinse them under cool water, then pat them dry. You can leave the stems on or cut them off, but make sure that each leaf is smaller than 8 inches (20.32 centimeters), otherwise it won't fit in your lantern. Set the leaves aside when you are done.


Consider pressing the leaves between the pages of a heavy book for several days. This will help dry the leaves out further and flatten them.;
, You can make your lantern a different size if you want to, but the rectangles need to be twice as long as they are tall. For example, you can make a mini lantern using 4 by 8-inch (10.16 by 20.32-centimeter) rectangles.

,, You can place as many leaves as you want inside each paper, but the light will shine through better the fewer leaves you use. These will be the panels for your lantern.


For a twist, consider adding a sprinkle of glitter inside the folded paper., Set your iron to the lowest setting; you want it to be warm, not hot. Cover your work with the cloth, then press the iron over it for 2 to 5 minutes. Flip the paper over, and press it again for another 2 to 5 minutes.Repeat the process with the other sheets, working one at a time.


If you don't have an ironing cloth, you can also use an old pillowcase or thin towel instead.

, Line the sheets up side-by-side to make a strip with the edges touching. Make sure that the front of the leaves are facing you. Cut three 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) long strips of washi tape, and tape the strips together.For a neater finish, make sure that the folded edges of your panels are facing the same direction.
If you are making a smaller/larger lantern, cut your tape accordingly.
Consider using washi tape with a wood grain pattern. This will make your lantern look more like a lantern. You can also use black washi tape instead.

, Cut a 32-inch (81.28-centimeter) strip of washi tape, and place it along the top, long edge of your wax paper strip. Repeat this step with a second 32-inch (81.28-centimeter) strip of washi tape for the bottom edge.

, Make sure that the backs of the leaves are inside the lantern. Next, cut an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) strip of washi tape, and place it along the edge of the first panel. Align the first and last panels together, then fold the tape onto the last panel.

, Get an LED or battery-operated tea light, and turn it on. Set it down onto your table, then place the lantern over it. Avoid using real tea lights, as they can get too hot, and may cause the wax paper to melt and come apart.

Prepare the leaves.,
Get a small, round lid.,
Cut two rectangles out of parchment paper.,
Coat one of the sheets of parchment with glue.You can do this using a spray-on glue, or you can paint it with white school glue and a foam brush or paint brush.,
Add the leaves.,
Cover the leaves and paper with another layer of glue, and press the second sheet of parchment paper on top.Simply spray another layer of glue on top, or paint the glue on using a foam brush or paint brush.

,
Let the paper dry.,
Cut two ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) wide strips out of paper for the top and base of your lantern.The strips need to be the same length as your parchment paper.,
Glue the strips to top and bottom edges of your parchment paper.Coat the back of each strip of paper with glue, then align it with the top and bottom edge of your parchment paper.,
Wrap the parchment paper around the lid and glue it in place.,
Glue down the seam.,
Add a handle.,
Use the lantern.",How to Make Leaf Lanterns2," Find some leaves outside and rinse them off with cool water. Pat them dry. If you want to, you can trim the stems off. Next, place the leaves between the pages of a book, and stack several more heavy books on top. Leave the leaves there for 2 to 3 days.

, The best type of lid would be the cardboard or wood kind that comes from a cheese container.You can also try using a lid from a yogurt or ice cream container instead.


If you are using a plastic lid, you will need to use a hot glue gun to attach it to the lantern.

, Measure the circumference of your lid first, then add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for the overlap. Cut your parchment paper according to that measurement, making sure that both sheets are the same size. Your lantern can be as tall or as short as you want it to be.

, Be sure to coat the paper evenly, from edge to edge.


Keep your work area clean by working on top of some newspapers or a cheap, plastic tablecloth.

, You can use as many or as few leaves as you want, but the fewer leaves you use, the better the light will show through!For a twist, consider adding a sprinkle of glitter.

,, To help it dry nice and smooth, place a stack of heavy books on top of it for about 1 hour., You can use construction paper, scrapbooking paper, or even wrapping paper for this. Try to use a color and/or pattern that matches your leaves.

, Run your fingers over the strips to seal them.

, Draw a line of glue around the outside edge of your lid first. Next, wrap the parchment paper around it, making sure that the bottom edges align. If your lid is made out of cardboard or wood, you can use hot glue or white school glue. If your lid is made out of plastic, you must use a hot glue gun; regular glue won't hold.


If you are using hot glue, squeeze the glue out 1 inch (2.54-centimeters) at a time. If you squeeze it out all at once, the glue will dry too fast, and the bond won't be as strong.
If you are using white school glue, position the lid so that the top is facing inside the lantern, then use clothespins around the base to hold the lantern together until the glue dries.

, You should have about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of excess parchment paper. Draw a line of glue along the edge of the parchment paper, then press it down onto the lantern. Place the lantern, seam-side-down onto the table, then run your finger along the seam from inside the lantern to seal it. You can use a glue stick or white school glue for this.


If you are using white school glue, secure the lantern at the top and bottom with a clothespin until the glue dries.

, Use a hole puncher to punch two holes into the top of your lantern. Try to get the hole into the middle of your ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) wide strip of paper. Next, cut a piece of string, and thread it through the holes. Tie the ends of the string together to make a loop.

, Get a battery-operated or LED tea light, and switch it on. Place it into the lantern, then give the lantern to your child to hold.

Find some leaves you'd like to use, then clean them.,
Mix together equal parts of glue and water.,
Blow up a balloon, then set it down in a large mug or small bowl.,
Tear white tissue paper into 2 by 3-inch (5.08 by 7.62-centimeter) rectangles.,
Start applying the strips to the balloon.,
Apply the leaves to the balloon.,
Apply two more layers of paper on top of the balloon.,
Wait for the balloon to dry, then deflate the balloon and take it out.,
Add a handle.,
Use the lantern.",How to Make Leaf Lanterns3," Rinse the leaves under cool water, then pat them dry. Next, trim the stems off; this will allow the leaves to lay more smoothly against your lantern. Because the leaves are going onto a curve surface, there is no need to press them.

, Find a bowl or disposable container, then fill it with equal parts of white school glue and water. Stir the two together using a plastic fork or spoon; you can also use a popsicle instead.


Avoid mixing too much glue-water at one time. This project may take a while, and you don't want the mixture to dry before you use it all. You can always mix up more glue-water later.

, How big you blow up your balloon is entirely up to you, but the bigger you blow it up, the more leaves you will be able to fit. Consider placing a small pebble or marble inside the balloon first. This will act as a weight, and help keep the balloon steady while you work.

, You can cut the rectangles if you want to, but tearing them will allow them to overlap better and give you a smoother finish. The size does not have to be exact.

, Dip your first strip into the glue-water, then run it over the rim of the bowl to get rid of any excess. Place the strip on top of the balloon and smooth it down. Keep applying the strips in a similar manner, overlapping them slightly.


Leave the bottom part of the balloon (the part that's inside the bowl or mug) uncovered. You want about a 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) opening. Don't worry if it appears jagged; you can always trim it up later.
If the balloon as to get too drippy, you can apply the strips of paper dry.

, Paint the back of each leaf before you press it against the balloon. You can use as many or as few as you want. You could even overlap the leaves, if you'd like. Keep in mind that the more leaves you use, the less light will be able to shine through.

, Use the same technique as before. Again, if the balloon starts to feel too wet, stop dipping the tissue paper into the glue, and simply press it on top of the balloon instead. The tissue paper will stick to the damp paper that's already on the balloon.

, Take the lantern off the mug or bowl and turn it around. Cut a hole near the tail end of the balloon. Slowly release the air from the balloon, prying it away from the sides of the paper as you do. If the lantern collapses, wait until you have taken the balloon out, then push the walls back out from the inside.

, Punch two holes near the top of the lantern, about ½ to 1-inch (1.7 to 2.54-centimeter) away from the rim. Next, thread some string through it, then tie the ends together to make a loop.


If the top opening is jagged, you can trim it down using a pair of scissors.

, Get a battery-operated or LED tea light and turn it on. Place it inside the lantern, then hang the lantern up, or give it to your child to hold.

Prepare your leaves.,
Get a glass vase, bowl, or jar, and clean it well.,
Coat your glass object with a layer of decoupage glue.You can do this using a foam brush or a paintbrush.,
Press the leaves against the glass object.You can use as many or as few leaves as you want.,
Let the leaves dry, then paint another coat of decoupage glue over the leaves.Apply the glue directly to the leaves, then spread it outward towards the edges of the leaves.,
Let the lantern dry completely.At this point, you can choose to apply a second or even third coat of decoupage glue.,
Consider adding a wire handle if your glass object has a neck.,
Make a loop in the middle of the wire.,
Wrap the loose ends of the wire around the neck of your lantern.,
Cut the wire that you used to create the coils off using a pair of wire cutters.,
Fold the remaining wire strand over to the loop you made earlier.,
Use the lantern.",How to Make Leaf Lanterns4," Trim the stems off of the leaves first. Next, rinse the leaves under cool water, then pat them dry. Place them between the pages of a book, then stack several more heavy books on top. Let the leaves sit there for at least 36 hours. This helps absorb any excess moisture and flatten the leaves., Wash your glass object using warm water and dish soap. Dry it off with a soft cloth. Finally, wipe it down with a paper towel or cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oils or fingerprints that may prevent the decoupage glue from sticking.


From now on, try to handle your glass object only from the inside.

, If you are working on a large glass object, paint only a small section of it so that the decoupage doesn't dry out before you get to it.


Many decoupage glues, such as Mod Podge, come in different finishes, including satin, glossy, and matte. Choose one that appeals the most to you. A glossy finish will blend with the glass the best, and a matte finish will give you a frosted look.

, If you plan on layering or overlapping the leaves, however, be sure to paint the backs with more decoupage glue. This will ensure that they leaves stick together., Be sure to coat the glass part as well. This will help seal the leaves in and prevent the leaves from peeling away. Depending on what type of decoupage glue you are using, it may take 1 or 2 hours for it to dry.

, If you choose to do so, let each coat dry before applying the next.

, Get some 18-gauge wire, and cut a 24-inch (60.96-centimeter) long piece using wire cutters.You can use any color of wire you want, but your lantern would look better if the wire matches the leaves. For example, if you are using lots of red, orange, or yellow leaves, a gold or copper-colored wire would look lovely.


If you do not wish to add a handle, click here to learn how to use your lantern.
A wire handle will only work for glass objects that have a neck, such as jars. They will not work for glass objects with smooth walls, such as vases.

, Find the center of the wire, then fold it around a pencil or pen to make a loop. Twist the wire 3 to 4 times to hold the loop, then pull the pen or pencil out. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to pinch the coils together., Take one end of the wire, and twist it around the other 3 to 4 times, as close to the neck of the lantern as possible. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to squeeze the coils shut., Try to cut it as close to the coils as possible. Use your needle-nose plies to fold down any bits of wire that stick out.

, Thread it through the loop, fold it back up, then wrap it around itself 3 to 4 times. Pinch the coils together with a pair of needle-nose pliers.Your handle is now complete.

, Because this lantern is made out of glass, it is safe to use with real candles. You cannot wash it, however, so it would be best to use candles that are already in a container, such as glass votives and tea lights.Alternatively, you can always use a battery-operated or LED tea light instead.

Decide if you need to use a physical location for your deposit.,
See if an online deposit works for you.,
Decide how you want to pay.,
Decide how you want the funds to be received.,
Contact the recipient.",How to Transfer Funds Internationally2," If you need to transfer money at a physical location, Western Union and MoneyGram are your two options. However, for both Western Union and MoneyGram, conducting a transfer at a physical location usually costs more than doing it online.


For example, as of January 2017, MoneyGram's fee for sending a $200 remittance to Mexico from the US is $9.99 vs. $4 for the same service online., Transferring money online can be the easiest and most convenient way to conduct a transfer. All four major transfer companies offer international transfer services from online portals. Choose which one is right for you.


Viamerica and Xoom are two newer companies that cater especially to the remittance market. While Viamerica has some of the best overall rates, they only cover a limited area. Xoom has an excellent network of pickup locations in foreign countries, but can be slightly more expensive.Generally, Western Union and MoneyGram offer both competitive rates and a wide network of pickup locations, although this will vary from country to country.

, While paying with a debit card will be the quickest way for the recipient to get their remittance, arriving in minutes,it also usually carries the highest fees, and often by a substantial margin.A direct transfer from your bank account will carry substantially lower fees, but the money can take days to arrive.


With either MoneyGram or Western Union, you can pay in cash or with a debit card in person, or with a debit card or direct transfer from your bank account online.
Xoom offers payment with a credit card, debit card, or bank account online.Viamerica only does direct transfers from your bank account, which takes a couple of days to confirm and set up.

, Although picking up cash at a physical location is common, you can also deposit the money in the recipient's bank account, and depending on location, on a debit card, mobile wallet, or delivered in person.Again, take into account possible delays and fees (including fees the recipient's bank make charge) when making your choice.


Mobile wallet service is available in Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Romania. The funds are usually available within a few minutes., When the recipient is picking up cash at a physical location, you will need to follow a certain procedure. After the transfer service has gotten the money from you, they will give you a code for accessing the funds on the other end. You will then contact the intended recipient and give them the code. When the funds arrive, they tell the cashier the code and receive the money.


As you might imagine, the code/cash pickup system has a unique set of security vulnerabilities if you don't know the recipient. Money transfer services like MoneyGram and Western Union are prone to scams. Make sure that you are only sending money to a person you trust.

Find out whether these services are available for your destination country.,
Gather the necessary information.,
Send the money.",How to Transfer Funds Internationally3," Some large banks offer special remittance services that allow you to transfer money abroad less expensively than using a wire transfer. However, the list of destination countries is typically less extensive than it would be using PayPal or a money transfer service like MoneyGram or Western Union.For example, Wells Fargo offers an ExpressSend service to 12 countries in Latin America and Asia, including Mexico, China, India, and the Philippines., Every bank is different, but generally, you will have to provide the bank certain information in order for them to process your request. Using Wells Fargo's ExpressSend's service as an example, you will need the following:The recipient's name, address, phone number, and the name of the Remittance Network member where the funds will be picked up.

The address must be an actual physical address. No PO Boxes are allowed.
Indicate whether the telephone number provided is from a land line or mobile phone.


You will need to know how the recipient of the transfer will receive the funds, cash or account deposit. If it will be deposited in their account, then you will have to provide the recipient's account number.

, Be sure to tell the recipient in what currency the money will be available. Wells Fargo, for example, uses local currencies for some countries and dollars for others. If the money is deposited in dollars, there may be additional fees to exchange the currency on the recipient's end.

Advise the recipient of the transfer time.",How to Transfer Funds Internationally4," Wire transfers are among the most expensive ways to transfer money internationally, typically costing $30-$60, but they have much higher available limits than do most other methods of transferring funds. So, before you conduct a wire transfer, make sure that you are sending an amount of money too large to send another way.


The daily outgoing wire limit is going to vary based on your bank and the type of service you pay for on a regular basis. For example, for a typical CitiBank customer, there is a daily $50,000 limit on outgoing international wires. But, for certain Personal International Banking clients, the limit shoots up to $250,000 per day., There is a very detailed article for how to Make-an-International-Wire-Transfer here, but the documentation requirements are fairly standard. You will need the name and address of the recipient, the recipient's bank, and the name of the account where the money will be deposited. In addition, you will need the recipient's account number or International Bank Account Number, and the recipient bank's SWIFT code., You will need to specify the type currency that the recipient should receive. Keep in mind that in most cases, it will be more useful for the recipient to receive the money in their native currency. If the exact amount to be transferred is very important, then make sure that you check the exchange rate that the bank offers., Be sure to ask the bank personnel how long the wire transfer will take. Usually the transfer can be completed in one or two days, but sometimes they can take as long as fifteen business days.The exact time will depend on the amount of money sent, when you sent it, and the destination country.

Find a prepaid debit card that works for you.,
Add money to the card.,
Send the card to the recipient.",How to Transfer Funds Internationally5," There are several companies, such as Akimbo, that offer prepaid debit cards with the capability of sending money abroad.Each brand of prepaid card will have its own set of fess associated with its use, but at the minimum, expect an activation fee. Some card also charge fees for loading money onto the card and withdrawing money from it.


There are two ways to use a prepaid card to send money abroad. You can buy a Visa or Mastercard gift card with international capabilities that has a finite, non-replenishable amount on the card. Or you can use a card that allows you to set up a large, replenishable account that allows users with sub-account cards to withdraw from it.

, The type of card you use will dictate the ways that you can add money to it. Of course, all of them accept cash. However, some replenishable cards even allow you to transfer money onto the card directly from a bank account.

, If you are using either one prepaid card or a card with sub-accounts, you will need to send the card to the recipient or recipients. Use the postal service or a private carrier like DHL, UPS, or FedEX. Be sure to investigate withdrawal limits and transaction fees, as there is often a daily limit for the number of transactions or amount of money that can be withdrawn."

File for replacement or compensation if the money order is lost or stolen.",How to Trace a Money Order1," In order to track your money order, you'll have to have the correct receipt; that is, you'll need the one with the serial number or receipt number of the money order on it. For USPS money orders, this will be the stub on the side of the order. For Western Union orders, this will be the bottom portion.


Some resellers (convenience stores, supermarkets, etc.) may provide you with an additional receipt that does not show the required numbers. This is not the receipt that you need.;
, You will need to contact the issuer of the money order. This is the service that actually processes the order, usually your bank, the US Postal Service, or another money-sending service like MoneyGram or Western Union. The name of the issuer will also appear on the money order and receipt. You should not contact the reseller of your money order, which could be any convenience store, supermarket, or other store where your money order was purchased., Some issuers allow you to track the money order online for free using the serial number. The USPS, for example, has a convenient tracking site that you can use to check the status of your money order and see if it has been lost or stolen.Most issuers do not offer online tracking. If it is unclear if you can do so, or how you can do so, contact the seller to see if it is possible.

, Even if you cannot track the money order directly, you can typically track the physical package that contains it. Most mail services and post offices will provide a tracking number, which you can use online to follow the location of the shipment. If the package does not arrive at its destination, you can show your receipt for the money order to the shipper and request reimbursement., You can find a customer service number on the receipt or stub for the money order. If for some reason the number is illegible or missing, you can easily find contact information for the issuer on their website. All that you will have to do when you call is tell the representative that you need to trace the money order and provide them with the serial number or receipt for the your order.The representative will only be able to tell you if the money order has been cashed or if it is outstanding, and will not be able to tell you it's location., If you believe your money order is lost or stolen, you will have to fill out the proper type of form and mail it in to trace your money order.


For USPS money orders, visit a USPS location and ask for a PS Form 6401 Money Order Inquiry. You will need a valid photo ID and a fee of $6.10 to issue the request. From there, USPS will trace your money order and it will appear on the lost money order list on the USPS website if it is indeed lost or stolen.For Western Union or MoneyGram orders, take the receipt to the agent that you bought the money order from. After you fill out the required paperwork and pay a fee ($15 for Western Union), the service will trace the money order for you. For some tracing requests, this may take up to 8 weeks., Depending on the issuer and the materials you can provide, this can be either an easy or a time-consuming process.


Western Union has a variety of applications for compensation available to customers, and you must select the appropriate form depending on which materials you have (serial number and receipt, for example).If the money order has not been cashed, Western Union will either refund your money or replace the money order.
For MoneyGram money orders, expect that, if the money order has not been cashed, the full amount will be refunded to you within 30 to 65 days of filing the correct paperwork. If the money order has been cashed, though, you will only receive a photocopy of the cashed money order.If you purchased the money order from the USPS, and your money order is found to be lost or stolen, you will be allowed to receive compensation or replacement no sooner than 60 days after you first filed the 6401 form claim mentioned above.USPS will require a processing fee of $6.10."

Use cash.,
Buy a money order with traveler’s checks.,
Purchase a money order with a credit card.,
Pay with a PIN-enabled Visa or MasterCard gift card.,
Purchase a money order remotely.",How to Pay for a Money Order1," Cash is the most widely accepted form of payment for a money order. You can go to any money order provider and purchase a money order with cash. You simply pay for the amount of the money order plus a fee.Companies that issue money orders want the most secure form of payment possible because once they issue the money order, their money is as good as gone.
You can also pay with a debit card linked to your bank account.
You cannot pay for a money order with a personal check. Checks can take a few days to process. If you don’t have sufficient funds, the money order issuer loses the money.;
, The only place you can purchase a money order with a traveler’s check is at the United States Post Office (USPS). You will have to pay for the amount of the money order plus a fee based on the money order amount. When you pay, sign the traveler’s check in front of the postal service worker who is preparing the money order for you.USPS is willing to accept traveler’s checks because they recognize them as a form of cash., Some money order issuers allow you to use a credit card, but not all. You can use a credit card to purchase a money order at Western Union and 7-Eleven. It is expensive to buy a money order with a credit card. Your card issuer will likely view it like a cash advance. This means they will charge you the higher interest rates and fees associated with cash advances. Also, you don’t earn any points or rewards on cash advances, so you won’t earn them for purchasing a money order either., You can pay with one of these cards at Western Union, Walmart, the post office and 7-Eleven. However, doing so is often linked with suspicious activity. For example, some people purchase these pre-paid cards and then immediately liquidate them in order to take advantage of any available rewards the cards offer. Then they deposit the money orders into their bank accounts and use the money to pay their bills. But depositing lots of money orders into your bank account looks like money laundering, and your bank can close your account for doing so., Some companies now allow you to purchase and send a money order online. For example, you can purchase a money order online with Payko and pay with your PayPal account, which is linked to a credit card or bank account. However, you can only purchase a single, $200 money order per day. This method is not as fast as other online bank transfers. Instead of an instantaneous transfer of funds from one account to another, a physical money order is printed out and mailed to the recipient. This can take several days.Sending money over the phone is possible, but this is not the same thing as a money order. You can contact a remittance service like Western Union and request an electronic transfer of funds over the phone. You can pay with a credit or debit card. However, a physical money order is not printed out in this case. Rather, the funds are transferred from your bank account to the recipient’s account electronically."

Keep an eye out for a small test transaction.,
Set up your payment parameters and wait for your ACH debits to begin.",How to Make ACH Payments," The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) was established in 1974 by several U.S. regional clearing houses, the entities that facilitate money transfers between financial institutions.ACH was essentially an agreement among these organizations to streamline the process of clearing funds for transfer.
The NACHA now estimates that $40 trillion per year passes through the ACH Network.;
, Making a paperless payment to your electric company, for instance, involves electronic transactions between you and your bank, the electric company and its bank, and the two banks and one of two ACH Operators which clear the transaction.The payment Originator initiates an ACH payment with his/her financial institution.
The Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI) records the ACH entry.
The ODFI batches together and sends multiple ACH requests to one of two ACH Operators.
The chosen ACH Operator (the Federal Reserve or the Clearing House) clears the request and transmits it (in a batch) to the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI) .
The RDFI credits the Receiver’s account within 1-2 business days.

, With elements such as paperless transactions, clearing of payments between banks, and credits to accounts, an ACH payment has some similarities to wire transfers, writing paper checks, and credit card charges. But it is different from each and has strengths (and possible weaknesses) vis-a-vis these alternatives.


A wire transfer is a direct, paperless transaction between payer and payee, cutting out the “middle man” that clears the transaction. The wire transfer company, such as Western Union, only facilitates the process (and charges a fee for it). Wire transfers are faster, happening almost immediately, but cost more (because of facilitator fees) and may run more risk of fraud (because the the lack of a “middle man” to clear the transaction). If you need to get money to someone right away, a wire transfer is still the fastest way to go.Paper checks follow almost exactly the same process as ACH payments, but they are physically bundled, cleared, and exchanged between financial institutions. Sending a paper check in the mail may seem safer to those who fear online hacking, but remember that a paper check has your name, address, phone number, account number, and routing number. This is more than enough information for a criminal to wreak havoc on your finances.If you are debating whether to set up automatic payments by either ACH payments or credit card charges, your fraud liability level is one factor to consider. By federal code, your liability for fraudulent credit card charges is $0, while with ACH payments (or debit card transactions, for that matter) the maximum liability is $50 if you notify your bank within 48 hours or $500 if you do so within 60 days.Also, keep in mind that if your credit card number is stolen, then this can reduce your available funds on the credit card, but will not affect your bank account balance. However, ACH debit will affect your bank account and you may end up with a bounced check or not be able to pay your bills if the number is stolen.

, There are actually two forms of ACH payment you can make. You may want to think of them as a “push” and a “pull” payment method, respectively.An ACH credit payment is the form most common to online bill paying through your bank. You authorize your bank to send payments (single or recurring) to the designated payee.
An ACH debit payment, however, is more common to online bill paying through the recipient’s website — for example, setting up automatic payments via your electric company’s site. Essentially, you are authorizing the payee to take payments (single or recurring) from your account.
ACH debits, thus, require you to provide your account number and routing number to a third party, the payee (so they can withdraw funds). ACH credits avoid this potential security risk because such information remains in-house with your bank.
Therefore, if you have the option of setting up automatic payments for your electric bill either through your bank (ACH credit) or through the electric company’s website (ACH debit), there may be less risk to your personal financial information by choosing the former.
Having all of your bill pay information together in one account can also be quite convenient. If you need to change or verify anything, then it is all in the same place.

, Online bill pay has become a standard feature of bank accounts, and is usually free with your account.


Because you are setting up online payments through your own bank, you don’t have to worry about providing your bank account information. If you have multiple accounts with that bank, though, you’ll have to choose which to use for online payments.
Online bill payment interfaces vary by financial institution, but there is no reason yours should be anything but intuitive and easy-to-use. If it isn’t, you may want to shop around for a new bank.

, Most banks should permit you to make an online payment to virtually any company or individual, just as you can write a check to just about anyone.


Likewise, just about any potential payee should be able and willing to receive payments from your bank, but it cannot hurt to contact them and make sure.
Your online bill pay interface probably has information on common payees — credit card companies, local utilities, etc. — already on file and ready to go. You may have to search or choose your electric company from a list, for instance, then provide your account number and payment zip code from your electric bill. Often this is enough to get you started.
Other, less common payees, or individuals, may require additional information to be provided. Look at your account statements and/or contact the company directly to obtain the proper billing information.

, Some smaller payees — such as perhaps your local water authority — and almost certainly individuals may not be set up to receive paperless, ACH credit payments. In this case, your bank may actually print up and mail a paper check for you as part of its online bill pay service.


Instead of you remembering to write out and send a check to the water company, then, what may be happening is that you are authorizing your bank to create and send a check to the water company for you each time payment is due. This isn’t actually an ACH credit payment, but you will probably set it up in the same manner as one.
Examine your online billing statements, which usually now contain check images. You should be able to see the image of the check drawn up by the bank on your behalf to pay the water bill.
While you’ll save on postage, please note that these paper checks drawn up for you will have your account and routing numbers on them, so they are no more secure in that regard than sending a check yourself.
Many people use online bill pay instead of purchasing paper checks, regardless of whether they use an ACH credit or their bank account.

, For your rent payment or electric bill, you’ll almost certainly want to set up a monthly payment, thereby giving yourself one less thing to forget about each month.


You can set up a recurring ACH credit in the same amount at the same time each month, which is good for something where the amount due remains steady, such as a mortgage payment.
If your bank is able to receive online statements for your from the payees you designate — when available from a payee, this is usually an option when you add a new online bill payee — you can set up recurring payments in varying monthly amounts. For instance, you can have your total balance due or minimum balance due for your credit card bill paid automatically each month, without you having to take any action.
If you have multiple automatic payments happening each month, keep a close eye on your account balance to make sure you maintain sufficient funds. If you have insufficient funds to make an ACH credit payment, the payment will not be made.

, Call or, more likely, visit the recipient’s website. If you are setting up ACH debit payments, you will more than likely be doing so via signing up on the biller’s website.


Most companies of any significant size have embraced online bill payment because it cuts down on their costs. Think of all the time and staff it takes to open all those envelopes stuffed with paper checks and payment stubs.

, These will naturally vary by recipient, but there are some typical features of the process.


If you are signing up online, you will have to provide, along with standard information about yourself, your bank account and routing number. You’ll find these numbers along the bottom of your checks. If you don’t have paper checks, you can find your account number on statements or other documents, and contact your bank and request your routing number.
Just a reminder: when setting up online payments, or sending out a check, whether voided or active, be careful regarding whom you are providing access to your account and routing numbers. Some security experts recommend that you treat these numbers in the same way you do your Social Security number, so think before you provide them.If you are signing up by filling out a form to be mailed, faxed, or scanned, you may have to provide a canceled check, which will give the payee your account and routing numbers. Write VOID across the middle of the check in bold, large letters (and in ink).

, If you are setting up automatic payments for your phone bill, you may see an ACH debit for a few pennies or even $0.00 from “GloboFone” (or whatever it may be) on your bank statement.


Such a test transaction is the recipient’s way of confirming that your information is correct and that it is able to “pull” funds out of your account.

, Establish the timing and amounts (recurring amount, balance due, minimum due, etc.) to be withdrawn each month or other time period.


You may be able to set up automatic notifications by email or text when you have a new bill, when a payment is posted, etc. This is usually a wise choice.
There may be a delay of up to 1-2 billing cycles before an automatic payment plan takes effect, so be prepared to pay another bill or two as you did before.
Make sure you have sufficient funds so that an automatic ACH debit does not overdraw your account. If the electric company tries to pull out $100 from your account and you only have $80 in it, expect to pay overdraft fees with your bank, as well as any interest/penalties imposed by the payee.

Get the information you need from the recipient.,
Find out the deadline for sending a bank transfer.,
Ensure you have sufficient funds in your account.,
Bring photo identification and your bank card to the bank.,
Complete the bank transfer form.",How to Make a Bank Transfer Payment1," The first thing you will need to do is ensure that you have all the required details from the person you are paying money to. Take time to double-check all of this information thoroughly. The details you use will instruct the bank where to send the money. This can vary a little from bank to bank, but be prepared with the following:


The name and address of the person, company or other entity receiving the money.The name and address of the bank the money is being sent to.
The recipient's account number.
The American Banking Association's (ABA) routing number for the bank the money is being sent to.If you are in the UK you will need the receiving bank's six digit sort code.You may need ""further delivery"" instructions depending on the receiving bank. This could be an additional account number or name.;
, If you need your transfer to arrive the same day, you will need to meet this deadline, which is typically in the mid-afternoon. There may be an extra charge for a guaranteed same-day transfer, so be sure you know exactly what the costs will be.The time will vary from bank to bank, so contact your branch if you are unsure. If you do plan to meet this deadline, be sure to arrive with some time to spare.

, Before you make a bank transfer you should always double-check that you have the required credit in your account. If you don't have the balance necessary to meet the cost you may go overdrawn and be charged by your bank. If you are making a transfer in person in the branch and are uncertain whether you have enough money, ask the bank teller to check before processing the transfer.If you are due to get paid at the end of the week, but only have time to go to the bank before that, you can set the date for the transfer so it is processed after you get paid.
The teller will most likely ask you on what date you want to send the money when she processes your transfer.

, When you go to the bank, remember to bring along some photo ID, such as your driving licence, as well as your bank card. The requirements can vary from bank to bank so if you are uncertain, call up your branch or look on the website for more details. It is better to be certain than risk a wasted trip. When you reach the teller at the bank, say you want to make a transfer. Some banks will only wire money if the sender is there in person.

, The bank teller will pass you a bank transfer form, onto which you put all the information about the transfer. Where you are sending the money, how much you are sending, and what date you want to money to be sent. The teller will then input all the relevant information into the system and send your transfer.


It can take from 1 to 3 days for the funds to appear in the receiving account. Bank transfers sent within the same country usually are credited faster than funds sent internationally.
Transfers to another account held with the same bank can arrive almost immediately.Check your account for transfer fees deducted from your account. Your bank may deduct a fee for sending the transfer, and the receiving bank may also deduct a fee.

Benefits include extra security, no need for a bank account, the chance to make a transaction with a single payment, and the ability to send money overseas. Possible problems in sending a money order include extra fees, extra paperwork, the need to go to a bank or post office instead of going online, dealing with limitations on the amount of money you can send, and occasional delays in sending and receiving money. Consider your options carefully before choosing to send a money order abroad.


If speed is important, consider wiring money instead of sending a money order. Western Union transfers can be done almost instantly, whereas money orders must physically traverse whatever distance is involved. If you have to send more than $700 internationally, you might run into money-order limitations, meaning you would have to purchase more than one money order.;
, Not all nations do. At last count only 29 countries accept American money orders. Any nation is free to place specific restrictions and conditions before accepting foreign money orders. Before proceeding any further, check with your post office about which nations will accept your money order and which might require extra paperwork on your part. , Talk with a clerk at the service window. If you don't know where your nearest post office is, use a post office locator online such as the one at https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorAction!input.action. All full-service U.S. post offices can issue money orders. Other places that sell money orders include credit unions, banks, and certain large retail stores. , In the U.S., they may be purchased for any value up to $700. (Certain countries -- El Salvador and Guatemala, for example -- will not allow money orders larger than $500.) The clerk will furnish you with the appropriate paperwork to fill out.

, You may use cash, a debit card, or a traveler's check. In addition to the face amount of the money order, you will pay a small transaction fee. In the United States an international money order carries a fee of $4.50. This is added to your total when you pay the clerk.
Note that a traveler's check can be used only if the money order is for at least half of the traveler's check's value. For example, if you have a traveler's check for $500, you can use it to purchase a money order worth at least $250 (or more than one money order totaling at least $250.) , There are a number of lines to fill out on the form, and it is essential that you do so correctly. Be sure that you use only blue or black ink and that you print everything correctly and legibly. Most money-order forms will ask you to enter the following:


Today's date
Your full name
Your full address
The recipient's name
The recipient's full address
The amount of money you are sending
A description of the purpose for the money

, Complete all address information, and affix the proper postage. The appropriate postage depends on the weight of the letter and its destination. A one-ounce international letter requires postage of about $1.15. , When you send money orders you can choose to increase the amount of security and insurance on your envelope. Indemnity coverage is provided free of charge, which means that you can request that a lost or stolen money order be replaced for a nominal fee. If you'd like your money order to have more security, insurance is available, as well as other features including registered mail or restricted delivery. You can ask the postal clerk about the costs and benefits of these extra services. , Make sure that the postal clerk provides you with a receipt for your money order. Place the receipt somewhere safe where you can find it later. For example, a wallet, filing cabinet, or desk drawer might be good places to store your money order receipt.


If your money order is lost or stolen, your receipt will help you get your refund quickly. There is, however, a fee of $6.10 for money-order replacements. , Use the Postal Service's tracking feature to predict when your money order will arrive at its destination. This feature will allow you to monitor where your money order is at all times, and it will let you know when your money order is expected to arrive at its destination. This will help you ensure that the money has gone to the right place and person.


If your package goes astray, contact your post office immediately. They will give you the forms to begin the money order replacement process.

USPS does not allow tracing of any money order without a receipt.Call your issuer's customer service number (easily found on their website) to see if they can trace a money order without a receipt.

, You will need to contact the issuer of the money order.

You should not contact the reseller of your money order, which could be any convenience store, supermarket, or other store where your money order was purchased., Money orders purchased from an institution other than a bank may be difficult to track. Try to come up with as much information as possible to help the institution locate your money order before contacting them. Important information to have may include:


Date and time of purchase
Your contact information
Where you bought it
The amount of the money order
Any information about other money orders you purchased on that day, if applicable.

, How this process will work varies between issuers.


For a bank-issued money order, your bank will likely keep a copy of the receipt, as they are the issuing institution. It is also likely that they will be able to identify your money order from your account history and trace it this way. However, none of this is guaranteed and will vary between banks. Contact yours for more information.For tracing orders through a non-bank issuer (such as MoneyGram or Western Union) without a receipt, this will have to be done either in person at the store or with the agent that you purchased the money order from or through the mail. Both options will require you to fill out a form that requires some or all of the information listed above, pay a fee, and either turn it in at the store or mail it in.For Western Union ""Research Requests,"" as these requests are called, a fee of $30 must be paid at the store or included with the mailed-in form., Depending on the issuer and the materials you can provide, this can be either an easy or a time-consuming process.


If the money order is located and has not been cashed, Western Union will either refund your money or replace the money order.
For MoneyGram money orders, expect that, if the money order has not been cashed, the full amount will be refunded to you within 30 to 65 days of filing the correct paperwork. If the money order has been cashed, though, you will only receive a photocopy of the cashed money order."

Go to the post office.,
Use a remittance service provider.,
Pay for online money orders.,
Purchase multiple money orders if you need more than $1,000.",How to Pay for a Money Order2," In general, banks charge the highest fees for money orders. Every bank charges a different amount. Some banks may charge you as low as $1.25 for money orders up to $1,000. Others may charge you as much as $5.00. If your bank charges more than $1.25 for money orders, try to go someplace else to purchase one., The post office charges $1.25 for money orders up to $500 and $1.65 for money orders up to $1,000.

On this line, you should write the name of the person or company who will receive the money order. Always ask the recipient what name should be provided on the money order, as you must use a legal name rather than a nickname.

Determine where the money order is from.,
Find a place to cash it.",How to Cash Money Orders1," Money orders may be issued by the United States Postal Service (USPS), banks, grocery stores, convenience stores, credit unions and cash advance stores.


A money order's place of origin is usually indicated with a logo or stamp in one of the corners of the paper. Look for the USPS logo, a bank logo, or the name of another institution.
If it's unclear where the money order came from, ask the person who gave it to you where he or she got it.
If you can't figure out where the money order came from, that's OK. You won't be able to take it to the post office, but you can take it to your bank or another institution that cashes money orders.;
, Money orders can typically be cashed at the same locations where they were purchased. If you have a bank account, you may also choose to cash it there. These practices are followed internationally.


Go to your bank. A bank in which you have a checking or savings account will cash a money order. Some banks will require you to have enough funds to cover the amount of the money order. You can also deposit a money order into your bank account.
Go to the post office. The post office will cash money orders that were purchased from a post office. Larger post offices have more funds to cash larger money orders, so if your money order is for a huge amount, choose the bigger branch in your area.
Go to a grocery or convenience store. Most grocery and convenience stores that sell money orders will also cash money orders. Their fees are usually low, and sometimes they cash checks for free.
Go to the credit union that guaranteed the funds. For example, if the money order is from the L&N Federal Credit Union, any L&N Federal Credit Union branch will cash the money order in full.
Go to a check cashing store. Use this as a last resort, since check cashing stores usually charge higher fees than grocery or convenience stores.
If you have a money order from a foreign country, you may have to have it cashed in that country and then wired to you. Banks usually charge steep fees for this service, so if possible, make sure money orders are made out to you in the currency of the country in which you plan to cash it.

If the transaction took place online, find your national email or consumer line phone number. The easiest way to find this is to access your national Western Union website and click on ""contact"" in the top right hand corner of the website. The email address for your country is as follows: COUNTRYNAME.customer@westernunion.COUNTRY (e.g, if you're in Germany, the email address would be Germany.customer@westernunion.de).

, You will need to visit or otherwise contact the place of purchase for the money transfer.

, You will now receive your refund in cash or credited to your bank or credit card account.


If you are visiting a sending agency, simply wait for the agent to call one of the Western Union offices, wait a few minutes and then collect your money in cash. Refund requests made on the same day will always include the charges as well as the principal send amount. However, if your refund request is not made on the same day you will lose the charges (unless there was an error on Western Union's side or you were a victim of fraud, in which case you will receive a full refund).
If you contacted Western Union via email, you will receive a confirmation email once your request has been processed.

You will be able to use this online portal to change your contact and billing information in the future, and it’s important you always know what address the bank has on file for you, as certain transactions with your bank card might require a billing zip code for verification.


When inputting your contact email address, make sure to use an an email account that you check daily or frequently in case the bank needs to send you any important information via email, or in case you lose or forget your password and need to be emailed a new one.

, Once you’ve setup your account, take some time to click around the banking portal and learn where things are. If you have multiple accounts, click on each one and see how each account looks when opened and broken down into more detail. Find the “logout” button so you can securely log out of your banking sessions each time you finish.


It’s important to understand the way your specific banking system is set up and where important pages can be located. Simply taking some time to explore the interface is the key to learning the ins and outs of your online banking portal.
A banker or customer service agent from your bank would likely be available to help show you around the website. Give your bank a call or visit a branch for help if you feel you need it.

, One great feature of online banking is the option for getting digital or electronic bank statements rather than the traditional paper statements. Not only is this better for the environment as it saves paper, it can help you stay more organized and on top of your accounts. Most online banking portals will have a tab where you can view your statements in electronic form, sometimes as a .PDF that you can also save to your own harddrive.Usually, there will be an option in your online banking portal to stop all paper statements from being mailed to your home and switch entirely to digital statements. Choose this option if you’re interested.
Some banks offer incentives to customers who want to switch to electronic statements, like a small percentage docked from the interest rates on credit lines. Check with your bank to see if there are any perks for switching to digital statements.

, Many banks offer a free bill pay service through your online banking portal where you can pay utilities, rent, and other monthly charges. You might also have the option to schedule these payments ahead of time and not even have to worry about them each month. Many services now have the option to link your bank account for automatic payments, which you can then monitor through your online banking portal.Remember: only set up automatic or scheduled payments if you are sure the funds will be in your account on the day those bills will process. You won’t want to get hit with any overdraft fees.

, Once you are a customer of a bank and have an account with them, you can often use the online banking portal to sign up for new accounts as well. Once you’re logged in, all the information the bank has on file for you can be accessed, so applying for new lines of credit, opening new accounts, or even applying for loans or mortgages can sometimes be done right from the comfort of your home., Online banking portals often have message inboxes where you will be securely notified of new account statements, and changes to your account information. Make sure you locate this inbox and check it regularly. Not only will you find these important account alerts, you might also find customer-only offers for new banking products. Credit lines with low introductory interest rates, high-yield savings accounts, and other services might be offered to you specifically through that message inbox.


These alerts may or may not also forward to the personal email account you have tied to the banking account. Some online portals might require you to specifically select this option in the settings of your online banking inbox.

, If you have multiple accounts with one bank, you can use your online banking portal to transfer money between those accounts. You can also send money to other people who have accounts at the same bank, and even to people with accounts at partner banks. For example, Wells Fargo and Bank of America allow their customers to transfer money between accounts at the two banks.


Make sure you know what fees may apply to this service. For the most part, transfers between your own accounts will come as a free service, but federal law prohibits more than 6 transfers from a savings account to a checking account in one month. When using the transfer tool on your banking portal, any fees will be listed prior to you confirming the transfer.

, Many banks have smartphone apps you can download and access on the go. Simply search for your bank in the app store on your smartphone and download the application. Make sure the app is created, owned, and operated by your bank. You will likely see offers or advertisements for this app on the bank’s website or in the branches. Some banks even offer the option to deposit checks with the camera on your smartphone. You can also use these apps to transfer money, monitor account balances, and locate nearby ATMs and branches.

, When you are connected to a public WiFi connection, avoid inputting any personal information, including passwords and banking information. There are ways for hackers and thieves to steal your information when it is transmitted over unencrypted signals, which is often the case with public or free WiFi connections.If you rely on this kind of connection, consider downloading an encryption software onto your browser to keep your information safe.

, Just like when you type in your PIN at the ATM, you will want to make sure no one can see your screen if you are banking online in a public place. If you’re using your smartphone to check your balance, for example, make sure no one is looking over your shoulder or standing very close by. Keep passwords and balance information private from onlookers.


Cover the screen of your phone or laptop with your hand if you’re worried about prying eyes, or simply wait until you are at home or in a private place to access your online banking information.

, One of the best ways to make sure your accounts are secure is to monitor them for signs of any unauthorized charges. Online banking offers 24/7 access to your accounts, which makes it easier to monitor the activity in them. If you see any charges you don’t remember making yourself, contact the bank immediately. Have the charges open in front of you for easy reference and access."

Wait one to three days for the transfer to post.",How to Transfer Money from One Bank to Another1," Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments fall into one of two categories: debit and credit payments. Transferring money between bank accounts is considered a debit and can be completed fairly quickly. Different banks sometimes have different ACH payment procedures that you will need to follow in order to transfer your money. ACH payments are extremely common and are used in different forms to direct deposit paychecks, pay bills online and transfer money between accounts.Tell your bank you would like to execute an ACH transfer and they will walk you through the steps if you would like to do it over the phone.
Banks often charge fees for ACH transfers. The fee is usually under ten dollars, but ensure you find out exactly what the fees will be.;
, You will need, at minimum, the bank account and routing number of the account you wish to transfer money to. You can find these numbers on the bottom of a check you have for the receiving account. The account number is on the bottom right and the routing number is on the left. If you are sending the money to someone else, you will need to get this information from them.Routing numbers are often available online. The routing number is an identifier for the bank your account is in, so try looking on their webpage to locate it.
You will also likely need the name of the person on the account you are transferring the money to if it isn’t your own account.
Be careful when sharing any banking information with other people. Do not provide your account numbers to people you do not have sufficient reason to trust.

, An ACH transfer can overdraw your account if the funds are not available, which may incur overdraft fees from your bank. Before executing an ACH transfer, be sure to verify that you have the money in your account.


Make sure any deposits you need to make the transfer have cleared.
Ensure there are no outstanding debits that haven’t posted yet that could bring your balance below the amount you are transferring.

, Many banks with online banking allow you to complete ACH transfers simply by filling out an online form, but you may prefer speaking to someone over the phone or in person. Regardless of the method you use to convey the information, you will need to provide your own account information and the recipient account and routing number. Make sure to specify how much you would like to transfer.Many banks allow you to set up automatic, recurring ACH transfers for recurring bills or transfers to a savings account.

, ACH transfers are slower than wire transfers, but usually cost less. It can take up to three business days for the money to reach the recipient account. The time and day you send the money can affect how long it takes for the funds to arrive. Submitting an ACH transfer late in the day may mean the process won’t begin until the following day and weekends do not count as business days. As a result, using an ACH transfer late on a Friday can mean waiting up to five days to receive the funds (longer if there are any holidays).Remember that weekends and federal holidays do not count as business days.
If the money does not post in the other account within three days, contact the sending bank to see if there has been an issue with the transfer.

Be proactive.",How to Make Online Banking Safer2," Your customers will rely on you as the ultimate authority in whether or not they have been scammed, and you should know how to identify common scams such as phishing emails and spoofed websites, as well as how your customers can avoid falling for these tricks., You should be able to explain to customers in-depth how to properly use the security features that you offer. Some customers may need more help than others; customers who are not very familiar with computers may not understand how to choose a good password, or why their password choice would be important., If a customer requests that you sign into their online banking for them to assist them with something, thank them for their trust, but remind them that nobody should ever access their online banking other than themselves. Instead, offer them a computer (if one is available for customer use) and invite them to sign in privately, and then you can walk them through their transaction. Tell your customers that no banking representative should ever require their online banking password to assist them., If a customer comes to you with a concern that their online banking has been compromised, do not dismiss them. Listen carefully to everything they have to say, and look at anything they may have brought with them to show you.

If the customer has been scammed, you should write down whatever the customer tells you about the scam, and if possible, make a copy of anything they have brought in. Pass this along to the appropriate party, ideally your Fraud and Security department. They may be able to warn other customers about the scam and prevent any further fraud.
If the customer has not been scammed, reassure them that everything is alright but that they have done the right thing by being cautious. If possible, show them how they can identify that this situation was not a scam, so that they are better-prepared in the future.

, You can be a valuable resource to both your employer and your customers by being vigilant towards online scams.

If your bank's website does not list common scams and security tips, offer to write some up yourself.
If you hear of a new scam on the rise, share that information with your coworkers and your manager so that everyone is prepared to help customers guard against this new threat.
If you feel that your online banking interface could be more secure, discuss your concerns with the appropriate person in your bank.

Understand the variables of your payment plan.,
Calculate your total accrued interest.,
Calculate the total cost of your purchase.,
Calculate your average payment amount.",How to Use a Simple Interest Calculator to Find Your Payment Amount1," To calculate your payment amount you will need to know the interest rate, the principal amount and how long you will be making payments.


Interest rate. The rate of your simple interest payment plan will most likely be communicated with a number in percentage form. This percentage reflects the amount of money extra you will be paying given a certain amount of time. Usually the rate is annual - for example if your rate is 15%, the extra amount will be 15% of the principal for every year that you have an outstanding balance.
Principal amount. This amount reflects your outstanding balance. For instance, if you bought a computer that costs $2,000 and paid $1000 upfront, you would then have a principal amount of $1,000 left to pay.
Time period of payment plan. This is the amount of time between your first and last payment. The longer the period is, the higher the total amount you paid for your purchase will be.;
, You need to find out much extra is going to be added to your outstanding balance.


Identify your your variables. What is the rate, the principal and time period of your payment plan?
Be sure to convert your rate into a decimal amount. To do this you need to divide the number in the percentage by 100. For example, if your rate is 15%, divide 15 by 100 - you will get .15, the rate in decimal form.
Consider the period of your payment plan versus the period specified by your interest rate. Does the period of your payment plan fit evenly into the period specified by the rate? If not, you will need to divide your interest rate before you do any further calculation with it. Imagine the case where you will only be making payments for 7 months but the rate is given per annum. You will probably need to divide the annual interest rate by 12 in order to generate a monthly interest rate.
Multiply your rate in decimal form by the principal (rate x principal). This tells you how much interest will accrue per period. For example, if the principal is $1000 and the annual interest rate is 15% (.15), then you will be paying $150 per year in interest. If the principal is $1000 and your monthly rate is 3% (.03), then you will have to paying $30 per month in interest.
Multiply the amount of interest per period by the number of time periods you expect it will take you to complete your payment (interest accrued per period x periods). This will give you your total accrued interest. Say you know that you'll be paying $150 per year in interest and you will be paying off your purchase for 3 years – by multiplying these numbers ($150 x 3) you would find that your total accrued interest is $450.

, Add your total accrued interest to your principal amount (interest + principle). If you found that your total accrued interest is $450 and the corresponding principal amount is $1000, by adding these two figures you'll find that the total cost of your purchase is $1450.

,


Consider how often you will be making your payment compared with the period in which you are accruing interest. Say the period in which you accrue interest is 3 years - if you are making monthly payments, there will be 36 of them; if you are making semiannual payments you will be 6 payments.
Divide the total cost of your purchase by the amount of payments you will make.

Confirm that you have a life insurance policy that carries cash value.,
Consult your policy documents to find the current cash value of your policy, which should be amortized in the contract.,

Compare the costs of accessing this money against other credit options.,
Finalize the loan.",How to Use Insurance Investments for Loans," Other life insurance is as unsuitable for this as your auto insurance policy.


Cash value life insurance builds an accessible fund with each premium payment, in a manner not unlike the way your mortgage payments build up equity. That's your money, but it is tied to the death benefit when the policy pays out. If you take a loan from it, your death benefit will be reduced until you pay the loan back.
Whole life, universal life and variable life, as well as annuity life products, are the most common life insurance policies to carry a cash value.;
, Confirm that it's enough money to suit your financial needs. Also like home mortgage equity, you may be surprised at how slowly the cash value builds.

, Say that you want to take out a ""policy loan"" on the cash value life insurance policy in question. Have the policy number ready.

,, Interest rates and fees for life insurance policy loans are often quite high as compared to traditional funding options. They are, however, usually less expensive than payday loans and credit cards.

, This may require you to sign documents and fax them to your insurance company. In general you will receive your payment in the same form you make your premium payments--by check if you mail in payments or by direct deposit if you have an automatic draft.

Pick a bank with a low or no minimum balance requirement.,

Try a trial online bank account and keep your brick and mortar accounts.,
Experience the speed that transactions are posted.,
Switch online banks if not satisfied.",How to Choose an Online Bank," There are online bank ratings, comparisons, and reviews. A wealth of information is on the net in this new and booming sector of banking. Research online banks with the following questions:


Where is their headquarters located at?
How long has the company been in business?
Are they listed on the stock exchange?
How is the phone and email customer service reputation?
Is their website easy to use and navigate?
What other services do they offer?;
,, Online bill payments remove the stress of mail getting lost, stolen, or delayed. The cost of stamps, envelopes, and stationary are almost gone in bill paying. Each online payment has a verification number that should be recorded. Paying a credit card bill late could result in a rate hike and paying online is fast. Payments can be made to companies or individuals and the information on each of them need only be input once (payments after that are a breeze).

, This is one of the great features of online banks. Even if free ATM use is limited, they will allow a reasonable amount of free withdrawals, before ATM fees kick in. A couple of online banks might have unlimited, free ATM withdrawals, but with online bill payment, ATM and check use will decline anyway. Take the next step in convenience with an online account with a good ATM usage feature, i.e., free ATM use.

, The network has to be widespread for convenience. Notice at ATMs and at card scanners, what networks they support. A couple of online banks might have a debit card rewards program.

, Direct payroll deposits are faster than depositing a paycheck in person. Some banks allow customers to deposit checks using a scanner and email. Other banks supply prepaid deposit envelopes.

,, Another feature that online banks have over brick and mortar banks is that they can offer lower minimum balance requirements. Online banks also have lower or no monthly charges and at times, free checks.

, Most online banks will have yields in multiples of what brick and mortar banks do. The interest posted each month will be a surprise.

, To have the best services, choose an online bank from a wide geographical area, but sometimes, a brick and mortar bank with online banking may be best. For example, a small business owner may not be able to do online banking in another state if his or her deposit consists of many checks and cash.

, Later, it is a good idea to have a brick and mortar account as a back up, in case you need instant cash for those unforeseen circumstances. There are alternatives for getting quick cash such as using a personal check or making a credit card cash advance.

, Some banks are slow to post transactions and correct balances.

, Banks are can close accounts after a period with no charges.

Review the potential borrower's credit profile.,
Weigh the available information and decide.,
Work with the actuarial team to determine loan rates and fees.",How to Underwrite Loans," Payments such as those equal to the proposed mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance comprise mandatory monthly costs. These are costs that are necessary and cannot be compromised or adjusted with ease.;
, Debts from other loans, such as student loans for example, and revolving debts (credit cards) must be taken into consideration. For revolving debts, 5% of the total debt is typically applied.

, This amount includes salary, commissions and dividends which occur with regular frequency and therefore can be relied upon. This amount is used to counterbalance monthly costs and debts.

, This figure represents the Primary Housing Expense to Income ratio. If this ratio is unfavorable, the borrower could be at risk for loan denial.

, The result is known as the Total Obligations to Income ratio. A favorable result that shows the income holding a strong proportion against total obligations can work for the proposed borrower seeking loan acceptance.

, If the borrower is purchasing a home or property, this becomes increasingly important. Whether or not the borrower has means (via payment methods such as cash, stocks, bonds, or property sale) to make a down payment on a new purchase can weigh heavily upon the acceptance of a loan application. Furthermore, the larger the down payment, the smaller monthly payments may be, and vice -versa.

, This can include credit reports and scores from major credit bureaus such as Experian. Each credit union may report different items and scores, so up to 3 may be used. Items on the credit report must be verified and analyzed, with special consideration given to negative events such as charge offs, account closures by companies, previous loan defaults and late payment trends.

, Once all the information that completes a potential borrower's financial profile is available, underwriters attempting to underwrite a loan must consider all of the factors and the trends and risks they represent.

, Once an underwriter decides to approve a loan, he or she ought to use actuarial data to determine the specifics of the loan offered to the borrower.

Tracing debtors can be a difficult task.,
When trying to trace a debtor it is best if you can look into the person’s financial history and see if you can pinpoint something that can lead you to believe one of the above reasons is true, for example


The person was a regular payer until a particular date
The person has never paid any of the money owed

,
Now you should have a vague idea as to the reason for none payment and you can tailor your actions accordingly.

,
The first thing to do is to speak directly to the debtor, for this you will need to have been smart at the start of the business relationship, time after time firms carry out hundreds if not thousands of pounds worth of work for a client or customer without having all the customers contact details, if you are dealing with an individual or sole trader you need to make sure you have


Home address/work address
Home telephone number
Mobile number
Valid email address

,
These are the minimum requirements; you should also try for partners name and date of birth.,
Once you have all this information you need to check it, try different numbers to contact your customer so in the event of them not paying you can get in touch with them quickly and resolve any matters before they escalate.,
When calling a debtor make sure you try at different times of the day, if you only call at one particular time and receive no answer then this could simply be because the debtor is working at that particular time.,
If you still receive no response it is worth following up on one of the above actions but if you wish to persist then the next step is to confirm that they are still at the address.,
Assuming that the debtor is still residing at the address it is time to follow up the threats with some action, you need to instruct a debt collection agency or solicitor to collect the debt on your behalf because you have run out of other legal options.,
If the debtor has moved it can become very difficult especially if they have moved within the last three months, this is because it takes around this amount of time for the debtor to start showing at the new address.,
The best piece of advice is to collect as much information about the person when they are prepared to give you it i.e.,
Finally good luck with any trace and collect work you undertake.",How to Trace and Collect Debt," What you must always remember is that people who owe money are not necessary bad people; they are usually in debt for a reason such as:


Fallen on hard times
Not happy with product or service so refuse to pay
Unaware of payment terms
Have moved addresses and not told the company or people they owe money too;
,,,, It may seem strange at the time but if you have to trace somebody then these are the pieces of information that will lead you to the person. If you are working for a company it is worth doing a company credit check, this will reveal


Company accounts – Are they making any money?
Directors names – Is the person who placed the order a director?
County court judgements – did they pay their other suppliers?
Directors dates of birth and addresses
Company telephone number

, It is also worth pointing out that if you are offering credit terms you need a consumer credit license to cover you in the event that you are not paid.

, So spread the calls out, you can telephone somebody up to three times a day and leave three messages, I think that it is more professional to leave only one, you do not want to harass anybody. If after calling you have still received no response you must contact the debtor by post and email, I would recommend sending a basic letter to them, explaining the current situation, if after a week you have still not had a response send another letter but be firmer this time, explaining the action that will be taken if the debt is not paid by a particular date. The third letter should be worded stronger still, explain in clear detail the action that will result in the letter not being responded to, this could be


A debt collection agency will be used
A solicitor will be used
Costs and interest will be added to the account

, The simplest way to do this is to contact a neighbour of the debtor and ask them, it must be said that discretion must be used, do not tell the neighbour anything about the debtor just simply ask if the person still lives next door, if they demand to know who you are simply state that you have some correspondence that you need to get to them, if they press you further thank them for their time and end the call. Remember to withhold your number though! Its 141 if you don’t know.

, You could use an online solicitor to send a “letter before action” again this is an idle threat but since it on headed paper from a solicitor it carries more weight, note that the solicitor will want at least £5 for doing this and will not follow up the action but this is a tried and tested technique and does have good results.

, Everyone shows at their address, what I mean by this is that when you do normal everyday things like fill in your address on a form you leave a trail back to your address. Some people say that they don’t but everybody does, information is collected by everyone these days and if you read the terms and conditions of most large organisations they do say that they will pass information about you to other large organisations, this takes time so for three months none of the systems will be showing the new address and you will need to do something other than system based trace work. The only method now is to get on the phone and start calling other people, you can try neighbours who might know the debtors whereabouts, again remember not to start discussing any issues you have with the debtor with their neighbours as this could land you in serious trouble. You can also try people who live locally with the same surname, hoping that they will be relatives who will be able to help you in your location enquiry. To do this try BT.com, you can search an area and surname to get useful telephone numbers.

, at the start of any business relationship. When getting people to fill out any order form as them for all the information you need then, at that moment the balance of power is with you, they want something from you so you can use this to your advantage, if they pay you can destroy the information, if they don’t you have it to hand. It is also worth doing because the serial debtors and there are lots of them about, will not be happy leaving so much information with someone whom they intend to con, they will leave sections of the order form blank and suggest that they don’t need to fill in their address as you can contact them on the telephone, be wary of these people.

, Remember to always work with ethics and integrity.

Examine what a sub-prime loan is.,
Understand that the whole problem started when people without the means to pay back money were loaned money, undoing previously cautious lending decisions.

,
Note that there are many remedial actions which can eliminate the negative effects of sub-prime lending.,
Be aware that a downtrend of the financial markets doesn’t mean effectively that overall world economy is under threat.

,
Look at the history of real estate value increases and decreases.,
Consider the above factors, although they are not to be taken as facts in all cases, nor do they all apply to every case.,
Look at other events that have contributed to the buyer having less funds available to make their mortgage payments each month.,
Look at the down-turn in the real estate market.,
Realize that the markets are no more or less volatile than they have been in the past, and that an upswing in the real estate markets could turn the situation around in a fairly short period.

",How to Understand Subprime Lending Problem," Although the prefix sub usually means below, in this case, it means higher than, or more than prime, or the prime interest rate. The prime interest rate is the interest rate banks are charged for loans, and doesn't reflect the typical rate on a personal mortgage, although when the prime rate falls, especially for several quarters, and a significant amount, other interest rates usually follow suite. This means borrowers were paying higher than prime interests rates, which results in higher monthly payments.;
,, The world economy is pretty much stable and sustainable compare to earlier recessions. Although market parameters are more complex than before, there are no quick fixes for the current prevailing economic slump. However, simple rules of macro economics and micro economics can resolve the challenges.

,, This is the heart of the current sub-prime mortgage troubles, and here is a simplified view of credit companies rationale for issuing sub-prime loans to under qualified buyers.


Real estate values increased faster than almost any other market or investment program over the past 20 years.
Average earnings increased at a fairly steady rate (averaged) over the past 40 years.
Inflation and low interest returns on other investments were not satisfying many investor's desires for larger returns.
A perception that if sub-prime mortgages failed at a predicted rate, the reselling of these properties would generate profits, not losses, for the investors involved.
There possibly has been an underlying thinking in some investor's minds that the government would step in to bail out the buyers if they faced foreclosure, and to a limited extent, this has occurred.

, People on both the buying side of this economic dynamic and the selling side were overconfident in both the continued climb of real estate values and sales, and assumed that earnings would increase without a similar increase in the cost of living, which would enable the buyer to handle the high cost of the loan.

, Gasoline and other fuel prices have steadily increased for the past 4 years, as have medical, insurance, education, and food prices. This could be considered a contributing factor in a buyer having less money from their monthly income to use for making their mortgage payments.

, Even in areas where real estate values are relatively steady, a situation that is unusual in the present (2007-2008) market, most markets have experienced a dramatic down-turn in sales, so buyers who purchased property to take advantage of the strong market a few years ago to net a profit on their purchase are looking at the loan costs out-pacing their investment appreciation, offering them little incentive to maintain the integrity of their loans.

Check if the borrower has received pre approval for the loan.,
Verify the borrower’s employment.,
Review the borrower’s credit report.,
Ask the borrower to submit any additional reports or documents, as needed.,
Understand the role of the underwriter.,
Communicate with the underwriting team if a “suspense” is placed on the loan.,
Allow the underwriter to approve or deny the loan request.",How to Process Loans," By the time the borrower's application reaches you, they may have received pre approval for the loan via their bank, based on their finances.The lending agent at the bank will act as the intermediary between you and the borrower.


Processing usually occurs 5-20 days after the borrower has completed the loan application.;
, In addition to reviewing the borrower’s tax returns and current proof of employment, you should also contact your employer for official verification.

, Use a credit report from three credit monitoring bureaus to verify the borrower’s debt and payment histories, as well as borrower’s credit score.


Check the borrower’s assets (checking and savings accounts) and any outstanding debits (car payments, student loans).If there are unacceptable late payments or judgments for collection, have to borrower provide satisfactory written explanation for them.

, For example, if the borrower is purchasing a home, you will need their title report to ensure there are no outstanding liens against the title, which would affect their legal ownership.


For a mortgage loan, you will need to pay particular attention to the borrower’s income to ensure their total monthly mortgage payments will not swallow up their total gross monthly income.You should also make sure the borrower has a home insurance policy.

, The underwriter is responsible for determining if the loan package is acceptable and that the borrower’s risk has been established.An underwriter may also look at the borrower’s ability to pay off the loan, their credit history, and any collateral offered against the loan.Lender underwriting occurs 20-30 days after it has been submitted by the loan processor., A “suspense” occurs if more information is needed for the loan package. Discuss any issues with the underwriter to try to resolve them.


If necessary, the borrower may be contacted by the underwriter to supply additional documentation., Once the loan package is in order, the underwriter will give conditional approval to the bank, who will then notify the borrower of their approval.


As the loan processor, you are now no longer involved in the loan package.

This can clear up any problems and may prevent you from having to remove your guarantor and go through the process of renewing your loan.


In some cases, you may not be able to speak to your co-signer because of death or divorce. In these cases, you may need to speak to your and the individual’s lawyer.
In the case of the death of a guarantor, many institutions will call the co-signed loan and collect from estate of the guarantor if equitable security cannot be obtained by the borrower.
Your guarantor may have a legitimate reason for wanting off of the loan, such as she is buying a house and doesn’t want this tied to her credit.If you have some type of personal issue with the guarantor, this may not be enough of a justification to remove her as co-signer.
Your guarantor should also have a copy of the loan terms and you may want to call her attention to the clauses on guarantors for her information.;
, Every loan comes with paperwork that details the terms of the loan, including contingencies related to a guarantor.Knowing the details related to guarantors on your loan can help you not only understand what you require to remove a guarantor, but also if it is even possible.Be aware that many lenders will not allow you to remove guarantors, except in cases of death or possibly divorce.In the case of divorce, both parties typically remain liable unless there is a court order.
In cases where you may remove and/ or replace a co-signer, there may be additional fees or you may even need to sign a new contract, which could change the terms of your original loan.Call your lender if you have any questions.

, If you decide to proceed with removing your guarantor, schedule a meeting with your lender. This can help you explain the reasons for why you want to remove the lender as well as discuss what options you have in altering the loan terms.


You can also schedule time to speak to your lender over the phone if meeting with the organization in person isn’t possible.
Make sure to schedule the meeting as soon as possible, possibly before your next payment is due.
Be honest with your lender. This may help open up different options for removing the co-signer.

, Discuss with your lender all of the options available to you to remove or replace your guarantor. Knowing what possibilities you have may save you money, headaches, and possibly your relationship with your guarantor. Some of the options you may have include:


Removing a guarantor altogether.
Replacing the guarantor.
Paying off the loan or refinancing it.It's also possible that you will not have the option to change the terms of the loan or remove the guarantor.

, Once you’ve had a chance to review your options with your lender and guarantor, make a decision on how to proceed. Make sure that whatever decision you render is in the best interest of you and the guarantor.


Because the relationship of guarantor-borrower is often personal, you’ll want to make sure that any terms are not to the detriment of either party, which could have a significant impact on personal ties.
In some cases, you may have to involve a lawyer, especially in cases of death or the demise of a personal or business partnership.
Be aware that in most cases, the guarantor is legally committed to remain co-signer no matter her personal preferences.She should have contemplated such contingencies before agreeing to act as your guarantor.

, If your lender allows you to remove the guarantor from your loan, you may have or want to renegotiate the terms. This may help you get better rates or remove the necessity for a guarantor altogether.


Be aware that a bank will not allow a past-due or defaulted account to remove a guarantor. In this case, you will have to replace the guarantor you removed with someone else.
The bank may reassess your need for a guarantor based on successful payments of the loan and proof that you have improved your credit score and are able to continue making regular payments.In turn, this may give you a more beneficial interest rate or even loan terms.If you are able to replace the guarantor, the lender will need information for a new guarantor before it can renegotiate the terms of your loan.

, If you are able and need to replace a guarantor on a loan, you will need to designate a new guarantor for the loan. Identify several potential persons or organizations that could act as a guarantor for your loan. This can help ensure that you have a viable replacement in the event that someone doesn’t agree to act as your co-signer.


You can ask close friends, family members, or employers to act as your guarantor. Make sure to only ask persons who are close to you and know you are asking in good faith.
Be honest with any person or organization you ask about why you need a guarantor. This could help you secure a co-signer and demonstrate a request made in good faith.
Be understanding if an individual or organization cannot act as your guarantor. This is a significant responsibility that may leave them with a considerable burden in the event your default.

, A potential guarantor needs to have good credit in order replace your current co-signer. Checking the financial viability of the person you asked to act as your guarantor can help you avoid problems or delays when you renegotiate loan terms with your lender.


You can ask your guarantor about their financial health, which may be enough information.
If you want to be absolutely sure you can avoid problems replacing the proposed guarantor with your lender, ask them to provide you a copy of her credit report from the three primary credit reporting agencies. The bank will request this information in any case.
You may not need to ask an organization for its credit information, though the lender will also require information about it as well as a contact person, such as the Chief Financial Officer or your boss.

, You will need to give your lender information regarding the person or organization you have designated as the replacement guarantor. Make sure to have all relevant financial information for your co-signer to avoid delays to approval. Your guarantor may need the following forms of identification or financial information:


Credit report(s)
Employment and salary information
Proof of ability to pay
Personal identification including age
Proof of residence or citizenship., Your lender will need to approve your proposed guarantor in order to add her name to your loan. Wait for the response from your lender before making any plans.


It may take your lender up to a week to make a decision on the viability of your proposed guarantor. For example, the lender may run credit reports or contact your co-signer’s employer during this time.
If your lender doesn’t approve your guarantor, present another one of your options for co-signing the loan.

, Once your lender approves the renegotiated loan terms and your replacement guarantor, you will need to sign the necessary paperwork. Make sure your guarantor is present, as she will also need to sign the documents.


You may need to schedule an appointment with your lender to sign the new loan. Make sure your appointment is at a time that both you and your guarantor can attend.
Some lenders may not issue the loan or refinance until they have the physical signature of your co-signer.
Make sure that you and your guarantor read the terms of the loan very carefully before signing. If you have any questions or concerns, ask your lender to clarify them.Be aware that your guarantor may not agree to act based on the terms of the loan, which represents a considerable risk for her and her credit., Once you’ve signed the loan, make sure you and your guarantor have copies of the loan agreement. This can help clarify any questions or issues that may come up between in the life of the loan., It’s important to make regular and timely payments on your loan. This can help improve your credit score and may help you get better loan terms on your current or future loans.


If you are unable to make a payment, call your lender and speak to someone about the issue. In many cases, lenders are willing to work with a person if they’ve make regular payments and agree to make installments towards any overdue amount.

Take care of any shortage.",How to Put Money in Escrow," Even if your lender doesn't require you to set up an escrow account, you may want to ask if you can have one anyway.An escrow account means you can pay a little each month toward your property tax and homeowner's insurance premiums, both of which normally are paid in large lump sums each year.
Making monthly payments toward these expenses can be easier to budget. Keep in mind that without an escrow account, you'll have to put back money to pay these large annual expenses yourself.
Escrow accounts typically are required if you have a federally guaranteed loan, such as a VA or FHA loan, or if you have a conventional mortgage in which you've borrowed more than 80 percent of the value of the property.;
, Your lender may need information from you about your homeowner's insurance and your property tax.If your lender doesn't have the correct information, you may end up getting a bill stating that your lender has not paid your taxes or premiums on your behalf. It can be complicated to get your money out of the escrow account in this situation.
Based on the information you provide, your lender will calculate the amount of money you need to deposit in the escrow account each month to cover insurance premiums and property tax.
You should use the total annual payments owed for tax and insurance to calculate your own payments and double-check the calculations made by your lender.Keep in mind that some premiums are paid to cover you for a period of several years, so you'll have to divide that premium by the number of years of coverage to get the annual cost for that policy.

, If your mortgage lender, as your escrow agent, is paying your homeowner's insurance premiums and your property tax for you, make sure the bills are sent to the right place and not to you.


Keep in mind that even if your lender is paying these bills, they are ultimately your responsibility. You must make sure that the correct amount is being paid on time., Your lender and the bank typically will require the escrow account to be established with a minimum balance which is maintained at all times.Federal law limits the amount of money your lender can require you to keep in your escrow account.In most cases, the minimum balance must be an amount equal to about two monthly payments. This reserve covers any possible increase in taxes or premiums., Your monthly deposit will be approximately one-twelfth of the total of your state property taxes and your annual homeowner's insurance premium.Typically you will simply make a single monthly payment to your mortgage lender. Part of that payment will go towards your mortgage principal and interest, while the rest goes into your escrow account to cover your property taxes and insurance premiums.
Keep in mind that if you don't keep up with your escrow deposits, you may be charged penalties from your lender and ultimately could face foreclosure.
If your property taxes aren't paid, the state could place a tax lien on your home.
If your homeowner's insurance isn't paid, this could lead to foreclosure if your mortgage lender requires you to maintain insurance coverage – and most do. The lender also may buy a policy and add the premium amounts to your loan balance. These insurance policies, usually called either ""force-placed"" or ""lender-placed"" insurance, tend to cost more and offer you fewer benefits than if you chose your own policy and paid for it yourself.

, Keep up to date on the status of your account by monitoring the balance and your deposits.Typically you can go online between annual statements to monitor the transactions posted to your escrow account., Your lender is required by federal law to send you an annual statement of the transactions posted to your escrow account.The statement typically includes a list of all deposits and payments made out of the account, as well as an analysis of the expected activity for the next year.Compare your statement to your initial statement or the previous statement and make sure they are in agreement.

, You may want to double-check any statements you've received for property taxes or insurance premiums to make sure they match the amounts listed on your escrow account statement.


Verify the due dates for your taxes and premiums, especially if the lender has noted a change in the due date. The due date for these expenses can affect the amount of your monthly deposit.If your insurance premiums have increased, you should contact your insurance company and find out why – especially if you haven't had any claims. You may want to switch to a different insurance company to save money.
If your property taxes have increased, you should contact your local taxing authority and make sure the assessment is accurate and they have correctly valued your property.

, If there is not enough money in your escrow account to pay your taxes and insurance premiums, you typically have the option either of paying a larger escrow payment each month or making a lump-sum deposit to cover the shortage.Your escrow payments also may go up to account for increases in property tax or premium rates. So even if you make a deposit to cover the shortage in full, you still may be responsible for a higher escrow payment each month to account for those changes.

Have a good credit history
Be a US citizen or legal resident
Be able to legally incur loan obligations
Have no history of causing the FSA a loss due to a loan
Have no delinquencies on federal debts
Be the owner/operator of a farm;
, A direct operating loan is handed out if there is a specific item you want to purchase. If you're looking to buy something like livestock, farm equipment, fuel, and so on, your best option is to apply for a direct operating loan., A microloan is a smaller loan given out to independent farms. Farms of this type are usually just starting out and produce a niche service or specialty crop., If you've been in the farming business and are now looking to buy your own farm, direct farm ownership loans give money to help farmers obtain their own property. These can also be used to enlarge or add buildings to an existing farm or to adjust an existing farm's soil or water., If you're looking to grant the money from your loan to others, a guaranteed loan is your best route. This loan allows you to extend your funds to others who do not meet qualifications. Money given from this loan is meant to be used to finance or expand an existing farm.For example, if you want your child to eventually take over your farm, you can get a guaranteed loan if they don't qualify for a loan. Your child will be able to use the funds from the loan to expand and manage your farm.

, There are some specialty loans for specific groups. If you fit into a targeted group, try applying for one of these loans.If you're a young farmer participating in things like 4-H and need to fund your education, you can apply for a Youth Loan.
Women and minority farmers can apply for Women and Minority Farmers and Ranchers Loans.
If you've been in business for less than 10 years, look into Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Loans.
If you're Native American, ask about Native American Tribal Loans.

, Floods, droughts, and other natural disasters can greatly set back a farm's finances. If your farm has been harmed by a disaster, you can apply for an emergency loan for help., Applying for loans requires an extensive amount of paperwork. To start, fill out a form requesting a loan. This will specify the type of farm you're operating, the type of loan you're applying for, how you plan to use the loan, and other basic information.Any forms you need for the process can be downloaded on the FSA website or picked up at a local FSA or USDA office.

, When you're applying for a loan, the FSA will want to know a great deal about your financial history to ensure you're responsible with money. If you've been keeping quality records on your farm, you can find this information where you keep important documents. Provide the following documents with your application:Three years of financial history
Three years of production history
A list of any other creditors

, The FSA will want to make sure you're a trained, professional farmer. Present them with any training certifications, college transcripts, or other documents proving you received professional training to become a farmer.For example, if you have an associate's degree in a field related to agriculture, this would be something to include.

, Online or at an FSA or USDA office, you should find a form authorizing employers, financial institutions, and other entities to release sensitive information regarding your financial and employment history. The FSA will want to review this information to make sure you're a safe investment. Sign and date the form and provide any other information requested to authorize the release of this information., A business plan overviews the goals of your farm, as well as your general operating practices. Unless you have extensive experience in business, or work with someone who does, it's highly recommended you seek assistance to draft your business plan.Small Business Counselors is a non-profit organization. Volunteers have experience managing and running a business and can help you write a business plan.
The USDA has various subgroups, such as the Extension Risk Management Education Program, that may be able to help you with your business plan.
If you have a friend or family member who runs a business, ask if they'll assist you with your plan.

, You can look up local centers online. Once you've found a center near you, gather your paperwork and submit it there. Make sure you've signed and dated in all the necessary places and have all the information you need to apply.Some loans may allow you to submit materials online, which is often easier. Check the FSA website to see if materials for your loan can be submitted online.

, Usually, someone will contact you about scheduling a meeting with an FSA representative to discuss your request.You will have an opportunity to address any questions or concerns the FSA has regarding your loan to help them process the application.

It's a good idea to briefly review your plans for the loan before the meeting.
Not every loan requires a meeting with an FSA representative. This is more likely to occur when you're applying for a direct loan.

, While times will vary, you will usually hear back on your loan within 60 days of submitting your application. During that time, the FSA will reach out to you if they're having any problems. For example, if documents are missing, an FSA representative may contact you to request these papers., If your loan is approved, you will have to meet with an FSA representative to sign the paperwork. Review the paperwork carefully so you understand the terms of your loan and then sign in the required places.It's a good idea to take the paperwork home for a night to review it. This ensures you completely understand the terms of the loan.
If you're not used to reading legal documents, have a lawyer or accountant go over the information with you.

, If your loan is rejected, you can ask to meet with an FSA representative to go over the reasons why and ask for an appeal. A mediator may be present at the meeting to help the conversation run smoothly. You can also submit an appeal request to the National Appeals Division found within the USDA.You can find information on the precise means to request an appeal via the USDA website.

, If you don't receive a loan, review the reasons why. There are many reasons your loan may have been denied. Work on improving your odds for a loan and then reapply in the future.Review the documents you submitted. Was your business plan as detailed as necessary? Did you provide all the requested financial information? A lack of detail can often cause a loan to be rejected.
Next time, think about enlisting help from business professionals to make sure your application is as thorough as possible before applying for a loan.

It will then return the title to you. This process should be spelled out in your loan agreement. Look over this document to understand exactly what you need to do in order to restore full title to your vehicle.


Lenders typically charge a monthly fee that can be quite high, which you will have to pay in addition to the original amount borrowed.There will also be an associated APR with the loan, which represents the amount of interest you would have to pay over the course of a year. The lender must present you with the terms of the loan in writing before you sign it.When you are applying for a car title loan, federal law requires the lender to tell you both the APR (not just the monthly rate) and the total cost of the loan in dollars.Your APR will be based on the amount borrowed, the monthly interest rate, the fees you must pay, and the duration of the loan.;
, When you sign a loan agreement with a title loan company, you are basically saying that the loan company can take your car if you do not pay back the amount borrowed under the terms of the agreement.Therefore, before you can regain the vehicle title you surrendered when you received the loan, you must pay off the loan in full, including the original loan amount, monthly interest, and any additional fees.


Try to pay off this amount as soon as possible to avoid further fees or charges.
If you are having trouble coming up with the money, and you really need your vehicle, try borrowing from a source that charges less interest/fees than what the title loan company is charging you.

, Most title loan companies will supply documentation that confirms the loan is settled in full, complete with details regarding the payoff date, history of payments remitted, and other relevant data. Keep this document in a safe place in case there are any problems with restoring your vehicle's title.

, After you have paid off the loan in full, the loan company will sign your vehicle's title to signify the release of its lien on the vehicle and mail you the vehicle title you surrendered at the time you executed the loan. Depending on your jurisdiction, the loan company may have to return this title in a specified amount of time.


For example, in Texas, a title loan company must return the title to you and clear its lien on your vehicle's title within 10 business days of receiving payment in full., Generally, you will be working with your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (""DMV"") to clear the lien on your vehicle's title. While the process varies by state, generally you will have to complete a form to restore title and mail that form, along with your vehicle's title, to the DMV along with a processing fee. The DMV will then remove the lien from the title and issue you a new title, restored fully in your name.


For example, in California, you must submit your title within 30 days of receiving it from the title loan company, pay a transfer fee of $15, and then the DMV will issue you a new title identifying you as the sole owner of the vehicle.In Texas, you must visit your local county's tax office, pay a title fee of between $28–$33, and then submit your vehicle's title, proof of release of lien, and a completed title application to restore your vehicle's title., Many agencies will provide verification that the paperwork from the title loan company has been received and is in process, and can give you an estimated amount of time for processing. This will help you get some idea of when to expect your restored title.


You can use this chart to find the contact information for the DMV for your state., Once you receive your restored title, go over it to make sure the information is accurate and complete. If there are any errors or omissions, contact the issuing agency immediately and arrange to have the information updated. This will help prevent any possible difficulties with the title in the future, such as when securing tags, paying taxes on the vehicle, or selling the automobile to a new owner.

, Car title loans can be problematic for the borrower for a variety of reasons, most notably the high interest rates and fees associated with this type of loan which could lead to an inability to pay while interest continues to compound on the original amount you borrowed. Ultimately, this can lead to you losing your vehicle, which can impair your ability to carry out daily tasks or attend work. Before you consider obtaining a car title loan, consider other methods of borrowing money:Getting a loan from a bank or credit union.
Getting a paycheck cash advance from your employer.
Borrowing money from family, friends, or your church.
Getting a cash advance on your credit card.
If your need for money arises from obligations to other creditors, try contacting them and discussing repayment plans or other ways to satisfy or reduce your debt.

, If you are able to identify other methods of borrowing the money you need, it is best to compare them before selecting one. Take note of the following information and use it to decide which terms are most favorable to you:The APR.
Any additional fees involved.
The time by which you must repay the amount borrowed.
The consequences involved if you are unable to repay the loan.

, After you have considered your options, choose the one that makes the most financial sense. Your option should have comparatively low interest rates, a reasonable repayment window, and should provide you with sensible options should you encounter difficulties with repayment. Above all else, you should remember to only borrow what you believe you can pay back in the time provided.The last thing you want is to enter a vicious cycle of borrowing money, incurring high fees, and then having to borrow more money to pay off the initial loan.

, The basic idea of this type of loan is that you—in return for an agreed-upon amount of money, usually a relatively small amount—give a lender the title to your vehicle.You must generally own the vehicle outright.You also are generally required to pay a borrowing fee in addition to repaying the loan itself. This amount is usually due within a short time, usually around 30 days from the date you take the loan.In the case that you are unable to pay off the loan in the designated timeframe, the lender will take possession of your vehicle using the title you surrendered at the time of the loan.
A 2013 study found that the average consumer takes out a car loan for about $950, renews the loan eight times, and ends up paying about $2,100 in interest alone at a 300% annual percentage rate (""APR"")., Before you obtain a car title loan from a particular company, it is best to check if that company is properly registered with the state. While not all states require such registration and state law differs with regards to the regulation of title-loan companies, you should at least check to see if the loan company has complied with any required official process before you take out a loan.


For example, in California, all title-loan companies must be registered with the California Department of Business Oversight.You can search online to see if the company is registered using the database provided.While this is not a guarantee that the loan company is reputable, it is far better than obtaining a loan from an unregistered company.

, The first step in obtaining a car title loan is to go to a lender that deals in this type of loan transaction and present the lender with the information the lender will use to process your loan. This information includes:A completed loan application.
Your car itself.
Your car's title.
A form of photo identification.
Proof of insurance.
Some lenders also ask for an extra set of car keys (used to take your vehicle if you default on the loan) or require you to enroll in some type of roadside-assistance plan.

, The second step in obtaining a car loan is to review the terms of the loan itself. Read through the entire document, paying special attention to any monthly fees, the APR, the total amount of the loan, and the date by which you must repay the loan.

, After a borrower has reviewed and agreed to the terms of a car title loan, the lender provides the borrower with a cash advance and the borrower gives the lender the certificate of title for his or her vehicle.The lender will then place a lien on your car's title.Generally, you will still be able to use your car during the duration of the loan.You will not have full legal title to it, however, because you have surrendered the title to the loan company as a form of collateral.

, If you can't pay back the original amount borrowed plus any applicable fees by the date these amounts are due (again, usually within 30 days), there are several things that can happen:The lender might allow you to ""roll over"" your loan, giving you an extension of time in which to pay off your outstanding balance. You will, however, likely be charged an additional monthly fee for doing so that can be quite high.If you roll over your loan repayment multiple times, you may end up paying more in fees than the amount you originally borrowed.If you cannot pay off the balance despite one or more roll overs or extensions, the lender will eventually stop offering these extensions, declare your loan to be in default, and then take your car using the title you provided at the time you signed the loan agreement.You will lose possession of your vehicle.
Some states require title loan companies that repossess and sell your car to pay you the difference between the sale price and the amount of your loan.Some states do not.

A well-qualified lawyer will be able to talk you through the benefits and drawbacks of signing a subordination agreement, as well as the steps for executing the agreement. Start by asking friends and family for lawyer recommendations. Most lawyers make a living off referrals and it can be a great way to find a great lawyer.


If you cannot find a quality recommendation, contact your state bar's lawyer referral service. After answering a few general questions about your legal issue, you will be put in contact with various qualified lawyers in your area.;
, As soon as you hire a lawyer, talk to them about what you want to accomplish. Mention that you think using a subordination agreement would be a great option. Subordination agreements are binding contracts that rank the debts of specific creditors. This ranking becomes incredibly important during bankruptcy proceeding because debts with a higher rank get paid off first.Under the Bankruptcy Code, a subordination agreement is fully enforceable so long as it is unambiguous and properly executed.However, because you will be (or are) in an automatic stay, the court may interpret the execution of a subordination agreement as a violation of that stay. Make sure your lawyer feels confident in the agreement's enforceability before you draft and execute it.

, If you and your lawyer feel confident that a subordination agreement will be enforceable, you and other creditors must discuss how you want the agreement set up. Most creditors will want their claims to have the highest priority possible. This will allow their claims to be paid out first by the debtor. Therefore, you will need to find a valid reason to request that your claim jump other claims that are currently ahead of you. Common reasons for subordinating a claim include the refinancing of a loan and creditor wrongdoing.


When a creditor offers a loan on property that has already had one or more loans associated with it, the newest creditor will often require (as a prerequisite to making the loan) the more senior creditors to subordinate their claims. This helps the newest creditor feel at ease about making the loan, because they know if something happens their money will be paid back first. The most common example of this is with mortgages.Sometimes a creditor acts improperly by breaching a fiduciary duty or by doing something that causes damage to you and other creditors. In this circumstance, the creditor that has harmed you might be subject to equitable subordination, which will leave the priority of claims up to the judge.As a way of remedying the improper act, you might ask the judge in a bankruptcy case if you can work with all the creditors to come up with a claim priority on your own.

, If you and other creditors can agree on the terms of a subordination agreement, you (and your lawyer) should offer to draft it. Being able to draft an agreement gives you the power to ensure it is created up to your standards. When you or your lawyer begin drafting, start with the following information:A title (e.g., ""Subordination Agreement"")
The date of execution (e.g., ""This Agreement made as of September 10, 2016)
A description of the parties (e.g., ""Donald Gene, an individual residing at and Alyce Ann, an individual residing at "")

, Every contract has to have some exchange of consideration (i.e., something of some value). In a subordination agreement entered into at this stage of bankruptcy proceedings, the consideration you offer will usually be the withholding of filing a motion for equitable subordination. The consideration the other creditor will offer is the subordination of their claim to yours. This exchange should be summarized near the beginning of the agreement.


For example, your summary could read: ""In consideration of Donald Gene not filing a motion for equitable subordination, Alyce Ann agrees to subordinate her claim in the manner agreed to below""., The first substantive paragraph of your subordination agreement needs to lay out exactly what interests are being subordinated and what interests are gaining priority. The security interests need to be defined with enough detail so a court can identify what you are talking about.


For example, do not say, ""Junior creditor subordinates the mortgage."" A court will not be able to identify what mortgage you are talking about, or how it will be subordinated.
Instead, consider saying something like: ""Junior creditor hereby subordinates any and all security interests of the Junior Creditor in any of the Debtor's personal property and assets (the specific assets at question are outlined in Exhibit A), in favor of such loan and any other indebtedness, present or future, of Debtor to Senior Creditor."", Your next provision should clearly state how the subordination will work and how the new junior creditor will be paid. In most cases, you (as the new senior creditor) will require that your interest be paid off entirely before the junior creditor can get paid at all. In other circumstances, you may allow the new junior creditor to collect a certain dollar amount as consideration for entering into the agreement.


For example, one option might be to draft your provision as follows: ""It is agreed that until Senior Creditor has been paid in full by Debtor, no payments, in cash or other property, shall be made by Debtor or received by Junior Creditor.""
Another option may be the following: ""It is agreed that until Senior Creditor has been paid in full by Debtor, no payments, in cash or other property, shall be made by Debtor or received by Junior Creditor, except Senior Creditor hereby consents to payment by Debtor to Junior Creditor in the amount of $50,000 immediately prior to Debtor paying Senior Creditor in full."", The last substantive provision needs to ensure the junior creditor will not implement any enforcement actions to try and collect their debt before you. This usually means the junior creditor will need to agree not to ask the debtor for payment, enforce any right they have to collect the money, or join any legal action to ask for the money.


For example, this provision might read as follows: ""The Junior Creditor will not (i) make any demand for payment of or take any action to accelerate any Junior Indebtedness, (ii) seek to collect payment of, or enforce any right or remedies against the Borrower related to or supporting any of the Junior Indebtedness, (iii) commence or join with any other creditor in commending any action against the Borrower arising from or relating to the Junior Indebtedness."", Boilerplate language is a term used to describe language in a contract that does not touch on the substance of your contract, but instead touches on the enforceability and administration of the contract as a whole. This language is incredibly important to have in cases where your contract is challenged in court. This language will tell the court how the contract should be interpreted, what laws should apply, and how a dispute should be resolved. Examples of common boilerplate provisions include:Indemnity
Validity
Amendments
Waiver of notices
Governing law

, At the end of your agreement, make sure there is room for every party to sign. At the top of your signature page, write the following: ""In witness whereof, the parties hereto have each duly executed and delivered this subordination agreement as of the date first written above."", Pass the original copy of the agreement around and get it signed by every party. Once every party has signed the agreement, it will have been executed and it will be enforceable.

Order credit reports from each of the three major credit bureaus where creditors examine your score: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. You can find these credit bureaus on the Internet, and order your credit reports either by phone or through their websites.You can also order all three for free through annualcreditreport.com.
Credit scores are based on a variety of factors such as record of pill paying, total indebtedness, and credit requested.Scores range from 500 being the worst credit to 850 being the best. Anything before 600 can put you at risk for needing a guarantor.;
, Once you’ve obtained your credit reports, examine them and determine if there are any issues or misinformation on them. You need to clear up any problems before getting a loan.You can deal with issues on your credit report by:


Paying off collections and judgments.
Disputing any inaccuracies that may negatively affect your credit score, because these may hinder your chances of getting a loan. You can dispute inaccuracies through each of the credit bureau websites.
Ensuring that there is no credit fraud or identity theft that could hurt your chances of receiving financing., If your credit isn't good but you have other assets (such as property, physical equipment, or stocks), you should be able to get a secured loan. By offering up your assets as collateral, the lender can be confident he will get his money back, even if you default on the loan.An unsecured loan requires you to have excellent credit or a steady, high income, as there is no guarantee (or ""security"") that he will get his money back if you default.An unsecured loan has higher interest rates and is more difficult to obtain, as it is a riskier loan., In order to get a loan, you must be able to prove that you can make regular and timely loan payments as well as that the loan amount you are requesting meets debt to income ratio requirements. This can help you figure out how much financing a lender may be willing to grant you as well as if you may need a guarantor to sign for the amount you’d requested.Loan repayment schedules are based on factors such as income, interest rates, and the repayment schedule.You must provide information on any income you earn and prove that it has been stable for an extended period of time.Examples of monthly income include employment wages, social security, pension payments, alimony or child support payments, and rental income.The loan approval process involves qualifying the amount of the loan you are requesting. This helps the lender ensure your ability to make monthly loan payments that fits into a prescribed debt to income ratio.For example, a creditor may require that your total monthly debt obligation, including your loan payment, must not exceed 36 percent of your total monthly income. Debt to income guidelines vary per lender and loan type, so a good rule of thumb is to make sure your total debt to income ratio is 30 percent or less before you try to get a loan.Take into account other collateral you could provide, such as a savings account, stock, physical equipment, or other assets.

, Keeping your debt in check can help you more readily qualify for financing without a cosigner. Simple measures can help you effectively manage your debt and avoid uncomfortable situations with lending.You can manage your debt by:


Keeping balances on credit accounts as low as possible.
Paying off debt instead of switching it between several accounts.
Keeping unused credit cards open.
Only opening accounts for credit and financing that you truly need., Besides having a good credit score and proof that you can repay a loan, you can provide lenders with other compensating factors to tip the loan approval process in your favor. This may also help you get the loan without a guarantor. Compensating factors are strengths on a loan application and can include:A down payment of 10% or more of the total purchase price (on secured loans).
Successful demonstration of the ability to pay expenses equal to or greater than the proposed monthly payment.
Demonstrated ability to accumulate savings and use credit wisely.
Documentation of compensation or income not included in effective income. This includes public benefits.
Proof that the loan only requires a minimal increase in monthly expenses.
Proof of substantial cash reserves or non-taxable income.Potential for increased earnings, which is indicated by training or education in the borrower’s profession.The asset purchased with the loan may affect income positively, increasing your earnings.
You may have the option of accepting a high interest rate as compensation for weaknesses in your loan application. For example, those who purchase cars from buy-here pay-here lots often have poor credit, no guarantor and high debt to income ratios; however, they are able to get site-financed auto loans by accepting high interest rates.Note that lender keeps the title and repossess collateral when necessary.

, Companies offer many different types of services depending on the needs of their clients. Search for lenders that can best serve you and your needs, which may help ensure that you do not need a guarantor and get the best rates and loan conditions possible.


Set up an appointment with local banks and credit unions and ask about their loan programs and qualification guidelines. In some cases, working with local businesses can work to your benefit because they are able to work directly with you.

, Having multiple accounts at one organization can help you to get the best loan conditions possible and may negate the necessity for a guarantor.


Search online for services that allow you to obtain feedback pertaining to the types of loan programs for which you may be able to get approval without committing yourself to any contracts.

, It’s absolutely vital to be as open as possible with your potential lender. Explaining your situation openly and honestly may help you get a loan without a guarantor if the company is willing to work with you.Some lenders are willing to bolster bad credit with alternative credit scores such as utility bills.Knowing falsifying information or documents can result in prosecution.

, One of the many factors that potential lenders assess is your ability to pay. By paying other bills, such as utility or car payments, on time, you can demonstrate your ability and willingness to pay for your loan without a co-signer.Receive electronic reminders for bill statements.Set up automatic payments to come from your bank or other accounts every month.If you miss a payment or are unable to pay, contact your lender immediately to set up a payment schedule that will get and keep you current.Know that paying off a delinquent loan won’t remove it from your credit report., Lender will examine at how close you are to maximum credit limits when assessing your credit score. Keep your credit limits well below their maximum to help you qualify for optimal lending conditions.Avoid maxing out credit cards or accounts.Pay off credit card balances each month for the best scores. Revolving balances between credit cards can harm your credit score.Most experts recommend keeping your used credit at no more than 30% of your total limit., Avoid the temptation to apply for frequent credit. Only request funds that you need and that you can reasonably pay, which may also help you apply for other loans in the future.Lenders will examine your credit activity, including new applications, as a way to assess your need for more credit.Applying for a lot of credit over a short period of time can make it seem that your economic circumstances have undergone negative changes, scaring off potential lenders., An individual’s credit score is based on the experiences of lenders with the person over time. The longer period of time that you can establish good credit practices, including timely repayment, the more likely a lender is to assess you as a good credit risk. In turn, this can help ensure that you won’t need a guarantor or be subject to high interest rates.Part of establishing your long-term credit is regular review of your credit reports from the three primary agencies.

, Just as knowing how to build or re-establish credit is important to getting a loan approval, so it recognizing factors that can harm it. This may help minimize the necessity for getting a co-signer.The following factors can harm your credit score:


Unpaid medical bills and parking tickets.
Heavy use of credit, even if you quickly pay it off in full.
Signing up for and using store credit for initial discounts.Charging off accounts.
Defaulting on a loan.
Filing for bankruptcy.
High or maxed out credit card balances."

Receive a ruling.",How to Subordinate Claims During Automatic Stay As a Creditor2," If a senior creditor has committed some inequitable act that injures you and your claim, you may be able to file a motion and ask the court for the remedy of equitable subordination.Equitable subordination allows the court to reprioritize claims when it determines that one creditor is guilty of misconduct that has harmed other creditors and that gives an unfair advantage to that creditor acting improperly. While a court can reorder priorities, they cannot completely disallow a creditor to collect at all.Talk with your lawyer to determine if this type of action might be right for you. Your lawyer will have to look at whether another creditor has committed some wrongdoing and whether you were harmed.

, Different courts have ruled differently on the question of whether an equitable subordination claim violates an automatic stay. During an automatic stay, creditors are not allowed to initiate litigation or adversarial proceedings against the debtor. Some courts see the filing of a motion for equitable subordination as an offensive tactic meant to gain an advantage over the debtor and other creditors, which means they do not allow it. However, other courts have allowed it.Ask your lawyer about your court's likelihood of accepting your motion. Your lawyer will be able to do some research and should be able to give you a pretty definitive answer quickly.

, In order to be successful in a claim for equitable subordination, you will have to meet the test that has been laid out by the courts. Specifically, you will have to be able to show that a creditor engaged in some inequitable conduct, that the misconduct harmed you or caused the creditor to receive an unfair advantage, and that equitable subordination is not inconsistent with other provisions of the law.To meet this three-part test, you will have to show, in your motion and attachments, enough evidence to convince the judge that misconduct has taken place and that you have been harmed.
Examples of creditor misconduct include the breach of a fiduciary duty or egregious conduct that causes damage.
To show harm, you will have to prove that the creditor's misconduct in some way made it more difficult to collect the money owed to you by the debtor. For example, maybe a creditor's action caused money to leave the bankruptcy estate, which means it cannot be reached by the bankruptcy court and cannot be paid out to creditors like you.

, Most motions for equitable subordination are filed by the debtor or their trustee. However, in some circumstances, the court will allow another party to file a motion for equitable subordination. To get permission from the court, your lawyer will need to file a request with the judge or ask the judge during a hearing. Your lawyer should be prepared to explain why you should be allowed to file the motion, and why the debtor would not be the proper party to file instead.

, If you are allowed to file a motion for equitable subordination, you and your lawyer will have to draft that motion. A motion is simply a legal document that asks the court to do something. In this case, you will be asking the court to reorder the priorities of specific creditor claims. Your motion will start with a caption, which identifies the court you are in, the parties to the case, and the case number. Your motion should also have a title, which in this case might be, ""Notice of Motion and Motion for Equitable Subordination"".


The first part of your motion will provide notice to other creditors and to the debtor that you plan on filing this motion. This section might read: ""Please take notice that on July 17, 2016, I will move this court to equitably subordinate the claims detailed below.""The body of your motion will explain to the court what you are asking it to do and why you have the legal authority to ask for it. In the case of equitable subordination, your motion might be as simple as stating: ""I, Creditor Number Five in the bankruptcy proceedings described below, respectfully request that this court grant a motion for equitable subordination in accordance with 11 U.S.C. Section 510(c)."", In addition to your notice and motion, you will have to provide other documents that will help persuade the court to rule in your favor. These documents will be attached to your motion and will be filed along with it. In general, you will need to draft the following attachments:Memorandum of points and authorities in support of motion. This document provides the court with any legal authorities and arguments you may have that support your motion. This is where your lawyer will lay out the test for equitable subordination and explain why you meet it.
Declaration in support of motion. This document will lay out all of the important facts that led you to file the motion. The declaration will be filled out by your lawyer but you will have to sign it because you are the one personally aware of the facts of the case.
Proposed order, which the judge will sign if they choose to grant your motion.

, Once all of your documents have been drafted, make enough copies to give to every interested creditor as well as the debtor. Send one copy to each interested party through the mail. Once you have done this, you need to sign, or have someone else sign, a proof of service form for each person you served. This form swears to the court that you have properly served everyone. These proof of service forms will be filed along with your original motion., Take your completed motion and attached documents to the bankruptcy court where the underlying bankruptcy case is being heard. Hand your paperwork to the clerk of courts and tell them it needs to be filed. The clerk will take your papers and file them according to the case number on the front of your motion., At the same time you file your motion, ask the clerk to set a hearing date. The clerk will look at what dates the court has available and assign a time to you. Make sure your hearing date is far enough in the future so that other creditors and debtors have an opportunity to file responsive motions if they want. Each court might have different rules about how much time you need to provide., On the day of your hearing, arrive at the courthouse early so you can park, get through security, and find your courtroom. Once in the courtroom, sit quietly until your case is called. At that time, move to the front of the courtroom with your lawyer. To start the hearing, the judge will announce what the hearing is about (i.e., hearing arguments for and against the motion for equitable subordination). Next, the judge will ask your lawyer questions to try and understand why you are asking for equitable subordination. The judge will have read your motion, so they will likely push your lawyer on certain issues to try and get a clearer picture.


The judge will also let any opposing parties speak if they are present. They will be able to make counterarguments to try and get your motion denied. Once the opposing parties have made their points, the judge will usually let your lawyer respond. Your lawyer should be prepared for this, as they will likely have read any opposing motions.

, Once the judge listens to arguments, they will make a decision. If your motion is granted, the judge will sign your proposed order and they will decide how to equitably subordinate the creditor that committed some wrongdoing. If your motion is denied, your claim will maintain the same priority it had before you filed the motion.

Switch to bi-weekly payments.,
Go for a shorter term mortgage.,
Agree to make one extra payment each year.",How to Pay Extra Toward the Principal of a Loan1," Talk to your lender about possibly switching to bi-weekly payments rather than making full payments every month. Bi-weekly payments take advantage of the fact there are 12 months in the year but 52 weeks. If you pay half the amount every two weeks, by the end of the year you'll have made 13 full payments rather than 12.Talk to your bank or lender about setting up a bi-weekly payment plan. Some companies are willing to set up a plan of this type for free while others might charge a fee.Sometimes, outside companies offer to set up bi-weekly payments for you. However, this is unnecessary. You should not have to pay additional fees for something you can do yourself.;
, If you have a mortgage payment, you can save money by shortening your mortgage. You can shorten a 20 year payment plan to a 15 year one. While payments will be higher, you can work with your lender to find manageable payments and interest rates. However, if you're worried about affordability you don't have to refinance your mortgage. You can find a refinance calculator online and see what your rates would be with a shorter term plan. Then, take initiative on your own to pay more each month. If you're unable to make the higher mortgage payment one month, you won't be in any trouble with the bank., You can also talk to your lender about making one extra payment each year. If you plan ahead around the month when the extra payment is due, this is manageable. In some loan agreements, you may get a bonus or a sizable tax refund for making an extra payment."

Learn the difference between a secured and an unsecured loan.,
Be wary of payday loans and cash advances.,
Expect a higher interest rate and fees.",How to Get a Loan Even With Bad Credit1," A secured loan is one that's backed up with collateral (a home, car or property, for example.) On the other hand, an unsecured loan does not have any collateral behind it, so they're riskier for lenders to make and therefore come with higher interest rates. Also known as personal loans, unsecured loans are primarily small amount loans used to cover home improvements, small purchases (computers, riding lawn mowers, security systems) or to cover unexpected expenses.Be clear on the terms. In some cases, a loan has a fixed interest rate and a specified payment term. In other cases, the loan may work like a revolving line of credit and come with a variable interest rate.
Calculate tax-time savings. You can deduct the interest on secured loans such as mortgages or student loans. The interest on an unsecured loan is not tax deductible.;
, Payday loans are short-term, small-amount loans that are meant to tide you over when you are low on cash. You write a check for the amount you borrow along with a fee for the loan and leave it with the lender, who will then cash the check when you have the funds to pay. If you don't pay on time, you can roll the loan over, but that means additional fees that can really add up.


Banks, chains and private storefront operations all offer payday loans that come with interest rates as high as 500% or more. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, the average interest charges for these loans are 225% to 300%.Think twice before borrowing on your credit card. Credit card cash advances are expensive—interest rates fall between 30% to 40% once you factor in fees.
Figure out what you can afford. Just because a lender will loan you money doesn’t mean that you can afford it. While banks take into consideration your ability to repay,secondary lenders who do high-risk loans don’t take this step.It is up to you to determine whether or not you can afford the loan.

, The price you pay for less-than-stellar credit comes in the form of higher closing costs, origination fees, and interest rates. A borrower with excellent credit may have closing costs that are .5% of the loan amount. A buyer with a low score may be charged between 1-4% of the loan amount simply because it's a riskier loan, and lenders do not make as much money on them.

Ask a direct relative to co-sign.The most traditional way to get a loan without having your own credit score is to piggyback on the good credit history of someone else.,
Get a personal loan from family or friends.",How to Get a Loan with No Credit1," A co-signer agrees to take responsibility for your loan debt if you should falter.


A direct relative, like a father, mother, brother, or sister, will usually be your best option. You could go to extended family or close friends if you have no other alternatives, but since these relationships are often not quite as strong as those made with direct relatives, they may take more of a beating if you encounter difficulties in repaying your loan.
Make sure that the co-signer understands the risk. Your loan will reflect on their credit report, so if things go bad, their credit score will take a dip. The co-signer is also responsible for your debt, so if you fail to pay, it falls to him or her to pay it off in your place.
Choosing a co-signer with a high credit score will improve your chances of securing a loan better than if you were to choose a co-signer with mediocre credit. A lender wants to make sure that the loan will be repaid. If your co-signer has a good credit history, that lender will feel more confident about whether or not its money will be returned.;
, If you have a relative or close friend who is financially capable, you might be able to get a direct personal loan from that person, especially if he or she has some idea of how responsible you can be with your money. Treat this personal loan as a serious business transaction to avoid straining the relationship later on.


Traditional advice suggests that you never borrow money from family or friends. This situation could quickly get ugly, especially if the exchange of money is poorly documented, and one or both sides could end up feeling cheated. It should be used as a last resort and you must be extremely careful to avoid wrecking your relationship.
Create a written agreement defining the terms of the loan. Your document needs to include the interest rate, how much money is being borrowed, how much needs to be paid off monthly, when the loan needs to be paid off in full, any collateral you offer for the loan, and any consequences you will face if you fail to repay the money.

Determine whether the family member asking for money is responsible enough to return it.,
Make sure that you have the money to spare before lending money to family.,
Discuss your expectations regarding a family loan before coming to a final decision.,
Establish a payment plan that meets the budget of both you and your family member.,
Write up a family loan contract with all the details of the loan and make it official by having you both sign it.",How to Lend Money to Family," Only you can decide if a loan will be paid back. Obviously, a family member who is habitually overspending and is currently in debt would not be a good person to lend money to.;
, Do not get yourself in a financial hardship just so you can bail out a family member. The only time you should ever lend money to family is when you can spare the amount. For this reason, the money should never come out of your current budget, your hardship savings, or any retirement funds. The truth is you still have to be prepared that the family member will not pay back the loan.

, Remind the person that this is a loan; that you do expect to receive interest, assuming you do, and that you expect the money to be returned by a certain period.

, Be realistic about how much can be paid during what period of time. Don't set your family member up to fail. Smaller payments are always easier to pay off than the whole amount, not just for the family member, but also for you. This way you can see your money being returned.

, If you prefer, call in a third party to witness the agreement and its specifications. By doing this, your family member will understand that you are serious about getting the funds back. There are many resources online that offer tools for establishing contracts.

Increase your monthly checks by one twelfth.,
Pay a bit more each month.,
Understand pros and cons of simply paying more.",How to Pay Extra Toward the Principal of a Loan2," If you're unsure you want to renegotiate the terms of your payment plan, you can simply work on increasing your monthly payments each month. Each month when you write your checks for the loan, increase the amount you're paying by one twelfth. While it might not seem like a lot, you are slowly chipping away at the principal of the loan., Many people are nervous about committing to a payment plan with strict, set amounts. One way simple way to pay extra towards the principal of a loan is to simply pay more each month when you can. If you have extra money one month, put it towards your loan. If you're low on funds the next month, just pay the regular amount., Some people enjoy the flexibility of simply paying more, but it comes with certain drawbacks. Understand the pros and cons when considering a flexible payment plan.


You have to take initiative on your own if you're simply paying more. When you agree to a new payment system, you're essentially to pay more. However, going at it alone means you have to take personal responsibility. If you're not great at financing and budgeting on your own, you might want to reconsider simply paying more.
The main plus side on a flexible payment plan is that you're under no obligation to make higher payments if you can't afford to do so. If you're financial situation is somewhat unstable, this might be a good idea.
Keep in mind that, for most payment plans, paying extra one month does not mean you will not owe your regular payment the next month."

Make sure to communicate with the lender.,
Keep track of when payments are due.,
Budget for extra payments.",How to Pay Extra Toward the Principal of a Loan3," If you want to send extra money to a lender, it's not necessary to let the lender know ahead of time. However, communication is important to any smooth borrower/lender relationship. You want to assure extra funds are applied to the principal of your loan. Your borrower may assume the extra money is for your next payment. It's not a bad idea to let a lender know ahead of time if you're planning on putting extra money in one month to go towards the principal of a loan., Paying extra never means you don't owe your regular monthly payments. Keep a calendar to track when payments are due. Make sure you don't miss any payments, as this can affect your interest rates and credit.

, If you've switched your payment plan, you'll need to form a whole new budget. Many borrowers get overzealous and sign up for a payment plan they cannot keep manage. If you've switched to bi-weekly payments or another payment plan to requires extra money, spend some time budgeting for the extra money. Write down your income and how much you need to put towards the loan each month. Calculate other necessary expenses, like rent and bills. From there, figure out how much money you can reasonably spend on things like food, entertainment, and so on while paying off your loan.

Learn how your FICO credit score is calculated.,
Know how your credit score can impact loans.,
Order your credit report and check for errors.,
Dispute any errors on your credit report.",How to Get a Loan Even With Bad Credit2," There are five areas FICO considers when calculating your credit score, and each is weighted differently. The importance of each areas is approximately:Payment History — 35%. The most important factor in your credit score is whether or not you have a good track record of paying your debts on time.
Amounts Owed — 30%. This examines how much you currently owe. Owing money isn't automatically a bad thing; FICO will examine how much credit you have available and how much of it you are currently using.
Length of Credit History — 15%. A young person with no credit will likely have a low score here, but this can be balanced out by having high scores in other areas. Generally, a longer credit history will give you a higher score in this area.
New Credit — 10%. If you have opened several new accounts over a short period of time, especially if you have a short credit history, this can lower your score.
Type of Credit Used — 10%. This area examines your retail, installment loans (such as auto payments), mortgages, and credit cards. Your score will be higher if you show you have a good, balanced mix of credit.

, Your credit has a direct impact on whether or not you are eligible for a loan, as well the amount of interest charged on the loan. Lenders will examine your credit score to determine if you are a good risk and likely to actually repay the loan.To get a loan and good terms, you'll want a good credit score. If you have a bad credit score, see what you can do to improve your credit before taking out a loan.

, There are three credit bureaus lenders may use to check your credit score — TransUnion, Equifax and Experian — and they will provide you with a free copy of your credit report once a year. Your credit report is used to calculate your credit score, so it is essential that you check your report for any errors. Note that credit bureaus may use different versions of the FICO score, so you should check all three reports yearly.


Order your credit report from annualcreditreport.com. Keep in mind you will be provided with a free copy of your credit reports, not credit scores. You will almost always have to pay a small fee to find out your actual score.

, If you do find a mistake on your credit report — perhaps you paid off a loan but it is showing up on your report as unpaid — you will need to make sure these errors are corrected. Start by reaching out to the vendor who reported the incorrect information and ask them to correct the error. Contact the credit bureau as well, providing copies of any evidence proving they have incorrect information. The bureaus are required to investigate your claim within 30 days.If possible, communicate with everyone via mail, keeping copies of any correspondence as proof.

Get a secured credit card.,
Make payments on time.,
See a credit counselor.",How to Get a Loan Even With Bad Credit3," Secured credit cards help you rebuild your credit by allowing you to establish a consistent repayment history. They work like this: You load a certain amount of money onto the card (a security deposit) and that represents your spending limit. As you repay the amount you ""charge"" to the card, it becomes available for you again.


Shop around for the lowest fees and rates. There are two expenses associated with secured credit cards: an annual fee and an interest rate. Do your research to find the card that's most affordable for you.
Explore ""hybrid"" cards. Some cards are hybrids of a secured card and a regular credit card. They allow the borrower a credit limit that's higher than their security deposit. These cards typically come with high interest rates.

, Your payment history makes up 35% of your credit score, so on-time payments will help you build higher credit.Once you've established a positive credit history and improved your credit score, you're able to qualify and apply for one of the issuer's many unsecured cards., It can be very helpful for you both financially and emotionally to have someone on your side as you try to rebuild your credit. That's what credit counselors do. They offer services that include helping you to create a budget, negotiating with your creditors, creating a repayment plan, setting up a savings strategy to name a few; it all depends on your needs. Their goal is to help you eliminate debt and be financially secure.


Choose a reputable counselor. A professional credit counselor will be experienced and licensed in finance or a related field. Make sure they are part of a non-profit agency.
Investigate debt consolidation services thoroughly. While seeking a debt consolidating loan may be a good strategy for you, approach this option with caution. If an agency asks for an up-front fee to help you with this process or suggests you stop paying your loans and pay them instead to handle the consolidation, this should raise a red flag for you."

Know the terms.,
Check your credit score.,
Know the disqualifiers.,
Make adjustments.",How to Get a Loan Even With Bad Credit4," FHA loans are available to some first time home buyers who are purchasing single family homes or homes in small multifamily units. A buyer with a credit score above 580 will typically be eligible for a loan with only 3.5% of the purchase price as a down payment on the mortgage. Borrowers with scores between 579-500 are eligible for 90% financing (or a 10% down payment), and borrowers with credit scores below 500 are ineligible., Just as you would if you were buying a car, you should start by checking your credit. That way, you maximize your information and minimize the surprises. Therefore, check your credit score and get a copy of your credit report before you even start to visit with lenders. You can get a copy of your credit report at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action. You can get your credit score directly from the credit bureaus, or from sites like creditkarma.com or credit.com.


As with applying for any loan, the more you can tweak your credit score to adjust it higher, the better. Try and establish a year's worth of on-time payments, reducing your credit utilization to 30% or less than your credit limit, and minimizing your applications for large lines of credit, like car loans.

, Now that you have your credit report, check the items in your credit report against the standard disqualifiers. The standard disqualifiers are: bankruptcy within 2 years, a mortgage foreclosure within 3 years, late mortgage payments or a credit to debt ratio that is too high.While FHA lenders will review any of these items for extenuating circumstances, these usually disqualify a buyer from loan eligibility. If you have any of these items on your credit report, you should consider postponing your application for an FHA loan, If you are turned down for an FHA loan, then you can make adjustments to your financial situation that will increase your chances of approval down the road. For instance, if you have cash reserves equal to at least three months of mortgage payments, a reduced debt-to-credit utilization ratio, or apply for a loan for a home that has a payment that is no more than $100 greater than your current payment, the lender may approve you for the loan where you were denied before.As always, lenders look more favorably upon borrowers who have larger down payments than borrowers with small down payments, as it is indicative of financial stability.

Check your credit.,
Plan in advance.,
Shop around.,
Read the fine print.,
Look at conventional lenders first.,
Focus on finding the lowest APR (annual percentage rate) over the shortest term.,
Watch out for non-essentials in your contract.",How to Get a Loan Even With Bad Credit5," You want to have as much information going into any transaction as you can. That way, you will be able to better evaluate any information that you counterpart in the transaction tells you. Therefore, check your credit score and get a copy of your credit report before you even start to visit with lenders. You can get a copy of your credit report at https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action. You can get your credit score directly from the credit bureaus, or from sites like creditkarma.com or credit.com.

, Try to make plans for your new car purchase several months in advance. That way, once you have read the information in your credit report and seen your credit score, you can take steps, such as making on-time payments and using less of your existing credit limits (try and keep it under 30%), to improve your credit score., If you're buying a car, your bad credit may not be a terrible hindrance to getting a good loan because the term of the loan is short and the car itself is essentially collateral (it can be repossessed if you fail to make payments). Therefore, it is imperative that you shop around. The average borrower with bad credit pays higher rates for an auto loan.If you’re paying much more than that, there’s an excellent chance that you can get a better deal elsewhere.

, Some dealers write up contingent or conditional contracts that allow them to increase the down payment or monthly payment of your loan. This type of term is extremely unfavorable to the borrower, and will almost certainly be used against a borrower as a pretext for repossessing the car. If a lender inserts this type of clause into the contract, run the other way., While a conventional lender, like a credit union or bank, might give a person with bad credit a higher interest rate than a person with good credit, they will often lend to borrowers with bad credit. Scrutinize dealers that cater to people with bad credit carefully. Those are often the lenders with the least favorable terms to the borrower., Extending the length of your loan may be tempting because it reduces the amount of your monthly payments, but you end up paying more in interest in the long run. This goes double if you are buying a used car. If the term of the loan is too long, you can end up making monthly payments on a car that long ago ceased to be drivable., Some lending contracts require the borrower to purchase extended warranties, aftermarket services and even insurance. If these have been added onto your contract, walk away.

"
Find out if your employer has a relationship with a financial institution.,
Try applying to a credit union.You may still need to prove some level of financial responsibility if you apply for a loan through a credit union, but in general, credit unions are more accepting than more formal lending institutions like banks.,
Get a peer to peer loan.",How to Get a Loan with No Credit2," Some companies establish business relationships with financial institutions.To go through one of these institutions, you will essentially need to put your salary on the line as collateral.


This is a more common practice among larger companies than small businesses, so keep that in mind if you work for a small company with limited resources.
The financial institution the company has a relationship with could be a bank or credit union, or an entirely different lending institution altogether.
These relationships will work one of two ways.

In the first, most common method, you will set up the terms of the loan with the financial institution and monthly payments will be deducted directly from your paycheck.
With the second method, you will set up the terms of the loan with the financial institution and make monthly payments as you would if you had secured the loan without going through your employer. If you fail to make your payments, however, your wages will be garnished and the money will be taken from them, plus additional interest.



,


Credit unions are owned, in essence, by their members. These members must have something in common, like an industry, religion, employer, or a geographic location. These institutions are nonprofit organizations, so the earnings are passed along to their members in some form (usually lower fees or improved services).
You can locate a credit union in your area by searching through your phone book or by doing an Internet search. There are even websites set up to help you with this search, including:

The National Credit Union Administration’s Credit Union Locator (http://www.ncua.gov/NCUAMapping/Pages/NCUAGOVMapping.aspx)
My Credit Union's Credit Union Locator (http://www.mycreditunion.gov/pages/mcu-map.aspx)
A Smarter Choice's Credit Union Locator (http://www.asmarterchoice.org/)


If possible, compare loans and terms of service from multiple credit unions to determine which has the lowest interest rates and best payment conditions.

, There are various programs in existence that allow you to obtain a personal loan directly from another individual instead of from an institution. You might find it difficult to secure a peer to peer loan if without first proving that you can be responsible with your money, though, so you should still be prepared to plead your case.


This is strictly done via an online platform. The process is streamlined, but you need to make sure that you go through a reliable peer to peer lending website or service to avoid getting cheated.
With most peer to peer services, borrowers sign up and post a loan listing. This listing describes the sort of loan they are looking for, including the reason for the loan and the amount of money needed.
From that point, investors can view the borrower's listing and determine whether or not it meets their criteria. The lenders can screen applicants and check your credit, and if you do not have credit, that information will be noted on your listing. This method allows you to explain more of your circumstances, though, and an individual investor may be more willing to take a chance on you than a large institution will.
A few noteworthy peer to peer lending websites include:

Prosper (http://www.prosper.com/)
Lending Club (https://www.lendingclub.com/)

Contact creditors from alternative credit tradelines.,
Have an impressive down payment.,
Gather documents that prove you have the means to make payments.,
Create your credit history now.",How to Get a Loan with No Credit3," If you have successfully managed to pay off leases and utilities for several months to a year, you have some record of financial responsibility, even though you do not have official credit or a credit score. If you can contact these creditors to ask for official verification of your financial record with them, you will be that much closer to proving your financial responsibility to a potential lender.


For major loans, like mortgage loans or car loans, try to make sure that you have at least one rent or lease payment to show.
As a general rule, try to have at least four alternative credit tradelines
Ask each creditor or institution for a letter on official letterhead indicating your name and account number. Ask them to state that your account has been ""paid as agreed for the last 12 months.""You can also provide copies of your latest utility bills to show that your accounts and responsibilities are currently paid in full.

, A hefty down payment improves your chances of securing a loan, with or without credit. If for no other reason, it means that the amount of money you need to be approved for is lower, thereby improving your chances that an institution will be willing to take a risk on you.


A good down payment will also suggest to potential lenders that you have the means to pay off a loan as well as the ability to save and put money toward a purchase.
You should try to have a full 20 percent down payment.

, Statements from your employer and bank statements can indicate to a potential lender that you have the financial means to make consistent payments and pay off your loan.


Provide copies of your financial documents, including documents that reflect your savings, income, and monthly debts. Most lenders will want to see that your monthly debts will not be any higher than 36 percent of your gross monthly income.
Ask your current employer for a letter on company letterhead stating your position, how long you have worked for the company, and your current salary. Lenders are more likely to be encouraged if you have worked at the same company for two years or longer since it indicates some sort of financial stability.

, As you go through the process of trying to secure a loan, you can start building a little credit history through official means. It may be deemed insufficient by some lenders, but if you can back up a baby credit history with other records proving your financial responsibility, it may carry more weight.


Establish a checking or savings account. Bank statements can be used to show lenders that you are responsible with your money and have not overdrawn your account.Apply for a credit card. Gas cards and department store cards are usually the easiest to get, followed by credit cards offered by a bank and connected to an account. You can also get a secured credit card, but you will need to make a deposit on the credit account to get one.

The card issuer must report to a credit bureau if you want to use the card to build a credit history.

Determine at what point you don't believe you will receive payment without asking.,
Inquire politely about the money.,

Be more forceful in your payment requests.,
Continue escalating the rigor of your collection activities.,
Hire a collection agency.,
Know what you cannot do.,
File a lawsuit in small claims court.,
File a lawsuit.,
File a Petition for Citation.,
Collect your money.,
Locate the debtor’s employer.,
Send interrogatories to the debtor’s employer.,
Ask for a garnishment order.",How to Collect Money From People Who Owe You," If your initial agreement didn't have a strict due date, then you will have to make that determination on your own. Decide how much you trust the person to pay without you directly asking.


Take the amount owed into consideration. A small debt may not be worth pursuing right away, while a larger debt might take some time to collect.
If you are owed money in the course of a business transaction, ask for it as soon as possible. Waiting on the debt will only make it harder to collect.;
, Once you have passed that date, make a request for the money. At this stage, all you want to do is make sure that the debtor is aware that their debt hasn’t been paid. Sometimes people just forget, and a friendly reminder is all they need. More formally, this is called an ""inquiry contact.""


Don't demand payment, instead offer a reminder (""Do you remember the money you owe me?"") that allows the debtor to save face.
Include all relevant information when asking about the debt. You should be prepared to provide the amount given, when you received the last payment, the amount owed, any payment arrangements you are willing to accept, contact information for you, and a clear due date.
If you are dealing with a company or client, it can be helpful to make this inquiry in the form of a letter. This gives you a paper trail if the situation escalates.
For a due date, 10 to 20 days from the date the debtor receives a letter can be a good timeframe. It is in the foreseeable future but not close enough that the debtor feels panicked.

, It may not be worth it to you to wait for the full amount. If the amount is small, or you do not believe the person will be able to pay, consider letting them provide something else in return. Providing a service or other favors will work if that arrangement is acceptable to you. If this is the case, be clear about the offer and collect as quickly as possible.


Don't be too quick to bargain, as this may send the message that the debt can be negotiated down, or that the debtor can take even more time., These are called ""demand contacts."" If the debtor does not respond to your request, you should be more direct. Make sure it is clear that you expect immediate payment or a definite commitment to payment, and provide clear instructions for making that payment.


Your language here should be more direct, and show some urgency. Phrases like ""You need to pay now,"" or ""We need to come to an arrangement now"" let the debtor know you are serious, and you are not willing to negotiate further.
Include clear consequences for not paying. Let the debtor know what you plan to do if you do not receive proper payment on time, and be prepared to follow through.

, If you don't receive any payment resulting from the demand contact, then chances are that the debtor either doesn’t have the money or just doesn't feel like paying. It’s your job to make them prioritize you through multiple contacts by phone, letter, e-mail, or in person, so that they decide to pay you before they pay someone else (or head for the hills).

, Hiring a third party to conduct your claim lets the debtor know you are serious, and can free you up from the hassle of contact and arranging payment. Collection agencies will charge as much as 50% of the payment for their services, so you need to decide if the partial payment is better than nothing.If the payment for a collection agency is too steep, you may consider skipping this step, and going to small claims court.

, If you are collecting your own debts, there are certain practices that may be illegal in your state. There is a federal law that may apply to you if you could be considered a debt collector under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. In all likelihood, you will not be subject to that law but you will still need to comply with the laws of your state. While each state's laws will differ, you should generally stay away from the following tactics:


Calling at unreasonable hours;
Adding additional fees;
Purposely delaying collection in order to add more fees;
Telling the debtor's employer about the debt;
Lying about the debt owed;
Making false threats to the debtor., Check your state’s statutes or state court's website to determine if you can file a claim. Dollar limits can range from $2,500 to $25,000, depending on the state.You can locate your state court’s website and statues by following the correct link from the National Center for State Courts’ .


If you do go to court, prepare for your hearing. If you have a contract, promissory note, or any other documentary evidence of the debt, make enough copies that you can provide the Judge and the debtor, or his or her attorney, with a copy. You should also make copies of any other evidence you wish to submit in the same manner.
This can be a drastic step. Make sure the amount owed is worth the hassle of appearing in court. If the debtor is a friend or relative, this can definitely have a negative impact on that relationship.

, If you fail in small claims court, or are not allowed to file claim there, go to the state court. Consult or hire an attorney, file the proper forms, and prepare for your court date with as much necessary paperwork as you can gather.


This option is generally more expensive, considering court and attorney fees, but if you are successful, it may be worth it more than using a collection agency.The threat of a suit may be enough to bring someone to pay, but you should not make such a threat unless you intend to follow through.

, Once you have obtained a judgment against a debtor, you may file a Petition for Citation, for contempt of court, if they still fail to pay it. Filing a Petition for Citation along with a Notice of Hearing will cause the court to set a hearing, forcing the debtor to return to court and explain why they have not paid the debt.


At the hearing, you should ask the court for permission to garnish the debtor’s wages.

, After some process of inquiring, demanding, and suing for your debt, the debtor will be forced to pay. Sometimes it will be as simple as asking. In other cases, you may need to take additional court-ordered steps, perhaps a Writ of Execution, or a Lien, in order to receive proper payment.


If the case has gone to court, and you have employed the services of an attorney for that purpose, you should consult with them on the best course of action.

, Once you have received the permission of the court to garnish the debtor’s wages it will be up to you to determine where the debtor is employed. The easiest way to do this is ask the debtor. If he or she is unwilling to tell you, you may need to send a set of interrogatories, which are questions that must be answered in writing and under oath. Check your state court’s website for interrogatory forms.

, Once you believe you have found the debtor’s current employer, you will need to send interrogatories to the employer for confirmation that the debtor is employed and his or her wages are not already being garnished up to the limit.

, Upon receiving confirmation that the debtor is employed, you can ask the Court for an order of garnishment, which will be sent to the employer to begin garnishing the debtor’s wages.


Individual states have different laws on wage garnishment, so make sure you are clear on the laws where you reside."

Identify various credit sources.,
Consider using a bank.,
Try crowdfunding.,
Investigate merchant cash advances and credit cards.,
Look at the SBA's programs.",How to Get a Loan Even With Bad Credit6," There are a variety of credit sources available to small businesses, but many business owners aren't aware of them. Banks, micro-credit organizations, crowdfunding, merchant cash advances, and business credit cards are all ways to generate cash flow for business development. In addition, SBA runs many loan programs that disburse funds through private lenders.

, This is where most business owners are going to turn first, and with good reason. Banks typically offer the largest lines of credit with the best repayment terms, but are among the most risk averse lenders.Therefore, if you are applying for a business loan with bad credit, take steps to maximize your chance of success:


Be prepared to offer collateral. Particularly if you have a low credit score, banks may want some sort of collateral, like real estate of heavy equipment, available to secure the loan. If you do not have that type of collateral, then make sure that your accounts receivable look as strong as possible. You may be eligible for accounts receivable (AR) financing. This means you can use the money owed (but not yet paid) to your business by customers as collateral for a loan.Factoring is another option similar to AR financing. Factoring entails the actual sale of AR for a discounted face value, instead of pledging it as collateral.
You may also be able to get inventory financing from the bank, which is a loan given to purchase products to sell. The products, or inventory, themselves serve as collateral — if you cannot repay the loan, you will have to turn over the product to the bank, and the bank will sell it to try and recoup their loan.Show past profitability, and to describe a well thought-out plan for future profits. Even if you aren't profitable now, showing a plan for making a profit can go a long way.Start small. Start by making small loan requests as it will increase the odds of success. A track record of successful small loans sets you up for getting a larger one down the road., If you think you have a great business idea but have a poor credit history, this can be an excellent way to get it off the ground. There are four basic types of crowdfunding:


Rewards crowdfunding offers some type of tangible reward, like a t-shirt, a book, or coffee mug, in exchange for funding. This is the most common type.
Equity crowdfunding offers a piece of the business in exchange for funding. This has been especially popular in Europe, but is on the rise in the US.
Donation crowdfunding—which amounts to nothing more than soliciting donations with nothing in return—offers the least amount of risk to the recipient of funds, but is usually the domain of charitable and artistic enterprises. This can be a very hard sell for a profit-based business.
Lending crowdfunding is basically peer-to-peer lending on a different kind of platform. Whereas peer-to-peer lending focuses on the loan, lending crowdfunding focuses on the purpose for the loan. This can be a great option if you think you can provide a quick return on investment, as the terms of these loans are typically shorter than conventional loans.

Try microfunding. This is can be especially attractive for startup companies. Microcredit organizations loan small amounts less than $50,000 (more likely in the $1,000 to $3,000 range) to small business entities, and they open credit lines to markets that traditionally have very little access to it, like women and minorities. Since the duration of these loans is usually short, look for microloans from non-profit groups, like www.accioneast.org to avoid usurious interest rates.



, Merchant cash advances give a business owner a lump sum in exchange for a share of the business' credit card sales for a fixed period of time. Business credit cards, like all credit cards, can have very high interest rates, and low credit limits, but they can be used as a last resort., The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a variety of loan programs for small businesses, including real estate loans, disaster assistance loans, and general small business loans.Learn more on the SBA's website, https://www.sba.gov/loanprograms.

Complete the FAFSA.,
Consider a Stafford Loan.,
Consider a Perkins Loan.,
Apply for a PLUS Loan.,
Investigate a private student loan.,
Counter your poor credit with a co-signer.",How to Get a Loan Even With Bad Credit7," The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a form detailing your financial information for the purposes of obtaining student aid. The bulk of government student aid is in the form of loans. Most of these loans are available without a credit check. Indeed, many students have no credit history at all and still receive loan awards.

, Stafford Loans are the most popular types of federally available loans. The interest is variable from year to year, and they come in two forms, subsidized Stafford Loans, and unsubsidized Stafford Loans. With a subsidized loan, interest is deferred while you are in school. With unsubsidized Stafford Loans, the interest accrues while you are in school. The amounts of Stafford Loans that are available to borrowers vary per year and by education level. Undergraduates may borrow between $5,500 and $12,500 per year. Graduate students may borrow $20,500 per year., The interest levels on Perkins Loans are fixed at 5%, unlike Stafford loans, which have variable interest rates. Undergraduates are eligible for $5,500 per year and graduate students are eligible for $8,000 per year.Eligibility is limited to those who demonstrate ""exceptional financial need"" as is determined by the FAFSA.

, PLUS Loans are available to graduate students and parents of undergraduate students. The amount available is the cost of attendance minus any other aid the student might receive. The interest rate is fixed at 6.84%, and the loan origination fee is 4.272% after October 1, 2015. Unlike other federal student loans, PLUS loans come with a credit check, although the terms are fairly lenient., If you’re applying for a private student loan, a lender will assess your creditworthiness just like any other private lender. There are many different types of private student loan lenders, but you should start with conventional lenders, like Sallie Mae and SoFi. Check out some comparisons at www.graduateleverage.com and www.simpletuition.com.

#*Private student loans should usually be something you look at last, but particularly for graduate students, the interest rates offered by private lenders can be less than interest rates offered by the government., It may be easier for you to get a private student loan if you can find an adult (parent, guardian, trusted family friend) with good credit who will agree to co-sign the loan. A co-signer takes on the responsibility of paying your loan if you fail to make timely or regular payments.

Present your case.,
Prepare a loan application and/or loan application letter.,
Be prepared to ask more than once.",How to Get a Loan Even With Bad Credit8," If you plan on getting a loan, you're going to have to ask for it eventually, and that means meeting with a lender.You must present hard copies of financial documents to back up the information you presented in your loan application. Plan to bring with you: employment information and housing history for the last two years, two years worth of W-2 forms and income tax forms, complete information and several months worth of statements for all bank accounts and complete information for any outstanding loans and credit card debt., A loan application captures basic information about you including your social security number, income, expenses and savings to name a few. Be sure your application is neat and complete. A lending officer shouldn't have to struggle to read your information. In some lending situations, you may choose to write a loan application letter. Use this letter to explain why you need the loan, how you plan to use it and your plan for repayment.

, Without a strong credit report behind you, you may have to work harder and have greater determination to get a loan. Facing rejection is never easy, but don't let it stop you from trying again and again if that's what's necessary to succeed in getting the money that you need.


Make a plan. Create a list of at least a dozen lending institutions in your area and begin applying. If you receive a rejection from the first company, move on to the next institution on your list. Just knowing that there are more possibilities out there can help to keep your spirits up and your options open.
Ask for feedback. If your loan application is rejected, be sure to find out why. Use what you've learned to try to strengthen your position for your next application.

Also look to the private sector, especially organizations that are focused on offering support services to farmers of all types.;
, Base your initial qualification of those lenders on information that is available online and through other media outlets. This will help to limit your list to lenders who have a history of approving secured crop loans in the amount you have in mind.

, As the next phase of the task, delve into more specific information about each lender on your list. Look into the financial stability of the lender, as well as locating and reading consumer reports about how each lender interacts with its customers. This will give you some idea of which lenders have a reputation for honesty and integrity. Remove those who do not seem to be up to your personal standards.

, Establish contact and obtain specific information on the qualifications that you must meet in order to submit an application and successfully receive a secured loan on crops. Keep in mind that while some lenders will accept just about any type of crop that has market value, others may be focused on approving loans secured with specific crops.

, After evaluating the reputation and financial stability of each lender, along with policies and procedures used to consider applications, determine which lender is the most likely to provide the secured crop loan you need.

, Many lenders will want to see histories of the past performance of the crops you plan on using as collateral for the loan, as well as the usual information on your assets, current liabilities, and other relevant financial information. In some cases, this may require up to 5 years of data. Include information such as sale prices and total sales volume related to the growing season from 1 year to the next. Make sure to include data about any extenuating circumstances that may have negatively impacted crop production in any one of those years.

, Use the channels provided by your lender of choice, noting any information about the duration of the application processing.

Plug your numbers into the interest formula IPT=R{\displaystyle {\frac {I}{PT}}=R} to get your rate.,
Convert the interest rate to a percentage by multiplying it by 100.,
Refer to your most recent statement to fill in the interest equation.,
Make sure that your time and your rate are on the same scale.,
Use online calculators to find rates for complex loans, like mortgages.",How to Calculate Interest Rate1," Once you know the basics of this equation, the math is easy. Just fill in the numbers for your loan or savings account after paying/receiving interest. This simple equation can be used to find your basic interest rate.


I stands for the amount paid in interest that month/year/etc.


P stands for the principle (the amount of money before interest).


T stands for time periods (weeks, months, years, etc.) involved


R stands for the interest rate, as a decimal.;
, A decimal like .34 doesn't mean much when figuring out your interest. Multiply by 100 to get a percentage. This is the percentage of every bill account of principle that is reflected in interest. So, if you got .34 as your rate before, you'd be paying 34% interest (.34∗100=34%{\displaystyle .34*100=34\%}), You should easily be able to find interest paid, the time period (when the bill/statement is from) and principle. For example, say you paid $2,344 in interest on a $12,000 loan last year. You want to know what your monthly interest rate was. To get it, you could input:


Interest equation: IPT=R{\displaystyle {\frac {I}{PT}}=R}


Plug in numbers: $2,344$12,000∗12mo={\displaystyle {\frac {\$2,344}{\$12,000*12mo}}=} Interest Rate


Simplify equation: .01627={\displaystyle .01627=} Interest Rate


Multiply by 100 to get the final percentage: .01627∗100={\displaystyle .01627*100=}1.6% monthly interest rate.


, Say you're trying to figure out your monthly interest rate on a loan after one year. If you put ""1"" in for T, as in ""one year,"" your final interest rate will be the interest rate per year. If you want monthly, you need to use the correct amount of time elapsed. In this case, you'd aim for 12 months.

The time should be the same amount of time as the interest paid. If you're calculating a year's worth of monthly interest payments, for example, then you've made 12 payments.

Make sure you check when your interest is calculated -- monthly, yearly, weekly, etc.-- with your bank., The interest rate for loans must be readily available when you sign up for the loan or credit card. But tricky terms like APR (""annual percentage rate,"" ie. ""interest"") and fluctuating rates may make it impossible to determine what a certain rate even means. These fluctuating rates are almost impossible to determine by hand, but free calculators online can help you find the specifics for difficult loans.

Send notification letters.,
Write a demand letter.,
Talk with the debtor about repayment options.,
Seize collateral, if possible.,
Settle for less than the full amount.",How to Collect on a Promissory Note1," The debtor may owe interest, fees, and penalties. Look at your promissory note to see what late charges you can assess. Then add up the total amount the debtor owes.
, Federal and state laws prohibit debt collectors from engaging in aggressive collection practices. You can avoid the problem by not making any phone calls. Instead, communicate with the debtor in writing.

Illegal collection practices include using obscene or profane language, threatening to arrest debtors, and calling at inconvenient times., Send the first letter as soon as the debtor is 30 days late. Remind them they are late and tell them how much they need to pay to get current on the loan. Also include information about the date of the promissory note and the date payment was due. You can also send 60-day and 90-day past due letters if you want.

Remind the debtor that you will pursue other remedies as spelled out in the promissory note if they don’t pay you back in time.Send the notification certified mail, return receipt requested and keep the receipt with your copy of the letter.

, The debtor might ignore your late-payment notices. In that case, you need to send a demand letter. Review your promissory note to see what actions you can take. For example, your promissory note might allow you to accelerate payment, meaning the debtor must pay the entire amount owed.

Format your demand letter like a business letter, and use letterhead if you have it.
Include a brief description of the dispute. Mention dates: the date of the promissory note, the date payment was due, the date you sent notifications, etc. If you go to court, a judge will find this background information helpful.State what you want the debtor to do. If you want the entire debt paid off, then include a deadline.
Remind the debtor you will sue in court if they don’t meet your demands.

, After receiving your demand letter, the debtor might call, panicked. Discuss why the debtor has been late and when they might catch up.


You can choose to let them skip a few payments if that will help them get current on the loan.
Alternately, you might want to play hardball and not let them miss a payment.

, The debtor might have pledged property to back up the loan. In that situation, you can seize the collateral.You should have a signed security agreement that identifies the collateral and where it is located.

When seizing collateral, you can’t breach the peace. This means you can’t trespass on the debtor’s property or trick the debtor by pretending to be a police officer.Sue in court if you can’t reach the collateral.

, The debtor might have no money, and if they declare bankruptcy you'll probably be completely wiped out.In that situation, you should consider settling the debt for less than the full amount.


You might have to negotiate. The debtor will want to pay as little as possible, but try to get them to pay at least 50% of what they owe. Demand a lump sum payment in cash.
Feel out how financially stable the debtor is. Do they have a job? Do they have other debt payments, such as car payments?

Solve for the numerator of the equation.,
Solve for the denominator.,
Solve for the exponent.,
Finish solving for the denominator.,
Complete your calculation.,
Use online resources to construct an amortization table to understand the annual payments.",How to Calculate an Annual Payment on a Loan1," Assuming a fixed interest rate and evenly spaced payments, the annual payment amount for an annuity (anything that must be paid in yearly increments) can be determined using the following formula: AnnualPayment=(r(P))(1−(1+r)−n){\displaystyle AnnualPayment={\frac {(r(P))}{(1-(1+r)^{-n})}}}, The first step of finding annual payments on a loan is to understand what each of the letters means. Fortunately, each letter simply represents one of the elements of a loan. This information can be easily found on your loan agreement.If you don't have a copy of your loan agreement, contact your lender.

r represents the interest rate per period. Because this represents an annual interest rate in this case, this number may be referred to as an APR (annual percentage rate).

P represents the principal, or the amount borrowed. This can also be referred to as the present value. 

N represents the number of periods in the loan. In this case, periods equals years, and would just be the number of years on your loan agreement.


, Once you know the terms of your loan, you can plug them into the formula above to determine the annual payment. For example, consider a $10,000 loan with an annual interest rate of 9%, for a period of two years.


AnnualPayment=(0.09($10,000))(1−(1+0.09)−2){\displaystyle AnnualPayment={\frac {(0.09(\$10,000))}{(1-(1+0.09)^{-2})}}}

Note that when inputting a percent (9% in this case), it must be input as a decimal. 9% therefore becomes .09.


, The first step in calculating annual payments on a loan is to solve for the numerator (the top part of the equation). Multiply .09 x $10,000 to get $900. This completes the left side of the equation. Your equation should now look like this: AnnualPayment=$900(1−(1+0.09)−2){\displaystyle AnnualPayment={\frac {\$900}{(1-(1+0.09)^{-2})}}}
, The next step is to solve the denominator (the bottom part of the equation). This will be done in three steps. First, add 1 to .09, to give 1.09. Your equation should now look like this: AnnualPayment=$900(1−(1.09)−2){\displaystyle AnnualPayment={\frac {\$900}{(1-(1.09)^{-2})}}}
, Raise 1.09 to the power of -2 (the term). The result will be 0.8417. Recall that when solving an equation, brackets are always solved first, followed by exponents (the -2). Your equation should now look like this: AnnualPayment=$9001−(0.8417){\displaystyle AnnualPayment={\frac {\$900}{1-(0.8417)}}}
, Subtract 0.8417 from 1, to obtain 0.1583. This would complete the bottom part of the equation. Remember to keep as many decimal places present in calculation as possible. This will ensure accuracy, especially in larger loan amounts. Your equation should now look like this: AnnualPayment=$9000.1583{\displaystyle AnnualPayment={\frac {\$900}{0.1583}}}
, Divide the top of your equation by the bottom to get the annual payment on your loan. Solving the example equation, you get 5685.41. Therefore, your annual payment would be $5,685.41.
, An amortization table allows you to see each payment you will make for the remainder of your loan, broken down into how much is principal, how much is interest, and what the remaining balance on the loan is. This allows you to see exactly what your monthly (or annual) payment is, and less and less of the payment goes to interest over time as the amount owed decreases.Simply input the amount, interest rate, and term into the calculator, and the amortization table will show every monthly payment from the current point to the end of the loan.

Find out your interest rate before getting a loan.,
Ask about accrual rates to determine when you get charged interest.,
Use longer term loans to pay less each month, but more overall.",How to Calculate Interest Payments1," Calculating interest payments is not a simple equation. Luckily, a quick search for ""interest payment calculator"" makes it easy to find your payment amounts as long as you know what to input into the calculator:


Principal: The amount of your loan. If you loan is $5,000, the principal is $5,000.


Interest: In simple terms, the percentage of money you're being charged to have the loan. It is either given as a percentage (such as 4%) or a decimal (.04).


Term: Usually in months, this is how long you have to pay the loan off. For mortgages it is often calculated in years.


Payment Option: Almost always a ""fixed-term loan."" However this can be different for specialty loans. Ask if the interest and payment schedule is fixed before getting a loan if you are unsure.;
, The interest rate is the cost you pay for borrowing money. It is the rate of interest that you will pay on the principal for the life of the loan. You want it to be as low as possible, as even .5% of a difference can mean a huge sum of money.If you would prefer lower payments, you may pay a higher interest rate and more total interest over the loan, but less each month. Someone with less savings on hand or whose income is bonus or commission-based would likely prefer this option. However, want to stay below 10% interest whenever possible. The common rates for different loans are:


Auto: 4-7% Home: 3-6%


Personal Loans: 5-9%


Credit Cards: 18-22% This is why you should avoid large purchases you can't repay quickly on credit cards.


Payday Loans: 350-500%  These loans are very dangerous if you can't pay them off within 1-2 weeks., In technical terms, the accrual rate tells you how often lender calculates the interest you owe. The more frequently you're charged the more you owe, since you have less time to pay off and the bill and prevent higher interest.Look, for example, at a $100,000 loan with 4% interest, compounded three different ways:


Yearly: $110,412.17


Monthly: $110,512.24


Daily: $110,521.28


, The term is the period of time that you have to repay the loan.Again, this will vary from one loan to the next, and you'll need to choose a loan with a term that meets your needs. A longer term will typically result in more interest paid over the life the loan, but smaller monthly payments.For example, say you have a $20,000 auto loan with 5% interest. Total payment would be:


24 Month Term: You pay 	$1,058.27 in total interest, but only $877.43 each month.


30 Month Term: You pay $1,317.63 in total interest, but only $710.59 each month.


36 Month Term: You pay $1,579.02  in total interest, but only $599.42 each month."

Talk to your bankers to negotiate a lower interest rate.,
Choose a less-frequent accrual rate to pay less in interest.,
Pay more than your interest whenever possible, no matter the interest rate.,
Monitor common interest rates before getting a loan.,
Know the interest rates on any investments to money wisely.",How to Calculate Interest Rate2," Getting a lower interest rate is usually just a matter of negotiating. To be successful, all you have to do is come prepared. Know how much money you want, how much interest you'd like to pay, and what rate is going to be too high for you to make a deal before walking in or calling up. Financially stable people with decent (650+) credit scores have the best chance to negotiate rates.Call up your credit card company and let them know that you've found better rates on other cards. If you're a regular customer who pays on time, they will likely try to keep your business.

Talk to your banker about the lowest possible rate they can give. Research other options so you can point to other offers.

Be wary of variable APR or interest -- it may look appealing at first, but these ""deals"" often turn into exorbitantly high interest rates after 1-2 years., The accrual rate determines when interest is added to principal. So, if it is really high (such as daily) it means that whatever interest is unpaid at the end of the day gets added to principle. This means the next month's interest payment will be even higher since you have a higher principle. For example, note how a $100,000 loan with a 4% interest rate is compounded three different ways:


Yearly: $110,412.17


Monthly: $110,512.24


Daily: $110,521.28, Remember that interest is taken as a percentage of principle. Simply said -- the more you owe, the more money you pay in interest. If you can pay off some of the principle every month along with the interest, you may not lower your rate. But you will definitely lower your payments., Interest can be thought of as the cost of borrowing money. Either you pay someone for it, or your bank pays you to ""borrow"" the money in a savings account. Either way, you should know the rates before signing any paperwork.


Auto: 4-7% Home: 3-6%


Personal Loans: 5-9%


Credit Cards: 18-22%


Payday Loans: 350-500% ., The safer an account is, like a savings account, CD, or bond, the less money it usually returns in interest. That said, this sort of guaranteed, but slow growth, can be powerful when saving for retirement. Other accounts with higher interest rates will make you more money, but with more associated risk or stipulations attached.


Savings Accounts: 1-2%CD 1-2%


US Bonds (over 30 years): 3-4%

Find the correct court to sue in.,
File a complaint.,
Send the debtor notice of the lawsuit.,
Receive the debtor’s answer.,
Prepare for trial.,
Go to court.,
Enforce your judgment.",How to Collect on a Promissory Note2," You can’t sue the debtor in just any court. However, you have options, depending on the circumstances. Consider the following:

Consider small claims court if you're suing for a small amount. Each state has a small claims court that hears cases up to a certain dollar amount. Small claims court is ideal if you don’t have an attorney.You can generally sue in the county or district where you made the contract or where the debtor lives or works.
If you live in a different state than the debtor, you might file in federal court. However, federal court lawsuits are complicated and you’re better off if you have a lawyer.

, You kick off a lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. In this document, you identify the parties to the lawsuit, how much you are suing for, and why you are suing. You should also attach a copy of your promissory note. File your complaint with the court clerk and pay a filing fee.Most small claims courts have “fill in the blank” forms you can use.
If no form is available, look online for sample complaints or consult with an attorney who can help you.

, Typically, you’ll send a copy of the complaint and a summons, which you can get from the court clerk. You’ll need to follow your state’s rules regarding service. Generally, you can use the following methods:Have someone hand deliver the papers to the debtor. You can’t deliver them yourself, but you can ask a friend or hire a process server. If the debtor is a business, you will serve their registered agent.
Pay the sheriff to make service, which is an option in some counties.
Mail the papers to the debtor using first-class mail.

, The debtor has a chance to respond by filing an answer and sending you a copy. Read it closely because it will contain the debtor’s defenses. For example, the debtor might argue the promissory note isn’t valid or that you’ve verbally agreed to let them stop making payment.

The debtor might also counter-sue you. For example, if you called the debtor in the evenings or threatened them physically, they can sue you for illegal debt collection practices., The trial will revolve around whether the promissory note is valid and whether the defendant is justified in not paying back the debt. Unless you’re in small claims court, you’ll need to do quite a bit of work before your trial date approaches.


You’ll swap documents in a process called “discovery.”
You may need to have a settlement conference.Courts hope parties can settle their disputes so a trial becomes unnecessary.
You can file a motion for summary judgment. In this motion, you argue you should win without going to trial because no set of facts exists that will allow the debtor to prevail.

, Each side can call witnesses and introduce documents. You’ll want to introduce the promissory note and testify about the debtor’s history of payment.


Most small claims courts don’t have juries, so a judge will likely decide who wins.

, If you win, you get a piece of paper from the court. Now you need to enforce it. The debtor can voluntarily pay you, or you might need to take other action. Consider your options:You can garnish the debtor’s wages or bank accounts.
You might be able to have the sheriff seize and sell personal property such as boats, cars, jewelry, etc. You will get some of the proceeds from the sale.
You can also put a lien on real estate, such as the debtor’s home. Depending on where you live, you might be able to force a sale of the property. At a minimum, you can receive payment if the debtor sells the house or refinances.

Find a reputable collection agency.,
Confirm they’re licensed.,
Check fees.,
Ask how they find debtors.,
Sign a contract.,
Share information with the agency.",How to Collect on a Promissory Note3," You can hire a certified member of the Commercial Collection Agency Association. These agencies have extensive experience and adhere to state and federal collection laws.Also check whether anyone has complained to the Better Business Bureau about the collection agency.

, Collection agencies should be licensed by the state where they are collecting the debt. Ask for the license number and double check by calling the state’s licensing agency.States usually require that debt collectors be bonded and have insurance, so ask for proof of that as well., Generally, collection agencies charge contingency fees. This means they only get a fee if they collect money, and they take a percent off the top. Typically, an agency will take 15-20% of the amount collected.Get the fee agreement in writing.

For example, an agency with a 20% contingency fee keeps $2,000 of every $10,000 collected.
Because agencies work on contingency, some debts might be too small for them to take on. Call and check.

, The debtor might have skipped town after stopping payment on your debt. If so, the collection agency should tell you how they will find them. For example, they might employ skip tracing, which involves using special databases to track down the debtor., Make sure to get the agreement in writing. Don’t rely on oral agreements, and insist all key terms are included in the contract. If you have a dispute with the collection agency, then the terms of your contract control.

, You’ll speed up the collection efforts if you share helpful information, such as the following:The debtor’s name and address, including any aliases.
The debtor’s telephone number and email address.
Whether the debtor has responded to your efforts to collect on the debt.
A copy of the promissory note.

Use an online calculator to confirm results.",How to Calculate an Annual Payment on a Loan2," Often, lenders require that you make monthly or quarterly payments. Therefore, it is more useful to know what the monthly or quarterly payment is, rather than simply the annual payment. Fortunately, the same formula is used, with some minor revisions.

For the sake of this example, assume the new loan is the same as previously-discussed one, with the only change being you are now required to make monthly payments for the two year period.


, Although the formula is largely the same as that for annual payments, a few minor changes occur to reflect the fact that there are now more payments. Again, the standard formula is: Payment=(r(P))(1−(1+r)−n){\displaystyle Payment={\frac {(r(P))}{(1-(1+r)^{-n})}}}

First, the amount of periods in the loan, or ""n"", would change. Instead of being 2 (representing two years before, or two annual payments), it is now 24 for monthly payments (representing 1 payment a month for 2 years) and 8 for quarterly payments (representing one payment each quarter for the two years). 

Second, the annual interest rate would need to change to reflect the fact there are more payments. To determine an interest rate for periodic payments, divide the annual interest rate by the number of payments required within a year. For example, a 9% annual interest rate is equivalent to a .0075 or .75% monthly interest rate (.09/12)., The new formula, with all the example numbers plugged in looks like this: Payment=(0.0912($10,000))(1−(1+0.0912)−24){\displaystyle Payment={\frac {({\frac {0.09}{12}}(\$10,000))}{(1-(1+{\frac {0.09}{12}})^{-24})}}}
, Start by simplifying the rate by solving for the monthly interest rate. This is done by dividing the annual rate of 9% by 12, as in the equation, to get 0.0075. After you do so, your equation should look like this: Payment=(0.0075($10,000))(1−(1+0.0075)−24){\displaystyle Payment={\frac {(0.0075(\$10,000))}{(1-(1+0.0075)^{-24})}}}
, Continue by solving the numerator (the top part of the equation). Multiply the two numbers (rate and principal) together to solve this step. Your equation should now look like this: Payment=($75)(1−(1+0.0075)−24){\displaystyle Payment={\frac {(\$75)}{(1-(1+0.0075)^{-24})}}}
, Next, simplify the denominator (bottom of the equation) by adding the rate to 1. This comes to 1.0075 in our example. The equation now looks like this: Payment=($75)(1−(1.0075)−24){\displaystyle Payment={\frac {(\$75)}{(1-(1.0075)^{-24})}}}
, Next, solve the exponent in the equation by raising the (rate +1) found in the last step to the power of -24. This comes to 0.8358. The equation now looks like this: Payment=$751−(0.8358){\displaystyle Payment={\frac {\$75}{1-(0.8358)}}}
, Simplify by subtracting your result in the last step from one. In our example, this would be 1−0.8358{\displaystyle 1-0.8358}, which yields 0.1642. At this point, the equation looks like this: Payment=$750.1642{\displaystyle Payment={\frac {\$75}{0.1642}}}
, Finally, divide the top part of the equation by the bottom to get your monthly payment. In this case, Payment=$456.76{\displaystyle Payment=\$456.76}
, If necessary, you can convert your monthly payment to an annual total by multiplying it by 12. Here, 12∗473.78=$5,481.12{\displaystyle 12*473.78=\$5,481.12}.
, Once again, keep in mind that there are plenty of online calculators available to calculate this online, without ever calculating the payment yourself."

Learn the formula for complex interest payments.,
Adjust for frequency of payments.,
Adjust for number of payments.,
Calculate your monthly payment.,
Calculate your total interest.",How to Calculate Interest Payments2," Calculating your payments and interest requires the use of a mathematical formula, which is as follows: Payment=Principal∗i(1+i)n(1+i)n−1{\displaystyle Payment=Principal*{\frac {i(1+i)^{n}}{(1+i)^{n}-1}}}The ""i"" represents interest rate, and the ""n"" represents the number of payments.

Like most equations in finance, the formula for determining your payment is much more intimidating than the math itself. Once you understand how to set up the numbers, calculating your monthly payment is as easy as pie. 


, Before you plug numbers into the equation, you must adjust your interest payment “i” for how often you are paying.

For example, imagine you took out a loan at 4.5 percent, and the loan required you to make payments on a monthly basis.

Since your payments are monthly, you will need to divide the interest rate by 12. 4.5 percent (.045) divided by 12 equals 0.00375. Plug this number in for ""i."", To determine what to plug in for ""n,"" your next step is to determine the total number of payments you'll be making over the term of the loan.

Imagine that your monthly payments are on a loan with a 30 year term. To find the number of payments, simply multiply 30 by 12. You'll be making 360 payments., To figure your monthly payment on this loan, it is now just a matter of plugging the numbers into the formula.This might look intimidating, but if you go step by step, you'll soon have your interest payment. Below are the steps of the calculation, done one by one.

Continuing with the example above, imagine you have borrowed $100,000. Your equation will look like this: 100,000∗0.00375(1+0.00375)360(1+0.00375)360−1{\displaystyle 100,000*{\frac {0.00375(1+0.00375)^{3}60}{(1+0.00375)^{3}60-1}}}


100,000∗0.00375(1.00375)360(1+0.00375)3600−1{\displaystyle 100,000*{\frac {0.00375(1.00375)^{3}60}{(1+0.00375)^{3}600-1}}}


100,000∗0.00375(3.84769....)(1+0.00375)360−1{\displaystyle 100,000*{\frac {0.00375(3.84769....)}{(1+0.00375)^{3}60-1}}}


100,000∗0.01442.....(1+0.00375)360−1{\displaystyle 100,000*{\frac {0.01442.....}{(1+0.00375)^{3}60-1}}} 


100,000∗0.01442.....(1.00375)360−1{\displaystyle 100,000*{\frac {0.01442.....}{(1.00375)^{3}60-1}}}


100,000∗0.01442.....3.84769.....−1{\displaystyle 100,000*{\frac {0.01442.....}{3.84769.....-1}}}


100,000∗0.01442.....2.84769.....{\displaystyle 100,000*{\frac {0.01442.....}{2.84769.....}}}


100,000∗0.00506685.....=506.69{\displaystyle 100,000*0.00506685.....=506.69}


$506.69. This will be your monthly payment.


, Now that you have the monthly payment, you can determine how much interest you will pay over the life of the loan. Multiply the number of payments over the life of the loan by your monthly payment. Then subtract the principal amount you borrowed.Using the example above, you'd multiply $506.69 by 360 and get $182,408. This is the total amount you'll pay over the loan's term. 

Subtract $100,000 and you end up with $82,408. That is the total amount of interest you'd pay on this loan.

For the remainder of the section, you can use the following example loan:

You take out a $100,000 home loan. You have 30 years to pay it off at 4.5% annual interest rate.


, You need to tell Excel that you're paying a debt. To to so, write the principal with a negative number, without the $ sign.


-100,000 = Principal


, You can leave it in years, if you want, but your answer would spit out yearly interest payments, not monthly. Since most loans are paid monthly, simply multiple the number of years by 12 to get your total number of payments. Write this down in another box.


-100,000 = Principal


360 = Number of Payments


, In this example, your interest rate is annual, meaning it is calculated at the end of the year. However, you're paying monthly, meaning you need to know what your monthly interest rate is. Since 4.5% is for 12-months of interest, simply divide by 12 to get one month's worth of interest. Be sure to convert the percentage to a decimal when you're done.


-100,000 = Principal


360 = Number of Payments


4.5%12=.375%={\displaystyle {\frac {4.5\%}{12}}=.375\%=}.00375{\displaystyle .00375} = Monthly interest.


, Excel already knows the equation for calculating monthly payments, with interest. You just have to give it the information it needs to make the calculation. Click on an empty box, then ;locate the function bar. It is located right above the spreadsheet and labeled ""fx."" Click inside of it and write ""=PMT(""

Do not include the quotation marks.

If you're Excel savvy, you can set up Excel to accept the payment values for you.


, Place the values needed to calculate the payment in the parenthesis, separated by commas. In this case, you'll enter (Interest rate,number of periods,principal ,0).

Using the example above, the full entry should read: ""=PMT(0.00375,360,-100000,0)"" 

The last number is a zero. The zero indicates you will have a balance of $0 at the end of your 360 payments.

Make sure you remember to close the parenthesis off.


, If you've entered the function correctly, you should see your total monthly payment in =PMT cell of the spreadsheet.

In this case, you'll see the number $506.69. That will be your monthly payment.

If you see ""#NUM!"" or some other output that doesn't make sense to you in cell, you've entered something incorrectly. Double check the text in the function bar and try again.


, To figure out the total amount you will pay over the life of your loan, all you have to do is multiply the payment amount by the total number of payments.

In the example, you'd multiply $506.69 by 360 to get $182,408. This is the total amount you'll pay over the loan's term.


, If you want to know how much interest you'll pay over the term of the loan, this is just a matter of subtraction. Subtract the principal from the total amount you'll pay.

In the example you'd subtract $100,000 from $182,408. You end up with $82,408. This is your total interest paid.

In some cases, borrowers can get up to 85 percent of the value of their home minus the amount left due on their mortgage. This allows them to use the HELOC to do things like:

Make an addition to their home.

Buy another property.Consolidate debt.

Pay for higher education.

Using a HELOC to consolidate debt can end up being financially destructive if you are not careful. Doing so may cause you to run up more debt than you had originally. Avoid this by paying the existing debt, closing those accounts, then paying off the HELOC. 

Only consolidate debt using a HELOC if the interest rate on the HELOC is favorable to that of your existing debt.
;
, In many ways, the two types of home equity loans are similar. However, second mortgages require fixed payments (on both the principal and interest) that begin when the money is borrowed. HELOCs are different in that they allow for a draw period in which the borrower pays only for the accrued interest.Draw periods on HELOCS are usually 5 to 10 years, while repayment period are generally 10 to 20 years.Interest rates on HELOCs are typically higher than those on home equity loans.Because HELOCs are drawn upon as needed, they are more flexible than second mortgages. This makes them a better choice if you are unsure how much money you will need. 


, Consider your realistic ability to repay the line of credit, particularly after the draw period. After all, paying a small monthly payment that takes care of the interest on your credit is relatively cheap. However, at the end of the draw period, the balloon payment for the value of the credit line is due. Borrowers then have the choice of either paying the balloon payment from their savings or taking out another loan to cover it.Consider how this will affect your finances before taking on a HELOC.

Despite having the opportunity to repay only interest during the draw period, many HELOC borrowers choose to repay the principal, either partially or entirely, during the draw period., If the balloon payment on the HELOC is not made, the lender has the right to foreclosure upon and seize your home.Additionally, a sudden drop in the value of your home may cause your lender to freeze your borrowing privileges. That is, you will temporarily be unable to borrow more money. Be aware of these risks before opening a HELOC., For example, are you still in the first year or some other timeframe?. This is important because most HELOCs will allow interest-only payments for some period of time, such as the first 5 to 10 years.
, This will give you the information you need to calculate your payments. This information includes your outstanding balance and interest rate charged.

For example, imagine that you have a HELOC on which you currently have $20,000 drawn out. This HELOC charges 5% interest. You are currently preparing to receive a bill for the month of April, so you will be paying interest for 30 days (interest is calculated daily). 


, This not the maximum amount of the loan; it is only the amount you have used or your ""draw"". Specifically, this is the average daily balance for the month, which can be calculated by adding up every daily balance on the HELOC and dividing by the number of days in the month., If listed as percentage (that is, 5 percent), start by changing it to a decimal by dividing by 100 (5/100 = 0.05). Remember that this is the annual interest rate. Divide by 365 to get the daily interest rate.In this case, that would be 0.05/365, or 0.000137.

Your interest rate may be tied to a government-standard interest rate, such as the prime rate. If this is the case, your calculation of your interest rate is more complicated. You have to find out what the margin is on your interest rate (how much higher your rate is than the prime rate, for example) and add that to current prime rate. For example, imagine in this case that the prime rate is 3.5% and your margin is 1.5%. This sets your interest rate at 5%. 


, Multiply your daily interest rate by the total borrowed (or drawn). In the example, this would be 0.000137*$20,000, or $2.74.
, This would be 28 for February, 30 for September, and so on. If you are still in your draw period, this is your monthly payment. In the example, your monthly payment for April would be $2.74*30, or $82.20.
, Many HELOCs charge variable interest that is set to a another market rate, like the prime rate (an important bank rate). This means that your interest rate moves along with this market rate and can be vastly different between months or years. In addition, many HELOCs charge a higher interest rate than the market rate. The difference is called a margin. Your rate is calculated as the market rate (whichever one your HELOC is set to) plus the margin.For example, if your HELOC is tied to the prime rate, which is currently at 3.5% and charges a 1.5% margin, your annual interest rate is 5%. 

Note that this will have to be recalculated each month as interest rates will change. 


, First, divide your interest rate by 100 to get it in decimal form. In the example, this would be 5%/100, or 0.05. Next, divide your annual rate by 12 to get a monthly interest rate. This would be 0.05/12, or 0.00417. Finally, add 1 to your monthly interest rate. So, 1+0.00417=1.00417., Start by determining how long you plan to spend repaying your HELOC. This could be as few as 3 years or as many as 20. In any case, settle on a number and multiply it by 12 to get the total number of monthly payments you will make. For example, imagine that you plan to pay off the HELOC for 10 years. You would have 10*12, or 120 payments., This sounds complicated but it is simple to do on a calculator. Enter your converted monthly interest rate (1.00417) in the example first. Then press the exponent key, which usually looks like this:xy{\displaystyle x^{y}}. Next, enter the total number of monthly payments you will make (120 in the example) with a negative sign in front of it (so -120). Press enter to get your answer.In the example, this will be 1.00417^-120, or 0.607.
, Take your answer from the last step and simply subtract it from one. In the example, this would be 1-0.607, or 0.393., That is, use your monthly interest rate (without the added one). So, in the example this would be 0.00417. Take this number and divide it by the result of the last step. So, 0.00417/0.393=0.0106., For example, if you have a balance of $100,000 on your HELOC, your monthly payment during the repayment period would be 0.0106*$100,000, or $1,060."

Let's use the example that you borrow $100,000 from your brother and promise to pay him back in 5 years plus an extra $25,000. In order to find the interest rate that is ""implicit"" or ""implied"" in this agreement, you need to do a mathematical calculation.The formula you will use is total amount paid/amount borrowed raised to 1/number of periods = x. Then x-1 x100 = implicit interest rate.;
, For the example in Step 1, first divide the total payback amount by the borrowed amount. In this example, you borrowed $100,000 and pay back a total of $125,000, so $125,000 divided by $100,000 is 1.25., Raise the result of the first step to the power of 1/n, where n is the number of periods interest is paid. For simplicity, we can use n=5 for 5 years to calculate the implied annual interest rate. Thus, 1.25^(1/5) = 1.25^0.2 = 1.0456., Subtract 1 from the above result. Thus 1.0456-1 = 0.0456. Then multiply the above result by 100, to arrive at 4.56%, which is the implicit interest rate per year."

These can be found on your loan agreement.


Alternately, you can enter your own values for a loan agreement you think you could get. Be sure to research the prevailing interest rate on your loan type for your creditworthiness.
You can get the monthly payment amount from there by reading and following the directions at how to calculate loan payments.;
, Open Excel on your computer and choose to open a new, blank workbook. The program should then display a blank worksheet. This will be your workspace for calculating your balloon payment.

, Enter your variables' names in the cells from A1 down to A4 as follows: annual interest rate, duration of your loan (years), monthly payment, and your loan amount (principal). This will ensure that you don't mix up any values if you change your variables later., Fill in your variables in the adjacent cells to your labels. These will be cells B1 to B4. Check again to make sure you've put the right variables into each cell, because your calculations will depend on this.For example, consider the following variables:


An annual rate of 4% would be entered into B1 as 0.04
A 15-year loan would be entered into B2 as 15.
A monthly payment of $1000 would be entered into B3 as -1000. Be sure this is entered as a negative number. This is how Excel recognizes payments.
A loan amount of $150,000 should be entered into B4 as 150,000.

, The equation used to calculate your payment payment is the future value function. This is denoted in Excel with the symbol ""FV."" It can be either typed in manually to a nearby cell by typing ""=FV("" or found in the functions tab under financial functions. Either way, when you type it into a cell, the function will prompt you for variables as follows: =FV(rate, nper, pmt, , )., Each variable will be linked from your variables you've already entered on your worksheet. However, some changes must be made to some of the variables when they are entered. Additionally, they must be entered in the right order. Enter your variables as follows:


The prompt ""rate"" is asking for your periodic interest rate. That is, your monthly interest rate. When prompted, after typing ""=FV("", click on cell B1, where your rate should be. Then, type ""/12"" to divide your annual rate by 12 and find your monthly interest rate. The program will now calculate this for you in your equation. Enter a comma to move on to the next variable.

If your payments are quarterly, divide by 4 instead of by 12. For semi-annual payments, divide by 2.
Assuming monthly payments, your equation should now look like this: =FV(B1/12,


The prompt ""nper"" is asking for the total number of payments. Here, you'll want to multiply the duration of your loan by 12 to find the total number of monthly payments made on the loan. When prompted, click on B2 and then type *12 to multiply it within the equation. Enter a comma to move on to the next variable.

Multiply by 4 for quarterly payments or 2 for semi-annual payments.
Assuming monthly payments, your equation should now look like this: =FV(B1/12,B2*12,


The prompt ""pmt"" is simply asking for your monthly payments as entered in B3. Simply click on B3 when prompted or type it into the equation. Enter a comma to move on to the next variable.

Your equation should now look like this: =FV(B1/12,B2*12, B3,


The fourth prompt, "","" is just asking for the principal, or loan amount. Simply click on B4 when prompted. You can then close off the equation with a closing parenthesis. The last variable, "","" is unnecessary here.

Your final equation should be as follows: =FV(B1/12,B2*12,B3,B4), Check that you've entered everything correctly and that your equation doesn't contain any errors or unnecessary numbers. The program will return your answer in the same cell where you entered the formula., The answer will be returned as a negative number if you've entered everything correctly. This simply means that it is a payment and not a return. The number displayed will be the balloon payment due at the end of your loan. If the number is positive, this means either that you've entered your data incorrectly or that you don't have a balloon payment loan.


Using the variables in this example, a balloon payment of $26,954.76 will be due at the end of the loan's term.

, This will allow you to calculate the effect of a better rate, making a higher monthly payment, or extending the length of your loan.

Consider fixed versus adjustable interest rates for a loan.,
Assess the annual percentage rate, or APR, for a loan.,
Always shop around for loan interest rates.,
Ask about locking in rates.,
Evaluate troublesome loan clauses.",How to Compare Loan Rates," Financial experts report that many lenders in recent years have pushed adjustable interest rates without really telling people what they are. A borrower should know whether their loan includes a fixed or adjustable interest rate.


Understand the benefits and disadvantages of adjustable interest rates. With a fixed interest rate, the borrower knows what interest they will pay on a loan over the entire term of the loan. On the other hand, an adjustable interest rate can change along with the prime lending rate. This can have positive results if the national interest rate goes down. However, it can cause a financial crisis for a borrower if the interest rate goes up.;
, The APR takes into account various other kinds of lending fees along with the basic interest rate to provide the borrower with a total interest obligation annually.

, Make sure that the lenders you are talking to are offering the lowest interest rates possible, relevant to market rates and other aspects like your credit score.

, Many homeowners getting mortgages and others who are looking for other conventional loans will attempt to lock in a specific interest rate at some point in the agreement. Locking interest rates means that if the rates change between the time of the locking and the settlement of the deal, the effective interest rate for that particular loan will not change.

, While government programs insure conventional loans with a fixed interest rate, some private lenders offer exotic loan products that include dramatic changes in interest rates over time. Financial journalists have reported on the dangers of these kinds of subprime loans. Educate yourself on what to avoid in order to prevent a foreclosure or similar situation.


Look out for teaser rates. In many cases, the lender offers a low, up-front interest rate that is scheduled to jump several percent after one or two years, according to the loan agreement. This is where the borrower needs to read his loan agreement carefully and identify these improper changes.
Avoid balloon payments and similar setups in a loan agreement. Balloon payment loans were originally made for borrowers with uneven income who expected windfalls, large bonuses or other financial payments later in a tax year or after the initial few months or years of a loan. The balloon payment setup allows the borrower to pay a lower monthly payment up until the balloon payment kicks in, where a much larger single payment applies. For the conventional borrower, this is a bad deal, since wage earners and others structure their payments around steady income.

It does not include other aspects of the deal such as the trade-in allowance, fees, taxes, and other closing costs.;
, For auto or boat purchases, among others, a dealer may offer a trade-in allowance or credit for giving them your old car or boat when you buy a new one. The value of this item, or a credit provided by the dealer, is then subtracted from what you owe on your new purchase. The net trade-in allowance is found by subtracting the amount still owed on your trade from the trade-in allowance offered by the dealership.


If the trade-in is high enough, dealers don't typically require an extra payment, such as a down payment.
Some dealers may allow you to use the trade-in value of your old vehicle to cover the required down payment on a new one (assuming the old one holds enough value)., Dealers may also offer cash rebates as a way to incentivize purchases. These cash rebates are simply subtracted from the purchase price at closing. They also do not need to be included in the amount to be financed. Rebates may be provided to certain buyers, like students or military veterans, or may be specific to certain vehicles., The amount left after rebates and trade-ins is the the amount owed. This amount must be either paid in full or borrowed from a lender and paid off in installments over time. From here, you can calculate the down payment if the lender requires one. For example, a lender might require 10 or 20 percent down on your purchase. Your loan amount is then the amount remaining after the down payment is subtracted out.

, ""Amount financed"" is a term that is specific to home loans. All other loans simply refer to the amount financed as the total amount of the loan provided to the borrower. For these types of loans, simply use the loan amount after the down payment as calculated in this part as your amount financed.

, For a home, this will be your accepted offer price. For example, you might talk a homeowner down to selling a property for $100,000.

, Home purchases may have required a ""good faith"" deposit. Other purchases may also require a deposit be made while bidding on or reserving the item. This deposit is typically paid upon submission of an offer to purchase. This money is then subtracted from the purchase price, as you have already paid it.Deposits are either returned (depending upon terms) or converted into the down payment amount and/or closing costs.
For example, if you put in a $3,000 good faith deposit on a $100,000 home, you would subtract this from the $100,000 to get $97,000.

, The portion of the original purchase price remaining after these deductions is your loan amount, assuming you are planning on financing the purchase. This amount must be borrowed from a lender and then repaid over a period of time per a loan agreement. The loan amount is the amount borrowed from the lender, not the amount that will eventually be repaid in total, which also includes interest expenses., The down payment is paid in full upon closing the sale. It is generally a percentage of the total purchase price and is designed to provide security for the lender in the event of default. Therefore, it is not included in the amount financed.Many mortgage lenders require 20 percent down on a real estate transaction, although you may be able to secure an FHA-backed mortgage requiring as little as 5 percent down payment. A lower loan balance results in less interest expense and the possible requirement of mortgage insurance.A lower downpayment is expected on government- guaranteed loans such as FHA or VA because the lender has recourse to the Federal government in the event of default.
For example, if you paid a 20 percent down payment on the $100,000 house purchase, which would be $20,000, you would subtract this from your total.
Your good faith deposit may be applied towards your down payment. This means that the loan amount would still be the purchase price minus the down payment, which is $80,000 in this case.

, ""Amount financed"" is a term set by the 1968 Truth in Lending Act to describe how much credit is provided to a borrower when they take out a home loan. It is calculated by subtracting prepaid fees and finance charges from the loan amount, since these fees are paid at closing simultaneously with the execution of the loan documents. This means that the amount financed is always less than the actual loan amount. The amount financed is provided to borrowers on the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement, which is supplied after you apply for a home loan., Prepaid fees are subtracted from the loan amount to arrive at the amount financed. These fees include prepaid points, homeowners association fees, mortgage insurance, and escrow company fees. They also include lender fees like underwriting fees, tax service, process fees, and prepaid interest. Add all of these fees up to arrive a total prepaid fees amount., Subtract all of the prepaid fees from the loan amount to get your amount financed. This information will also be available on your Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement., If you have the amount financed for a mortgage loan, you can use this information to compare different lenders by looking at the associated fees and interest rates. This information is provided on the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement, which is provided by all lenders to loan applicants. If you instead are financing another purchase, you can use your amount of financing required to apply to a variety of loans and look for the best combination of fees and interest rate., Your loan will likely be charged compound interest as you pay it off. Compound interest paid increases with the loan duration, the interest rate, and the compounding frequency (how often the compound interest is calculated each year). When you have the amount financed, you can use online interest calculators to determine how much interest you will pay on loans with different loan terms. A longer, higher-interest loan will end up costing you much more money in the long run than a shorter-term, low-interest loan.


For more information, see how to calculate interest payments.

, If you know how much you need to borrower (your loan amount), you can use this information to check for loan rates online. Check loan aggregator sites to find interest rates for the type and size of loan that you need. Then, input this information into an online loan calculator to figure out what your monthly payments might be. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) provides a good calculator at http://apps.finra.org/Calcs/1/Loan.

, Once you have an idea of the monthly loan payments, you can use this information to figure out how much you can afford to take out in a loan. Assess your ability to afford the loan by starting with your monthly after-tax income. Then, subtract any existing debt payments (mortgage, auto, etc.), monthly expenses like utilities and food, and savings or contributions to an emergency fund. The amount left is money that you can afford to pay towards a new loan's monthly payment.Most financial planners suggest limiting house payments plus taxes and insurance to 25 to 28 percent of take-home income.
For example, if your household net income is $7,000 per month, your total outlay for housing should be no more than $1,960 per month.

, Your actual mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) is calculated using your amount financed, rather than the loan amount. That is, your actual APR will be higher than the interest rate listed on your loan. To calculate your actual APR, find your monthly payment by using your stated interest rate, loan term, and loan amount and entering them into a loan calculator. Then, record your monthly payment and find a loan calculator that allows you to input your monthly payment, loan duration, and loan amount and receive an interest rate as the output. The output will be your actual APR.A good calculator for this purpose can be found at http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/interest-rate-calculator.php.

Gather the information you need to calculate the loan’s amortization.,
Set up a spreadsheet.,
Calculate the interest portion of the monthly payment for month one.,
Compute the principal portion of the payment for month one.,
Use the new principal amount at the end of month one to calculate amortization for month two.,
Determine the principal repayment for month two.,
Analyze the trend that occurs over time.,
Consider the impact of amortization at the end of the loan’s term.,
Use the concept of amortization to make smart choices about your finances.",How to Calculate Amortization," You’ll need the principal amount and the interest rate. To calculate amortization, you also need the term of the loan and the payment amount each period. In this case, you will calculate monthly amortization.The principal amount is the current loan balance outstanding ($100,000).
Your interest rate (6%) is the annual rate on the loan. To calculate amortization, you will convert the annual interest rate into a monthly rate.
The term of the loan is 360 months (30 years). Since amortization is a monthly calculation in this example, the term is stated in months, not years.
Your monthly payment is $599.95. The dollar amount of the payment stays constant. However, the portion of the payment that is principal or interest will change. You will mostly be paying off the interest when you start making payments, and then your payments will start to go to the balance.;
, This calculation has a few moving parts and would best be accomplished in a spreadsheet where you've pre-loaded all your relevant info into column headings like: Principal, Interest Payment, Principal Payment, and Ending Principal.

The total number of rows below those headings would be 360 to account for each monthly payment.
A spreadsheet makes the calculations significantly quicker because if done correctly you only have to enter a given equation once (or twice, as when you are using the previous month's calculation to fuel all subsequent calculations).
Once entered correctly, simply drag your equation(s) down through the remaining cells to compute amortization over the life of the loan.
Even better is to set aside a separate set of columns and input your main loan variables (e.g. monthly payment, interest rate) as this will allow you to quickly visualize how changes will affect each other over the life of the loan.
You can also try an online amortization calculator.

, This calculation requires several steps. You need to convert the interest rate to a monthly amount. The monthly rate is used to compute interest for the month. Loans that amortize, such as your home mortgage or car loan, require a monthly payment. As a result, you need to compute the interest and principal portion of each payment on a monthly basis.
Convert the interest rate to a monthly rate. That amount is: (6% divided by 12 = 0.005 monthly rate).
Multiply the principal amount by the monthly interest rate: ($100,000 principal multiplied by 0.005 = $500 month’s interest).
You can use the equation: I=P*r*t, where I=Interest, P=principal, r=rate, and t=time.

, Subtract the interest for the month from the payment to compute the principal payment amount.Subtract the month’s interest from the payment amount to calculate the principal payment: ($599.55 payment - $500 interest = $99.55 principal payment).
As more principal is repaid, the interest due on your principal balance each month will decline. A larger portion of each monthly payment will go toward principal repayment.

, Each time you calculate amortization, you subtract the principal amount repaid in the prior month.Calculate the principal amount for month two: ($100,000 principal - $99.55 principal payment = $99,900.45).
Compute the interest for month two: ($99,900.45 principal X 0.005 = $499.50).

, Just as you did in month one, your interest for the month is subtracted from the total monthly loan payment. The remaining amount is your principal repayment for the month.Calculate the principal payment in month two: ($599.55 - $499.50 = $100.05).
The principal repayment in month two ($100.05) is larger than month one ($99.55). Since the total principal balance declines each month, you pay less interest in the balance. In month one the interest was $500. In month two, the interest was only $499.50.
As the required interest payment declines, the portion of the payment that goes toward principal increases.

, You can see that the loan’s principal is reduced each month. Because the principal amount declines, the interest computed on the lower principal amount also goes down. Over time, a growing amount of each monthly payment goes toward principal.Calculate the new principal balance for month three’s interest calculation: ($99,900.45 - $100.05 = $99,800.40).
Compute interest for month three: ($99,800.40 X 0.005 monthly interest = $499).
Calculate the principal payment in month three: ($599.55 monthly payment - $499 interest in month three = $100.55).

, You’ll see that, over time, the amount of interest charged each month declines. The principal portion of each payment increases over time.Interest payments decline to nearly zero. In the last month of the loan’s term, the interest payment is $2.98.
By the last period of the term, the principal portion of the payment ($596.37) is close to the entire payment amount.
The principal amount still owed is $0 at the end of the term.

, Since your mortgage loan and many car loans use amortization, you need to understand this concept. You can use your knowledge of amortization to manage your personal debts.Whenever possible, make extra payments to reduce the principal amount of your loan faster. The faster you’re able to reduce principal, the less total interest you will pay over the term of the loan.
Consider the interest rate on the debts you have outstanding. Your extra payment will have the biggest impact on the loan with the highest interest rate. You want to reduce the principal amount for the debt with the highest interest rate.
You can find loan amortization calculators on the Internet. Use a calculator to compute the interest you will save if you make extra payments. Say, for example, that your extra payment reduces your principal from $10,000 to $9,900.
Use the $10,000 figure and calculate your amortization over the remaining term of the note. Change the principal from $10,000 to $9,900 and run the calculation again. Take a look at the total interest paid over the life of the loan. You’ll see a difference, based on the extra $100 principal payment

Click on cell A1 and then on the formula bar located above the column names.",How to Calculate Implicit Interest Rate2," This includes the number of periods such as months, total amount borrowed, monthly payment, and total number of years. You can find this information in your loan agreement., Common spreadsheet programs include Microsoft Excel and iWork Numbers. You will be entering the data from Step 1 into a formula bar on the spreadsheet., If you are taking out a $300,000 real estate mortgage with monthly payments of $2,000 for 30 years, enter this function formula in the formula bar: =RATE(30*12,-2000,300000). Then hit return.The function calculates the value at .59%, which is a monthly interest rate. To annualize this monthly rate, multiply it by 12, and you get an implicit annual interest rate of 7.0203%."

Determine implicit interest for leases.,
Determine implicit interest for bond purchases.,
Calculate implicit interest before borrowing or leasing.",How to Calculate Implicit Interest Rate3," Many times business owners lease rather than purchase equipment. While lenders do not have to charge an explicit rate in a lease agreement in the U.S., finance firms making the loan are required to calculate the cost of borrowing for you.


For example, a food products company needs to lease a large pasteurizing machine. They decide to lease rather than purchase it. If the total cost of the lease is $1,000 and the company makes 12 payments of $100 per month, then the lease agreement has an implicit interest rate of 20%.

, When purchasing bonds, an implicit interest rate is the difference between the current yield (dividend) paid on a bond and the rate that the bondholder will receive at a fixed point in the future. The implicit rate may change from the rate stated in the bond contract at the time of purchase, since bonds can rise or fall in value during the bond term.


For example, you purchase bonds with a promised dividend of $5.00 per share to be paid in one year. Due to fluctuations in the marketplace, you receive $10.00 per share on the one-year due date. The implicit interest rate earned is 50%.

, If there is not an explicit interest stated, you should always calculate the implied interest rate before signing a lease or taking out a loan. This rate will determine your total financing expense. Do not rely only on monthly payment amounts or short-term yields on bonds before making financing decisions.

To find this information, either consult your loan agreement or estimate this information as best you can. Remember, you can always change this information to multiple different values to estimate payments on different loans.


You'll need the following information: your annual interest rate, the duration of your loan in years, your loan amount, and your balloon payment amount.

, Start by opening Excel on your computer. Then, open a new, blank workbook and begin your work on the worksheet that comes up.

, In the first column, column A, enter the names for the variables you will be using. It's easiest if you enter them as follows, from top to bottom: your annual interest rate, the duration of your loan in years, your loan amount, and your balloon payment amount.


If entered correctly, this information will be in cells A1 through A4.

, Type your loan information into the appropriately-labeled spaces next to your variable names. If entered correctly, they should be entered as follows:


Your annual interest rate, for example 4%, should be entered in cell B1. Be sure to include the percent sign.
Your loan duration, for example 15 years, should be entered in cell B2 as a simple number. In this case, you would just enter 15.
Your loan amount, also called the principal, should be entered into cell B3. For example, for a loan amount of $150,000, you would enter 150,000. Excel will assume this is an amount of money; no need to enter the dollar sign.
Enter your balloon amount into cell B4. This should be a negative number, as it is a payment. For example, for a $27,000 balloon payment, you would enter -27,000.

, The function that will be used here in the payment function, abbreviated by Excel as PMT. To enter this equation, find a nearby empty cell and type ""=PMT("". The program will then prompt you for variables like this: =PMT(rate, nper, pv, , )., Additional changes will have to be made to your entered variables within the PMT function. When prompted, enter the variables as follows:


For the ""rate"" prompt, you'll need your periodic rate instead of your annual rate. This means dividing your annual rate in cell B1 by the number of payments per year on your loan. For monthly payments, divide by 12, for quarterly payments by 4, and for semi-annual payments by 2. Enter a comma to move to the next variable.

Assuming monthly payments, your equation should now look like this: =PMT(B1/12


For the ""nper"" prompt, enter your loan duration in cell B2. However, like the rate prompt, this will need to be adjusted to the total number of payments. For monthly payments, multiply by 12, for quarterly by 4, and for semi-annual by 2. Enter a comma to move to the next variable.

Assuming monthly payments, your equation should now look like this: =PMT(B1/12,B2*12,


Enter your last two variables, in B3 and B4, for the ""pv"" and """" prompts, respectively. Be sure to enter a comma after B3. Then, close the equation with a closing parenthesis mark.

Your finished equation should look like this: =PMT(B1/12,B2*12,B3,B4), Press enter. Your result should be displayed in the cell where you entered your equation. It will be a red, negative number. Again, this simply means that this a payment. If it is not a negative number, you've entered some information incorrectly or your loan is not a balloon payment loan.


In the example, the program would return a monthly payment of $999.82.

, If you are comparing multiple loans, save this payment figure elsewhere in the worksheet and enter information from your other loans. This will allow you to compare payments from different loan amounts, interest rates, durations, or balloon payments.

Make a list of your debts.,
Check your credit history.,
Research consolidation loans.,
Assess your priorities.,
Apply for the loan.,
Pay off your smaller loans.,
Consider other options.",How to Consolidate Loans1," You can’t choose a good course of action until you know how much you owe. Find all of the debts you want to consolidate and create a list with the following information:


The amount due.
Your monthly payment.
The interest rate on the loan.
Whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Secured loans are tied to an asset, e.g., your car acts as security for the car loan.;
, Lenders will only make loans if they are confident you can pay them back. Pull a free copy of your credit report and a copy of your credit score. Generally, you’ll need a solid credit score (in the mid-600s) to get a personal consolidation loan.Your score might be hurt by errors in your credit report. Check it thoroughly and dispute any wrong information. For example, there might be accounts listed that don’t belong to you, or accounts might be inaccurately listed as in default.
If your score is low, wait to consolidate. You can pay down debt and improve your credit score first.

, Many lenders offer these loans. In fact, you probably get offers in the mail. You can ask your bank or credit union for a personal consolidation loan. You might also approach online lenders. Consider the following:


Don’t use a secured loan to consolidate unsecured loans. For example, a lender might say, “Sure, we’ll give you a $20,000 consolidation loan, but we want you to put your home up as collateral.” If you default on a secured loan, the lender can take the collateral.Pay attention to both interest rates and the term (length) of the repayment period. Don’t focus only on the monthly payment.
Research online lenders closely. They should have a physical address listed on their website and use encryption when you submit information. Check with the Better Business Bureau if there have been complaints., Loan consolidation can save you money in two ways—it might lower your monthly payment or it might lower the total amount you end up paying back. Some loans will do both, but some will do only one or the other.


For example, you might find a consolidation loan that will cut your monthly payments in half. It does this by stretching out the repayment period to 20 years. You’ll end up paying more over the life of the loan.
In some situations, however, you might be focused only on cutting your monthly payment. For example, you might have lost your job. In this situation, a lower monthly payment will give you some breathing room, and you can refinance the consolidation loan later.

, Contact the lender and provide all required paperwork. You’ll have to provide a bunch of information, such as personal identification, proof of income, and your employer information., After you’ve been approved, the lender will probably send you a check. Don’t go shopping! You need to use these funds to pay off your smaller loans. Pay them off in a timely manner and then commit to paying back your consolidation loan., Loan consolidation might be unnecessary or not the right choice for you. For example, if you’ve recently fallen on hard times, you might have other options. Consider the following:


You can call your creditors and ask that they let you skip a couple payments until you land on your feet. You’ll have to have a good reason, such as a job loss or illness. Also the lender wants to be sure your problems are temporary.
You can visit a credit counselor and set up a debt management plan. The counselor can negotiate with your creditors to reduce your interest rate and waive late fees and penalties. You make one payment to the credit counselor, who distributes your payments to each creditor."

Evaluate the impact of extra payments.",How to Amortize a Loan," When you borrow money from a bank or other lender to make a large purchase such as a house or a new car, you borrow a specific total amount. This amount will be listed on your loan documents.As an example, assume you are borrowing $150,000 to buy a house, or $30,000 to buy a car.;
, Your loan term is the length of time you'll be paying back your loan. For mortgages, the term typically is 30 years, although terms anywhere between 15 and 40 years are not uncommon. For vehicle purchases, loan terms typically run anywhere from 3 to 6 years.Keep in mind that although loan terms usually are discussed in terms of years, they are calculated in months. For example, if you had a 30-year mortgage, your loan term would be 360 months. For a 5-year vehicle loan, the loan term would be 60 months.

, The interest on a loan is the amount it costs you to borrow the money, expressed as a percentage of the borrowed amount. The interest rate you are offered will depend on your credit history, the type of loan, and the amount of money you're borrowing.In most cases, your interest rate will not change once the loan term starts. However, it may increase after a few years if you've taken out an adjustable-rate loan.
Generally, you'll have either simple interest or compound interest. With simple interest, the interest is calculated solely on the outstanding principal amount. However, with compound interest, the interest rate is applied to both the outstanding principal and the outstanding interest owed.
For the purposes of the examples, assume the interest rate on the 30-year home mortgage is a fixed rate of 4.5 percent, while the interest rate on the car loan is 5.25 percent.

, The total repayment consists of how much it will cost you to pay back your loan over the full loan term, including principal, interest, and any fees. The total repayment figure assumes that you make all payments on time.Keep in mind that your annual interest rate does not reflect the cost of origination or other fees that your lender may charge to service your loan. However, your loan documents may include a figure described as the ""effective APR."" This amount is the annual interest rate plus any fees.
While traditional lenders are required by law to disclose the APR to you, lenders outside the traditional sphere are not. If you're using an alternative lender, make sure you total all the fees and find the APR. You can use APR calculators online for this purpose.

, While amortization math is fairly complex, you should at least get a handle on it so you understand how the calculations work. However, you don't have to do every calculation by hand – you can use an online calculator.To start, you'll need the following figures: the initial principal or amount of the loan, the interest rate per period, and the total number of payments or periods.
Add one (1) to the interest rate to period, then raise this sum to the power of the total number of payments or periods. Multiply this figure by the interest rate per period, and place this number on the top of a division symbol.
On the bottom of the division symbol, take the figure you got when you added one (1) to the interest rate and raised it to the power of the number of payments, then subtract one (1).
Complete the division and multiply that amount by the initial principal to find the payment amount per period.

, There are many independent financial websites that have amortization calculators available. Banks and other lenders also often have these calculators available on their sites.If your lender has a calculator available on its website, you may want to use that one as opposed to one offered elsewhere. Not that there's going to be much, if any, difference in the calculation, but using your lender's calculator gives you a little more ground to stand on if you find a difference between the monthly payment you calculated and the one your lender calculated.

, Online financial calculators provide spaces for you to enter the total amount of the loan, the term of the loan, and the annual interest rate. There also may be places for you to describe the type of interest or enter any fees., Once you've provided the necessary information about your loan, the calculator will provide you with the amount of your monthly payments so you don't have to do all that math by hand.Keep in mind that amount you calculate may be different from your actual monthly payment if your lender charges fees that you left out of the calculations.
For example, if you have a $150,000 mortgage with an annual interest rate of 4.5 percent and a loan term of 360 months (30 years), your monthly payment would be $842.50. If you have a car loan for $30,000 with an annual interest rate of 5.25 percent and a loan term of 60 months (5 years), your monthly payment would be $569.58.

, An amortization schedule will help you understand your monthly payments and fit them into your budget. The benefit of creating your own spreadsheet is that you can save it on your own computer and print it out, which you can't do with the online calculators.Most basic spreadsheet apps have amortization table templates built in. You also may be able to find a template for the spreadsheet app you use and download it for free online.
Using a template will save you from having to enter the amortization formula manually.

, Your spreadsheet will have a separate line or row for each payment over the life of the loan. You may want to organize your spreadsheet so that the first half of the payments are on one side of the page and the other half run down the other side of the page, so you can see the whole table at a glance., The first column of your spreadsheet typically should be the date each payment will be made. Work with your spreadsheet functions to see if you can get these dates to auto-populate based on a formula rather than having to input each one manually., The two columns that provide the amount of each payment that goes to principal and the amount that goes to interest will be the most useful columns for you in comparing different loans or understanding how your loan is amortized.In the beginning, you'll notice that more of your payment goes to interest than to principal. This is because interest is being computed on a larger amount of principal initially. As you pay down the principal, the interest you pay gradually decreases as well and more of your payment goes to principal.
If you aren't using a specifically designed amortization table spreadsheet, you'll have to enter the code yourself for the amortization formula so that your spreadsheet will auto-populate these columns and you don't have to calculate each amount by hand.
You may want to add an additional column for the interest rate. If you have a fixed-rate loan, you may feel this column is unnecessary, but it could be useful if you have an adjustable-rate loan.

, Unless you have an adjustable-rate loan, your monthly payments aren't going to change, so you can easily fill in the payments column using cut and paste.Your overall balance typically should be the last column on the spreadsheet. Use the formula function to fill in the data for this column, showing the balance decline by the amount of each monthly payment.
You also may want to include a column that shows how the principal balance (rather than the total payoff amount) is declining over time. To populate this column, create a formula that subtracts the amount of each payment applied to principal from the total remaining principal after each payment.

, If you have a fixed-rate loan, your amortization schedule will determine the amount of each monthly payment. This amount won't change unless you are late with a payment, at which point your lender will charge you late fees and other penalties.Some lenders reserve the right to increase the interest rate if you are late on multiple payments, which could affect the amount of your monthly payment.
Keep in mind that if you are late on a mortgage payment, you typically must continue to pay fees and penalties until your mortgage is brought current. This means if you skip one month's payment and then make the regular monthly payment the next month, you'll be charged for two months of late fees.

, In many cases, you can make extra payments each month and these will be applied entirely to the principal of your loan. Making extra payments, whether regularly or sporadically, can help reduce the amount of interest you have to pay. You'll also pay off your loan faster.With an amortization schedule you can create an extra column for extra payments. Enter extra payments to see how it changes the amount of your monthly payments that go to principal and interest over time, and how much sooner you can pay your loan off.

Check if you qualify for a balance transfer card.,
Avoid transferring large amounts.,
Complete the balance transfer.,
Pay your bills on time.",How to Consolidate Loans2," Many credit cards offer a low APR for 12-18 months if you transfer a balance onto them. Generally, you need good credit to qualify—often a credit score over 700. When you transfer, you might pay only a small transfer fee, around 4% of the amount transferred.You can find offers for balance transfer cards online. Visit websites such as NerdWallet or Credit.com to compare offers.
You might already have a balance transfer card. Check your statements.

, You’ll only come out ahead if you can pay off your debts before the 0% APR period ends. If you can’t, then the interest rate will zoom up, often over 15%, which will cost you a lot of money.

The interest rate on a personal loan will be lower than 15%, so avoid using a balance transfer unless you can pay everything off early., Transferring is easy. You simply tell the credit card company the account you want transferred and the amount. The amount should show up on your next statement., The 0% APR is only good if you make monthly payments in full and on time. If you don’t, then you’ll lose the introductory rate and probably pay penalties and fees on top of it.Set payment reminders, if necessary. For example, many credit card companies will send a text or an email reminder.


You’ll have an easier time paying your bills if you create a budget and stop spending. Some people see that their monthly payments are low, so they spend even more. Avoid this."

List your student loans.,
Identify your goals.,
Find private lenders.,
Ask questions.,
Apply.,
Consider other options.",How to Consolidate Loans3," Gather all of your monthly loan statements and create a list with the following information:


The lender.
The amount you owe.
Your monthly payment.
The length of the repayment period.
Whether the loan is federal or private.

, People consolidate their student loans for different reasons, and the reason matters for purposes of how you consolidate. Consider the following:


You want to consolidate because you are overwhelmed with paperwork. In this situation, you can consolidate some loans through the Department of Education. You won’t lower your interest rate at all. Instead, the new consolidated loan will be a weighted average of the interest rates on all of your loans.You want a lower interest rate. You’ll need to pursue consolidation with a private lender. A lower interest rate will decrease the amount you pay each month. It will also reduce the amount you pay back over the life of the loan (unless the term of the loan is longer).
You want a lower monthly payment. Generally, you should consolidate with private lenders. However, if you consolidate with the Department of Education, you can seek income-driven repayment plans or extend the repayment period, both of which will lower your monthly payment.

, Some of the more popular lenders include SoFi, CommonBond, and Citizens Bank.Typically, you’ll need a credit score in the mid-600s, so pull your credit score.Check the interest rates offered by each lender. Fixed rates range between 2-9%. Variable rates might be initially lower, but they can zoom up in the future.

, There are many people who can help you decide which consolidation path is right for you. Talk to your current lender and discuss your options. Consider asking the following questions:


“Are all of my loans eligible for consolidation?” Most federal loans can be consolidated with the Department of Education. However, private lenders set their own rules.
“If I consolidate my loans with the Department of Education, do I lose anything?” For example, you might lose any credit you have earned if your loans are currently on an income-driven repayment plan.“Can I consolidate if my loans are currently in default?”

, Gather your student loan information. If you are applying for a private loan, you’ll need information about your financial history: job history, current income, educational background, etc.To consolidate with the Department of Education, go to www.studentloans.gov and use your Federal Student Aid ID to log in. You’ll pick which loans to consolidate and choose a servicer. You’ll also pick a repayment plan, which can run from 10-30 years, but income-driven plans are available also.
To apply with a private lender, you should submit information about your financial background and your student loans. They will make a decision based on this information and your credit history., Your financial difficulties might be temporary. If so, consider different options that will give you some breathing room. There’s no reason to consolidate if you don’t need to.


You might seek deferment or forbearance, which will allow you to suspend payments on federal loans for a period of time. Contact your lender.
You might also qualify for income-driven repayment plans on federal loans. Although you can choose these plans after you consolidate, you can also choose them without consolidating. On these plans, you might only pay 1-2% of your disposable income. As your income increases, you can pay more.

Find numbers that are meaningful to you.,
Use bizarre imagery.,
Make a mnemonic.,
Create a story.,
Connect numbers to people you know.,
Practice repetition and mapping.",How to Remember Your PIN at the Checkout1," If you have the option of creating your PIN, this is perhaps the easiest and most common means of recalling it. Find a set of numbers that have some kind of significance to you and will, therefore, be easy to remember. These numbers can be important dates, the numbers of your favorite athletes, an old phone number, etc... Be sure to avoid using numbers that will be easy for a criminal to obtain, like your birthday or the last four digits of your phone number. Make it a number that you’ll remember but that is obscure enough to not be evident to a criminal.
If you are 18 and your favorite grandparent is 90, you might use 1890.;
, This technique uses strange or funny visuals that will help you remember your PIN. Try to find an association between certain numbers in your PIN. These can be associations with individual numbers or groups of them. Try to create an association that will be particularly absurd or strange and, therefore, easier to recall.For example, if you want to remember 0285, think of a two-year-old whose best friend is 85.

, Use the first letter of each number in your PIN to create a mnemonic device for recalling your PIN. Mnemonics are excellent devices for remembering various kinds of information. Simply take the first letter, find a word that starts with that letter, and create a mnemonic that will stick with you. For example, 2275 is “two, two, seven, five.” Take the first letter of each number, which is TTSF, and create a sentence, like Two Toads Smell Funky.
You can also use the first syllable of each number to create your mnemonic. This may help you create a stronger mental association.

, This method is similar to the bizarre imagery but can be more detailed. You should think of a backstory for your number that either explains it entirely or parts of it. Is your number the secret code name of a secret agent or the birthdates of two star-crossed lovers? Develop a rich background for your number. For example, if your PIN is 2333, think of Michael Jordan playing one-on-one against his teammate Scotty Pippen. Their numbers were 23 and 33 when they played together on the Chicago Bulls.

, Associating your PIN with important people in your life is an easy way to ensure that you remember your number. Find numbers that are connected to the people that you care about.For example, your grandmother was born in 1922 and your mother in 1975, so your number will be 2275.

, Practice the movements you make while entering your PIN to sharpen your muscle memory. Through repetition, your brain will remember the movements you make when you enter the number. With enough practice, you should be able to enter your number without even thinking of it. Your body will guide you to the right numbers. Because it is unlikely that you will want to spend hours practicing your movements are your local ATM, this method may be the least practical.

Complete the closing paperwork.",How to Apply for a Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan," An essential employee is someone whose managerial or technical expertise is crucial for your business to function on a day-to-day basis.This person doesn't necessarily have to be an owner of the business. They could be your general manager or hold some other title.
The person must receive orders that they are being called into active duty during a period of military conflict.
The period of military conflict may include an actual declared war, a national emergency declared by congress or the president, or any other military operation such as peacekeeping operations.;
, The SBA's MREIDL should be considered a last resort. If you can get a loan from a commercial lender to cover your need, you aren't considered eligible for the loan.While there's no requirement that you actively seek out loans from private sources, keep in mind that the SBA will evaluate whether you have other financing options available.
If you do have other options available that would meet your need, the SBA may determine you aren't eligible for the MREIDL.
For this reason, it's a good idea to do what you can to make sure that you don't have any other way to cover the financial shortfall you will experience as a result of the loss of your essential employee when they are called up to active duty.

, You must analyze your business's expenses to determine what portion of your operating expenses can't be met as a result of the military reservist being called up into active duty.When you apply for the MREIDL, you will have to submit financial documents, including profit and loss statements and detailed lists of your business's expenses and liabilities.
Keep in mind that the MREIDL is not designed to make up for profit loss. The SBA will analyze your business's financial records to determine what economic injury you will suffer.
If your loss of the essential employee will cause a loss in profits, but not to such an extent that you cannot pay your business's debts and basic operating expenses, the SBA typically will determine that you don't need an MREIDL.
The purpose of an MREIDL essentially is to keep your business on ""pause"" until the essential employee returns. If the SBA determines you're eligible, you'll get funds to cover necessary obligations, but not to refinance or consolidate debts or expand your business.

, You cannot apply for an MREIDL until the military reservist gets notice that they are being called up. From that date, you can apply for the loan anytime while they are on active duty or up to a year after they've been discharged.While you become eligible to file an application from the date of the notice, you should keep in mind that if your application is approved, funds won't be disbursed until the essential employee actually leaves for active duty.
Because the MREIDL is considered a last-resort option, and because you'll have to do quite a bit of financial forecasting to determine your need, in many situations it may be best to wait until the person leaves and see what happens.
If you apply for an MREIDL soon after the essential employee leaves, and the SBA declines your application, you typically have the option of reapplying later. A second application may be a sound option if the reasons for the SBA's denial are later eliminated.

, When you apply for the loan, the SBA will check your credit and the credit of your business. While the SBA doesn't publish a certain minimum credit score that is required, the administration must have reasonable assurance that you can and will repay the loan.Credit-worthiness may be tied to your ability to get funding from other sources. If you have a high credit score, there typically is a greater chance that the SBA will decide you don't need an MREIDL because you could get adequate funding elsewhere.
Regardless, you want to have a good idea of what's in your business's credit report before you apply for a loan of any significance, including an MREIDL.
Keep in mind that business credit reports work differently than personal credit reports, and your business may not have many entries even though it has years of credit history, because information is submitted voluntarily.
You also don't have the right to a free copy of your business credit report, as you do with a personal credit report. You must contact the reporting agencies directly, and typically have to pay a fee to get a copy.

, Federal law requires collateral for all loans over $50,000. Having collateral you can pledge does not increase the chances your loan will be approved. Likewise, the SBA won't decline a loan solely for lack of collateral.The SBA will accept real estate as collateral if your business owns property and has any equity in it.
Collateral also may include other business assets such as motor vehicles, office equipment, or fixtures.
Keep in mind that while the SBA won't decline your application, the amount of collateral you have available may impact the amount of money the SBA lends you.

, While you can complete a loan application online and submit it electronically, you may want to download a paper form before you start so you can find out what information you will need.The paper form includes government privacy disclosures as well as filing instructions that may benefit you. Use the instructions as a checklist to ensure you've prepared all the required documents to submit in your application package.
The SBA gives you the option of applying online and submitting all of your information electronically.
You also can fill out and mail paper forms, but keep in mind if you decide to go this route that the processing time may be considerably delayed. Not only do you have to factor in mailing time, but paper documents are more difficult to share among those reviewing your application.

, There are a number of documents that you must copy or prepare to submit along with your application, including financial statements, forecasts or estimates of the economic injury caused by the call-up of your essential employee who is a military reservist.If you have difficulty completing the financial estimates required for the loan, you may want to consult an accountant for assistance in preparing these statements.
You must include a copy of the notice received by the essential employee calling them up to active duty.
You also need two written statements – one from you as the business owner and one from the military reservist who has been called up to active duty – stating that this person is essential to the day-to-day operations of the business.
Along with business income and loss statements, you must include a written explanation of how this essential employee's call up to active duty will cause substantial economic injury to the business, along with an estimate of the injury your business will experience. #Complete your loan application. The application itself requires you to provide the SBA with information about your business, including names and contact information for all owners of your business, and to describe the economic injury that you face., All MREIDL applications must be accompanied by complete copies, including all schedules, of the most recent federal income tax returns for the business.If you don't have a copy of your most recent tax return, you must explain to the SBA why it isn't available.
Additionally, the SBA requires you to complete IRS Form 4506-T, Disaster Request for Transcript Return, and submit it along with your application and other documents.
If you download Form 4506-T from the SBA's website, it's partially filled out to identify the years of the transcripts you're requesting and where those transcripts must be sent.
The only part you have to complete is the name, address, and EIN of your business. Then you can sign and date the form.

, If you're completing your application online, you will be prompted to attach other forms or information not included in the application. If you want to file a paper application, you should follow the filing instructions that accompany the application form.Make at least one copy of every document you submit to the SBA for your records, and keep them all together with copies of any emails or other correspondence you receive from the SBA regarding your loan request.
If you have any questions or concerns about your application package, you can contact the SBA's customer service center at 1-800-659-2955, or by email at disastercustomerservice@sba.gov.
Customer service cannot advise you on how best to complete your application documents, but they can answer questions about the type of information you'll need to complete the forms.

, After the SBA reviews your paperwork and assesses the needs of your business, it will send you written notification of whether your request was approved or denied.The SBA typically makes a decision on MREIDL applications within 7 to 21 days of the date the application is received.
If the SBA declines to issue you a loan, your notice will include the reasons for the SBA's denial.
If your loan was approved, your notification will include details about the amount and term of the loan.
The interest rate for all MREIDL loans is 4 percent. The maximum term of the loan is 30 years, but the SBA will set the term of your loan based on its analysis of your financial projections and your ability to repay.

, If you are approved for an MREIDL, you must maintain adequate insurance, including insurance of all collateral you have pledged to secure your loan. This may require getting additional insurance for the life of the loan.The SBA requires you to maintain hazard insurance on any collateral. This insurance is required for the protection of both you and the SBA.
Your approval document will describe the amount of insurance you must have, and the required deductibles.
If the property is located in a flood hazard area, you also must purchase flood insurance for the full insurable value of the property.

, When your loan is approved, the SBA will let you know what additional documents it must receive before funds can be disbursed. If the military reservist has already left for active duty, you may get your money as soon as all documents are received.Once the SBA receives the additional documents requested, which may include proof of insurance on collateral property, your loan funds are ready for disbursal.
If you applied for your loan when the military reservist received notice that they were being called up, but they haven't left yet, the SBA won't disburse your funds until they actually begin active duty.

Credit reporting is governed by laws and by the regulations of companies that participate in the credit system. Because of this, there are a number of things you’ll be able to do, but there are also things you can’t legally do.


You or someone working for you can’t remove accurate but negative information.
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you have the right to have inaccurate information removed from your credit history.
Also know that you have the same rights and abilities to repair your credit as “credit repair” companies.;
, There are a number of things that are legally not allowed to be included in your credit history. These banned items are a mix of factors that do not directly impact your credit worthiness and items that do reflect your history but are excluded because of law or common practice. If any of these items are on your credit report, you have the right to have them removed. Banned items include:


Medical information and medical history.
Chapter 11 bankruptcies older than 10 years.
Any debt that is more than seven years old.
Information about your marital status, sexual preference, race and ethnicity, or age., The first step in repairing or even understanding your credit report is to check it. Checking your credit report will help you keep tabs on new or suspicious items. You’ll also gain an understanding of how credit reporting works and you might also be able to track your credit score.


There are three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.
All three can all be checked once per year for free through AnnualCreditReport.com. AnnualCreditReport.com is the only source of free credit reports and is authorized by federal law.
Make sure to spend time checking over all three reports from all three agencies.
Each of the three above-mentioned reporting sites can have varying data on you. You need to know what each one says about your debts., After you’ve educated yourself and checked your credit report, you need to determine if you have the right to repair or fix your credit report. Most of the time, you have the right to repair your credit report (for free) if there is inaccurate or erroneous information on it. Consider:


If there are items due to identity theft or similar issues marring your report.
If a company has reported a debt that is inaccurate or untrue.
Any negative items that you incurred and are responsible for will be very difficult to remove. , Once you’ve identified the faulty information and the reporting agency responsible, you need to contact that credit reporting agency. That agency is responsible for removing inaccurate information at no charge to you. Consider:


The free credit report discussed above will include contact information.

Dispute the error and give the corrected information to the company if you have it available.
You should also get any duplicate entries removed. Negative duplicates can hurt your credit score by twice as much, if not more.
Send copies on any documents that support your claim.
Use a sample letter from the Federal Trade Commission to help you craft your own letter. See it at: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0058-credit-repair-how-help-yourself

The credit reporting agency is bound by law to investigate your claim and to report back to you within 30 days., If the agency’s investigation does not resolve your issue, you should request that they include your letter of dispute in your credit report. This way, anyone pulling your credit report will also receive a copy of your letter and be able to read your side of the story. While this might help in some circumstances, it might not help in others. You can also ask that (at your expense) the agency forwards a copy of the letter to anyone who recently pulled your credit report., After your initial actions have failed, you need to file a formal written dispute with the credit agency. Your formal dispute will list all of the information you believe to be inaccurate. Your dispute, as well as your letter of dispute, will be included in all future reports., Beware of anyone offering to help you repair your credit for a fee. Ads such as this are often illegal; or, at the very least, they will not help you as much as they claim.


You have the ability (for free) to do anything a company might legally do to repair your credit.
The Credit Repair Organization Act says that it is illegal for a company to misrepresent their abilities. If a company charges you a fee and doesn’t make good on its promises, you can sue them and seek punitive damages.
Contact the Federal Trade Commission at 1-877-FTC-HELP if you feel you’ve been taken advantage of by a credit repair company., When negative information is accurate, often the only recourse you have is to wait for those items to disappear on their own. Unfortunately, time might be the only recourse you have to repair your credit report.


Bankruptcy information disappears after ten years.
Unpaid judgements against you disappear after seven years.
Information regarding criminal offenses does not disappear.

, One of the best ways to repair your credit is to apply for new credit and make sure you honor your obligations in full. Over time, your credit will improve and people who pull your credit report will be able to see that you honor your debts and are potentially a trustworthy person to lend to. Make sure to:



Get a secured credit card if you can’t get a non-secured one. Secured credit cards are ones where your credit limit is tied or secured by an amount of money deposited in a savings or checking account.
Pay your debts on time and quickly.
Do not overextend your credit. Only borrow and spend what you can pay off on a monthly basis.

, One tactic to improve your credit and the way your credit report looks to others is to lower your debt to income ratio. A debt to income ratio speaks volumes about your monthly debt obligations to your monthly income. The lower your debt to income ratio, the better. To lower your debt to income ratio:


Pay off debt as quickly as you can.
Avoid taking on new debts.
Try to increase your income."

The report will detail a consumer's instances of unpaid fees, bounced checks, and instances of suspected fraud, as well as a list of credit inquiries, check orders, and credit freezes.Consumers can request a report from the company by going to the ChexSystems website at https://www.consumerdebit.com/consumerinfo/us/en/chexsystems/report/index.htm and filling out the necessary identifying information, including the consumer's full name, address, and social security number, and submitting that information through the website.
ChexSystems will respond to requests for a consumer report within five business days.Only the consumer himself or herself may request a consumer report.Not everyone is on the ChexSystems list. If you request a copy of your report and you are not on the ChexSystems list, you will receive a blank report.;
, Consumers can order a ChexSystems report via mail by printing and filling out the downloadable form at https://www.consumerdebit.com/consumerinfo/us/en/Printable%20Order%20Form.pdf. Consumers should then mail the completed form to Chex Systems.


Address the envelope to ""Chex Systems, Inc., Attn: Consumer Relations"".
The address for ChexSystems is 7805 Hudson Road, Suite 100, Woodbury, MN 55125ChexSystems will mail out a consumer report within five business days from the time the initial request is received., Consumers can request a ChexSystems report over the phone by calling 1-800-428-9623. Callers will then verify personal information through ChexSystem's voice messaging system., In addition to phone, standard mail, and online requests, ChexSystems also offers a fax option.


Consumers will have to fill out the same offline request form required for standard mail requests, available on the ChexSystems website.
Consumers should then fax the completed request form to (602) 659-2197., There are a number of reasons why certain items contained in your report may be inaccurate. You will need to address these issues immediately if you suspect that your report is incorrect.


Victims of fraud or identity theft may have an inaccurate report due to spending activities of the fraudulent party.Occasionally banks make mistakes when compiling credit information. It's possible a consumer's bank has not yet updated the status of a previously delinquent account, or reported the wrong date of an account delinquency., Consumers who wish to dispute an error in a ChexSystems report may initiate that dispute with either ChexSystems or the bank that provided ChexSystems with that information. Because consumers may initiate disputes with both ChexSystems and the bank, it may expedite the dispute process by filing a dispute with both institutions.Highlight or circle the account listing that you believe is inaccurate or incorrect. Then make a photocopy of your report, keeping the original for your own records., This can be addressed to the bank, to ChexSystems, or to both institutions. The letter should state in as professional a manner as possible what the discrepancies are, itemizing all of the suspected errors in your report. Request validation of your information and the removal or correction of the disputed items in your report.Send your request for validation letter with a photocopy of your report (having highlighted the inaccuracy you wish to dispute) to the bank and/or to ChexSystems.If you are sending a request for validation to ChexSystems, you will also need to fill out a Consumer Request for Reinvestigation form, available online at https://www.consumerdebit.com/consumerinfo/us/en/chexsystems/disputeform.pdf.

, Every form, letter, or complaint you send to either your bank or to ChexSystems should be sent by certified mail with a request for a return receipt. This will provide you with documentation that the requests were received by the appropriate party or parties on a given date, should either fail to respond in a timely manner.ChexSystems and your bank must respond to your request within 30 days (21 days in the state of Maine). If either institution fails to respond to your request in the required time frame, the item(s) under dispute must be removed from your record. This is mandated by law.Once the allotted time has passed, you may proceed to sending a Demand for Removal letter. A sample letter can be found online.

, If the disputed item was confirmed by either the bank or ChexSystems as an error but has not been deleted from your record, you may then send a Procedural Request letter to either institution, requesting detailed information as to why the information has not been removed and asking for the name and contact information of each source of disputed information. Each institution then has 15 days to complete the re-investigation  and supply you with the requested information, or they could face investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and other legal action.A sample Procedural Request letter can be found online at http://wallethub.com/edu/chexsystems-removal/12781/#procedural-request.

, If either institution continues to ignore your requests for removal of the false/disputed information, you may then file a formal complaint with a regulator, such as the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), your State Attorney General's Office, your State Banking Commission, or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may also file a lawsuit in small claims court against the appropriate institution., If you were unsuccessful in getting a disputed item removed from your file, you can request to add your own statement to your file. This will allow any financial institutions you attempt to do business with to see in their report on your credit that you disputed an item and that the institution(s) responsible failed to resolve the issue.Print and fill out the Request for Consumer Statement form from the ChexSystems website at https://www.consumerdebit.com/consumerinfo/us/en/chexsystems/cnsr_stmt_request.pdf.
Send the completed form to ChexSystems Consumer Relations at 7805 Hudson Rd., Ste. 100, Woodbury, MN 55125.Consumer statements must be fewer than 100 words, with the exception of Maine residents, who are permitted up to 200 words. All consumer statements must be free from profanity or explicit language.Consumer statements may not include the names of other persons or businesses and must refer specifically to the information contained in that consumer's file., If you closed out a checking account without first paying off any overdraft fees levied by the bank, you may have to pay that amount in its entirety back to the financial institution you previously conducted business with in order to remedy your financial situation.Obtain proof of payment from the bank or financial institution once you've paid off your debt.Request a written agreement from your bank to either delete your information from the ChexSystems database, or to update your account to reflect that the balance was paid in full.ChexSystems isn’t obligated to remove the report if it was originally accurate. However, the financial institution is required to update the report to reflect a “paid in full” or “settled in full” status., Many national and regional financial institutions offer special checking accounts to consumers who cannot open a standard bank account. These accounts are variously called second chance accounts or fresh start accounts. They are typically accompanied by monthly fees, and the financial institutions offering these accounts may require eligible consumers to undertake financial management classes in order to maintain an account.Some financial institutions will convert a second chance account into a standard checking account after a consistent period (such as 12 months) of financial responsibility.Every state in the US except New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont has a financial institution that offers some type of second chance checking account.Consumers in US states that do not offer second chance checking accounts may wish to try to open an account through one of the nationwide financial institutions that offer these accounts, such as Green Dot Bank and Wells Fargo., Anyone who owes unpaid fees on an overdrawn bank account, has had checks bounce, or has committed an act of fraud could be placed on the ChexSystems list., A negative ChexSystems score stays with the consumer for five years, unless the score is contested by the consumer and proven to be inaccurate. Though there are ways to open a checking account in spite of a poor credit score, many consumers cannot afford the substantial fees that come with a poor score checking account, and may end up being unable to open an account at all., Many consumers mistakenly believe that ChexSystems denied them from opening a bank account, when in fact it is the financial institution that a given consumer tried to do business with that accepts or declines their account. ChexSystems merely provides financial institutions with a consumer's credit score and financial history.ChexSystems is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, meaning federal guidelines are followed to ensure that any information in a consumer's file is accurate, and that the consumer's privacy is protected.However, mistakes do happen from time to time, which underscores the importance of discovering your ChexSystems file and taking the appropriate actions.Under federal guidelines, consumers are entitled to one free copy of the ChexSystems consumer report every 12 months.Be aware that the company primarily deals lists negative information. If you request a ChexSystems report and the file they send you is blank, that is generally a good thing."

Visit the website of each agency to receive a free copy of your credit report, or you can visit AnnualCreditReport.com to receive one free copy from each agency.You can also request a three in one credit report, but for a fee of $40.
You can still request your credit report if you have already used up your free reports for the year; however, you will have to pay a fee.;
, Errors on your credit report are information that should not be there. Common account-related errors are late payments that are more than seven years old (and therefore should no longer be on your report), a listed credit card or loan account that doesn’t belong to you, or an account that was closed by you but it is listed as closed by the provider.According to federal law, collection accounts can be reported for up to seven and a half years from the date you first fell behind, regardless if they are paid or unpaid.Collection accounts that are paid may still appear on your credit report for up to seven and a half years., Some common derogatory mark errors are paid collection accounts that are showing as unpaid, a paid tax lien that is more than seven years past your date of payment, creditor lawsuits, and an account that was discharged in bankruptcy but is mistakenly still showing up as active and with a balance., Common personal information errors include your name being listed wrong on the account, addresses listed that you never lived at or used as a mailing address, and inaccurate employer information.There are disputes that creditors do not have to investigate. These disputes are information that identifies you (name, date of birth, Social Security number, telephone number, or address); the identity of past or present employers; requests for a consumer report; information originating from public records (judgments, bankruptcies, liens); information related to active duty or fraud alerts; and information another creditor institution gave to the credit reporting agency., If the negative mark on your report was caused by unusual circumstances or temporary hardship, you may want to try writing a letter of goodwill, asking them to remove the mark. The letter should outline the personal hardship (for instance, if your spouse was seriously injured and you had to quit your job to care for them and fell behind in your payments). This letter should be polite (since you were, in fact, late on your payments) and concisely describe the issue and reason for missing your payment. Be honest and take responsibility for what happened, and request specifically that they remove this mark from your credit report.If you always made payments on time before and/or the period of hardship, point this out as well. You could write something like, ""Up until this unforeseen event, my credit history with you was spotless and I always paid on time. I realize I made a mistake in falling behind on my payments, and I am not proud, but I would be extremely grateful if you could remove the lateness or make an adjustment.""If he creditor has indicated an unwillingness to remove the negative report for goodwill, offer to pay for the debt in a lump sum upfront in order to get them to stop reporting the negative trade line.Debts satisfied through a bankruptcy should be removed as they have been technically satisfied. While the bankruptcy will remain on the credit report, the individual debts should be removed to avoid a double dip consequence.
Striking a deal with a creditor is rare, and even rarer with collection agencies. Most collection agencies will respond by stating that they are unable to remove negative information from your credit report.

, If you file a dispute with the credit bureau, you may do it either online, through the mail, or over the phone. You can go directly to the credit reporting agency’s website and file a dispute online; this is the most convenient method.However, if the credit bureau needs to contact the creditor to confirm and check the information you are disputing, there will most likely be a delay in getting the issue resolved. Your best option then is to file a dispute with the creditor directly.Provide specific information in regards to the error and evidence that proves it is a mistake. For instance, if you are shown to have made a late payment on a loan but your payment was on time, include a copy of your credit report with the error circled in red, then a copy (never the original) of documents that prove you paid on time. Request that the matter be investigated and removed from your report.

, If the negative mark on your credit was made in error (if you were not, for instance, late on your payment but it was reported as such), you can reach out to the creditor directly and ask them to correct this by providing the relevant evidence. The drawback of filing a dispute with the creditor directly is that they usually only accept disputes by mail. This means you will need to mail in a written letter.When writing your letter, focus on the relevant information and put the most important information in the beginning of the letter. If you are disputing multiple items, make that very clear in the beginning, as well.In your letter include: your full name and the account(s) you are referring to, what you are disputing and why, a copy of your credit report with the errors circled in red, and copies (never originals) of the original documents that prove that you paid an account on time, for example a credit card statement. Or, if the year you opened a loan is being reported incorrectly, include a copy of an original document that shows the correct year., You can file a dispute with both the credit reporting agency and the creditor to speed up the process. Send a written letter to both the agency and the creditor with all the important information and documents.Remember to keep the original documents for yourself and only send copies to the agencies and creditors.

, If either the creditor or credit bureau resolved the dispute, they must update their records. If the creditor resolved it, the creditor must notify the credit bureau about the change. Also, if you filed a dispute with the credit bureau, they must include a free copy of your updated credit report if it was changed.The credit bureau or creditor are required to investigate your dispute within 30 to 45 days of receiving the notification of the dispute; however, disputes are usually resolved within 14 days.

, You can also request that the credit bureau send notices of corrections made to your credit report to anyone who has received your report in the last six months, or in the last two years for employers.If your dispute was filed through a credit bureau and you disagree about the way the issue was resolved, you can add information about your dispute to your credit report. For example, write a statement summarizing what happened if the dispute did not go in your favor. This does not apply if you filed your dispute through the creditor., Reasons to file a complaint are: the dispute took too long, you were not treated well during the whole process, or there is still a valid error on your report that is hurting your credit. If this applies to you, you can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), your state’s Attorney General’s office, or your state’s Department of Consumer Affairs.In your complaint, explain in as much detail what happened and why you think you were treated unfairly.
The CFPB has an online option for you to file a complaint.

In the first situation you dispute something with a creditor such as a notation that you made late payments or were in default. By law, when you contact a creditor to dispute an item reported on your credit report, the creditor is required to update your account by showing it “in dispute."" However, once the disputed item has been investigated, the dispute notation should be removed from your credit report.



 


In the second situation you ""close"" (take out) a loan. The loan, however, is mistakenly reported as “Consumer Disputes this Account” instead of ""closed."" In either situation you have to reach out to the credit reporting agency (CRA) whose report contains the dispute and ask that it be removed.;
, If you were denied a loan because your report shows a dispute, you should first check with the lender to find out which report it used. It would be from one of the three main credit-reporting agencies in the U.S.: Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.

, You are entitled to one free report from each of the three CRAs each year.Check each report for any disputes.


To request a report online, visit annualcreditreport.com. This is the only site that offers truly free reports.
To request over the phone, call 1-877-322-8228.
To request by mail, send a letter to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. Instead of writing a letter, you may complete the Federal Trade Commission’s “Annual Credit Report Request Form,” which is available for download at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf., You should closely scrutinize each of the three credit reports. Look for any accounts that are listed as “disputed.” You will want to request that each dispute notation be removed.


If an account is listed as ""disputed"" on more than one credit report, you should contact each credit reporting agency whose report contains that notation.

, Getting a dispute removed should be fairly easy. However, you might need proof that the dispute has been resolved. Look through your papers and find any communication from a credit reporting agency informing you of the results of their investigation. You might need to remind the CRA of their own findings by showing them this document.

, To have TransUnion remove a dispute, you should call 800-916-8800 and ask that the dispute be removed. There should be no need to follow up with a letter.


Nevertheless, you should take note of whom you talk to. Write down the person’s name, and note the day and time of the conversation.

, To have a dispute removed from Equifax, you should send a letter to Equifax Consumer Services LLC, P.O. Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374-0256. Send the letter first class, and request a return receipt. In the letter you should include your name and address as well as a request to remove the notation of dispute. Also share with the CRA the proof that the investigation into the dispute was completed. Send copies of supporting documents. , Experian likes to remove disputes from their reports as soon as they are resolved. If you need to contact them directly, use the phone number provided with their credit report. To contact Experian online, visit www.experian.com.

, A CRA has 30 days to investigate a dispute and take action. If you have not heard back from the agency after this period, follow up with a phone call, and ask if there is anything else that you need to do.

, If you run into problems with the CRA, and the dispute is not removed, you may want to reach out to the creditor directly. The creditor can request that the information be removed from your credit report.

, You should call the creditor which reported the dispute and ask to have it taken off your report. Also ask for an address where you can send a confirming letter.

, You should follow up your phone call with a letter which will serve as physical evidence that you requested removal. A letter to the creditor should have the following information:


The name of the credit reporting agency whose report shows the dispute.
A request to remove the dispute notation on the report.
A copy of any communication you have already had with the CRA about this issue.

, You should mail your letter first class, return receipt requested. Hold onto the receipt, and keep a copy of the letter for your records. Send any supporting documentation as well as a photocopy of the credit report with the dispute highlighted.

Make a word out of your PIN.,
Make a sentence out of your PIN.,
Encrypt your PIN.,
Use math to hide your PIN.,
Create small changes.",How to Remember Your PIN at the Checkout2," When using a telephone or ATM keypad, each number is associated with three letters. Determine what your PIN spells out on a phone or ATM keypad. Instead of trying to remember a series of meaningless numbers, it may be easier for you to remember this word.For example, the PIN 3474 is the word “FISH.”
You can use a website like Phone Spell to determine what letters correspond with your number.
If you have the option of creating a PIN, you can also use a word that is meaningful to you and convert it into a number.

, Determine the letters associated with your PIN numbers using a keypad or Phone Spell and use those letters to create individual words. Each number has three letter options so it should be easy for you to develop a sentence that you can remember and helps you remember your PIN. These words can be anything, so long as they help you remember your number.For example, 2275 can be CASL or Cats Always Sleep Long.

, You should generally avoid writing down your PIN. However, if you are simply unable to remember your number, you can try encrypting it with false numbers. When you write down your PIN, try interspersing it with numbers that are not part of it. This will make it more difficult for others to use your number if your information is stolen. Try sticking zeros between each number. For example, 1234 becomes 10203040.
You can also use the next number up. For example, 5678 becomes 56677889.

, If you have to write down your PIN, a more advanced method for disguising it is by using Modular Arithmetic. In this method, numbers wrap around and work in a similar way to how we calculate time on a clock. For your pin, you will want to use a module of 10, meaning that 10 is actually zero. In this system you can add or subtract a certain number from each number of your PIN and create a new number that your write down. In this system all that you need to remember is the number that you have chosen to add or subtract.For example, if you decide to add 5 to each number of 2275, your encrypted pin would be 7720. 2+5= 7; 2+5=7; 7+5=12-10=2; 5+5=10-10=0

, When you write down your PIN, make small changes to it that only you are aware of. Try changing only one number. This will be enough to make it worthless to an identity thief.


For example, if your PIN is 4569, write it down as 4579.

"
"
Ask the bank to create a number for you.,
Try to use random numbers.,
Avoid writing down your number.,
Use a password manager for important PINs and passwords.",How to Remember Your PIN at the Checkout3," If you are unsure about what PIN to use, ask the bank to create one for you. This will ensure that the number is completely random and, therefore, less likely to be stolen. However, this will make the PIN more difficult to remember.


Most banks will work with you to create a safe and secure PIN.

, The easiest way to create a secure PIN is to use random numbers. Although this PIN might be the most difficult to remember, it will be more difficult for an identity thief to steal it. If you are having a hard time picking a random number, try rolling a pair of dice and using the numbers that come up.


Avoid using numbers like the last four digits of your social security number or your birthday.
Do not use sequential numbers like 1234 or 5678. These are some of the most common and, therefore, likely to be the first combinations a thief tries to use.
Do not use the same number for multiple PINs.

, Although writing down your PIN will ensure that you always have it, it also increases the likelihood that it will be stolen. This is particularly dangerous if you are carrying your PIN in your purse or wallet with your card. If your things are stolen, a thief will have all of your information. The only way to securely retain a PIN is to memorize it.
If you have to write down your PIN, try to disguise it using encryption, math or other technique.

, Services like LastPass or 1Password offer to store and remember your passwords and PINs for you, which are then hidden behind a master password that only you know. Once you have entered your primary password, these services will autofill forms and keep your information secure. As long as you do not lose your main account password, your information will be safely protected. Many of these services are free and offer further security with pay upgrades.
Since your main password is the key to all of your other information, you will want to avoid writing it down or keeping it in a document that might be stolen.
For PINs, if you are likely to forget them while you are out, these services offer mobile apps where you can access your information. However, these are typically premium services.

Go over the definition of a judgment.,
Satisfy a judgment.,
File a satisfaction of judgment with the court.,
Be clear about your vacated judgment.,
Analyze what type of information your credit report contains.,
Request a copy of your credit report.",How to Remove a Paid Judgment from Your Credit Report," A judgment is a formal decision made by a court following a lawsuit. In this case, a creditor sues a debtor due to non-payment of a debt. The judgment is a legal requirement to pay the debt, and a judgment is part of the public record.


There are several forms of judgment. A judgment can be satisfied or vacated. The judgment may remain on your credit report for 7 years after the filing date.
A credit bureau collects credit information from a variety of sources. Keep in mind that not all creditors (bank, credit card companies) report all credit activity to the credit bureau.
In many cases, the borrower must follow up to get accurate data reported to each credit bureau. Your efforts can help you ensure that your credit report is based on accurate information.;
, A satisfied judgment means that the judgment has been paid. It’s important the paid judgment is reported on your credit report. If you pay a judgment, the total amount of debt that you owe goes down. Also, a paid judgment reduces the judgment’s negative impact on your credit score.You can satisfy a judgment by paying the balance in full. When the creditor is paid, that entity must file a satisfaction of a judgment form with the court. This is the former debtor’s evidence that the debt was paid.
In some cases, you can negotiate a settlement of your judgment. The creditor may be willing to accept a smaller payment now, rather than wait for full payment over a period of months or years.
You can satisfy a judgment by filing for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy will allow your judgment to be discharged. The discharge means that the judgment amount is no longer owed.

, Once the judgment is satisfied, either you or your creditor can file a satisfaction of judgment document with the court. Each credit bureau should be notified of the satisfaction of judgment filing. The bureaus should use that information to update your credit report.When you pay the judgment, check with the credit bureaus periodically to ensure that the paid judgment is reported.
The credit bureau is required to mark your judgment as having a $0 balance.
Even though you paid the judgment, the judgment will be listed on your credit report for 7 years after the filing of the judgment. The credit report should include the $0 balance.

, A vacated judgment does not mean that the judgment was paid. Instead, a vacated judgment is treated as if it never existed. The court will issue an order to set aside the judgment. That order documents that the judgment has been vacated. You can provide a copy of that order to the credit bureaus.Normally, the credit bureaus do not maintain records of vacated judgments. Since they don’t exist from a debt standpoint, there’s no reason to list them on a credit report.
If a credit bureau does include a vacated judgment on your credit report, you should dispute the item. When you complete their forms to dispute the item, you can include the order to set aside that the court provides.
Some credit bureaus treat this issue differently than others. One credit bureau may have a written policy not to include vacated judgments. Other entities are tougher on this issue. In fact, there have been class action lawsuits to remove vacated judgments. Ask the credit bureau about their policy.
A vacated judgment should be completely removed from your credit report. The rule requiring the judgment to stay on your credit report for 7 years does not apply. Instead of showing a judgment with a zero balance, all evidence of a vacated judgment is removed.

, Your credit report will contain a credit score along with information found in public records. That will include any court judgments that have been entered against you for debts owed and crimes committed. The public record includes any tax liens that have been entered against your property, and any bankruptcy filings.The credit report includes your identity, including your legal name, past addresses, and date of birth.
A report will list existing lines of credit that you have, including both open and closed credit card accounts. The report will disclose how much you owe to creditors and your payment history.
A common item on a credit report is a federal tax lien. The IRS may remove a tax lien in certain circumstances. If the tax lien debt has been paid in full, or you have entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS that results in full payment, the lien may be moved.

, As a matter of law, you are entitled to access one free credit report per year. Credit reports can be accessed from a wide variety of sources, some of which require payment. Request copies of your credit report and your credit score from each of the largest 3 credit bureaus. Sometimes the data can vary by bureau.You need to review your credit report for errors, such as a judgment that should not be posted. If incorrect data stays on your credit report, it will impact your credit score. A lower credit score will make it more difficult for you to borrow money at a reasonable interest rate.
Consumers should also review their credit report for positive credit information that may be missing.
If you pay off a credit card balance, for example, it’s important that your credit card company report that information to each credit bureau. When each bureau receives notice that your debt was paid off, it will improve your credit score.

, Any credit account, past and present, you have had in the past 7 years should be listed in the credit history section. If creditors reported late payments, check your records to ensure they are correct.

, Check the information listed there against your records to ensure it is correct. Pay close attention to fields that report the company name, account number, the date the account was opened, the name on the account, months reviewed, high credit, last activity, status, terms, balance, past due amounts, and date reported.


""Months reviewed"" refers to how long the account history has been reported.

The ""status"" field reports the timeliness of your payments. Terms are only listed if you have monthly payments that have yet to be made.

Find out your credit score.,
Note any significant recent changes to your credit score.,
Challenge any issues on your credit report.,
Pay your bills on time.,
Reduce your debt as much as possible.",How to Raise Your Credit Score in 3 to 6 Months1," There are a number of good ways to learn your credit score quickly. You can call a credit bureau directly, or use one of several free online services to get the number. You can also sign up for a credit monitoring service, which will track your credit score for you, and let you know of any significant changes.


There are three main credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Each will calculate your score slightly differently, so you will want to get a number from all three.
Some banks and other credit issuing institutions will enroll you in a monitoring service as part of signing up. Check with your bank or credit card company to see if that is the case.
Your score can range anywhere from 301 to 850. Anything over 700 is a good score, while 750 and above is a very high score, and would put you in great shape for any loans or credit you may need. A score below 600 is not good, and you will only qualify for loans at a very high interest rate, if you qualify at all.;
, Major changes could be recently filing for bankruptcy, foreclosing on a mortgage, or being the victim of identity theft. Other, less obvious ways to do serious damage to your credit include maxing out several credit cards at once or skipping bills. If you have had a significant change to your recent financial history, it can be much more difficult, if not impossible, to raise your credit quickly.

, Make sure all credit cards, loans, bills, and mortgages belong to you, and that the balances indicated on each are correct. If the reports have outdated or incorrect information, you should contact the reporting agency as soon as possible.Keep good debt on your reports. If you have paid off a large debt, such as for a car or house, don't try to get that off your credit report quickly. Paying off the large debt looks good to your creditors, so leave it there to demonstrate your trustworthiness.Sometimes incorrect information can arise from sharing a name with someone else, and sometimes it can be the result of attempted identity theft. You will be able to work with the reporting agency to figure out what is the case.
Discrepancies or issues can arise at any time, so you should get into the habit of checking your credit report annually to keep track.

, This is the best step you can take to improve your credit score. Payment history accounts for 35% of your credit score, and paying late reflects negatively on you, suggesting you are untrustworthy. You can work with your bank or the billing company to pay automatically from your bank account.


If you do use automatic payments, make sure you have enough funds in your account to cover the bills. If not, you can easily cause more issues for yourself.
Consider paying your bills twice a month, rather than just once. This can quickly erase large debts that build up suddenly due to unexpected expenses. Otherwise, it can look like you are too willing to max out your credit., Make sure you are paying the minimum on all your debts, then use your available cash to pay some of them off completely. Focus on smaller debts, which can be easier to manage. This can allow you to work your way up to paying off the big ones. You will need to pay more than the minimum for it to have any effect, so pay as much as you can as soon as possible.

Take out a small loan.,
Become an authorized user.,
Apply for a secured credit card.,
Report your rent on your credit report.",How to Raise Your Credit Score in 3 to 6 Months2," Go to a local bank or credit union, and get a small personal loan. Use that loan on a large item you already planned on purchasing. This is not an excuse to go shopping, as you want to be able to pay off the loan on time and in full., Find a family member or close friend who has good credit, and ask them to add you to their account as an authorized user. By agreeing, they assume all liabilities for your use of the card. You will be able to utilize the card, and benefit from the owner's strong history of paying.


If anything happens to the finances or credit of card's owner, that will seriously damage your credit as well, so be very careful.
This is risky for the card owner, as anything you do to damage your credit will hurt them as well. It should be someone who trusts you a great deal.

, You will give a security deposit to the issuer, usually equal to the credit limit. This is collateral for the card, so the issuer is covered if you default or otherwise can't pay. Make sure to pay off the card on time. A secured credit is meant to be temporary, until you can get a good rate on a card with an unsecured limit.You can apply for a secured credit card through your bank or credit union, or directly from a credit card company. Look for a card that has a low annual fee.

, Chances are you rent an apartment and pay rent. As long as you do so on time, that can help build your credit. Many private landlords will not report your payments to credit agencies, so ask yours if they do, and if not, if they will."

Keep track of your credit score.,
Manage your credit card usage.,
Reduce your regular credit cards.,
Shop for a loans in a short period of time.,
Increase your line of credit.",How to Raise Your Credit Score in 3 to 6 Months3," Just like you can improve your score, it can also go down if you are not careful. You should get into the habit of checking your credit score from each of the three major credit bureaus annually. Contact the bureaus quickly if anything seems troublesome or out of the ordinary.

, Don't pull out a credit card to pay for everything, as it will push you up against your credit limit and make you look irresponsible. You will want to keep your debt utilization ratio (how much you owe against how much you are allowed to owe) as low as possible. Ideally, you will only spend about 30 percent of your credit limit, showing you will use money loaned to you, but are able keep debt manageable.


You do need to spend some money on your cards. Otherwise, banks and other institutions won't loan to you. Without a credit history of any kind, they can't prove you are reliable.

, Pay off small balances on cards that you don't use very often, and stick to a few cards. All those cards floating around may be harder for you to track, and doesn't look good to a reporting agency.Keep paid for or unused credit cards, unless you are still incurring fees whether they are used or not. You may actually make a small purchase on an unused card so the issuer continues to report the action, but pay the amount off immediately. Maybe keep a card for paying one or two specific bills. Make sure you keep track of your spending on those cards.

, Your credit score is checked every time you apply for a loan and too many inquiries on your credit can decrease your score. Note however, that a bunch of credit inquires within a short period of time is not treated negatively, so consider shopping for loans within a 2-week period., Increasing the limit on credit cards without increasing your spending can make your debt to credit ratio look better. Increasing the limit is not an excuse to spend more money. You want to make your current debt look better, not give yourself an opportunity to spend more.


You should only do this if your credit is already fairly strong, and you are in a good habit of paying on time. If you are not careful, and your credit is particularly bad, your lender may actually reduce your credit.

Use a credit card for everything.,
Make your payments on-time.,
Ask for more.,
Get more than one source of credit.,
Don’t close lines of credit.",How to Maintain Your Credit Rating1," It might seem counterintuitive, but people with excellent credit use their credit cards more than most people, and they pay for everything on the card on time all the time.The difference is in the way they see the card itself. Those with excellent scores think of it as the dominant form of currency, representing the money they have in the bank. People whose scores are only fair often think of the card much differently, as an extravagance to be used sparingly.;
, Payment history is the biggest single factor determining your credit score. It makes up for 35% of FICO. Paying your entire balance on time, every time, is simple advice, and may seem trite, because it is easier said than done. Nonetheless, paying on-time and in full are the most powerful tools you have to create and keep a good score., People with excellent scores ask for higher credit limits fairly frequently (once or twice a year). It’s a great habit to get into as well, because it’s essentially asking your creditor to improve your credit score, since it decreases your overall credit utilization. If you utilize too large a proportion of your available credit, it weakens your credit.


As with anything, moderation is key. If you’re asking for higher limits every week, you will generate a number of hard pulls on your report, which causes your score to decrease. Once or twice a year, ask a creditor with whom you have a good history for a higher limit.

, The mix of credit is only about 10% of your total score, but it is a factor. Once your credit is rehabilitated to the point that you can qualify for a loan, you should take out a small loan or line of credit in a different form than the type of credit you already have. For example, if you only have one credit card, purchase an appliance on an installment plan or take out a small personal loan. It’s never a bad idea to save up the amount of the loan before you apply, put it in a separate account, and simply have the loan payments automatically draw from that account.

, If you cancel a card or another line of credit, the total amount of available credit you have will lessen, which will negatively affect your score. If you have one card you don’t use very much, charge a small recurring bill, like a phone bill or a trash bill, to the card. That will keep it active and with a small but manageable balance."

Don’t use all your credit.,
Take out credit slowly.,

Keep using the same accounts.,
Don’t obsess over your credit score.",How to Maintain Good Credit," Before you can improve your credit score, you will need to access it. You can check your credit score by accessing your FICO score at MyFICO.com or by contacting one of the credit reporting agencies (TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax). Any score report obtained from a credit reporting agency will contain all three of their scores, so you only need one. Alternately, you can get you credit score for free from a website like Creditkarma.com, Creditsesame.com, or Credit.com.Most credit scores range from 301-850, with 301 being the lowest and 850 the highest. Scores above 750 are considered excellent, scores between 700 and 749 are good, and scores between 650 and 699 are fair.
Anything below 650 is considered poor or bad credit.;
, When a lender requests your credit score, the credit bureau providing the score applies a complex algorithm to all of the data in your credit history that the bureau has access to and creates a personalized credit ""score"" based on your data. Despite the complexity of the credit score formulas, each one uses the same five factors to assess your creditworthiness. If you know your score is low, you should determine which of these categories are likely bringing your score down.


Payment history - whether or not the payments in your credit history were made on time. Your payment history score may be low if you have been late on payments in the last several months or have accounts in collections.
Amounts owed - the ratio of the amount of outstanding credit in your name to the total approved credit in your name. If you have used close to the amount you were approved for on your credit cards, this will lower your score.
Length of credit history - score based on how far back your credit history goes. Credit bureaus have access to data from ten years prior to the last use of every line of credit in your name. If you don't have a lot of credit history this score will be low, but it will not be weighted as heavily.
Types of debt owed - the mix of debt outstanding in your name. The score considers whether you have all of your debt in credit cards, or whether your debt is balanced between college loans, a mortgage, and a small line of credit. If the only type of debt you owe is credit card debt or multiple auto loans, that may negatively impact your score.
New credit - the amount of new credit you have been approved for and accepted. The more you borrow in a short period of time, the lower this part of your score. , The first step to boosting your score is to make all of your payments on time. Because payment history is generally the largest portion of a credit score, you can improve your score by improving your payment history. You can also improve other areas of your credit score, like amounts owed and types of credit, by reducing your overall credit balance and taking out credit a little at a time.


If you miss a payment, make it as soon as possible. Your score reflects the number of days a payment is late, so even if you're late, still prioritize getting your payment in, or contacting your creditor.If you find yourself missing payments frequently, set up calendar alerts, email reminders, or automatic withdrawals to pay your credit bills.
If you have a high outstanding credit balance, either use savings to pay off some debt or stop using credit cards until you can pay down your balance. Unless you're in an emergency situation, you should aim to use less than 1/3 of the total credit you are approved for. Reducing the percentage of your approved credit you have outstanding can boost your credit score in just a few months.
If you just took out a new line of credit, give yourself a 1-2 month cushion until you open another line.
If you are brand new to the credit scene, your credit score may be just below average. You shouldn't worry about your credit score as a new borrower, other than to remember to make payments on time and not to borrow everything you get approved for.

, Everyone has bumps in the road, and if you truly can't pay your bills, there are steps you can take to preserve your credit history. Some creditors won't send your account to collections if you agree to make smaller payments or apply for a deferral. A credit counselor can help you consolidate your debt into one line with a reduced monthly payment. Working with a credit counselor now to find a solution may save both your future finances and credit score.

, As a rule of thumb, aim to have an outstanding balance of less than one-third of the amount you were approved for on credit cards. As you use a higher percentage of your approved credit lines, this part of your credit score declines. Because the approved credit limit is generally based on your income, owing a large portion of the amount may indicate you are nearing your spending limit and are a risky borrower.Use a budget to guide your spending and make sure you don’t overuse your credit. Approval limits are often calculated using very long term payback schedules, (think 5 to 15+ years), so you should not plan to spend as much on a credit card as you are approved for.
Keep a savings account for emergencies. Your credit score takes a hit if you have to do a bunch of borrowing at one time. While sometimes this is inevitable, having some savings to prevent using too much credit can keep your credit score in good order.

, The new credit portion of your credit score considers the amount of your total credit that was recently borrowed. The logic underlying the scoring method is that the more money you’ve borrowed recently, the more risky you are as a borrower. This is based on statistics that show borrowers who need to borrow a lot of money in a short time often have a harder time paying that money back. Plan your borrowing in advance. If you need new furniture and a larger vehicle for an arriving baby, stagger your purchases by a few months. Leaving lengths of time between opening new lines of credit shows that you haven’t hit dire straights, and that you aren’t a risky borrower.
When taking out a new line of credit, remember that both the amount you are approved for, as well as the amount you actually borrow, both affect your credit score. Generally having been approved for a large amount will not hurt your score, unless you spend a high percentage of the approved amount.

, It is better for your credit score that you have a mix of different kinds of debts, like a mortgage, auto loan, school loan, and a credit card, than a lot of debt in just one kind of credit line. This is especially true for credit cards. If you have successfully made payments over a period of time on several different types of credit, your score will improve., Your credit report goes all the way back to the earliest transaction associated with any card you have used in the last ten years, and the longer your credit history the better for your score. This doesn't mean you shouldn't ever open new accounts, just hold on to accounts that look good on your history.


If you have had a card since you were 18, keep using it every once in a while. The fact you have paid off your debts consistently over a long period of time will boost your score.
A common misconception is that canceling credit cards is good for your credit score. Canceling a card may actually lower your credit score temporarily, as it reduces the ratio between your total outstanding debt and total approved debt. Canceling a card may be a smart way to curb your spending, but it will not boost your score.
If you miss payments, default, or incur penalties on a line of credit, you should consider closing that line once you pay it off. It will take a long time, but 10 years after you pay off the card all of the associated history will no longer be considered part of your credit history.

, Credit scores are only one of many factors that lenders consider if and when you apply for loans. Just as important if not more are your employment status, income, and the amount of any down payment. If you have a poor credit score, you should work on improving the things that you can, but also focus on developing a budget and using credit less. Credit scores are generally a good indicator of your financial position; if you are having a hard time getting approved for credit, your best bet is not to borrow.


Your credit will go up and down in small increments as your credit history, length, and substance changes. Most small changes will not affect your ability to borrow money, and you shouldn’t worry too much about your score. If you are following the steps above, you’ve done what you can and you should be able to relax.
Worry less about mortgages than credit cards and short term loans. Because housing loans are backed by collateral, they look less risky on your credit report. More risky are credit cards and other unsecured loans that are not attached to a single item.

Check your credit reports and your credit score frequently.,
Correct mistakes in your credit report.,
Don’t use more than a third of your available credit.",How to Maintain Your Credit Rating2," The kinds of people who have good credit and keep good credit are the ones who pay attention to it. Everyone in the US can get a free credit report from each of the credit bureaus once a year (meaning up to three different occasions). Since this is a report for you and not an inquiry from a creditor, it won't affect your overall credit rating. The report is a complete account of your credit history—what you’ve paid and when you paid it, what your debts are, and when you applied for new lines of credit. Your score is an estimate of how risky it might be to lend you money. They’re two related but different gauges of your financial well-being, and it’s important to know both.Check your credit report at https://annualcreditreport.com.
Check your credit score (for free) at https://www.creditkarma.com.

, Since everyone gets one free credit report per year, everyone should examine theirs for mistakes. As many as one in five Americans have an error on their credit report, so check diligently. Sometimes they’re serious mistakes and sometimes they’re not, but there’s only one way to know.If you find a mistake, do the following:First, notify the credit bureau of the error. Send a physical letter via certified postal mail, enclosing a copy of the credit report, the error, and any documents supporting your claim. Look at a sample letter at http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/rights/sample-credit-report-dispute-letter-of-explanation.aspx to get a better idea of the format.
Repeat the process with the creditor (not the credit bureau) who has filed the incorrect information. Request that the creditor send you courtesy copies of any correspondence they initiate with the credit bureau.
It's always best to put everything in writing when you're dealing with creditors or credit bureaus. Writing makes them accountable for their words, and ultimately, for their claims to you.

, Even though your overall credit limit might be $9000, it will hurt your score if more than about $3,000 of that limit is being used. This is called the “amounts owed” section of your credit score, which isn’t the most straightforward name. It means the amount owed relative to your credit limits, and not the entirety of the amount of debt owed.

Limit applications for new credit.,
Contact creditors to manage your debt.,
Negotiate negative items off your report.",How to Maintain Your Credit Rating3," When you need a new line of credit, choose just a few lenders you think will approve you, and apply to as few of them as possible. That's because new applications for credit result in ""hard pulls"" of your credit report, and a number of them in a short amount of time makes it appear you are trying to amass a great deal of credit at once.

, If you are at risk of falling behind on a bill, contact your creditors as soon as you can. If you ignore them, not only will you sow distrust between yourself and the creditor, you greatly increase the chances of them reporting the missed payment to the credit reporting agencies.


You're also far more likely to be able to set up payment plans or modify the terms of a loan if you've been speaking with your creditors all along., It won't always work, but you can sometimes negotiate with a creditor to remove a negative item from your report. Counterintuitively, this works best when you still owe money to the creditor. Most creditors would rather get some money than no money, so there's an incentive for them to make a deal.Write your creditor and offer to pay a portion of the account if they will remove the item from your credit report (or at least mark it as “paid as agreed”). If they agree to your offer or you agree to their counteroffer, get the agreement in writing and uphold your end of the bargain.
If you're considering bankruptcy, let the creditor know. You'll almost certainly get a deal (sometimes at a steep discount) if you do, because many creditors get nothing at all after bankruptcy.

",How to Get an Error Off Your Credit Rating," Monitor your reports more frequently if you are actively working to improve your credit rating, have been a victim of identity theft, or have any other reason to suspect your rating may have changed.


There are 3 major credit reporting agencies: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. It is important to review a copy of your report from each agency. Although they will often be the same, it is possible that an error could exist on one without showing on the others.
A federal law requires that each of the 3 agencies provide you a copy of your report, free of charge, once every 12 months. To get your free credit report, fill out a request at the Annual Credit Report website. You can also call 1-877-322-8228 to request your reports by phone.
To request additional reports during the year, contact the credit reporting agency directly. The fee for the report varies by agency.;
, If your report includes inaccurate information such as the wrong address, a debt you never held or a lawsuit you were never involved in, you can have this information permanently removed.

, It is not uncommon for an account or debt to show up more than once on your report, but each account is only supposed to be accounted for once when determining your rating.


Duplicate entries make it appear like you hold more debt that you do. Have them removed to clean up your report before applying for credit.

, In most cases, even accurate negative credit information must be removed from your report after a period of time. In the United States, the Fair Credit Reporting Act specifies how long each type of credit violation can remain on your report.


The following information should be removed from your report after 7 years: late payments, defaulted and charged-off accounts, lawsuits and court judgments, property liens, foreclosures and Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
Chapter 7 bankruptcy will remain on your report for 10 years.
Child support owed and outstanding student loans remain on your credit record until the debt is paid.

, If the error exists on reports with multiple agencies you will need to notify each agency separately. Send the letters via certified mail so you have proof of delivery. Include the following information in your letter:


Your complete name, address, phone number and Social Security number.
Clearly identify each entry on your report that you want removed, and state the reason why the information is eligible for removal.

, Regular checking accounts pay no interest at all; they are meant only to fund your checks and debit-card expenditures. Interest-bearing checking accounts do offer some interest on your deposits. There are two basic kinds of interest-bearing checking accounts:


Regular interest-bearing checking accounts pay a minimal interest rate. If you leave funds in such an account for very long, you are likely to lose considerable purchasing power – this money would usually yield more interest in a savings, money market, or certificate of deposit account.
High-interest checking accounts pay a little more. They provide an above-average interest income for your money. However, this increase in interest may be offset by fees, and you typically have to keep a much higher balance to qualify.

, You can add cash and checks to your account at any time without restriction. Simply fill out a deposit slip and deposit the funds into a designated ATM or in person at the bank.


Note that if you deposit checks into your account, your bank may hold the funds (or part of the funds) until the checks clear. Check with your bank to be sure.

, Since the ability to write checks is a key component of having a checking account, it’s important to know how to fill them out correctly. All checks have designated spaces for the following information:


Date. This is self explanatory: fill in the current date.
Pay to the Order of. On this line, write the name of the check’s recipient – it can be a person or a company.
$ Amount. Use numerals here. Write the number on the left most part of the field, taking care not to leave any space – these minimizes the risk of people fraudulently writing additional numbers.
Dollars. Write the corresponding amount, this time using words. Start at the left side, and write any cents as a fraction – the number of cents over 100. If there is extra space, draw a line straight through to the end of the field.
Signature. Sign your name here.
Memo. This field is optional. If desired, write a note to indicate what the check is for. If you are paying a bill, this is a good place to include your account number.

, Every month, you will receive a statement, noting in detail each check you wrote, all funds removed or deposited at an ATM or in the bank, all debit card transactions, and any other pertinent changes to your account. The statement will also have your current balance.


Get in the habit of looking over your monthly statements carefully and comparing them to your own records. Errors sometimes occur.
Checking account statements are often available by email instead of on paper. Check with your bank.

, Savings accounts are the most popular type of bank account. They pay basic interest on your money and allow you to withdraw it at any time. Therefore, a savings account is a good option for storing extra funds.

, There are two basic types of savings accounts: passbook savings and statement accounts.


Passbook accounts give you a bank book, where all deposit transactions are recorded. You can add and withdraw money only at the bank during regular business hours. With the prevalence of ATMs and electronic banking, some banks no longer offer this type of account.
Statement accounts are more common. You are issued an ATM card and provided with monthly or quarterly statements. You can withdraw money at any time from an ATM. In some cases, your ATM card functions like a debit card as well, and can therefore be used to pay bills and make purchases. Check with your bank.

, In general, savings accounts yield more interest than checking accounts, but different banks may have different requirements for savings accounts, and they may pay different interest rates. Shop around to find the best place to deposit your money.


Keep in mind the savings accounts typically pay less interest per year than money market or certificate of deposit accounts.

, Check with your bank to see how your interest is calculated. This should enable you to project how much you will earn over a certain period.

, In many ways, money market accounts (MMAs) are identical to savings accounts; they are interest-bearing deposit accounts. They usually pay higher interest rates than savings accounts, but they also require higher balances.


With MMAs, your money will be invested by the bank, but you will receive your interest no matter what. This makes MMAs different from money market funds, which may lose money if the investment does not perform well.

, There are two fundamental types of MMAs: basic MMAs and tiered MMAs.


A basic money market account simply requires a minimum deposit (at some banks, it might be as low as $100) and pays interest based on your balance.
A tiered MMA offers higher interest rates for higher balances.

, MMAs usually pay more interest than standard checking and savings accounts, but less than mutual funds or stock investments. On the other hand, they are risk free.

, Certificates of deposit (also called CDs or sometimes Certificate of Time Deposits) are risk-free investments. You deposit a certain amount of money into an account for a specified period of time (usually between 30 days and 5 years). In exchange for committing your money for that period of time, you receive a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account usually provides.

, When the specified period of time ends, your CD “matures.” At this point, you can either withdraw the money or allow it to “roll over” for another equal period of time.


In general, unless you tell your bank that you want to withdraw the money, they will roll the CD over automatically. Check with your bank to see what you need to do to withdraw the funds.

, Certificates of deposit come in three basic forms: liquid CDs, “bump up CDs,” and brokered CDs.


Liquid (or “no penalty”) CDs can be withdrawn at any time with no early withdrawal penalty charges. You can therefore choose to move your money to a higher-paying CD if the opportunity arises.
Bump up CDs let you maintain an existing CD but move it to a higher rate if your bank has one to offer. This will not typically happen automatically; you have to request it from the bank.
Brokered CDs are CDs found by a broker or financial advisor, who scouts the marketplace for the best CD rates.

, Certificate of deposit rates vary, and a few factors play crucial roles in determining how much interest you can make.


The length of time is key. The longer you agree to keep your money tied up, the higher the interest rate will be.
Economic rates play a role. When rates are generally high, so are CD rates.
Credit unions often offer slightly higher rates. Because credit unions are non-profit institutions, they typically offer slightly higher rates than banks do.
Short-term opportunities sometimes occur. Occasionally, banks will try to win business by offering higher rates on CDs for a short period of time.

Evaluate possible banks.,
Review account requirements.,
Find out if you can open your account online.,
Contact customer service.,
Fund your account.",How to Set Up a Bank Account Out of State1," To set up a personal bank account out of state, look at the banking options available to you in the other state to find the financial institution that will best meet your needs. Issues you may want to consider include operating hours, locations of branches, and online access.For example, if you have a vacation home in another state and want to open a bank account there, you might want to look at banks with branches near that vacation home that have weekend hours.
Keep in mind that if a bank has branches in your resident state, this isn't truly getting a bank account out-of-state. The branch in your resident state technically will be considered your home branch, although you can use branches anywhere.
This is important if you're trying to open a bank account out of state because you want to shield assets from garnishment after a judgement against you.
While judgement creditors may not be able to garnish assets out of state, if the bank has a branch in the state where the judgement was entered, they are still within the court's jurisdiction regardless of where you technically opened the account.;
, While most national and larger regional banks have similar requirements and types of accounts, smaller local banks may have additional requirements with which you're not familiar.Generally, you must be a U.S. citizen over the age of 18 to open a checking or savings account in any U.S. bank.
If you've previously had a negative banking relationship, including bounced checks or an account that went into overdraft, other banks may not be willing to open a checking account for you.
However, you still may be able to open a savings account even if you aren't eligible for a checking account. Since many banks offer debit cards for savings accounts as well as checking accounts, this option may still work for you.

, Most national and larger regional banks allow you to complete your application and open your account on their websites. Some smaller local and regional banks also may have a similar degree of accessibility, or you may have to visit a branch in person.Opening an account online won't work to establish an account out of state with some banks. The bank may require you to enter your state before allowing you to continue, and may not have the option for you to open an account if you live in a state in which that bank has no branches.
However, in other banks you may be able to open an account online where you wouldn't be able to do so in person. For instance, some banks do not allow you to open an account in person at a branch if you have an out-of-state driver's license.
You will have to enter your home address, driver's license information, and Social Security number on the application to open a bank account.
Depending on the details you enter, the bank may require additional information. You also may have to mail or fax copies of identification documents, such as your driver's license or Social Security card, so the bank can verify the information you provided on your application.

, If you have any problems or don't feel comfortable opening your account online, you typically can complete the application over the phone by calling the bank's customer service line.You should be able to find a toll-free number on the bank's website. Call that number and follow the prompts to speak to a representative.
Keep in mind that some banks may not allow you to open an account over the phone. Those that do may require you to mail or fax copies of identification documents so they can verify the information provided.

, Once your application is approved, you typically must make a minimum deposit to fund your account within a brief period of time after the initial set-up is complete. The amount you're required to deposit depends on the bank and the type of account you've chosen.You typically will need to make this deposit through wire transfer. Since you're transferring to a domestic bank, there may not be any processing fee.
However, be aware that your bank may charge a small fee to initiate the transfer to another bank, depending on the type of account from which you're withdrawing funds to make your initial deposit.
Other options to fund your account include mailing a check or money order to the bank, or visiting a branch in the other state and making a deposit in person.
If you opened your account online, the bank typically will give you options to choose if you want to deposit funds into your account electronically.

Register to do business in the state.,
Choose the bank you want to use.,
Speak to a representative.,
Make your opening deposit.",How to Set Up a Bank Account Out of State2," Even though having a bank account in another state doesn't necessarily mean you are doing business in that state, most banks require your business to be registered with the secretary of state before they will open a business deposit account.The registration requirement also may apply if you're operating your business as a sole proprietorship or partnership, even though the state may not require you to register.
Many states allow you to register your business online. Search for the state's secretary of state website and then look for a link to register your business.
You may have to pay a fee to register your business in the state, typically around $100. You may have to pay additional fees if you want to expedite your application, or to get additional certified copies of your certificate.
If you have any questions about whether you need to register your business with the state, talk to someone at the bank where you want to open an account.

, Different banks have many different features and options for business accounts. You may want to make a list of the features that are important for your business so you can find the bank that is right for you.For example, many banks have a monthly service fee attached to accounts, and you may have additional fees depending on the number of transactions you have in a month.
Different accounts also may have different levels of access with respect to withdrawals and domestic wire transfers allowed per month.
You can compare accounts to choose the best account for your business based on the number of transactions and minimum balance you anticipate for your account.

, A customer service representative will be able to answer any questions you have and help you set up your account. Unlike personal accounts, you typically cannot set up a business account online.Look on the bank's website to find the appropriate customer service number. Keep in mind some banks may have a different line for business accounts than for personal accounts.
Follow the prompts to talk to a representative, and tell them you'd like to open a business account. Be sure to let them know that you reside in a different state.
They typically will ask you questions about your business, including whether your business operates in the state and whether you're registered with the secretary of state or the state department of revenue.
If you begin your application over the phone, you typically must mail or fax copies of any documents required to verify your identity and information you provided about your business.

, After your paperwork is complete, you still must provide a deposit of at least the minimum amount specified by the bank to complete the set up of your business's bank account.If the account type you chose requires you to maintain a minimum deposit, your initial deposit must be at least that much.
Some banks may have a particular minimum initial deposit, regardless of the minimum you're required to maintain to avoid monthly fees.
To move money to an out-of-state bank, your easiest method would be to initiate a wire transfer from the bank where you're currently holding the funds you want to transfer.
You also may be able to make an initial deposit by sending a certified or business check to one of the bank branches.

"
"
Speak to a domestic banker.,
Meet the verification requirements.,
Submit financial documentation.,
Choose a currency.,
Transfer your funds.",How to Set Up a Bank Account Out of State3," Some larger banks have advisors who can assist you if you want to set up an account overseas, whether for your personal investments or for your business. Having a banker's assistance can help you navigate some of the more complex requirements more smoothly.Different countries have different banking regulations, and not all banks allow U.S. customers to open accounts.
Additionally, there may be more stringent funding requirements than you would find if you were opening an account at a bank within the United States.
If you already bank with a larger national bank, go to the website and see if they have an international banking department.
You also may be able to find assistance by calling customer service or speaking with a banker inside a branch.

, Offshore banks require more documents to verify your identity than may be required for a domestic account. In addition to providing information on an application form, you'll need to submit government-issued identification documents such as your passport.You may need to supply copies of your driver's license or Social Security card. For tax purposes, the bank also may need to verify your residence. A utility bill or similar document typically will work for this purpose.
Because of the wide variety of identity documents, if you're opening a bank account overseas the bank may require a notarized or certified copy to ensure what you've sent them isn't forged or falsified.
Getting the correct certification on your documents may require you to visit an authorized government office. The bank typically will let you know how to do this.

, In addition to personal information, you also must submit financial records and information so the offshore bank can verify your source of income and your banking history.While these requirements may seem intrusive or time-consuming, they are designed to prevent offshore accounts from being used for illegal purposes such as money laundering or tax evasion.
An offshore bank typically will request bank statements going back six months to a year, as well as wage statements or sales contracts that indicate the source of the money you want to place in the account.
Keep in mind that although offshore bank accounts are frequently associated with multimillionaires, you don't necessarily have to be incredibly wealthy to have an account overseas.
When international banks look at your banking history, what they want to know is how long you've had your accounts open and whether you have a positive relationship with your bank – not necessarily how much money you have in your accounts.

, When you open a domestic account, the currency automatically is the U.S. dollar. However, if you open an offshore account you'll need to decide the currency in which you want your funds held.Before you decide to hold funds in a currency other than your own domestic currency, make sure you ask a bank representative about the tax implications.
For example, you may elect to hold funds in the domestic currency of the country where the bank is located, which would enable you to earn interest on the funds in your account. However, earning interest in that country may subject you to tax liability there.
You also want to be careful about exchange rates. Before you elect to hold your funds in a different currency, research the exchange rate over a long period of time and assess the overall stability of that currency.

, Once your paperwork has been approved, you'll have to make your first deposit into your account. The main way to deposit funds into an offshore account is through a wire transfer, for which you can expect to incur additional charges or processing fees.Keep in mind that nearly every bank will charge for an international wire transfer. However, these fees vary, so it may be worth it to shop around for the best deal.
Since you likely will be depositing a large sum as your initial deposit, there's really no other way to get money to an offshore account.
Foreign banks won't accept domestic checks, and you would run a serious personal safety risk if you carried cash overseas.

Watch your home value, which may begin sinking (deflation of home values).,
Work on how you can economize rising household and business utilities -- as the suppliers ""pass-on"" the cost of inflation to the individual who then faces higher prices for energy and other utilities.,
Define deflation -- the lowering of dollar values.,
Look for your best ways to cut fuel usage, be economical and get better fuel economy on gasoline, oil and natural gas prices.,
Examine inflation caused partly by The U.S. Federal Reserve Board (The Fed) printing ""extra"" money to put it into circulation by loaning it to weak banks to encourage expanding these banks' loans to businesses and for individual (consumer) credit including for home loans to Fannie and Freddie which are government agencies that guarantee and buy U.S. home mortgage loans.,
Try to remain employed (perhaps move or change industries) and improve marketable skills and apply knowledge (unused it's equivalent to waste).,
Realize that failing economies anywhere could set economies falling around the world.,
See state and local governments at the brink of bankruptcy, as State and local governments needed Federal stimulus money in 2009 and 2010 -- depending on the Federal level for bail-outs which is itself in trouble -- including such states as: California, Illinois and New York State to be bailed out by the U.S. taxpayers (government), by The Fed printing money (monetizing debt/inflating) and loans from abroad, but then have to pay it back which drains all those coffers further.

,
Consider buying gold and government guaranteed investments, because of the weak U.S. Dollar and weak Euro; many people say that such things are good investments that have residual value.

,
See some perspective on Inflation, historically, a rate of 3% may be called ""creeping-inflation"" and then there is sometimes higher inflation that may be around 10% or even more with booms and bursts, typically.,
Recall ""TARP"" stimulus in 2008 as some economists startled the public, convincing the U.S. Presidents and that U.S. Congress (George W Bush and Barack Obama majority Democrat) saying that we were near a ""great-depression type of collapse"" and had to save the economy with ""TARP"" and then do more of that in 2009 to bail out the ""too large to fail banks and Wall Street companies""?,
Measure how much significant stimulus -- increased government spending for purchases -- is shown in the table from economic panic of 2008 through the bottom of that panic rising steeply into 2009 from ""Assessing the Federal Policy Response to the Economic Crisis"": from Testimony before the Committee on the Budget, United States Senate, John B. Taylor, Economist, Professor, Stanford University and Senior Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution.,
Consider the table from the Bureau of Economic Analysis which was given to the ""U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget, United States Senate"" in a presentation by John B. Taylor, Economist, Professor, Stanford University and Senior Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution: (See graph above entitled, ""Real GDP Growth into Contribution Due to Government Purchases"" by Bureau of Economic Analysis)


Notice the slow change from flat spending for purchases by the federal, state and local governments (The Government).",How to Understand Cause and Effect of Inflation and Deflation," Millions of Americans have their life-savings sunk/invested in their homes, and the average prices of homes may boom temporarily and/or head downward (deflating) and seem to show weakness as some areas of the economy recover more than others. A popped bubble may not always re-inflate (recover higher prices) in a short period of time; instead it may take years to get home prices rising near or surpassing previous highs.


Credit is often tight for home-buyers, consumer buying and business investors when there is deficit spending by government. Average/Middle-class payroll checks, salaries and wages are not rising much, and ""under-employment"" is common which is when people become employed below their previously better pay-rate standing.

, Consider that you individually can not control inflation, but perhaps you can try to manage the costs of household utilities (including water, garbage and sewer) that are related to energy costs as well.

, Deflation (sliding dollar value) would likely increase to stay even with inflation of money supply, as the cost rises, for instance, to buy each barrel of oil or other products. To offset inflation, the oil-producers can raise prices, in turn causing lower dollar values (deflation).

, A surge in oil prices could damage prospects for recovery that may be trying to take root in the current economy.

,


Printing more and more dollars would be called ""monetizing"" the debt. This suggests higher inflation and evidently increases economic weakness. The Fed prints more money than it shreds and replaces.
But, the creditors would then get paid back with money of less value, so some favor that idea.

, Get training (as much as possible) to improve value and income. In the U.S., unemployment was around 9.4 percent for about 2 years, and combined with ""under""-employment (working for lower pay) and ""discouraged"" job seekers are at high levels above 15% ..

, This economist said that not only U.S. citizens but Europeans face ""another serious crisis in early 2011,"" with huge short-term debts and many nation-states needing huge bailouts.To help the business and markets, ""Confidence is key,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. ""If people don't feel good the economy just isn't going to gain traction so it's very very important that people start to feel better about things because until we do the economy is going to struggle.""

,,, In about 10 to 20 years prices may double, triple, or more.


In the early 21st century, a dollar may be said to be worth around ""5 to 10 cents"" compared to around a 1960 approximate value of the dollar (depending on the product category), for example: a new auto which might have cost around $2500 would now be about $25,000 or so (that's the 10 cent dollar).

But, a cup of coffee at a shop then was 5 or 10 cents and in 2011 is now $1 or $2 in the U.S.A. and that shows that the dollar is, perhaps, worth about 5 cents, in that category.


Computers are counter-example (outlier) because of great economies and improvements in products that had the original low speed processors costing about $2000 to $3000 dollars in the early 1980s and the hard drives were very small, but very expensive -- and they actually came down in price with vastly improved speed and capacity. Today's desktop computer is much faster than the ""business mainframe computers"" of that era.

Notice that graph of Government stimulus with much ado and what effect? Taylor said the policy for simulating the economy should be ""based on certain established economic principles, including 'predictable, permanent and pervasive incentives' and throughout the economy... consistent with those three principles.""

Consider the sign-up bonus.,
Subtract the annual fee from the bonus.",How to Choose a Large Rewards Offer1," For example, a company may offer you 20,000 ""points"" just to open an account with them. If you're interested in the offer, take note of the expiration date, and sign up before that date. Keep the offer on file for future reference.


A ""point"" usually means one cent. In this example, you would multiply 20,000 by .01 to get $200. The credit card company is offering $200 as a sign-up bonus.;
, Let's say the annual fee is $80. Subtracting $80 from $200 leaves you just $120 from that sign-up bonus.

"
"
Estimate your projected use of the card for a year.,
Figure your reward total.,
Figure your total bonus-and-reward for the first year.",How to Choose a Large Rewards Offer2," This will give you an idea of your total reward. For example, you may estimate that you'll spend $15,000 with the card in a year's time.

, Multiply your estimated card use by .01. $15,000 X .01 is $150. You would be rewarded $150 for charging $15,000 on the card.

, The $200 sign-up bonus, plus the $150 end-of-year reward, minus the $80 annual fee leaves you with a total reward of $270 for using the card that year. That's not bad, assuming you buy only things you would have bought even without the card. If you make purchases just because you'll be rewarded by the card company, you may wind up poorer, not richer.

"
"
Calculate what your second year return will be.,
Decide whether the second-year return is enough to keep using the card.,
Let your card company know you're considering another company.",How to Choose a Large Rewards Offer3," There's no sign-up bonus this time, but there's always the annual fee. Assuming the same $15,000 expenditure, ($15,000 X .01) - $80 = $70. Thus, your second-year return would be about $70.

, Look at other card offers and make comparisons.

, They may be willing to sweeten their offer, perhaps waiving the annual fee for one year.

"
"
Don't diminish the value of your rewards.,
Pay online or in-person.,
On a calendar or planner, place reminders for when to expect your monthly card statement.",How to Choose a Large Rewards Offer4," You will lose ground by paying interest or ""late fees"" because of missed payments, late payments, or partial payments.


Do not use the card for installment purchases.
Pay off the full statement balance each month.
Make your payments consistently on time.

, Do not pay by mail unless you can mail the payment well in advance of the due date. Be aware of late fees and interest rates for unpaid balances. These costs are typically very high. It's always best to pay off your full balance every month. If you can't do that, be sure to make at least the minimum required payment for the month. Failing to do that is very costly in terms of fees, interest, and damage to your credit rating.

, If you're not completely satisfied with the card, place a reminder to cancel it before the next year's annual fee is charged. You may have to ask the company what that date is.

Evaluate your plan on a yearly basis.",How to Plan Succession for a Family Business," Your family, any other owners of your business, and your managers and employees all should be consulted as you plan succession.Schedule several group meetings devoted to your succession plan, as well as individual meetings with key players.
Keep in mind that family members and managers will continue to play an active role in the family business, so allowing them to be actively involved in the succession plan can help smooth the transition and ensure your plan is accepted.
Draft a formal agenda for your meetings and make sure everyone stays on task. The focus should be on the succession plan, not any other problems or issues people have with some aspect of business operations or with each other.;
, You should have a good understanding of what you want for the business and how you define your values and your legacy.You probably want to retire at some point, meaning you don't want to continue to be actively involved in the company for the rest of your life.
Decide the general age at which you would like to step down, and the extent to which you will remain involved with the company after that point.
You also should analyze what kind of income you want during your retirement, and what your other sources of income are. That way you can come up with a reliable estimate of how much of your retirement income should come from the business.
Keep in mind that if one of your primary goals is keeping the business in the family and having it survive as your legacy to future generations, that goal forecloses some options such as selling or liquidating the company.
Once you've identified your key goals, write them up in a summary of a page or less that you can distribute to other owners, family members, and managers.

, The needs and goals of your family and your managers and employees, as well as any other owners of your business, should factor into your succession plan.Written surveys can help you evaluate the needs and expectations of others involved in the business, and allow them to explore and consider succession issues in advance of a meeting.
Take notes at each meeting so you can accurately recall issues raised. Make copies of your notes available to everyone at the meeting so they can confirm their accuracy or correct any misunderstandings.
If there are other owners of your business, it is imperative that you meet with them often to get their input on the succession plan and also ensure that they understand how their rights and interests will be affected by the transition.
Understand the difference between individual goals and collective aspirations. While each person involved in the business has their own personal hopes and desires related to their own career path and professional growth, collectively your owners and management team should have goals for the business as a whole.

, Balance your goals and values with the expectations to others to arrive at the optimum situation you could hope to achieve through your succession plan.Review and summarize the goals and interests of all parties involved, then identify areas of conflict.
Unify the goals of everyone involved into a consistent plan that takes all of them into account and achieves as many of them as possible. To do this, you'll have to carefully prioritize certain goals over others.
Look at the big picture rather than relationships between people to determine which goals should be prioritized over others. Where your goals conflict with someone else's, you want to avoid prioritizing your goals for no other reason than the fact that you're the boss.
Your best case scenario will include your expected annual income after retirement, a list of your business's equity and who will own how much of it, and a list of who will occupy various managerial or executive roles and what their responsibilities will be.

, Once you have your ideal in mind, you can evaluate different ways to get as close to that ideal plan as possible.Your best case scenario is a unified set of goals that embody the hopes and expectations of everyone who plays a major role in your family business. However, what you still have to explore is how you will get from where you are now to where you want to be.
Keep your family dynamic in mind when you evaluate the different options, particularly if you have family members with ownership stakes in the business who do not get along with each other.
Get input from other owners, family members, and managers as well as professional advisors on a number of available options before you commit to a specific plan.

, An objective assessment of the value of your business can help you understand the financial condition of your company and its growth potential.Don't be surprised if you are disappointed by the valuation. A family business that you have built from scratch and poured your heart and soul into will necessarily have more value to you than it would to an independent third party.
This also is why you shouldn't skip the valuation – it is difficult if not impossible to plan succession for a family business without a realistic idea of its condition.
A qualified business appraiser also can help you assess the benefits of each succession option you're considering so you have as much information as possible to make the best decision for your business.
When you're researching appraisers, look for someone with a professional designation that indicates they have recognized education and experience in business valuation, such as a CBA (Certified Business Appraiser) or an ABV (the designation given to a certified public accountant who is accredited in business valuation)., An experienced business attorney or accountant can help ensure that your succession plan can proceed in a way that reflects your intentions.Professional advisors can review your business's overall picture and offer suggestions on how to best achieve your goals in light of your financial and legal realities.
As much time and effort as you've put into developing your business and planning your succession, you can't afford to have it all fall apart because there was a mistake in your legal documents. Your peace of mind in knowing that your succession plan will proceed according to your wishes is worth the cost of attorney's fees.

, Your timeline ideally should include benchmarks for specific goals, as well as trigger events indicating it's time to move on to the next step of the plan.Particularly if your succession plan involves selling or gifting shares to other family members over time, you must have a schedule in place that details when those transfers will be made.

, You may need to amend business organization documents and accounts to reflect your plan for succession.Lean on your professional advisors to draft any additional contracts or agreements as needed to implement your succession plan.
Make sure all legal documents created to implement your plan are executed and filed correctly so they will be legally binding.

, Once you've designed your plan, make sure everyone who might have a role in the plan understands what will happen and what they need to do.Create a document that summarizes your succession plan and paints a picture of what the business will look like once the transition is complete.
Meet and discuss the plan with key personnel to make sure they understand how it works and what will take place at each stage of the transition, as well as what their roles will be.

, To ensure a seamless transition, succession should take place in small steps over time.Accept input from managers and other key employees to make sure everyone understands the succession plan and is on board with it.
Keep in mind that leadership transitions are inherently unstable. Continually involving your managers and key employees in the succession process can help them feel more secure and confident staying with the company rather than being tempted to move on to a competitor they see as more stable.
You might consider offering stock options or similar incentives to keep managers invested in the company's health and growth and provide them a reason to stay through the transition.

, Managers and owners should know how to recognize when a trigger event has occurred that indicates it's time to move to the next step of the succession plan.Keep in mind that the actual trigger events may differ from those outlined in your plan. Even the most careful planner still can't predict the future, and unforeseen changes in your business or in the general economic environment can have an effect on the succession process.
Ideally, each phase of your succession plan should take between two and six months to complete. This gives your managers and employees time to adjust to a change before additional changes are made.
Your trigger events should be well defined and easy for key personnel to identify so they can set the next phase of your plan in motion.

, The person you've chosen to take over after you should have plenty of experience and familiarity with the business before he or she officially takes the reins.Assess your own skills and responsibilities as well as those of your successor. Creating a ""job description"" that includes a list of all the things you actually do can help familiarize your successor with your role in the company.
Consider allowing your successor to shadow you at work once or twice a week so he or she can see what you do on a daily basis.
Talk to your management team to get assistance with getting your successor ready. Find out what skills and knowledge your managers have that they can transmit to your successor.
Develop leadership and mentoring programs to provide your successor with the guidance he or she needs to grow with the company. If your successor is your child, for example, you should start training him or her to take over from childhood., A succession plan designed several years ago may no longer fit your goals or the needs of your business.Your plan may need to be revised to reflect changes in tax laws, business climate or conditions, or changes in personnel.
Since you have a family business, changes in the family also may impact your succession plan and necessitate revision. For example, if your son and his wife were tapped to take over when you retired, you may have to revise that plan if your son gets divorced.

Make your first month's payment.",How to Satisfy ACA Healthcare Requirements As a Small Business," The SHOP marketplace is located under the ""Small Businesses"" tab at healthcare.gov. Click on ""For Employers"" to access information about the ACA and the marketplace, including tools and calculators.The SHOP marketplace is a listing of quality health and dental insurance plans from private insurers that meet the minimum requirements established under the ACA.
By using the marketplace, you can handle every aspect of your health plans online, through a single account with healthcare.gov.
The marketplace website has a number of detailed guides and fact sheets that you can use to understand the website and what you can do there.;
, Eligibility to use the SHOP marketplace is limited to employers with fewer than 50 FTE employees. To figure out how many FTE employees you have, get information about your employees and the hours they worked for you last year.First, find the number of full-time employees you have. For purposes of the ACA, a full-time employee is someone who works an average of 30 hours or more each week.
Average the number of hours each week that each part-time employee worked for you last year, then add those times together.
Divide that number by 30 and round any decimal result down to the nearest whole number.
Add the result from your equation to the number of full time employees you have to find the number of FTE employees you have.

, In addition to having between 1 and 50 FTE employees, you must satisfy a few additional requirements to maintain your ability to use the SHOP marketplace.The SHOP marketplace generally isn't available if you only have one employee, and that employee is your spouse or child – and you can't count yourself as an employee either.
You must enroll in a plan available in the state where your business has a primary business address, unless you have an employee whose primary workplace is in a different state than the state where your primary business office is located.
You must extend healthcare coverage to all employees who work an average of 30 hours a week or more.
Your state may have additional requirements, which you can find by reading the fact sheets available at the SHOP marketplace.

, If you have fewer than 25 FTE employees, you may qualify for a heath care tax credit than will cover up to 50 percent of the cost of your premiums.In addition to having 25 or fewer FTE employees, the average annual wage of those employees must be $50,000 or less to qualify for the credit.
To calculate average annual wages, add the total amount of wages you paid to all employees, then divide that number by the number of FTE employees you have.
The maximum credit amount available is 50 percent, but that percentage decreases depending on the number of employees you have.
The small business health care tax credit is fully refundable, and can be applied either backward or forward to reduce tax liability.

, You have the ability to view the plans in the marketplace and their prices before you start your application, so you can compare and choose the plan that's right for your business.Checking plans in advance is especially beneficial if you need to consult business partners, managers, or other employees before you make your final selection.
Plans are organized in the marketplace by metal level. You can evaluate bronze, silver, gold, and platinum plans.
While plans in each category offer the same coverage of essential medical services, they differ in terms of the amount of money your employees will have to pay out of pocket.
Plans with higher premiums tend to have lower out-of-pocket costs, including lower deductibles and smaller copays.

, The SHOP marketplace rules allow you either to offer a single plan for your employees, or to choose a category of plans and allow your employees to choose the plan they want from that category.If you have employees in more than one state, you'll have to decide whether you want to offer different plans in each state or the same plan for all employees.
If you choose to offer the same plan for employees in multiple states, make sure the plan you choose is provided by a national or multi-state provider network.
Offering employees in multiple states the choice of plans in a category operates the same as it would if all your employees were in one state.

, Even if you decide to offer a health plan to your employees, you aren't required to offer a dental plan as well, but you can if you feel so inclined. As with health plans, you can browse the plans available in your state before you commit.Dental plans are organized into two categories, high and low. As with health plans, each category corresponds to the amount of money your employees will have to pay out of pocket for dental care throughout the year.
You don't have to offer a health plan to offer a dental plan. However, if you offer dental and an employee wants to get dental coverage for a dependent, that employee must first enroll for dental coverage for themselves.
If you decide to offer both health and dental plans, employees can choose to opt in to either plan or none at all.

, As a small business owner, you have the power through the SHOP marketplace to control the percentage of your employees' premiums that you will pay.How you determine your contribution depends on how you plan to offer coverage. If you're offering a single, identified plan, you may choose what percentage of that premium you'll pay.
Keep in mind that each employee's actual premium cost may differ depending on their age.
If you are eligible for and plan on taking the small business health care tax credit, you must pay for at least 50 percent of your employee's premiums.
If you've decided to offer your employees a choice of plans within a certain category, you can either contribute a fixed percentage, or you can fix your contribution based on a reference plan.
When you use a reference plan, you set a percentage based on the premium of that plan, and that amount is the maximum dollar amount you'll contribute towards the employee's premium, regardless of the price of the plan they choose.
For example, if you choose to set your contribution using a reference plan that has a premium of $200, and you want to contribute 50 percent, your contribution would be $100.
Following that example, if an employee chose a plan in the same category with a premium of $150, you would still contribute $100, even though that would be more than 50 percent of that employee's premium.
The advantage of using a reference plan, however, is that you can be fairly well assured for budgetary purposes of the exact amount healthcare will cost your business.

, To enroll in a healthcare plan through the SHOP marketplace, you must create a healthcare.gov account for your business. Simply go to healthcare.gov, click on the employer tab, and select your state.If you own businesses in more than one state, you'll have to create your account in the state where you have your primary place of business.
You have the option of creating additional marketplace accounts in each state where your employees work, if you want to choose different plans for employees in each state.
Some states have their own websites to which you will be redirected after selecting your state from the list. The page will list the name of the state site you need to use to apply for coverage, and you'll be sent to that site when you click the ""apply now"" button.

, After you provide a few identification details, create a password, and answer a few security questions, you'll be directed to verify your email address and continue enrollment.Once your account is created, log in and select the employer marketplace from the welcome page. Review the personal information and change anything that's incorrect or add anything that's missing, then begin the identity verification process.
You must enter contact information and personal questions to verify your identity. The contact information and Social Security number you enter should be yours – don't enter the information and EIN for your business here.
After your identity is verified, you're ready to begin your SHOP marketplace application. Enter information about your business, including its legal business name, EIN, and type of business. Then you'll enter personal and contact information for the primary contact on the account.
Verify that you qualify to use the SHOP marketplace, and then enter details for every employee including yourself who will get a coverage offer.
It's important to ensure you have the correct email address for each employee so they can be directly notified by healthcare.gov about your offer of coverage.
You have the option of uploading an Excel file with your employees' information. Your spreadsheet should include each employee's full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number, and email address.

, Once your application and eligibility are verified, you begin the five-step process of selecting your plan and submitting your enrollment. By using the SHOP marketplace, you have control over all the details pertaining to enrollment, including the ability to set an enrollment period, waiting period, and start date for the coverage.The enrollment period is the amount of time your employees will have to look over the coverage offer and either accept or decline it.
Make sure your enrollment period provides enough time for your employees to make a decision, but that it will end soon enough that you have time to complete your enrollment before the start date you've selected for coverage to begin.
You then will provide details about the coverage you're offering and the plan or category of plans you've chosen.
After you've chosen your plans and entered the details about the coverage and your contribution to the premium cost, the SHOP marketplace will send an email to your employees with the coverage offer.
During the enrollment period, you can track employee participation and review which employees have responded and how many have accepted or declined the coverage.

, Each state has a minimum percentage of employees, out of those who are offered coverage, that must accept your offer of coverage if you want to enroll at any time.While these requirements differ among states, they typically are around 70 percent. You can use the SHOP marketplace's Minimum Participation Rate Calculator to determine how many employees you must enroll.
Employees who decline your offer of coverage because they already have insurance from another source count toward your minimum employee participation requirement.
You can track your progress towards meeting this goal by logging on to your healthcare.gov account and selecting ""my enrollment.""
If you don't manage to meet the minimum employee participation requirements, you can still enroll between November 15 and December 15 of any year. The minimum employee participation requirement is waived during that time.

, You must make the payment for the first month's premiums when you finalize your enrollment, or your employees' coverage may be delayed or your enrollment cancelled.Once your enrollment period has ended, you're ready to finalize and submit your enrollment. Payment of your first month's premium must be made at this time.
If your application is received by the 15th and your premium payment is made by the 20th of any month, your coverage can start as soon as the 1st of the next month.
Keep in mind that while you can use an agent or broker to complete your SHOP marketplace enrollment application, they will not be able to make premium payments for you.
When you enroll in a plan through the SHOP marketplace, you must make your premium payments through your healthcare.gov account, not directly to the insurer.
From your marketplace account, you can download and pay your invoice for insurance premiums each month.

, Are you looking at parts of a whole? For instance, say you are studying what percentage of the student population at university eats vegetarian, vegan, or pescetarian diets. Each of those categories is a portion of a larger whole, which in this case is the student population. Therefore, a pie chart would be great for representing this information.

, To represent your information in a pie chart, figure out what percentage each part of your whole is. For example:


Let’s say you have 1,000 students in the population. 50 are vegetarian; 10 are vegan; 100 are pescetarian. That means that 5% are vegetarian; 1% is vegan, and 10% pescetarian. The rest of the students, which make up 84% of the student population, are not in any of these categories, so they are grouped together as meat-eating.

, Fill in the numbers and the labels. Often, your word processing software will do the percentages for you, though it helps to know ahead of time what it will look like so you can check to make sure it’s correct.

, The biggest chunk of your pie chart should be the meat-eating category, followed by pescetarians, the vegetarians, and then the vegans.

All you have to do is contact the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) office on your base. They’ll tell you when and where the closest class with open spaces is located—attendance is completely free—and you tell them you want to come.You can find the TAP office on your base by going to http://www.militaryinstallations.dod.mil/ and going to the drop down box that says “looking for a specific program or service.” Find the TAP listing in the drop down box, and enter the name of your base or your zip code to go along with it.
You can look at a calendar of upcoming class dates and locations at http://boots2business.org/calendar/.;
, The very first part of the Boots to Business course consists of a short video that outlines the course in its entirety, summarizing the curriculum in the two day course and in the eight week course.If you want to get a head start, watch it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DslI835e2V8.

, Once you’ve registered for a two day course near you, report to the classroom and take the course. You’ll be covering the basics of entrepreneurship, including the steps to starting a business, the pros and cons, and resources available to veterans.The two day course is designed to cover the basics, so if you have any basic questions, like how to register a business, which type of business forms are best for you, or you need some help deciding what type of business to get into, this is the place to ask them.
Just like you would with any course, make sure you bring along a notebook and a couple pens. It's better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them.

, Once you’ve completed the two day course, you’ll have the opportunity to register for the full eight week course. Since this is an online course, you won’t have to worry about finding a place to take it.


The course is taught by real live instructors, and you’ll get a lot of individual attention. That’s great for the learning process, but it limits class size. You probably won’t be able to start classes for a week or two after registering. Register at http://boots2business.org/boots-to-business/boots-to-business-8-week-online-course-registration/.

, The Boots to Business program recommends you set aside at least ten hours per week to devote to the course—not counting class time. That works out to two hours per day if you’re working a five-day week, so the commitment is substantial., Since most of the eight week course is focused on making a business plan and other startup concerns, think about what why being a business owner is important to you. Do you want to make a million dollars or have a guaranteed job for the rest of your life? The answer will influence the type of business you start, because small business owners generally need high profit margins to become wealthy.


For example, Coca-Cola can afford a tiny profit margin on each bottle of Coke they sell, because they sell millions of bottles per year. You probably won’t be able to match that economy of scale, so if you want to make as much money as possible, consider a business with a high margin, like a financial or legal services company.

, Your Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) likely provided you with specialized skills, many of which transfer to civilian life. Do your best to synthesize the skills you have with your business interests. It will help you operate more efficiently from the get-go, which is an important factor in business success.Identify the core skill you learned in your MOS. Even the most militaristic of skills, such as infantry of intelligence work, have application in the civilian world. For instance, infantry NCOs have extensive experience in logistics management.
If you're having trouble, go to http://www.military.com/veteran-jobs/skills-translator/, and use the skills translator to get some ideas about how your MOS applies to civilian life.

, The meat of the eight week course entails creating a business plan. Since you’ll be getting guidance from business professors all along the way, it only makes sense to make the business plan for the actual business you’re planning on starting. It will allow you to make the most of the course. Hypotheticals have their place, but in this setting, it would be a waste of time. If you've decided how to apply your skills to a business and what you hope to gain from opening a business, you should be able to come up with a specific business plan your actual start-up.

, The professors teaching your course are experts in the field of business. As consultants, their services would probably cost hundreds of dollars an hour. You’re getting them for free, so make the most of it. You should make every attempt to make the business plan you present to the loan officers and venture capitalists the most polished and professional business plan they’ve ever seen. You should also treat the course as an opportunity to get feedback on ways to better market and operate your business. Certain strategies work well for certain businesses. For example, in retail, where the margins are low, it pays to aggressively market your business, because profit is strictly tied to volume.

, The Boots to Business program is only one of many entrepreneurship programs available to veterans, including loans, grants, mentorship, and material resources.


For example, veteran’s loans are fast tracked under the SBA’s Express loan program. In addition, the up-front loan origination and guaranty fees are substantially reduced.The Leveraging Information and Networks to Access Capital (LINC) is a fabulous resource for securing funding. Complete the online test (in the same format as a personality test) and the results will be used to match you up with potential lenders and grants. Start it at https://www.sba.gov/tools/linc

With that being said, be cautious about debt financing your start-up. There are many variables contributing to business success, and a number of them are unrelated to your efforts (like a stock market crash). It sounds harsh, but your success or failure is irrelevant to the lender. You’ll be obligated to pay no matter what.

, The Veteran’s Business Outreach Center provides additional training and financial counseling, while Score.org provides free mentorship training for veterans and new entrepreneurs. Rather than letting the Boots to Business program be the end of your business training, let it be the very beginning. The SBA will provide you with resources that will allow you to succeed far into the future. A search wizard which will tell you all the types of aid for which you are eligible is at https://business.usa.gov/veterans#.


Operation Endure and Grow is the follow up program to the Boots to Business program. Another eight week course, it focuses on continuing business operations rather than starting a business.Veterans are also eligible for aid to guide them through the Federal Contracting process, information that isn’t widely available to the public. Two of the biggest programs are the Government Contracting Classroom and the Federal Contractor Certification Program, which guides veteran owned businesses through the process of obtaining government contracts."

Know as much as you can about what you expect to get out the professional services.,

Get your understanding of the services to be rendered and any variations to this understanding in writing, signed by both sides.,
Ask for regular updates on billing costs.,
Negotiate payment stages with the professionals.,
Challenge any suspected overcharging.",How to Minimize the Costs of Professional Services for a Small Business," Although you might not be trained in their skills, you should know your own business inside out and also it pays to do basic research in the financial/legal/architectural etc., matters that they're advising you about so that you can ask relevant and lucid questions, as well as prove that you're not a pushover. Don't assume that they either understand your business well, or that they are even necessarily providing you with the right advice; be prepared to ask a lot of questions. Questions keep people honest and researching.;
, While it is likely that your budget will be far less than the one they're going to suggest to you, it starts the discussion point, it alerts them to the fact that you're not an endless pocket and that you're savvy about the value of the services. It also enables you start negotiating a compromise set of fees.

, Whether by formal contract or by exchange of letters, this is your rock solid alibi if things go badly astray.

, If you don't receive these updates, ring up or call in and ask to see the latest tallies on a frequent basis. This is much less worrying for you and will ensure that you don't receive surprise amounts in bills.

, If you'd rather pay in ongoing installments to reduce a hefty end fee, arrange this. Never stop negotiating about the fees as the services progress; always ask for discounts where things go wrong in their advice and ask them to rethink strategies in the provision of their advice that will reduce the costs to you. For example, instead of using a senior lawyer on your legal matter, ask for a junior lawyer who is still well versed in the topic.

, Go through all your invoices with an eye to detail. If you see anything that doesn't match your understanding of the services to be provided and the costs, bring it to their attention and challenge the need to pay for the discrepancy. Even if it wasn't wrong, sloppy invoicing can in itself result in a reduction of a professional's fees – their professional reputation is at stake after all.

Send a letter to your landlord.,
Arrange a private meeting.,
Discuss terminating your lease.,
Put any agreement in writing.",How to Terminate a Commercial Lease1," If you need to end your lease early and want to negotiate early termination with your landlord, send him or her a letter requesting a meeting to discuss the issue.Read your lease carefully before you contact your landlord, and make sure there isn't already an early-termination clause you should follow.
If your lease does contain an early-termination clause, but your situation doesn't meet the conditions of that clause, include that information in your letter so your landlord understands why you need to negotiate outside of the lease.
Your letter should be collegial, but professional. Approach your landlord as a fellow businessperson, and explain that you would like to negotiate an early termination of the lease agreement.
Depending on how long you've leased the property and your relationship to the landlord, you may want to attach a copy of your lease for reference.;
, Try to meet with your landlord in a neutral location that has a minimum of distractions so the two of you can talk without interruption.A neutral location means that neither you or your landlord have the upper hand as a result of your surroundings.
Make sure you have all the information and documentation you need in advance of the meeting so you're prepared for questions your landlord may have.
You may want to write an outline or checklist of issues you want to discuss to keep your negotiations on track and make sure you don't inadvertently leave out something important to you.
If you have a tense relationship with your landlord, or have had problems or disagreements in the past, you may want to suggest using a neutral third party as a mediator to facilitate your negotiations.

, Explain to your landlord the reasons you need to get out of the lease early, and listen to his or her concerns.Propose terms that come closest to satisfying most, if not all, of the issues presented by you and your landlord.
You and your landlord have a lot of flexibility to negotiate an agreement that best meets your needs. For example, you might offer to give up some or all of your security deposit in exchange for the ability to terminate your lease early.
Keep in mind that your landlord also is a businessperson, and his or her primary concern is not losing money on the property. Reaching an agreement with you will benefit your landlord in that he or she won't have to worry about chasing you down for the money or having a property sitting vacant for an extended period of time.
If you have another tenant in mind who is willing to take over your lease, you may be able to negotiate an assignment of the lease with your landlord so the new tenant can take over from you and fulfill your obligations under the lease in your stead.

, You and your landlord can always terminate a lease by agreeing to do so, but your agreement typically must be in writing to have any legal effect.If you have a written lease, its terms can only be changed with another written contract signed by both parties.
However, even if you don't have a written lease, writing out the terms you've negotiated for terminating the lease protects you and keeps your landlord from later changing the agreement or arguing the terms were different than you thought.
Both you and your landlord should read over the termination agreement carefully before signing it. Make sure you the terms make sense and reflect your understanding of the agreement.
Keep in mind that your lease agreement will be void on the date specified for the termination to take effect, so make sure any obligations related to the end of the lease also are included in your termination contract.
Once you're both happy with the written contract, print up two copies and sign and date each of them. That way you and your landlord each have an original copy of the agreement.

Use a bar graph to compare different categories.,
Set up the sides of your chart.,
Choose a way to refer to your variables.You can make creating a graph easier on yourself by choosing symbols to represent variables.,
Choose the increments you will use to graph your information.","How to Use Symbols, Lines, and Bars to Represent Different Variables2"," Maybe you want to look at how the number of vegetarian on campus compares to the number of vegans. Whatever your categories, you will need at least two of them to compare, though you can also use more than two.

, A bar graph uses colored bars to represent a certain amount. Therefore, both the bottom and the side represent different variables.


For instance, you could have one bar represent vegetarians and one bar to represent vegans. The left side will show the increments.

, For instance, if you are talking about pescetarians on campus, you can refer to them that way the first time, but you can also add a symbol or abbreviation to use later, such as “PoC.” Just be sure to make it clear in your paper what abbreviation goes with what variable.


You can do this for any form of presenting information, be it pie chart, bar graph, or line graph.

, Since there are only 60 vegetarians and vegans total on campus, going up in 5-person increments on the left side makes sense.


Therefore, the vegetarian bar will go up to 50 people, while the vegan bar will only go up to 10 people, showing that there are more vegetarians on campus.

Wait patiently for your score to rise.",How to Get a Perfect Credit Score," Most agencies use payment history, types of credit, and a ratio of debt to credit in order to calculate a credit score. If you want to get a perfect credit score, it's important to understand the specifics of how your score is calculated. Use this information to monitor your behavior and help you reach your goal.


Each agency computes your credit score in a slightly different way. However, the most important components measured are your payment history (which is an assessment of how consistent you've been in making your payments) and your indebtedness level (which measures how much credit you are using versus how much you qualify for).
Together, these two parts made up about two-thirds of your credit score.For more on how FICO scores (the most commonly-used credit score) are calculated, see how to understand your FICO credit score.;
, Go to annualcreditreport.com to get your free credit reports. This can be done for free once per year and provides you with credit reports from the three major credit agencies, which are Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.Many Web sites claim to offer a free credit report. These sites usually force you to join a credit monitoring service that charges a monthly fee. AnnualCreditReport.com is the only government-authorized site to get a free credit report.

, Mistakes happen and this could cost you your perfect score. Get a copy of your credit report and verify that the information pertaining to your accounts is correct. If you find an inaccuracy, make sure that you contact both the creditor and the credit bureau to have it removed from your account. Simply fixing inaccuracies can increase your credit score.


Inaccuracies may be misstated personal information, closed accounts still showing as open accounts, and falsely-reported payment conditions (like late or missed payments that didn't happen)., Most lenders have tiered lending levels that provide different interest rates to different credit score ranges. However, there are no special packages available for those with perfect credit, which is usually stated as a credit score of 850. In many cases, lenders extend their best offers to borrowers with a credit score of over about 760 or 780. So, at a practical level, having a perfect credit score is no more useful than have an ""excellent"" credit score., On-time payments are usually the most important part of your credit score. A late payment will decrease your credit score and will affect it for up to seven years. If possible, set up an automatic payment system with your creditors, allowing them to take their payment out of your account every month. This prevents late payments., Credit bureaus look at the ratio of your available credit limits to the amount of debt you have in order to determine your score. It's best to have a high amount of available credit with a low debt.


Try to use credit only for emergency expenses and pay of the balance as quickly as possible. This ensures a low debt to credit ratio.
If possible, keep your debt below 35 percent of your total available credit. When your debt surpasses this limit, it begins to reflect negatively on your score., There are two types of accounts that may be listed on your credit report. It's best to have a mixture of these two. If you only have one of the account types, your score may be lower.


Revolving accounts, such as credit cards, have a variable monthly payment based on how much credit you use.
Installment accounts, such as a mortgages and student loans, are loans for large amounts of money with a fixed payment each month.It's best to have one or two installment accounts and no more than four revolving accounts., Applying for new credit accounts frequently can have a negative impact on your credit score. This includes applying for loans, credit cards, and other forms of credit. However, it does not include requesting your credit reports on your own.Try to keep your new credit applications down in the range of one to three new applications in a six month period., Making it to a perfect credit requires planning and consistency. You'll have to follow the recommendations for improving your credit for decades to achieve truly perfect credit. Try to make responsible credit use a habit that you don't even think about. Pay your bills on the same days every month and track your expenditures and income carefully. Only by establishing a system will you be able to keep your credit together for the required amount of time., Lenders typically look at your debt to income ratio to determine your eligibility for a loan. In many cases, they look for debt payments under 25 percent of your after-tax income. For most people, this number represents fiscal responsibility. However, to have perfect credit, your percentage spent on debt will have to much lower, around 15 percent. Living more cheaply will also make paying your bills on time and in full easier., Having perfect credit means having a flawless credit history on your credit report. If you accidentally make a late payment, but you have a good payment history otherwise, consider calling your creditor to ask them not to report the late payment. In many cases, they will do this as a gesture of good faith.


Late payments will disappear from your credit report after seven years.
You will not be able to get a perfect score, or even a good one, if you have negative events like a bankruptcy or collections account on your credit report. These flaws can stay on your credit report for ten years, and may stay on it forever., Time is a necessary part of the equation to get a perfect credit score. You will need at least 10 years of positive credit before you can achieve the highest score. Part of your credit score calculation actually takes into consideration the age of your oldest credit account. For this reason, avoid switching accounts or closing old ones."

It can be accessed by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling 1-877-322-8228, or mailing your request to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-528. You will need your name, Social Security number, and address to access your report., Credit reporting agencies sometimes accidentally report multiple entries for the same debt on your credit report. In other cases, creditors report make the mistake of reporting the same debt to a reporting agency twice. Regardless of how it happened, you're left with a duplicate entry on your report that, if negative, can have negative consequence for your credit score and your ability to get a loan. If you think you see a double entry, double check documents related to the debt and the account numbers on the credit report., If you have defaulted on an account and your creditor has sold your debt to a collections agency, you will have multiple entries on your report for this debt. However, the reporting agencies do not consider this a duplicate and there is nothing you can do.But if the collections agency sells that debt to another party (as they often do), there may be one or many more additional entries on your credit report that should not be there.
Entries from multiple collections agencies (those no longer own your debt) can and should be removed., Multiple student loan debts may be reported on your credit report because each disbursement (each school year or semester) counts as a separate debt. Unless there are true duplicates (multiples of the same disbursement), there is no need to worry about having many student loan entries on your credit report., You will need documentation of the duplicate entries. You should make copies of the duplicate entries on your credit report. You should also include any statements or contracts you have with the lender, or any other documents related to your debt that can help prove that the entry is a duplicate. This information should be included with your letter., Start by addressing the letter and writing a header. This will include both your information and that of your recipient. Include the following:


Your name
Address
City, State, Zip
Date
Recipient's Name
Title
Company Name
Street Address
City, State, Zip
Re: Recipient's name, Write that you are disputing what you believe to be a duplicate entry. Include the company or account names as stated on the credit report, as well as the amount of the debt.For example:In reviewing the attached credit bureau report, I have detected an error. The following account and/or entry is a duplicate of the same debt. I have attached a copy of this error.

, You will need to make it clear that you are requesting that the duplicate entry be eliminated. Make your request as clear and actionable as possible. Remind your recipient that they have 30 days to investigate the dispute and respond under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).For example: My credit report shows that you have submitted a duplicate of the same account. Under the provisions of the 1977 Fair Credit Reporting Act, I hereby request that your agency fix my account. As stated in the Act, I am giving you a 30 day notice as of this letter's due date to fix this issue. This letter was sent certified mail, return receipt requested. I expect a response within the 30 day period, with proof of action from you. I request a copy of my new error-free credit report by mail a letter from you stating that the account is fixed and error free.

, Include your own contact information so that the bureau may contact you. Write in your email address, phone number, and appropriate hours at which they may call you. You can also simply ask that they respond by mail, but keep in mind this is the slowest option.

, Call or send your letter to the creditor related to the duplicated debt entry. The duplicate may simply be a case of the creditor accidentally reporting the debt twice. Alternately, they may say that there is no error on their end, meaning that you should contact the credit reporting agencies to get the duplicate removed., The three credit reporting agencies are Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Visit their respective websites to learn where exactly you need to send your letter and to whom it should be addressed. Make sure you sent your letters via certified mail.Keep a copy of your letter., The creditor or credit reporting agency has 30 days to respond to your dispute. If you still have not heard anything at this time, contact each party and check to see if any changes have been made and, if they haven't, what the problem is. You may need to call them or write a follow-up letter. Keep documentation of all of these communications in case you have to build a court case later., Failure to respond within 30 days is a violation of FCRA. If you still haven't heard from the credit reporting agencies or creditors after writing follow-up letters and waiting another few weeks, hire a consumer law attorney. You can take your case to court and then have a chance to win monetary compensation to cover your attorney and court costs, as well as damages. You will also get the entries on your credit report corrected."

Review your lease.,
Send your landlord written notification.,
Make any required payments.,
Vacate the premises.,
Follow up with your landlord.",How to Terminate a Commercial Lease2," If your landlord allows you to terminate your lease early, the terms and conditions under which early termination are allowed typically will be included as a clause in the original lease agreement you signed.The early-termination clause will specify what you must do if you want to get out of your lease. Read these terms carefully and calculate the amount you will owe your landlord if you terminate your lease early under the clause.
Commercial leases may include a provision that allows for early termination only under certain conditions, such as a failure to meet income projections. If the clause in your lease includes conditions, you'll have to evaluate your situation to see if you meet them.

, Early termination clauses in leases typically require you to provide notification at least 30 days in advance of the date you want to terminate your lease.The amount of notice required by an early-notification clause typically depends on the length of the lease as a whole. While you may only have to give 30 days' notice to terminate a year-long lease, the notice period may be as long as six months if you have a five-year lease.
Reference the clause in the lease that you're using, and restate that clause's requirements.
For example, you might write: ""I want to terminate my lease early, in accordance with Paragraph 7.4 of the lease agreement. This letter constitutes the 30 days' notice of that intention as required by that clause. I understand I also must pay you two months' rent on or before the day I vacate the premises.""
Attach a copy of your lease to your letter, or at least the page with the early termination clause, as reference.

, Most early-termination clauses require you to pay a couple months' rent, or buy out a percentage of the remaining lease, often depending on how much time you have left.Early-termination clauses often require you to reimburse your landlord for any costs he or she incurs to turnaround the property so it is suitable to lease to a new tenant, and may require you to relinquish any claim to your security deposit.
Typically the clause will include a method of calculating the total amount of money you owe your landlord, but you may want to request a written accounting and statement for your records rather than just sending your landlord a check.

, Once you've set the clause in motion, you must leave the leased property by the agreed date or you may have to pay additional charges.Generally, you want to aim to leave the property in the same condition it was in when you took it over.
Your landlord can't charge you for normal wear and tear, which may be significant if you've operated in that location for several years.
However, you want to arrange to make repairs to anything such as a hole in the wall or marks left by fixtures you installed that wouldn't constitute normal wear and tear.

, Within a specified period of time, typically 30 days, your landlord must assess damages on the property and provide you with an itemized list of deductions to your deposit.Your landlord may charge you a fee to terminate your lease early. However, by law this fee can't exceed the costs the landlord actually incurs as a result of your lease termination.
You may be entitled to a refund if, for example, your landlord is able to re-rent the space you leased within a short period of time after you leave.
However, keep in mind that your landlord is unlikely to voluntarily issue you a check without prompting. If you see new tenants moving into the space within a few weeks after you left, send your former landlord a letter and ask for an accounting of costs.

Send notice to your landlord.,
Vacate the premises.,
Assist in finding a new tenant.,
Make payment arrangements.",How to Terminate a Commercial Lease3," If you are unable to work out an agreement with your landlord but still must leave the property, provide your landlord with at least 30 days' notice that you are leaving.You always have the option to simply break the lease – even if your landlord makes statements to the contrary.
However, keep in mind that breaking your lease without an early termination agreement may end up costing you more money as well as potentially causing bad blood between you and your landlord.
Make sure you read your lease agreement carefully. While residential leases typically require 30 days' notice if the tenant wants to break the lease, commercial leases may require 60 or 90 days' notice.

, Leave the leased space in a clean condition free of any personal property or debris, and hand off the keys to your landlord by the date you gave in your notice.Once you've left the property, you may be responsible for continuing to pay rent – at least until your landlord finds a new tenant – but you won't be responsible for the property itself.
If your landlord has an inspection form, review it before you leave to make sure you won't be on the hook for any repairs.
You also can create your own inspection checklist and look over the condition of the walls, floors, windows, and other main features of your space.
Generally, you should aim to leave the premises in the same condition as they appeared when you first moved into the space – minus normal wear and tear.
Keep in mind that any fixtures or other property you leave in the space after you've left typically are considered abandoned and become the property of your landlord. Don't leave anything behind that you want to keep, because you may forfeit the right to remove it or have it returned.

, Although your landlord can hold you liable for the entire amount of remaining lease payments, he or she has a legal duty to mitigate those damages by finding someone else to lease the property.If your landlord is unable to find a tenant to rent the place at the same or higher rent than you paid, you may be liable for the rent for the remainder of the lease – or the difference between your rent and the rent the new tenant is paying.
This may be a problem if the rental market is stagnant, leaving you on the hook for far more money than you would be if businesses are booming and there's a high demand for commercial spaces like yours.
You can help lower your costs by finding a suitable tenant to take your place. However, keep in mind that your landlord does have the right to refuse to lease to someone who doesn't meet his or her requirements.

, In addition to retaining the entire amount you provided as a damage deposit, your landlord may require additional money from you for breaking your lease early.If your landlord is uncooperative, or is threatening to sue you for a substantial amount of money, you may want to get a business lawyer involved to protect your financial interests.

Benchmark your company against competitors.",How to Measure Company Growth1," If you have goals to meet, not only do you have something to strive for, but you have something to measure against. When setting your objectives for your company, don't set yourself up to fail. Be realistic about what you can achieve so that you can be successful at achieving it. In the same way, don't lower your expectations so that you can easily accomplish your objectives. Set objectives that are both realistic and challenging.


Goals may include objectives like increasing market share or retaining more clients.Consider splitting your goals into short term and long term goals, which refer to goals achievable in under a year and those achievable in over one year, respectively.
A good way to check your goals is to make them conform to the acronym SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-Bound).;
, Your business plan should reflect the objectives that you have for your company, as well as the methods you plan to apply in trying to achieve them. When measuring company growth, you will consult your business plan to not only see if you have managed to achieve objectives, but also confirm that you have successfully followed the plan that you set out for your business.


If necessary, put together additional methods to measure the growth variables that you have selected.

Having an outside consultant look at your organization can provide you with a fresh perspective that can identify problems you might have missed.

The only determination that matters for the purposes of the SDVOSBC is a determination made by the Department of Defense or the Department of Veteran’s Affairs.A service-connected disability isn’t necessarily confined to a physical wound. Psychological wounds, such as those precipitating a diagnosis of PTSD also count.
If you haven’t yet been certified by the VA or DoD as disabled, read the guide at Understand and Request Veterans' Benefits
;
, In addition to demonstrating your disability, you also need to show the company seeking the contract is both owned and run by a service disabled veteran or veterans. Specifically, you’ll need to show that:The service disabled veteran must own at least 51% of the company outright.
A service disabled veteran is the highest officer in the company.
The service disabled veteran controls management and daily company operations.
All of the above can be demonstrated by providing the company charter, such as its articles of incorporation and bylaws.

, The small business size standards are determined by industry, so there are no blanket rules applying to all businesses. However, in the most general terms, a manufacturing or mining concern with less than 500 employees will qualify, and a nonmanufacturing concern with less than $7.5 million in revenue will qualify.The easiest way to determine if you qualify is by going to the SBA’s Size Standards Tool, located at https://www.sba.gov/tools/size-standards-tool?ms=nid4060.

, The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is a standardized method of business classification according to economic sector and industry. If you’d like to become a government contractor eligible for the SDVOSBC set asides, you’ll have to know your NAICS number.A NAICS number is six digits long.

Registering at https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11 is a mandatory step if you want to get a government contract. In addition to the above information, you’ll need to create a username and password for the SAM site. In addition, the following information will help government entities find you.Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. A SIC code is a lot like an NAICS number, except used by the Department of Labor. You can find the SIC code for your company at https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html

Understand your credit report and score.,
Go online and get a free copy of your credit report.,
Check to see if there are any errors on your credit report.,
Clean up any old small debts.",How to Get a Higher Credit Score Fast1," Your credit report is a record of your financial past, including any loans, bills, credit cards, or other debts you've had and whether or not you made the proper payments on each account. Your credit score is derived from this information and is a numerical representation of your credit risk. In other words, it shows a potential lender your trustworthiness in repaying your debts. Credit scores range from 300 to 850, with a lower score indicating less creditworthiness and a higher score indicating more.


Most financial professionals recommend a credit score of at least 700. Scores at this level or above allow a borrower to get lower interest rates on loans and credit cards than other people with lower credit scores.
Your credit score is also affected by a number of other factors, including how much you owe in relation to your available credit, the length of your credit history, the variety of your credit sources (whether or not you have several types of credit, including loans and credit cards), and recent credit inquiries (more requests for credit may lower your score).;
, You are entitled to one free report every year from each of the three main credit report agencies (TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax).


Ideally, you should do this regularly, at least once a year. Since the first time is free with every agency you can get a credit report as often as once every four months without paying. . Should you need a further report, be prepared to pay.
You may want to get a report from each of the three agencies, at least the first time, as they will not necessarily match.This is usually nothing to worry about and just the result of minor discrepancies in reporting, but it is good to know what information is out there.
Remember, your credit report is not the same as your credit score. It is the information that is used to calculate your credit score, but will not include the actual three-digit number you may be curious about. However, you can pay the agencies to provide that if you choose., Even very small mistakes can make a significant difference if they're not caught. This is one of the easiest ways to turn a low credit score around.


Contact any smaller credit and collection agencies on your credit report and ask them to verify the debts they are claiming. If they are not able to show that it was you, at that particular address, who defaulted on the payment, you can ask that they remove the claim from your report. This will improve your credit score immediately.
The same applies for companies that merged or closed down — if the information about you cannot be provided, you can request for it to be removed and therefore improve your credit score almost instantaneously.
For more information, see how to get an error off of your credit rating.

, An old missed payment that went to a collection agency could be causing you trouble. Take the opportunity to check your history and get everything in order.


Make partial or full payments of any remaining standout debts. Even putting some money toward the payment of a debt will make you look better in the eyes of creditors. Collection agencies will be happy to work with you, and will appreciate your efforts.

Be personable.,
Sell yourself.,
Be available.,
Do your research.,
Know your price tag.,
Wait to discuss the salary.,
Don't be angry.,
Be flexible.",How to Negotiate an Offer1," The person interviewing you wants to connect with you. If you're too cold, it's a turn-off. Be polite and diplomatic, but don't be afraid to open up a little bit. If your interviewer connects with you, she'll be more willing to hire you and to consider what you want for a salary.As an example, if your employer comments on how hot it is, instead of saying, ""Yes, it is."" offer a more personable response, such as ""I know! It's sweltering. Maybe we should try to fry an egg on the sidewalk."";
, Show why the company needs you by giving examples of how your skills match up with the company's needs. The more the company needs you, the more the employers will be willing to negotiate a better salary.For instance, if the company is looking for someone with good writing skills, say something like, ""I have ample experience in written communication. I minored in English in college, which is why my last employer often turned to me when she needed something official written, such as a letter to our customers.""

, Be clear that you want to work for the company, and they can get you for the right price.To clarify it for the interviewer, you could say, ""I am excited about what your company is doing, and I feel like I could be an asset here, as soon as we work together to find the right financial balance both of us can agree on.""

, Find out about the company, but also find out about the person interviewing you, if possible. The more you know, the better you will be able to connect with him or her.If you know the person interviewing you loves camping, you could bring up your love of camping at the start of the meeting to help connect with him or her.

, You can find average salaries on the internet, taking into account your education and experience level. Knowing the average salary will give you an idea of what you can ask for in a salary., The only time you should discuss salary is when you are sure they want to hire. You'll know they're ready because they say they want to make an offer to you.If you don't wait, you may estimate too high or too low. If you estimate too high, you'll be pushed out of the interview process, but you may estimate too low if you don't know exactly what the job entails.Let them make the first offer. It gives you a starting point, and you can negotiate from there., If the price tag is lower than you want, turn on the charm instead of getting angry. You may still be able to negotiate it higher, and anger will only cut off the negotiations.For example, if the company offers a salary that is too low, you could say, ""I appreciate that offer, and I am definitely excited to work here. However, I do think we need to discuss the salary some more. What do you think of (insert counter offer)?""

, You may not get the salary you want, but you might be able to get other benefits, such as more vacation time or a flexible schedule. Your interviewer may have more authority to approve these types of benefits than to give you a salary above the price range she must work in.You can also negotiate for a one time sign-on bonus.To negotiate other options, you can say something like the following: ""I understand you don't have much wiggle room on the salary, but do you think we could come up with some other kind of compensation? For instance, could I have extra vacation time instead?""

Assess your customer base and determine whether that has increased.,
Compute revenue growth.,
Calculate workforce growth.,
Find your market share growth.",How to Measure Company Growth2," Not only are you looking for more customers, but you should be seeing better quality customers. Your customer base should be bringing in more profit. This means you are seeking to gain repeat customers and build customer loyalty.


Customer value is often measured as customer lifetime value (CLV). This figure is calculated by multiplying the average sale value by the number of repeat transactions and then multiplying that total by the average retention time of each customer.The result of the CLV calculation should be regularly recorded and businesses should seek to increase it often time.
This can be measured by customer surveys, purchase analysis, or by immediate feedback (""is this your first time shopping with us?""). Systems need to be implemented to measure these variables., Revenue growth is one of the simplest ways to measure company growth over a period of time. Typically, growth is measured using the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). This calculation is particularly useful for summarizing growth over longer time frames, like 5, 10, or 20 years.The CAGR equation is as follows: CAGR = final value divided by starting value times 1 over number of periods less 1 or (FV/SV)1/n-1.
The beginning value here would be revenue in the first year in the range being calculated and ending value would be revenue in the last.
For a longer explanation of how to calculate CAGR, see how to calculate compounded annual growth rate.

, Keep track of new hires for the year and compare them to previous years. A growing company should continue to hire new employees as it expands. You can also express this figure as a percentage by dividing the number of new hires in a year by the total number of employees at the beginning of that year.

, Market share is a company's portion of the total value of their given industry. It is calculated by dividing the company’s total revenues by the total revenues in an industry over a period of time by the company's revenue over the same period. This period can be a quarter, a year, or several years.


Growth can be determined by calculating the company's market share in several different periods and looking for growth or shrinkage in that company's share of the market.For example, if you are researching a company in a $1 billion market and that company had revenues of $150 million in 2014 (15 percent of the market) and $170 million in 2015 (17 percent of the market), their market share has increased 2 percent in the past year.

Calculate the company's book value.,
Measure market capitalization.,
Find cash flow growth.,
Calculate the price/earnings (PE) ratio.",How to Measure Company Growth3," The company's book value represents the difference between the company's assets and liabilities. In simpler terms, it represents the net value of all of the company's property, or what the company would be able to sell itself for if it were forced to liquidate quickly. To calculate book value, add up the company's assets, including current assets, fixed assets, and debts owed to the company, and then subtract liabilities, like unpaid bills and loan balances outstanding., For publicly traded companies (companies who sell stock to the public), market capitalization (market cap) is a measurement of the total value of the company's outstanding stock. It is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of outstanding shares. Market cap is often used to measure a company's growth over time and is the most common indicator of a company's size used by financial professionals.The information needed to calculate market cap can be found in the company's annual report and on any stock-trading or stock market news website.
For more on market cap, see calculate the market value of a company.

, Cash flows show how much actual money a company is earning. They are often used by financial professionals to determine the value of a company. This is done through the process of discounted cash flow analysis, in which future cash flows are extrapolated to determine a value for the company. Measure current cash flows against past cash flows to determine whether or not the business remains solvent.Discounted cash flow analysis involves projecting future free cash flows for an investment or company. These cash flows are then ""discounted"" back to the present at a set discount rate. This discount rate reflects the time value of money (reflects the idea that an amount of money today is worth more than that same amount of money in the future).
The discounted cash flows are then compared to the present cost of the investment to determine whether or not that investment is a good one., For a publicly-traded company, the PE ratio represents the premium paid for the company's stock. That is, it is the current stock price divided by the average earnings per share over the last twelve months. A high result from this calculation means that investors expect that the company will increase in value in the future. Conversely, a low value may represent lower or negative growth expectations.For more on calculating the PE ratio, see how to calculate the PE ratio.

Calculate gross margin growth.,
Find profit growth.,
Evaluate your staff and consider their level of business growth.,
Analyze changes in your customer acquisition cost.",How to Measure Company Growth4," The gross margin is simply the difference between the company's revenue and its cost of goods sold (or cost of services provided). This represents how effectively the company is converting raw materials into finished products. Look for this metric to improve over time as the company streamlines its production process., Net profit, also called net income or simply profit, is the ""bottom line"" of the company. It measures the company's earnings after all expenses and taxes have been subtracted from revenue. Profits are then used to either pay dividends or are reinvested in the company. Profits, like revenues, are often measured using the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). This allows companies to show their averaged profit growth over time, rather than focusing on individual years.To calculate CAGR for profits, see calculate CAGR.

, Compare staff levels, turnover and performance, and determine whether those areas have shown improvement. Assess whether or not increases in workforce have led to equivalent increases in productivity. This can be applied to any department. For examples, sales productivity is calculated as the company's revenue divided by the number of salespeople., The customer acquisition cost measures how much you have to spend on marketing and sales to earn the business of a new customer. This is found by dividing these costs (sales and marketing) by the number of new customers over a set period of time.


A reduction in this cost is evidence that you are building a recognized brand. It also can show you if you are overspending on sales and marketing (if additional spending in these areas fails to bring a similar increase in new customers)."

To achieve these goals, it may be helpful to create a budget. This will help you to save money in other areas of your life so that you can pay down your debt as quickly as possible.

, Maybe you have several credit cards and debt on each card. Not all debt is equal in this case, as cards with high debt to limit ratios are penalized more on your FICO credit score than cards with lower debt to limit ratios.


What is a debt to limit ratio? Also called credit utilization, it's a measurement of how much debt you have on your card versus how much you are allowed to spend.A credit card with $900 of debt and a credit limit of $1,000 has a very high debt to limit ratio, one of 90%.
Ideal credit utilization rates are under 10%. If you can get your total debt to under 10% of your available credit, you've done very well. This should be your target debt level, even if it might take you a while to get there. In general, keeping your utilization under 30% is healthy.
Transfer debt from one card to the next. If you have one card with a high limit and another card with a high debt-load, consider transferring some of the debt over from one card to the other. This might help massage the credit utilization. Keep an eye on whether you would be accepting higher interest rates, and make sure to look at your options carefully.

, If your credit score is less than stellar, this is going to be more difficult, but applying for a limit increase will lower your total credit utilization and improve your credit score.Gather any supporting documents that might demonstrate why you should be given a credit increase (a pay increase, for example) and make your case to someone over the phone.
Be careful, however, as a limit increase request may cause your credit score to go down by a few points. If the credit card company needs to make a credit score check in order to authorize a limit increase, call the request off!

Pay bills on time.,
Use credit cards regularly and responsibly.,
Compare different card types.,
Get a loan that you can repay easily.,
Use your resources.",How to Get a Higher Credit Score Fast3," About 35% of your credit score is determined by your payment history— whether you paid your bills on time. If you have any bills that you haven't yet paid, find a way to pay them off.


Your credit score gets dinged each time you have a late payment, and then dinged again each time your payment is 30 days late and each time your payment is 90 days late.

, You should use your credit card or cards for small purchases and pay off the balance at the end of the month. This shows that you can borrow small amounts of money (what the card provides for convenience when you're at the grocery store) and be relied on to pay it back when you pay your bills at the end of the month.


Start using old credit cards again. If you have a credit card that you don't use anymore, the credit issuer may simply decide so stop reporting the account to the credit bureaus. That doesn't sound horrible, until you realize that accounts with a longer history actually improve your overall credit score.So get out your old card, put a small recurring monthly payment on it, or use it every so often to go to the movies. Pay off your debt in full each month.

, Prepaid credit cards don't get reported to credit bureaus. You may be thinking that paying for a credit card up front will give you an easy way to boost your credit score. Think again. Prepaid credit cards do not get reported to the three major credit bureaus and will not help boost your FICO credit score.However, a secured credit card may help you improve your score. This is a credit card with collateral (that becomes the credit limit) and it can be used to improve your credit score, so long as you use it responsibly.A credit card is an agreement: you are allowed to use a certain amount of money, as long as you promise to return it. A prepaid card is just like a transfer of your money into a different account. It won't show future creditors how you handle the contract of promising to pay back what borrow.
The difference here could be considered technical, as the collateral you put forth for a secured credit card will cover your credit limit. However, it will be in a separate account, and rather than being spent as you use the card, it will be a final resort for the bank if you fail to pay back what you owe.
Not all banks offer secured cards, but many do. See if your bank or credit union offers a card that will help you improve your standing.

, If you know you'll be able to pay it off, a small personal loan can increase your credit score. About 10% of your FICO credit score is what's called ""account mix,"" or basically how many different loans and credit accounts you have. If you take out a small loan and are able to pay it back quickly and responsibly, this will help your credit score.


Only take out a loan that you know, with certainty, you'll be able to pay back. If it takes several months or years for you to manage the loan, don't bother. Interest rates could eat up any remaining cash, making it harder for you to finish paying off the loan, and increasing your debt. This is simply to increase your credit, not to add more money to your accounts.
Join a credit union and apply for a loan there instead of at a bank. A credit union is owned by the members and will often be more understanding about lending small amounts of money to working families.
See if you can get a small loan through an online peer-to-peer network to establish your credit. Since the decision of these loans will be made by your peers, there is a higher chance of being approved.

, A low credit score doesn't mean all your financial opportunities are lost. Especially when seeking a loan, make sure you consider potential areas of assistance.


If you own a home but have fallen into debt, check if the value of the property has gone up recently. You may be able to borrow against the equity of your home in order to get the small responsible loan that will increase your credit score.
Ask a family member for help. Someone you know who has better credit than you can assist you in this situation. Have them co-sign a loan with you. This will guarantee to the bank that it will be repaid, and allow you the chance to show reliability. Of course, you need to prove to your friend or family member that you are as good as your word to get them to sign!

Do your research.,
Don't be afraid to ask for a lower price.,
Determine a target price.,
Talk to the right person.,
Be open.,
Don't accept the first offer.,
Take a moment of silence.,
Accept other compensation.,
Be persistent.",How to Negotiate an Offer2," Know what a fair price is for what you're buying. You can use comparison sites or simply look up prices on some of the major retail sites. For cars, you can find the approximate value on Kelley Blue Book.Check out the price of what you're buying at competing stores and dealerships.Think about profit margin. You're seller may be willing to mark the item down more if they have a high profit margin. For instance, you may be able to find out how much a dealership actually pays for a car, which gives you room for negotiation., You may not feel like you can negotiate in a certain situation, but it never hurts to try. You may be able to get away with it in smaller, locally owned stores especially.For instance, at a local store you could say, ""I really like this item, but I was wondering if you ever give discounts for items like this one?""

, Know what you're willing to pay, and don't go above it. If the seller wants you to pay more, you can always walk away., Make sure the person you are negotiating with has the authority to cut you a deal. If he or she doesn't, you may need to go higher., You don't have to guard all your secrets. Opening up a bit will create trust and a rapport with the person. Essentially, you're creating a relationship, and that will benefit you, as it will make the person more likely to give into you.As an example, you could talk about why you're shopping for a new car. Maybe you just lost your old one, or you need to buy one for your mother.

, Negotiating means making counter offers, and both of you will be happier if you feel like you settled on a fair price. Don't be afraid to offer another price.For instance, you could say, ""That's a good offer but not quite what I'm looking to pay. Would you take (insert offer)?""

, That is, stop talking for a few minutes to consider the offer because silence makes people uncomfortable. The seller will try to fill the space and may talk him- or herself into accepting a lower price., You may not get the exact price you want, but the seller may be willing to throw something else in, such as a free gift. If you're trying to buy a car, maybe you can negotiate free oil changes at the dealership., Don't give up just because you're tired, and don't signal to the other side that you're ready to stop unless you have the deal you want. The seller will zero in on that weakness and try to get you to accept the deal as is."
"
Pick a good time.,
Know what you really want.,
Let yourself be vulnerable.,
Be willing to listen as much as you talk.,
Be specific about your problems if you're trying to negotiate a better relationship.,
Don't be afraid to laugh.,
Work together.",How to Negotiate an Offer3," Don't start in negotiating about where you're going on vacation if your spouse is trying to deal with cooking dinner or getting the kids ready for school. Choose a quiet time when you are both calm, and have time to talk it out., When it comes to negotiating with a family member, it will be necessary for you to make compromises to preserve the relationship. That means that you need to know where you will stand firm and what you're willing to give up., When you're negotiating with someone you love, you have much more at stake than with a stranger. Don't be afraid to be open and honest with the person, as more communication will lead to you both understanding what the other person wants., Really listen to what the other person has to say. Even if you can't give into everything he wants, you should let him know that you hear and understand what he's feeling., That is, instead of blaming the other person, discuss your feelings, and be specific.For instance, instead of saying ""You're so annoying sometimes."" you could say, ""When you play your music so loudly, I find it hard to concentrate.""

, A little levity can lighten up the situation. However, don't take it too far, as your family member or friend may think you're not taking them seriously., That is, take some time to think through the problem together. Maybe you can come up with a creative solution that makes both sides happy.Don't forget that in every relationship, you're on the same team. Try not to pit yourself against the other person."

Review the credit agreement before completing or signing the application.,
Provide your personal information.,
Give your employment history.,
Provide your financial information.,
Submit the form and authorization to a financial institution.,
Wait for an answer.",How to Fill Out a Credit Application1," The credit agreement is usually found in the last section of the application. It outlines the terms and conditions to the consumer as required by the Federal Law Consumer Disclosure Act and explains the binding agreement between you and the issuer.


Pay attention to the APR (annual percentage rate) and the late charge penalties (i.e. the amount you pay if you make a late payment).
If you are unsure about any of the terms or have any questions, contact the card issuer before you start filling out the application.;
, The application will ask you for your personal information. The issuer is looking to see if you have a stable residence, and if you are who you say you are. Information that you will typically provide includes:Name - Last, first, middle, surname, maiden name.
Address including city, state, and zip code
Phone numbers - Primary and secondary numbers.
The length of time you have lived at your current residence
Previous address and the length of time you lived there.
Email address - Sometimes optional, but most financial institutions are going paperless and will insist.
Your Social Security number is mandatory to secure credit. The number will be used for identification purposes and to obtain credit history.

, If you are currently unemployed, your application will probably not be approved. A solid employment history demonstrates that you are responsible and have the ability to make payments. The longer you have been at the same job, the better. The application will ask for the:Name of your employer
Your position
Length of employment - Start date and end date.
The type of business - Education, financial, food service, etc.
Address and phone number of business
You may have to provide information for your last few employers

, Your financial information is one of the most important parts of your application. The issuer wants to know if you are financially stable and the percentage of your income that you spend on housing. It looks more favorable if you have a higher income, own a home instead of rent, and have multiple bank accounts. Typical information includes:Annual income - Household.
Bank information - Checking, savings, money market or IRA.
Residence - Do you rent or own?
Monthly rent or mortgage payments.

, Review the application and correct any errors or omissions. Sign and date your application, stating the information you gave is correct. Send it in online or mail in the application., The three outcomes for your application are accepted, referred, or declined. If everything checks out, your application will be accepted and you will receive your credit card within 2 weeks. If your application is referred, the issuer needs more information before a decision can be made and will likely contact you.If your application has been declined, read the rejection letter to determine the reason. Common reasons for rejection are:You made a mistake on your application.
There is a problem with your work history or financial information. If you have changed jobs recently or are unemployed, your application may be denied. Consider reapplying when your income increases, or you have been employed for 6 months.
There is a problem with your credit report. If you have credit problems such as low credit score, late payments, error on your credit report, or multiple inquiries into your credit, you may be denied.

Read the fine print.,
Visit your credit company's website.,
Time it right.",How to Extend a Line of Credit1," Sit down with your contract, and read through the terms and conditions. See what the contract says about increasing your credit limit. You might find that you qualify for an automatic boost if you fulfill certain conditions. For example, if you pay the minimum balance for six months in a row, your limit may automatically increase.This information may be under a heading such as ""Credit and Advance Limits,"" ""Important Terms of Your Account,"" or ""Changes to Your Agreement.""
There may be a line in your contract that states ""We have the right to change your credit limit at any time."" While this technically means that your company can decrease your limit, it also means that you are free to ask for an increase at any time.;
, You might already qualify for a credit increase. Log in to your account on your credit company or bank's website. Look for a link similar to ""Request a credit limit increase."" Click it to see if you qualify. You will be taken to an application or request system, which you will have to fill out. Depending on your bank, approval may be instantaneous or it may take a few days.

, Most credit companies will automatically boost your line of credit after six months. If six months have passed and you have not received a bump in your credit line, it may be time to ask for an increase. Once you have attained that initial increase, you can ask for a credit increase roughly every two years.Never wait until your credit is at its limit to increase or extend a line of credit. If you have maximized your limit, you might find it difficult to get a credit increase. This is because banks and credit companies prefer customers who use only a small percentage of their credit limit and who pay off their full balance.

, After you get the copy of your report, you should review each section and make a notation of the information that you would like to dispute.

, Your dispute will be more effective if you have evidence that an error was made. For example, if you see that a credit card payment is listed as more than 60 days past due, then you should see if you have cancelled checks that show payment was made and accepted before that date.

, You may dispute a credit report error online by visiting the website of the one of the three credit reporting agencies. Before beginning, be prepared to provide the credit report number on the credit report that you wish to dispute.


Equifax’s online dispute system is available by clicking on the “Credit Report Assistance” tab at the top and selecting “Dispute info on credit report.”Experian’s online dispute system is available by clicking “Disputes” under the “Consumer Assistance” heading.TransUnion’s online dispute system may be found by clicking on the “Credit Reports, Disputes, Alerts & Freezes” tab at the top of the page., An alternative to making a dispute online is to send one through the mail.

In your letter, you should include the following:Your personal information, including name, address, birth date, and Social Security Number.
A description of the entries on your credit report that you believe are inaccurate. State the facts and why you are disputing the information. You can also provide a copy of the report with the entries highlighted.
A request to correct or delete the entry.

, After you draft the letter mail it to the appropriate agency by certified mail, return receipt requested. That way, you can track it and be assured that the agency has received it. The address for each major credit reporting agency is here:

Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022., The agency may request additional information from you. Be sure to provide any requested information promptly, and send copies (not originals).


Always keep copies of any communications that you have with a credit reporting agency.

, The credit reporting agency is required to investigate the dispute within 30-45 days of its filing.In doing so, the credit reporting agency will forward the information you provide to the organization that reported the information.The provider of the information (usually a creditor) must then investigate the disputed information and report results back to the credit reporting company. If the company finds that the information is inaccurate, then it must notify all three national credit reporting agencies.Once the investigation has been completed, the credit reporting agency must send you the results in writing. It must also send you a written notice that contains the name, address, and phone number of the creditor who reported the disputed information.

, If the resolution is not in your favor, then you can ask that a statement of dispute be included in your file. This statement will then be included in all future reports.For a fee, you can also request that the credit reporting agency send your statement of dispute to anyone who has received a copy of your report recently.The statement can be 100 words or less (200 if you live in Maine).The credit reporting agency should provide guidelines.

, In addition to contacting the credit reporting agency, you should also contact the organization that provided the information that serves as the basis of the credit reporting error. Typically, this will be a creditor, such as a bank that extended a loan to you or a credit card company. Sometimes, it may be a collection agency.


If the credit reporting agency resolves the dispute against you, then contacting the creditor directly is the next logical step.However, the creditor is not required to respond unless you have additional information that was not considered by the credit reporting agency., Look at your statements and find a contact number to call. Once you reach a representative, you should inform him or her that you are disputing the entry. If requested, provide a detailed explanation as to why you are disputing the entry.


Also ask if the creditor needs additional information from you. If it does, then send copies of any supporting documentation.

, Even if you call, you should still send a letter.You should memorialize your telephone conversation by summarizing the conversation and typing up a letter. By doing so, you can create a paper copy of the communication that you have had with the creditor.


The FTC has a sample dispute letter that you can use. It is available at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0485-sample-letter-disputing-errors-your-credit-report-information-providers. Be sure to revise it to fit your particular circumstances.

, The creditor generally has 30 days to perform an investigation. It should then inform you of the results within five days of completing the investigation.If the dispute is resolved in your favor, then the creditor should contact the credit reporting agencies to correct the error.If you are sent a letter by the creditor agreeing that the information is incorrect, then you should forward a copy of the creditor’s letter to all credit reporting agencies that reported the error."

Limit the number of credit applications.,
Check your credit score before you apply.,
Make sure your finances are in order.",How to Fill Out a Credit Application2," Every time your credit is reviewed by a bank, lender, credit card company, or employer, it is considered an inquiry on your credit report. Too many credit applications can lower your credit score. Applying for too many credit cards, for example, can hurt your chances of your application getting accepted.Apply for one credit card at a time. Do not fill out 2 or 3 applications as a back up just in case your first application is denied.Shop around for credit cards only when you need to and without filling out multiple applications.
Do not shop for a credit card if you are also applying for a car loan or mortgage.

, Knowing your credit card score can help you apply for a realistic card and limit the number of applications you fill out. A FICO credit score ranges from 300-850.If you have a 320 score, you should not apply for a platinum, top tier card. Instead you would apply for a card that caters to people who are trying to rebuild or build credit.If you have a high credit score (usually 720+), you can apply to any card that you want.
If you have a low credit score, try applying for secured credit cards.

, Review your credit card debt and loans (e.g. personal, school, auto, etc.) before you apply. Also think about your work history and payment history. If you identify an area that needs improvement, work on that before you apply.Avoid taking any cash advances or going over your credit limit when you seeking to apply.
Establish a history of timely payments for all of your debt.

Determine your needs.,
Shop around for a card.,
Compare your final choices.",How to Fill Out a Credit Application3," There are 3 major types of credit cards. They are cards that help you build or repair your credit, cards that save money on interest, and cards that offer you rewards. The best card for you depends on your current needs.If you are trying to build your credit, you do not need to apply for a card that offers cashback or travel rewards. Apply for a secured card or a student credit card (if it applies to you).
To save money on interest, look for a low interest, 0% APR, or a balance transfer card.
If you plan to pay off your balance in full every month, you may want a rewards card. These cards have a higher APR rate, but have many benefits.

, Once you have determined the type of card you need, shop around to find the best deal. Start looking at your current bank or credit union. You may be able to get a better deal because you are an existing customer. Take your search online after that. Check each credit card for the following things:APR
APR for balance transfers

Penalty APR (How much? How long does it last? What initiates it?)
Fees (e.g. annual fee, cash advance fee, late-payment fee, and balance transfer fee)

, You may find two or three cards that meet your needs. Examine each card for differences. Nerdwallet has a tool that lets you do side-by-side comparisons of different cards.Things that you should look depend on the type of card you have:For low-interest cards look for late fees, the change in the APR after initial period, and the length of the APR period.
For secured and credit cards look for credit limit increases for making timely payments.
If you are using a balance rewards card look for an expiration date to use your rewards.

Provide evidence of increased income.,
Pay your debt on time and in full.,
Lower your credit utilization ratio.,
Avoid asking for an increase too often.",How to Extend a Line of Credit2," If you have received a raise or a higher paying job, you might be able to increase your limit. You will have to show the bank evidence of your increased income. Let them know that you want to extend your line of credit based on your higher income. Some types of evidence include:Your offer from a new job stating your salary
Two recent paystubs from within 90 days
A letter from your employer stating your increased income

, Staying on top of payments and deadlines will make you seem more responsible to the credit company. Not only will this improve your credit score but it will make you more attractive to your lender. You can even set up automatic payments through your bank to make sure that you pay on time.Do not charge things on your credit that you cannot afford to pay off at the end of the month This will lower your score, decreasing your chances of a credit line extension.

, Your credit utilization ratio is the percentage of your credit limit that you use at any time. For example, if you keep $250 on a line of credit with a $1000 limit, you have a utilization ratio of 25%. Keeping your ratio below 30% can improve your credit score. It also looks impressive to the bank., In the process of offering you a higher limit, your bank or credit company will likely do a hard credit enquiry on your credit score. This will temporarily lower your score. If you ask for credit increases too often or if you do so after opening up a credit card, you will find your credit score decreasing.When you contact the company, you should ask them at the beginning if they are going to do a hard credit check.
If your credit company offers you a small increase without checking your credit, take advantage of their offer. This means that they are offering you an increase without affecting your credit score."

Call or visit your credit company.,
Provide a good reason.,
Request a reasonable increase.,
Remind them of your loyalty as a customer.,
Ask why you were rejected.",How to Extend a Line of Credit3," If you cannot automatically increase your limit online, you should try calling or visiting your credit company or bank. Ask to speak to a manager about your credit limit. You should have your account and identifying information handy. This may include your social security number, telephone number, and account number.


The company might request information regarding your job, rent or mortgage payments, and income., Your bank or credit company will want to know why you are requesting a credit increase. You should be prepared with a strong response that demonstrates that you want the increase for legitimate, responsible reasons. Some good reasons include:“I want to improve my credit utilization ratio.”“I have recently received a raise, and I am able to handle a higher credit limit.”“I have maintained a good credit score for a while, and I would like to have an increased limit just in case of emergency.”

, Your bank or credit company might ask what you want your new limit to be. If you request a limit that is too high, you will likely be rejected. Aim to increase your limit by 10-25%.You can say, “I am looking to increase my credit score by 20%. So I want to go from $2000 to $2400.”

, The bank might be hesitant at first to extend your credit line. To make your argument more persuasive, remind the bank of what a good customer you are. Some things you can tell them include:


“I pay off my balance every month.”
“I have a credit utilization ratio of under 30%.”
“I have been at this bank for ten years, and I have always paid on time.”

, If you were turned down for an increased limit, do not despair. Instead, ask the bank for their reasons why. This can help you improve your next application for a credit increase. Work hard to improve your credit score, and try again a few months later.You can ask, “If you don’t mind, can you tell me why my request was denied?”
If the bank feels as though you have not been a customer long enough, you can wait a few more months before trying again.
If the bank says your credit score isn’t good enough, you can work on improving your score. Pay your balance off each month, and try again after six months.

, Whenever possible, communicate with all credit reporting agencies by postal mail. But if you must call about a credit report dispute, use the following telephone numbers: Equifax, (800) 685-1111; Experian, (888) 397-3742; TransUnion, (800) 888-4213.


The credit reporting companies are obligate to investigate the matter within 30 days, unless they somehow show your dispute to be frivolous.What happens during the investigation? The credit reporting company forwards the information you gave them to institution or company that originated the information. For the sake of example, let's assume it's a restaurant. The restaurant must then investigate the matter and report back to the credit reporting company with its findings. The restaurant is responsible for notifying all three credit bureaus if it finds that the information in question is inaccurate.

, Regardless of what the credit reporting company determines, they must send issue a verdict in writing. If the credit reporting company finds the disputed information to be inaccurate, they must provide you with a free credit report that takes into account this information.


This free credit report does not count towards your free annual credit report.
The credit reporting agency must also send you the name, address, and phone number regarding the institution or company that provided the disputed information.

, The credit reporting agency must also send copies of the revised credit report to any person or institution that received your credit report in the last two years for purposes of employment. The credit reporting agency is obligated to do both by law.

, This time, mention that your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) were violated by the credit bureau’s failure to promptly investigate and respond to your dispute., You are lawfully able to do so. If you wish to pay a fee, you can also have the credit reporting agency give your statement to any person or institution that received your credit report in the recent past.

Open a bank account.,
Establish consistent sources of income.,
Don’t move around too much.,
Apply for your first line of credit through your bank.",How to Establish Credit History1," When a person with no credit applies for a line of credit, the creditor must look to factors other than the applicant’s credit history and score to decide whether to issue the credit. Although not having a bank account doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t have money or legal sources of income, it is far more likely for criminals and the impoverished to lack a bank account. Since criminals often don’t pay back loans and the poor can’t pay back loans, not having a bank account makes it much less likely you’ll be granted a loan.It’s best if you have both a savings account and a checking account. Almost every major bank offers free personal checking accounts and savings account with low minimum amounts.;
, Any potential creditor will want to know you can pay back the credit extended, and they’ll need more substantial verification than your word. Therefore, you should establish consistent sources of above-the-table income before you apply for a new line of credit.Although anything with a paper trail will be helpful, the best source of income verification is a paystub. Paystubs show wages before and after taxes, hourly rate, hours worked, and total income year to date.

, When you’re applying for some types of credit, like home loans or auto loans, it’s common for a creditor to ask you for your residence history. The more often you move around, the less stable you seem, and the less likely to be extended a great deal of credit.Banks usually ask for three to five years of your residence history when you’re purchasing a home. If you’re getting an auto loan, you’re most likely to get a lot of questions about your residential history if you’re getting a loan from a “buy here, pay here” lot, and not getting a loan through a conventional lender, like a bank or credit union.

, Whether you’re getting a credit card, home loan, auto loan, or personal loan, if you’ve got no credit history, you should apply through your bank before you go anywhere else. They’ll have a better idea of your reliability than any other potential creditors would. "

However, if you have solid proof that it is invalid and you meet the other elements, you could potentially sue the reporter for defamation. Defamation laws vary by state, but they generally require:A defamatory statement was made

You will need to confirm your identity in person, in Australia, within 12 months of starting your account. If you are not able to accomplish this, the account you have started will become void, and your money will be returned.;
, There are four major banks in Australia: Westpac, Commonwealth Bank, NAB, and ANZ. Each of them offers similar account types with a low or zero monthly service fee, as long as you deposit a minimum amount. Conduct some research on each bank, perhaps even giving each bank a call, and then select the bank that best suits your needs.

, In general, there are two types of basic accounts that you can open: an everyday transaction account (similar to a checking account) or a savings account. Will you be using this account to conduct your daily business, or merely as a place to hold your money? Select the type of account you need.

, In order to begin the process of opening an Australian bank account, you will need to have some personal information ready. You will need your social security number, driver’s license or I.D. number, your birth date, and residential address. You will also need to have a few important documents that verify your identity, such as a passport and marriage license.

, Once you have selected your bank and gathered your personal information, visit the website of your bank and move through the application process. In most cases, you will need to scan or fax copies of some of your documents.If you prefer, you may also be able to apply by phone.
You will still need to scan or fax some identifying documents.

Your account will only be able to receive deposits until you have completed your in-person identity check with the bank. (In other words, until you arrive in Australia, you will not be able to access to money you have deposited into your account.)

Get credit for paying rent on time.,
Obtain a credit-builder loan.,
Find a co-signer.,
Get a secured credit card.",How to Establish Credit History2," A lot of people who have little or no traditional credit do rent a home or an apartment and pay rent on time. Most renters don’t get credit for their rental payments on their credit report, but that doesn’t have to be the case. There are several services which (for a fee) will report your rental payments to one or more of the major credit bureaus, and tell you which credit cards and lenders will take your rental payments into account. This can be a big help in establishing credit if you have little or none.There are quite a few rental reporting services, all coming in at varying price points. One of the best is RentTrack, as they report to all three credit bureaus and are priced very modestly.

, The term “credit-builder loan” is somewhat of a misnomer. In reality, it isn’t much like a loan at all. While you might apply for a credit builder loan like any other type of loan, the bank doesn’t give you the money it lends. Instead, it deposits the entire amount in a savings account. You make monthly payments on the loan, and when it’s completely paid off, they release the funds to you. While it might not be ideal, a credit builder loan can also be a good way to establish credit when you’re just starting out. Credit-builder loans have their good points and bad points. The advantage of a credit builder loan is that it does usually improve your score—by about 30-40 points. The disadvantage is the interest; you still pay interest on the loan. So it’s less like a loan than it is a subscription service to improve your credit score.

, Finding a co-signer is one of the most effective ways of establishing credit when you have none. A co-signer agrees to make payments on the debt in case you default. They assume responsibility, and it is their creditworthiness dictating the terms of the loan.Co-signers are also difficult to get. In essence, the co-signer is taking out a loan they don’t need and hoping you pay it back. Very few people are interested in putting themselves in that position, so don’t be surprised if a few people tell you “no” before you hear “yes.”

, Secured credit cards are a little like credit-building loans in that they’re not really credit—they are subscription services that improve your credit score. The subscription costs come in the form of interest and other fees.You “secure” the credit card with a cash deposit equivalent to the line of “credit.” If your deposit was $500, then you’ll have a credit limit of $500. You use the card as normal, making payments on whatever you charge. After a period of time, your credit limit will either be raised, or if your credit score permits, you can apply for an unsecured card and cancel the secured card.

Check your credit reports and your credit score often.,
Make your payments on-time.,
Establish diverse sources of credit.,
Don’t use more than 30% of your available credit.,
Don’t close lines of credit.",How to Establish Credit History3," You can get a free credit report from each of the credit bureaus once a year (meaning up to three different occasions). The report is a comprehensive picture of your credit history—what you’ve paid and when you paid it, what your debts are, and when you applied for new lines of credit. Your score is an estimate of your potential credit risk. They are two measures of your financial health, and it’s important to know both.Check your credit report at https://annualcreditreport.com.
Check your credit score (for free) at https://www.creditkarma.com.

, Payment history is the biggest single factor determining your credit score, accounting for about 35%. It’s simple advice, but easier said than done. Nonetheless, over the long term, it’s the best way to rehabilitate your credit., Once your credit is rehabilitated to the point that you can qualify for a loan, you should take out a small loan or line of credit in a different form than the type of credit you already have. The mix of credit is only about 10% of your total score, but it is a factor.For example, if you only have one credit card, purchase an appliance on an installment plan or take out a small personal loan. It’s never a bad idea to save up the amount of the loan before you apply, put it in a separate account, and simply have the loan payments automatically draw from that account.

, If you’ve got a credit limit of $1000, you should be able to charge $1000, right? Actually, if you want to keep your credit score in good shape, it’s best to carry a balance of no more than 30% of your available credit (and no less than 10%). This is called the “amounts owed” section of your credit score, which isn’t the most straightforward name. It means the amount owed relative to your credit limits, and not the entirety of the amount of debt owed.
If you can’t afford to get your balance down below 30% of your limit right away, one possible fix is to call your credit card company and ask for a higher credit limit.

, If you cancel a card or another line of credit, the total amount of available credit you have will lessen, which will negatively affect your score. If you have one card you don’t use very much, charge a small recurring bill, like a phone bill or a trash bill, to the card. That will keep it active and with a small but manageable balance."

This is to prevent money acquired through illegal activities from being stored in Swiss bank accounts. And due to tax-evasion crackdowns by the US Department of Justice, some Swiss banks are refusing to do business with American clients for fear of legal repercussions.Where you live and what you do for a living could influence whether or not you are eligible for a checking or savings account with a Swiss bank.


Citizens of certain countries are prohibited from opening Swiss bank accounts. This can be for any number of reasons, such as official embargoes (with countries like Russia and Iraq, for example) and other political exclusions.Regardless of your nationality and source(s) of income, your application for a Swiss bank account may be rejected if you are deemed to be a “politically exposed” person - someone who has been involved in a scandal or has a publicly dubious reputation. The bank would be concerned that if that sort of person became a client, he or she might pose too great a risk to the bank’s reputation.;
, There are approximately 400 banks in Switzerland, though two banks in particular - UBS (Union Bank of Switzerland) and Credit Suisse Group - account for almost half of all investments in Swiss banks.One of the biggest factors in determining which bank to choose is what you're looking for in a bank. Comparing policies and investment opportunities at a variety of top-rated banks can help you examine the pros and cons of each bank and find one that's right for you.


If privacy is a factor, consider going with a bank that does not have branches in your home country. Most banks are governed by the laws of the nation in which a given branch is located, not by the laws of the head office's nation.Be aware that unless a bank has earned a status of qualified intermediary (QI), that bank may have to report the owner of an account and all money received from the United States to the IRS, if the account holder is a US citizen., There are many different types of bank accounts available through Swiss banks. Certain bank accounts require a minimum amount for the initial deposit, a minimum account balance, and other qualifying factors.Compare the requirements for each type of account you're interested in opening to find one that will work best for your financial needs.


Some banks require customers to use Swiss francs (CHF). Others permit the use of US dollars, euros, and other forms of currency from around the world. Check with the bank you wish to do business with to see what form(s) of currency they accept if exchanging into other currencies is a concern for you.
One of the most secretive accounts is what is known as a numbered account. These accounts are not, strictly speaking, ""secret"" or ""anonymous"" accounts. Certain high-level bank employees will know the identity of the account holder(s), but these accounts still offer some degree of privacy, as numbered accounts require the bank to use only the account number in any and all correspondence regarding the account.However, these accounts tend to have a number of restrictions, and maintaining a numbered account may come with annual fees of up to 2,000 Swiss Francs.It is worth noting that some Swiss banks are reluctant to offer general savings accounts for foreign citizens. Instead, Swiss banks focus on providing foreign citizens with investment opportunities and wealth management specialties.

, Customers interested in opening a Swiss bank account must visit an operational bank branch, either in person or through a representative. If sending a representative, that representative will have to provide documentation for both himself and the person he represents. Due to strict banking guidelines, bank accounts cannot be opened online, as there is currently no way to verify the potential client's identity or source(s) of income online.


Certain banks may allow you to complete this process by mail. A photocopy of your official, government-issued passport would have to be certified by an approved institution and sent to the bank you wish to do business with., Like most banks around the world, Swiss banks are required to verify the identity and source of income of customers who wish to open a new account. For this reason, most banks require potential clients to meet in person with a bank representative to complete the verification process.


Customers may be required to provide a valid passport as a means of identification.Bank representatives may ask for documentation to verify the origin of income. For example, bank representatives may request a copy of a contract proving that a house was sold to acquire the money in question, or receipts from securities sales, or a verifying statement from a bank you've done business with in the past.
Banks may verify the listed address of a potential customer by sending some type of correspondence through the mail.

, As with any other bank account, there are forms and application materials that potential customers must fill out. Due to the security of Swiss banks and the international pressure to account for tax evasion efforts, however, the paperwork process can be quite lengthy. One Swiss bank expert reported that there can be upwards of 100 pages of paperwork required for a foreign investor to open a Swiss bank account., Each bank has different requirements on the minimum deposit/investment an individual must make. Sometimes various types of accounts within the same bank may have drastically different requirements. Some banks (and account types) have minimum deposit/investment sums ranging in the millions of dollars.Many private banks will not accept new clients unless that client is willing to invest a minimum of CHF 250,000 ($265,896.64 in US dollars, or 230,704.37 Euros). However, some banks, including UBS and Credit Suisse, will accept investments below CHF 50,000 ($53,179.33 US dollars, or 46,140.87 Euros).Check with the bank you're interested in investing with to learn more about their minimum requirements.

, Anyone new to Switzerland who hopes to open a bank account there will need to meet with a bank representative. It's best to make these arrangements and get a bank account set up as quickly as possible. It may be helpful to visit a Swiss bank branch before you close out your old bank account from the country you're leaving, if at all possible. Some expatriates may have a difficult time securing their housing without a bank account, yet they may also have a difficult time opening a bank account without an address.Potential customers living outside of Switzerland who wish to open a Swiss bank account but cannot visit a branch in person may be able to request an application package by mail. Documents provided by the potential customer will need to be authenticated, either by a notary, an employee of the Swiss bank, or an employee of a correspondent bank that the Swiss bank is willing to work with., Most Swiss banks assign a personal account manager to work with each customer, and it's important to remember who your account manager is for all future bank transactions. Ask for your account manager's contact information, including his email address and direct phone line at the bank.Bank branches in major cities tend to have at least one account manager who speaks a foreign language, including English. Otherwise an account manager will most likely be fluent in one of Switzerland's four major languages: German, French, Italian, or Romansh. If you know you will require an account manager who speaks a language other than the major languages of Switzerland, it's best to call ahead and make the necessary arrangements., Like most banks and financial institutions around the world, new customers wishing to open a personal account will need to provide documentation that proves the customer's identity and source(s) of income.New customers will be asked to verify their identity and address.If your identification card does not reflect your local Swiss address, you may need to provide a signed copy of your lease.
Some banks will require a new customer to verify his professional status. Banks may also require new customers to show any relevant work contracts and tax returns as part of the employment verification process. Showing proof of employment helps banks know that the money being deposited into an account has not come from illegal activities., There are over 20 Swiss banks that are cantonal, meaning they only do business with residents of the canton in which each bank is located. If you open a personal account with a cantonal bank and move to a different canton, you may be asked to transfer your account to a corresponding canton. This should not be a problem for customers who open accounts with Swiss national banks., Most Swiss banks charge a monthly maintenance fee for personal accounts, and may charge additional fees for a credit card or Carte Maestro (debit card).Monthly fees for personal accounts tend to range anywhere from 10 to 30 Swiss Francs (CHF), though customers can usually have these fees reduced or waived by switching to electronic banking statements, taking out a mortgage with the bank, or depositing a sizable amount of money into that account.Credit cards and Carte Maestros tend to have annual fees that range up to 3 Swiss Francs., This is particularly important for US citizens opening Swiss bank accounts, though it may apply to other countries as well. US citizens, regardless of their choice in bank accounts, are required to:


file Form 1040, Schedule B, Part III, declaring that you are opening a foreign bank account.
file Form TD F 90-22.1 by June 30th of each year to inform the IRS of the location of any foreign accounts that were in excess of $10,000 at any point during the previous year.

, A Carte Maestro is essentially a debit card that is issued by your bank. It can be used to withdraw cash or complete purchases in most shops, though merchants in smaller towns and villages may have cash-only policies., Many Swiss banks can issue credit cards to interested customers. However, customers may be required to provide the bank with a security deposit, typically one to two times the maximum monthly credit limit, to deter customers from ringing up delinquent charges. The deposit will be returned to the customer upon the credit card's cancellation, provided that the customer has paid off any charges that were made using that card., Traveller's checks do not always offer the best exchange rate, but they can be invaluable for overseas customers, as they can be easily replaced if lost or stolen.Additionally, traveller's checks allow customers concerned with security to conduct business and make transactions without compromising the privacy of their bank accounts.Investors with private Swiss bank accounts may wish to avoid getting a debit card or checkbook if privacy is an issue. Any time you write a check or use a debit card, it creates a traceable path back to your bank account. If you're trying to maintain a secret account, being issued a debit card or checkbook is an easy way to get caught., If for any reason you need to close your account or collect on your investment(s), most Swiss banks allow you to do so without any restrictions or fees.This gives many customers confidence, knowing that investments are available in case of an emergency.

Click ""Continue"" when you're done.",How to Open a Checking Account Online," Checking accounts come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, from your average spending account to high-interest investments for frequent depositors. You'll need to consider the following criteria before searching for a branch to suit your needs:



Whether or not you're a student. Most large banks offer a lenient account with reduced or non-existent fees for students; some banks, such as Chase, will even extend the account's usage to cover an additional year after your student status expires.

Whether or not you want to accrue interest. Most banks that offer interest on their checking accounts only do so for large account balances (e.g., $2,500 or more). Since depositing and holding large amounts of money in your checking is a risky endeavor, consider opening a savings account in tandem with your checking; most banks offer this option, and most savings accounts have a standard interest rate by default.

Whether or not you're comfortable with an online-only bank. Brick-and-mortar bank branches are often convenient; however, online banking services will usually apply fewer fees and offer higher interest rates on your accounts.Whether or not your job offers direct deposit. While a fair amount of larger banks charge a monthly fee for simply having a checking account, you can usually waive this fee by having your checks deposited directly into your checking account.;
, Though you'll likely want to stick with whatever branch is local and convenient, most large banks charge monthly fees, ATM fees, and more in order to cover their own expenses. Ideally, your selected branch will charge little or no money for the following services:



ATM withdrawal - If you choose to open an account with an obscure or non-local bank (for example, Wells Fargo has no branches or ATMs in Missouri), you'll have to pay a few dollars for every ATM withdrawal with that bank's card; similarly, using a specific bank's card with a different bank's ATM will often incur a fee. Some banks, such as Compass Bank, will reimburse your ATM fees on a monthly (or even daily) basis.

Minimum balance maintenance - Many larger banks will charge a small monthly fee if your checking account has less than a certain amount in it (for example, Chase charge $10/month for a basic checking account with a balance less than $1,500). If you don't intend to keep enough money in your checking account to avoid the fee, look for a bank with no maintenance fees. Many student accounts fit this criterion.Overdraft - If you overdraw your checking account, most banks will charge an additional fee on top of the difference; the average overdraft fee is around $34. While you probably won't be able to find a bank with no overdraft policy, look for one that offers a grace period or a reduced fee, such as Huntington.Maximum number of transactions - Some banks will charge a fee to your checking account after a certain amount of transactions in a month. Since you're likely setting up a checking account for the purpose of spending money, this is a fee you'll want to avoid.

, After you eliminate any banks with high fees or unwanted attributes, consider your remaining options. In order to determine the best candidate, you'll need to complete the following actions:



Research your banks' press - Typing the name of one of your bank options into a search engine should bring up customer reviews and pertinent news articles. If one of the banks you're considering has a fair amount of poor press, you might want to cross it off of your list.

Read the fine print - You'll want to visit your banks' online sites or physical locations and inquire about opening a checking account. Generally-speaking, you should be able to unearth any hidden fees or paid services you don't want.

Look for any work-based incentives - If your job offers free access to a checking account or increased interest at a particular bank, you should absolutely consider taking advantage of this feature.

Look for mobile support - Being able to access your accounts on-the-go is extremely important in the event of an emergency; for this reason, you should avoid banks that don't have mobile app support., Once you've decided on a bank that fits your specific criteria, it's time to set up your checking account!

, To sign up for a checking account with Wells Fargo, you must have the following available:Your Social Security number

Use caution when withdrawing money from non-bank ATMs.,
Contact the bank or credit union right away if you suspect any problems.",How to Open a Checking Account," Before finding an institution and opening an account, you'll have to narrow down what your banking needs are.


Think about what you will use this account for. Are you setting up direct deposit from your job? Are you tying a debit card to the account? Will you be writing a lot of checks? All these questions will be important as you move on and find a checking account that's right for you.;
, The two main institutions you would choose between are banks and credit unions. Credit unions provide similar services to banks, except they are non-profit and democratically run by members.Each offers different perks with their checking accounts, so keep these in mind when making a decision.


Credit unions usually have lower fees than banks, sometimes with free checking accounts. They are known for having better service than banks as well. They also, however, have fewer rewards and lower interest rates, and they are sometimes difficult to get in to. You might also have less choice of the type of checking account you'll get there.Most banks offer a wide range of checking services, and some might feel more secure with their money in an established bank. The fees on checking accounts can be high, however, and there also may be high minimum balance requirements for their accounts., Whether you decide on a bank or credit union, your first step should be making sure that an institution is properly insured and approved by the federal government. Most large institutions are a safe bet, but smaller ones might not be up to the strictest standards. It's always a good idea to check and make sure any place you put your money if properly insured.For banks, visit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation site.
For credit unions, visit the National Credit Union Administration site.

, Whether you end up choosing a bank or credit union for your checking account, you'll still have to pick from a huge variety in either category. While this may seem overwhelming, it will become much more manageable when you start narrowing down your needs to cut the list down.


Consider location. Is there a branch near your home or work? Also think about if you travel often. If so, you'll probably want a nationwide or even international bank so you can always find a branch nearby. If you never leave your hometown, then you can use a smaller local bank.Consider if the institution charges for checks. If you plan on writing a lot of checks, it can be a big advantage for you if the institution you use offers free or low-cost checks.
Look at the fees at different institutions. Some banks offer great services, but hit you with charges like account maintenance fees. Always look carefully at the kinds of fees an institution will charge you before making a decision.Think about the hours the institution is open. This might seem obvious, but if you work full-time, it could be very important. An institution that's only open 9-5 on weekdays might be difficult to get to if you work those hours. Look for one that's open weekends or nights if you have to.Do you want to do anything besides open a checking account at this institution? If so, look at the other accounts or credit cards it offers to help you make a decision.

, When you've narrowed down your list to one or a few institutions, then look at the checking accounts each one offers. Specifics might vary between institutions but generally speaking, there are a few standard kinds of checking accounts. Think about your personal banking needs to decide which would be best for you.Basic checking. These accounts are meant for people who just use their checking accounts to pay some monthly bills. They usually have low interest rates and a moderate minimum balance requirement. With these accounts there may be a limited number of checks you're allowed to write monthly before being charged a fee.
Free checking. Some banks and credit unions offer free checking accounts. That means no fees or minimum balance requirements, and you won't be charged for the amount of checks you write.
Interest-bearing accounts. These accounts will yield a relatively high interest rate. They usually require a high minimum balance or you'll be charged a monthly fee. If you're considering this kind of account, weigh the cost of maintaining that high balance against the interest you'll receive to see if it's worth it.
Joint accounts. These accounts are designed for use by two people, usually a couple sharing household expenses. Both people have equal access to the account.
Student checking. Some institutions offer special accounts for students. They usually have a low minimum balance and account-opening fee. They may also include other perks like low-cost loans and discounts on certain expenses.

, Many large banks like Chase, Capital One, Wells Fargo, and others have options to open accounts completely online. If you find one of these, you can avoid visiting a branch altogether and manage your finances from your computer or mobile device.


Each bank has a unique process, so it is best to directly contact the institution you're interested in. They will still generally have to verify your identity with a social security number and identification.
Be extra careful with security if you manage your banking online. Bank sites are usually secure, but cyber thieves can hack into your computer for information. It helps to avoid saving passwords to your computer in the event of a security breach.

, To open any bank account, you'll usually need several documents and pieces of information to verify your identity. Make sure you have all of these before visiting an institution to avoid repeated visits.Government identification. A state-issued driver's license or passport is usually required. School or work ID's are not sufficient here.
Your social security number. It is best to have this number memorized. If you don't know it by heart and have to write it down, be sure not to lose it and destroy it after you're done. Also don't put your name or any other information on the paper it's written on, just in case you do lose it.
You should also check with the specific bank before you visit to see if they require any other proof or documentation. This will avoid repeated trips to open your account.

, Whichever account you decide to open, it will probably have a minimum account balance. If you don't meet that minimum you'll be charged a fee. You're often given a day or so to make a deposit and bring the account up to the minimum before you're charged. You can take care of this right when you open the account if you bring the minimum amount with you., When you have your documents together, visit the branch and speak to a representative. Usually tellers don't handle opening accounts, so you'll probably be referred to one of the bank managers or financial consultants. He or she will speak with you about the account you're opening and counsel you on what options are best. Plan to ask the representative any questions you might have.Explain your financial and banking situation to the representative. With this information at hand, the representative can assess your needs and may be able to recommend options you didn't think of before.
If you've investigated the kinds of checking accounts the institution offers, mention them. The representative will be able to talk you through the pros and cons of each account.
Ask about any fees associated with the account, as well as the minimum balance required.
Ask if you can manage your banking online or over the phone. Most banks offer these services. They are much more convenient than having to visit the branch every time you need to handle your account.

, After speaking with the representative and gathering all the information you can, it's time to decide which account you want. When you decide on an account, then you'll have to deposit the minimum balance and usually submit an electronic signature that will show how you'll sign checks. After this, you can order personalized checks if you want them.


Remember that if you plan on using a debit card, it usually takes a few days for these to come in the mail. Have cash on hand to make purchases until then.

, Your checkbook will come with a registry where you can record all of your transactions. Every time you write a check or make a withdrawal/deposit, mark this in your register. Add or subtract the amount to get the new balance in your account. This way, you'll avoid bouncing checks.Also make sure to record the check number if you write a check. That way you'll avoid losing track of your checks.
There are also electronic options for balancing your account. Make a Spreadsheet for an easy way to track your spending and add up your expenses.

Mint.com is a website designed to manage your finances.
You can also check the App stores for financial managements apps like Personal Capital or Debt Minder., This will ensure that you're always aware of the activity on your account. It will help prevent you from writing bad checks, and will also help you detect any fraudulent activity.Be sure to either shred the statements when you're done with them or store them in a secure location. Never throw out a bank statement fully intact, or identity thieves could get your information.

, ATMs inside a banking branch are regulated by the Department of Financial services and protected by the bank's security. ATMs in other areas like bars or grocery stores aren't regulated the same way, and a thief could possibly get your banking information if you use one of these.If you are forced to use one of these, look around the area first. If anyone around looks suspicious or seems to be watching the machine, don't use it. Guard your information as well. Use your other hand to cover the keypad as you type your pin. Count your money as soon as it comes out of the machine, without turning around. This opens you up to robbery if a thief is observing the transaction.

, If you lose your card or suspect any fraudulent activity, act quickly. The sooner you contact your institution the better. You can cancel your card right away to prevent anyone else from using it. You can also lock your account if there have been unauthorized charges. It is all a matter of acting quickly to prevent further financial losses."

, When you are opening a bank account in Bermuda, you'll need to know which type of bank account you want to open. Bermudan banks will offer many of the same types of bank accounts that most other banks offer. Take a look at some of these account types and services that you can expect from a bank in Bermuda.Personal accounts
Corporate accounts
Savings accounts
Checking accounts

, Banks in Bermuda will all charge monthly or yearly account fees. Exactly how much the fees are will vary, depending on when you open your account and which bank you open it with. Check with the bank you are interested in to learn more about their recurring fees and which account types they apply to.Most banks will charge at least $8 a month to keep the account open.
Accounts that have been inactive for two years may have increased monthly charges.
You may need to maintain a minimum level of funds in your bank account.

, Bermudan banks offer many convenient banking services. The services might include things like wiring money to foreign banks or opening a credit card. Always make sure you are comfortable with the bank's service fees before opening an account with them.Online or e-banking services are generally included for free.
Some banks may charge for outgoing or incoming payments.
Your bank may charge for services such as mailing documents or making photocopies.

, It's likely that your bank will have a set minimum deposit that you will be required to make upon opening your account. This deposit amount will be unique to the bank you choose. Before opening an account, make sure you know the required minimum deposit amount that your account will need to have.For example, you may need $25,000 to open a savings account.
$25,000 might also be required when opening up some checking accounts.
Some personal accounts may require you to have at least $5,000 for your initial deposit.

, In order to open up an account with the bank you've selected, you'll need to make contact with your bank. Some banks will allow you to communicate online or by phone, making it possible to open an account without visiting the physical building. Other banks may require you to schedule a meeting with them to discuss the details of your account. Check with your bank to learn more about how you can make contact and start opening your account., All banks in Bermuda will require you to properly fill out and submit an application form to open your account. This form will provide the bank with enough personal information to verify your identity and set up an account in your name. While each bank will have their own form for you to fill out, you can review the following points of information to learn what to expect:Basic contact information, including name and address.
Specification of the services and products you wish to utilize.
Employment or business information.
Personal identity and tax information.
The method of funding your account and information about other bank accounts you hold.
How you wish your incoming and outgoing transactions to be handled.

, In order to finalize your account, your bank will likely ask you to submit some form of identification. This identification will be checked against the information you have presented to the bank previously. Once your identification has been received and cleared, you'll be given access to your new Bermudan bank account. You may be able to use these following forms of identification:Passport
Proof of address
Driver's license
Work permits or employment letters
Birth certificate

, After your account has been approved, you'll be able to make your required initial deposit and start using your account. Most Bermudan banks will allow you to wire money to and from your account and make deposits or withdrawals remotely. You'll need to speak with your bank to learn more about their specific policies when it comes to these services. To give you a general idea of which services some Bermudan banks offer, take a look at the following list:You can make your initial deposit with cash, check, card, wire or draft.
Demand checking accounts are usually offered in most currencies.
International wire transfers can send or receive funding world-wide.
Get real time account information with e-banking.
Enjoy additional services such as receiving reference letters, faxes, couriers, safe deposit boxes and complimentary photocopies.

, Although banking in Bermuda can have some unique advantages over your domestic banks, Bermudan deposit protections may be lacking. You'll want to carefully review the most recent deposit protection guarantees in Bermuda to learn if banking there is right for you.If you live in another country, that country's deposit protections will not apply to your Bermudan bank account.
Bermuda will guarantee a protection of up to $25,000.
This level of protection may rise in the future.

, If you live outside of Bermuda or are a national of another country, you will need to keep careful track of your income and banking activity.

However, you will have to prove that your money comes from a legitimate, legal source and that you are not exposed to significant political risk (a dictator or other politician from an embattled nation). In addition, citizens of some countries, like Russia and Iran, may be excluded from opening an account because of political sanctions.


For many Swiss private banks, you will need an initial minimum deposit of at least $250,000, if not $1 million or more.
To qualify, you will have to provide a valid passport as well.;
, Swiss private banks generally do not offer standard checking or savings accounts to foreigners. Rather, the main purpose of these accounts is investment. This means that these accounts can not be used for regular withdrawals to pay for things like your mortgage, car payment, etc. Most people use these accounts to store large sums of money, usually as a method of protection against external forces, like taxation, risk in their home country, or currency fluctuations., Swiss private bank accounts are generally used to protect money from unstable political or economic situations in the home country of the depositor. Many of these accounts are held as Swiss Francs (the currency of Switzerland), which is a very stable currency. This protects depositors from fluctuations in the value of their home currency which could devalue their assets. Additionally, money in these accounts is protected from unlawful government seizure and digitally encrypted to prevent theft.


Despite popular opinion to the contrary, money in these accounts is not safe from the taxation of your home country. By law, your account balances must be reported to your home country's tax authorities., One of the major draws of Swiss bank accounts is that they are much more private than other banks. All of your account information is completely confidential, including any submitted documentation like business plans and the origin of your funds. In many cases, Swiss bankers can be jailed for revealing your personal information. However, the exception to this rule is that several nations, notably the European Union and the United States, have agreements in place that require Swiss bankers to share tax information for citizens of these nations that hold Swiss accounts.Your information may also be disclosed for the purpose of:


Determining assets in divorce or inheritance proceedings.
Debt recovery in bankruptcy proceedings.
Criminal court cases.
Financial market regulatory investigations., A numbered account is one that is only identified by a banking number in all transaction. That is, your name is not tied to the account over the course of regular transactions. However, in order to open this type of account, you will still have to provide the bank with documents proving your identity. Some banks offer this type of account as a way of offering an increased level of privacy for their clients. Contact your bank to see if this is an option for you.


The name associated with your numbered account will still be known by banking officials and kept on record at the bank., Switzerland has a number of different types of banks, from large, international banks to smaller, regional banks that only serve a small geographical area. However, the private banks that cater specifically to wealthy and international clients are generally separate banking entities entirely. That is, they are rarely connected to banks offering regular banking services in Switzerland. Private banks can either be located through an online search for ""private Swiss bank"" or through a banking broker. A few of the more well-known of these banks are:


Pictet Private Banking.
SwissPartners.
Vontobel Private Banking.
UBS Private Banking., Swiss private bank accounts are intended for wealthy clients, and their initial required deposits reflect that. For many of these banks, depositors must have an initial deposit of up to 1 million Swiss Francs (about 1.05M USD). However, some of them allow deposits of lower amounts, like 250,000 Swiss Francs. Check with each bank to inquire about these limits., To open a Swiss account, you will need documents proving your identity and the source of your funds. Obviously, you will also need your initial deposit, in the form of a wire transfer, check, or cash (if the bank will allow it). Specifically, you'll need to gather:


A valid passport.
Some document verifying your address.
A way to prove the legitimacy of the source of your deposit (financial statements, inheritance documents, etc.)
Identification for beneficiaries of the account.
Other documents as requested by the bank., For many private banks, you will have to travel to Switzerland and meet with a private banker to set up your account. Some Swiss banks allows online account signups or mail-order ones, but the vast majority of the private banks require either an in-person meeting or working through an intermediary, like a financial services company or law firm.Once you have made contact with the bank, a Swiss private banker will talk you through the procedure of opening an account.

, Swiss banks only want taxed assets. Switzerland will adopt the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) as of 2018. This means that information about the account will be automatically given to the tax authorities of your country of residence once a year (if your country of residence has signed an AEOI-agreement with Switzerland).A 2012 agreement requires Swiss banks to share information on accounts held by US citizens with US authorities. This information is shared with the consent of the account holder.
However, if that account holder refuses to share the information, the US government can still obtain the information on their own., You will have to report your Swiss bank account balances and any earnings or losses on those balances when filing your annual tax returns. To make sure you are filing them correctly, it is best to let a tax professional handle them or at least consult with one before filing., If the laws in your country are less clear about disclosing offshore financial holdings, you should consult with a lawyer specializing in international tax law and tax law your in your own country. Filing an incorrect or incomplete declaration or tax return may subject you to criminal penalties."

If you are taxed on worldwide income, it is illegal to not report proceeds earned in an offshore bank/investment account, even though there may be no added tax from that country.


If your intention in setting up an offshore account in the Cayman Islands is to skirt tax laws, you cannot do so lawfully. If you are caught skirting tax laws by depositing money into an offshore account, you may face a variety of civil and criminal penalties, including forfeiture of money and possible imprisonment.;
, Having a bank account and an investment account are two different things, each having distinct tax implications.


Offshore bank accounts are administered by banks and offer traditional services associated with holding a bank account: spending, receiving, and transferring funds, along with earning some forms of interest. If you just want to hold money in an offshore account, a bank account is probably your way to go.
Offshore investment accounts are administered by investors and can hold money in different currencies, as well as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. They provide greater flexibility than bank accounts, but may come with higher fees. If you want to hold assets in addition to cash overseas, an investment account may be your best bet.

, Accounts can be opened by mail, precluding the need for you to visit Cayman in order to open an account. Additionally a number of services such as internet banking, mail retaining, credit cards and investment options can be set up on these accounts.

, You can use the internet or write to your local British embassy for a list of Cayman Islands Banks. Use search terms like ""Cayman Private bank account"" if you want to deposit more than $300,000 or ""Cayman bank account,"" ""Cayman banking,"" ""Cayman banks"" for Cayman Islands banks that accept less for opening accounts. Cayman private banks are more about investment and portfolio management than normal banking.


Ask each bank you talk to what kind of fees are associated with setting up a bank account. Use these fees to shop around for competitive pricing. These fees may not be insignificant. It may cost somewhere in the area of $500 to $1,000 to set up an offshore account.

, An apostilles stamp is a special kind of certification that you may need to provide as part of an international treaty. If you are required to show an apostilles stamp, you will need to visit your governmental office to obtain a state or national version of that stamp before continuing the application process.

, Requirements are usually set in place in order to avoid money laundering, fraud, or other legal or other illegal activities associated with the international transfer of money. These requirements may include:


Financial statements from your current bank to prove a satisfactory relationship.
Wage slip from current job.
Proof of identity.
Copy of your passport. (May be distinct from proof of identity.)
Proof of residence.
Description of the expected uses of the money.

, Banks that do not ask questions or require many documents exist for a reason: many people choose to consistently use them. If your intention in setting up a bank account in the Cayman Islands is to remain clean and lawful, you may find it in your interest to steer clear of these institutions.... 

, Because of increased publicity and scrutiny over the years, offshore banks are starting to ask more questions and see more proof. For the following contingencies, be prepared to supply additional information:


You may need to provide sales contracts if the money you're depositing is from a real estate transaction or significant business venture.
You may need to provide a letter from your insurance company if the money you're depositing is from an insurance contract.
You many need to provide letter from an executor of the estate if the money you're depositing is from an inheritance.

, One perk of having an offshore bank account is being able to choose what currency your money is held in. This, however, has its major advantages and disadvantages.


The advantage of holding your money in a foreign currency is the ability to hedge against depreciation or an unstable currency. If your currency is unstable and/or steadily losing value, this perk might be a significant advantage.
The disadvantage of holding your money in a foreign currency is that you may be subject to foreign tax laws and you will experience fees to exchange currencies.

, Most modern offshore bank accounts effect transfers by electronic wire transfer. Many offshore banks do not accept foreign checks, and carrying money around may be impractical and/or dangerous.


Shop around for competitive rates, as banks will typically charge a wire transfer fee when you deposit money. If you can find a bank that does not charge wire transfer fees, you might consider banking with that institution.

, Although most banks will issue a debit card associated with your account, you may need to pay fees in order to withdraw funds from your bank account.


Offshore banks generally do not issue checks for withdrawal purposes, for privacy reasons. Additionally, checks drawn on foreign accounts are often not accepted by other banking institutions.
For this reason, consider holding money in two accounts: one offshore account, and one domestic account. You'll be able to wire transfer funds from the offshore account over to the domestic account, where you won't have to deal with unknown hassles.

If you're under 18, some banks might require your parents to sign some forms when you make your account. Not all banks do this, so if you don't want your parents to be involved with your banking, try emailing banks before you go into them asking whether they require your parents to sign.
You'll need to have valid identification and be willing to share basic information about yourself. In the US, you'll usually need your Social Security number.You'll need to have at least the minimum amount of money for opening account. This can vary based on the bank and account you choose. For example, a basic Bank of America savings account requires a minimum deposit of $300.;
, Not all banks are the same, even when it comes to basic personal accounts. It can be very wise to contact the banks in your local area to discuss what exactly you'd get if you opened a basic account. While all banks are different, they can generally be lumped into two general categories: large chain banks and smaller local ones. See below:Large chain banks: Large banks usually have branches in most towns and cities across the country, which means you'll be able to get basically the same service no matter where you go. This wide coverage can help you avoid fees you'll have to pay for using other banks' services (like ATM fees, etc.) Large banks also usually have the resources to offer services like 24-hour help lines for their customers. In addition, these banks tend to have a stable, trusted reputation — they are unlikely to fail or present you with ""surprise"" difficulties.

Smaller local banks: Small banks offer a more personal, human experience. They tend to be friendlier than big banks in several ways — not only will they be willing to offer more personal, one-on-one attention, but they'll often be willing to ""work with you"" when something goes wrong (like you overdraft from your account). Smaller banks also usually charge smaller fees for using their services. On the other hand, smaller banks fail more frequently than large banks (this is still very rare, though)., Most of the time, one someone opens his or her first bank account, it is a regular checking or savings account (or both). Both of these types of accounts allow you to safely store your money with the bank and withdraw it when you need it. However, each type of account is best for different tasks. See below:



Checking: A checking account is what most people use for day-to-day purchases. With a checking account, you'll get a checkbook and a debit card that you can use to pay for things with the money in your account. Money in a checking account doesn't change over time — if you want more money, you have to put it in yourself.

Savings: As its name suggests, a savings account is best for saving money long-term. Money in a savings account slowly gains interest — in other words, the bank will pay you a small amount for storing your money with it. The more money you have in the account and the longer you save it, the more interest you get. You can still withdraw money from a savings account at banks and ATM, but you can't generally use it for checks and debit card payments.
If you have enough money to meet the minimum deposit for both, having both a checking and a savings account is usually best. You can use the checking account for your daily expenses and put extra money in your savings to make interest.

, Opening an account in person is usually the best option for first-time account holders. One big advantage of opening an account in person is that you can ask the teller all of your questions and get immediate answers (as opposed to the waiting you'll have to do online or on the phone). Also, because you can sign the forms and receive your confirmation documents on the spot, the process of opening an account is also usually speedier in person.


The rest of this section will assume you're opening an account in person. However, depending on your bank, you may also be able open an account over the phone or even online. These options vary from bank to bank — not all banks will let you open your account these ways.

, Now is an excellent time to ask for clarification on any issues regarding your account that you don't understand. Below are a few suggestions for questions you may want to ask, but don't be afraid to ask any others that occur to you.


Is there a monthly fee for maintaining this account? If so, what is it?
Is there a minimum balance that I must keep within this account? If so, what is it? What sorts of fees apply if I go under that limit?
What is the interest rate of my savings account? How often does interest generate?
Is there a limit to the amount of transactions (deposits/withdrawals, check writing, ATM uses) I have per month?
Where can I withdraw cash without paying any fees? What is the fee for using an ATM that doesn't belong to this bank?
Is the account I'm applying for insured by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS)?, As noted above, opening a checking account requires a few basic pieces of personal information. You may or may not have to provide documentation to prove this personal information. This depends on the exact bank you're opening an account with. In general, it's a good idea to have:


Proof that you are who you say you are: Have a government-issued ID with your photo on it with you (a driver's license or a passport are best).
Proof of address: A phone bill, driver's license, or any other official document with your name and address will usually do.
Proof you are a registered citizen: The bank will ask for your Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, or employer identification number to ensure that you are ""on record"" with the government. As long as you know this number, you don't generally need to have your Social Security card, etc. with you.

, When you finish completing your account, you will receive documents that contain important information about your account. Keep these in a safe place, like a strongbox. Don't let people you don't trust access these documents — they may be able to use them for malicious purposes. If you can, it's a wise idea to commit the following information to memory so that you don't need to rely on the documents in the future:


Your four-digit PIN number: You need this to use your debit card for purchases.
Your bank account number: You need this for financial tasks like setting up direct deposits
Your Social Security number: You need this for various tax and financial tasks in the future
If you believe your account information has fallen into the wrong hands, you can always contact your bank and request a ""freeze"" on your account to prevent unauthorized use.

, The biggest benefit of having a bank account is that it's a safe way to store your money. Money in the bank can't be lost or stolen — it's yours until you spend it. Even in the unlikely event that your bank is robbed, your money is insured by the government, so you won't lose it.When you want to get the money in your bank account, you need to make a withdrawal. There are several ways to do this:


Visit the bank in person and fill out a withdrawal form. You'll usually need your account number and basic personal information for this. Somewhat time-consuming compared to the other options, but necessary for special tasks like large withdrawals.
Use an ATM. See below for more information.
Online. In this case, your withdrawals are usually limited to transfers between accounts and payments to other individuals — you can't ""get cash"" online. See below for more information.

, ATMs (automatic teller machines) are a convenient way to get cash when you're out and about. ATMs are located at almost all banks. In addition, you can usually find them in areas of commerce, like malls, grocery stores, and some restaurants.


To use an ATM, you will need to know your checking account's four-digit PIN number. See our ATM article for detailed instructions.
It's always best to use your own bank's ATMs when possible. Usually, you'll have to pay a small fee for using ATMs that don't belong to your bank. Note also that your bank may have a limit on the number of times you may use its own ATMs per month without receiving fees.

, Another way to use your bank account to pay for purchases is to write a check. This is a convenient option when you don't have cash handy. A check is basically an official slip of paper that shows that you promise to pay someone a certain amount of money. When the person you write the check to brings it to the bank, it will use money from your account to pay.


See our article on writing checks for more information.
Make sure you have enough money in your account to pay for your purchase before you write your check. If you don't, your check will ""bounce."" This means that the payment won't go through, you'll have to pay a fee, and you'll still be held responsible for the money.
Some banks offer ""overdraft protection"" services for check-writing. In these cases, when you write a check that you don't have enough money to pay for, your bank may ""spot"" you the money to cover the purchase. You will still have to pay a fee but you won't have to deal with the check bouncing.

, When you want to put more money into your bank accounts, you need to make a deposit. As with withdrawals, there are several ways to do this:


Bring your money or check to your bank. You will have to fill out a deposit form, which requires you to provide your account number.
Use an ATM. Today, many ATMs (especially the ones at banks) allow you to make deposits. You will usually have to do this at one of your own bank's ATMs.
Use mobile check deposit services. One relatively new way to deposit checks involves taking a picture of the check with your mobile phone and sending it to the bank. This usually requires you to download your bank's mobile app. For example, click here for instructions for Bank of America's mobile check deposit service. Note that not all banks offer this.

, Today, nearly all banks will offer some sort of online options for viewing and managing your bank accounts online. Usually, you are prompted to set these up when you first open your account. These services will differ from bank to bank and account to account. In general, most banks will offer:


Secure online login options on the bank's official site
The ability to view your accounts' balances
The ability to view a record of purchases, withdrawals, and deposits for each account
The ability to transfer money between accounts
The ability to send money to other individuals

, Don't want to make a trip to the bank every time you are paid? Most employers offer the option for you to be paid directly into your bank account — this is called ""direct deposit."" In this case, taxes are withdrawn before the money is added to your account.


Talk to your employer's payroll department if you want to set up a direct deposit. This will usually require you to fill out some forms and provide information about your bank account (like your account number).

, ""Linking"" two separate accounts to each other usually means that the funds from one account are made available to the other for special expenses. For instance, if you link your checking and savings accounts, some banks will let you use the money from the savings account to cover overdrafts on your checking account.Other benefits include:


Avoiding some types of minimum-balance fees
Receiving one combined account statement rather than two separate ones
Allowing easier transfer of money between accounts.

, When you open any account with another person, it is called a ""joint account."" Married couples often open one of these accounts, but any two people can do this. You and the co-account opener have equal ownership over all the money in the account, and can take advantage of all the services that come with the account. Either owner can deposit or withdraw money without having to answer to the other holder.


For these reasons, it's important only to open a joint account with someone you absolutely trust. For instance, there's nothing the bank can do to stop one owner from taking all the money out of the account without the other's notice.To make a joint account, both account holders must agree to the terms of the account and fill out their own copy of the account creation forms. This means each person will need to provide an ID, Social Security number, etc.
Generally, most joint accounts carry ""rights of survivorship."" This means if one of the joint account owners dies, the surviving owner gets all the money in the account., Looking to earn more interest on the money you're storing long-term in your bank account? Many banks offer special options for starting accounts with higher-than-normal interest rates. This increases your long-term earnings, but you'll usually have to meet certain conditions to keep these accounts. See below for more information:



High-interest savings: This account comes with all the benefits of a regular savings account, but has a higher minimum balance (that is, you have to keep more cash sitting in the account). You may also be limited in terms of how often you can withdraw from it. In return, you will earn higher interest.

Interest Checking: This account features everything that a regular checking account has (ATM privileges, check writing, etc.), but it includes an interest rate, so it acts a little like a regular savings account. However, the monthly maintenance fees for these accounts are usually higher. This means it's in your interest to keep enough money in your account so that the interest outweighs the monthly charge.

, When you put your money in a CD, you legally agree to put it away for a certain amount of time. This usually ranges from several months to about five years.During this time, you may not add or remove money from the CD. Because you are agreeing to let the bank have your money ""no matter what"" for the agreed-upon length of time, CDs usually have higher interest rates than basic savings accounts.

Others choose to keep money there to protect their own privacy or to safeguard their money's value from fluctuations in the value of their home country's currency. Banks in the Bahamas offer all of these benefits in a country that has a stable economy and political system, as the Bahamas are part of the British Commonwealth.


Financial services account for a large part of the Bahamas' GDP. This makes the government inclined to protect laws that favor this industry and, by extension, account holders.;
, Before opening a Bahamas account, you should consider how much you really need this type of account. Bahamas savings accounts may offer higher interest rates than American ones or those in other countries, but investment accounts offer similar returns. In addition, unless you are currently experiencing political or economic turmoil in your home country, these accounts are no safer than those closer to home.


That said, an offshore account can a step towards making yourself independent of your home country (if you are planning on moving) or a useful step to take when moving to the Bahamas.
In addition, you can keep up to $10,000 in an offshore account without reporting it (though you still have to report earnings on the account)., The Bahamas is slowly becoming compliant with the US tax system. For now, they rely on a sort of honor system, where your foreign holdings and earnings will not be reported to the IRS (or the tax authority in your home country). However, you are still responsible for reporting assets (over $10,000) and any earnings in foreign account to IRS when you file your taxes.Foreign accounts, if you have over $10,000 in all of them combined, must be reported on an FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) if you live in the United States.Your earnings on foreign accounts will be taxes as either income or capital gains (depending on the nature of the account).
Failing to report foreign assets or earnings constitutes tax evasion.

, While Bahamas accounts offer a number of benefits, you may find that your money will be more easily accessed or have more earning potential elsewhere. Alternately, you may want to diversify your accounts even further and open accounts in several different countries. Many countries across the World offer bank accounts to US citizens without much trouble, including:


Switzerland. Swiss bank accounts are perhaps the most famous type of offshore account. They offer legendary privacy and world-leading service.
Other Caribbean islands. The Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Turks and Caicos all have thriving financial industries.
Mongolia. A fast-growing economy, Mongolia offers impressive interest rates that may be up to as high as 13 percent.
Hong-Kong. Some multinational banks (like HSBC) offer accounts in Hong-Kong, giving foreigners access to investment opportunities in China. In addition, accounts here are cheap and generally come with quick service., The bank you choose will depend on your financial goals. There are many private banks that offer investment accounts to foreigners without their being in the country. These accounts will have large minimum deposits, likely in the tens or hundreds of thousands dollars, and will seek to offer larger returns to foreign investors. However, if you are moving to the Bahamas or doing business there, you will need a local checking account. These will offer you easy access to your money and a debit card to facilitate transactions., After determining your needs you can begin to locate banks that have a presence in the Bahamas and can accommodate you. This is simple if you already have an account with a large multinational bank, as you may be able to open your account in advance from a branch in your area. Large banks active in the Bahamas include HSBC, Barclays, Citibank, and Scotiabank.


The largest local bank is First Caribbean International Bank. This bank and other local banks are eager to offer accounts to foreigners.Private bank accounts can be opened with a number of private banks. Some Swiss banks also have a presence in the Bahamas, including UBS and Credit Suisse. Other private banks operating in the Bahamas include Ansbacher, Corner Bank Overseas, Finter Bank & Trust, and Guaranty Trust Bank., Each bank will have a slightly different procedure and set of documentation requirements, so contact the banks first so that you can be provided this information. Ask about whether you have to be present to open an account and, if not, how you can open one remotely. In addition, ask about any account specifics, such as minimum deposit amounts and fees (annual fees, transaction fees, or others).For example, if you planned to live in the Bahamas, you would want an account that offered reduced ATM fees and free local transactions.
Gather information from more than one bank so that you can compare them.

, Eliminate any banks that seem unprofessional to you when you contact them. Then, cut out any that you can't afford because of high minimum deposits or fees. Finally, compare the services and reputations of the remaining banks to make your choice. When you've decided, you're ready to begin the process of opening the account.

, There are certain documents that will likely be required when opening your account. These are largely for identification and should not be hard for you to get a hold of. In general, you will need the following:


Government-issued identification, like a passport or driver's license.
Proof of residence, like a utility bill or some other document showing your home address.
Other documents as required by the bank., For many types of accounts, you will be able to open them without actually visiting the Bahamas. The bank should have clarified this with you when you contacted them about the account. Either work through a branch office for the bank if you've chosen international bank, or communicate directly with the bank to set up the account. In some cases, you can also work with a law firm or financial advisor in your country and they will open the account for you and take care of the paperwork.Opening an account through a representative (like a law firm or financial advisor) is only advised if you plan on opening a private bank account or setting up a business structure in the Bahamas. Otherwise, taking this route may be cost-prohibitive.

, If you have to open the account in person or choose to do so, you will have to set up a meeting with a banker either by calling ahead or by simply walking into the bank. Be sure to bring all of the documents that you need to open the account so that you don't have to come back. Most bankers will request your documents and the following basic information:


Your legal name.
Date of birth.
Address.
Citizenship and country of residency.
Your occupation., In some cases, you may be asked to provide additional information or documents to the bank. You may need notarized copies of some documents you have already submitted. Alternately, you might be asked to provide six months or a year's worth of bank statements to prove your good standing with your old bank.


In other cases, you may be asked to provide a document proving the source of the money you are depositing. This is a measure intended to prevent the bank from taking on money obtained through illegal means.
For example, if your money were obtained through the sale of property, you would need to provide a sales contract for that transaction., For some accounts, you are able to choose the currency in which your account balance will be held. For example, if you wanted to hold an account balance in US Dollars or Swiss Francs, rather than in your home currency, you could specify this. Doing so can protect you from fluctuations in the value of your home currency. However, keep in mind that there may be fees for converting your money to this currency, for example when you deposited and withdrew your money.


Check with your bank to ask about this option and inquire about fees for converting your money., After you've provided all of the required information and documents, you only need your initial deposit to finish opening your account. If you are opening the account through the mail or an intermediary, the deposit can be wire transferred from another bank or submitted as a check. You may also use cash if you are opening your account in person."

Choose a banking institution.,
Choose the type of account(s) that you want to open.,
Save up enough money to open your account(s).,
Open an account online.,
Visit a branch of the bank.,
Apply for the account and provide your information.,
Familiarize yourself with the terms of the account agreement.,
Make your first deposit.,
Wait for your checks and debit card.",How to Get a Bank Account," Perhaps the most important step in opening an account is deciding which bank to do business with. Compare several banks in your area using criteria that are important to you, such as the branch hours and the availability of ATMs. Generally, large national banks have the advantage of being available even if you travel or move, while small local banks tend to pride themselves on better service.


You can also open an account with a credit union instead of a bank. Credit unions are like banks, but they are organized as nonprofits and owned by their members (customers). To join a credit union, you will have to meet the membership requirement, which usually means living in a certain geographic area or working for a certain employer.Many banks will also allow you to open a bank account online.;
, Bank accounts are offered in 2 basic forms: checking and savings. Checking accounts can be drawn on through a debit card or check, and should be used for everyday spending. Savings accounts, on the other hand, are meant as a place where you park your money for a long period and earn interest as long as you keep it there.Each bank is likely to have different rules associated with their checking and savings accounts. For example, some checking accounts are free, while others require an annual fee in exchange for additional benefits. Many savings accounts require a minimum balance.
Some banks offer interest on checking accounts. Others allow you to write checks on your savings account. Check with your local banks to see what options are available to you.
You can also open both a checking and a savings account at the same time. That way, you'll have money that you can use for day-to-day spending in your checking account while still having money in a savings account that's for the proverbial ""rainy day.""

, You'll find that some banks have minimum deposit requirements before you open an account. Even if they don't, it makes little sense to open an account with $0. Have some money handy that you'll use as your first deposit when you open your account.


You can deposit one or more paychecks from your work into your bank account when you open it. You don't have to bring cash.
Bear in mind that checking and savings accounts will often have different minimum requirements. Be sure you find out the minimum for the type of account you're planning to open.

, Many banks will allow you to open a bank account online. That's a convenient option if you'd rather not go anywhere.


In some cases, you might be required to open an account in person. That depends on your personal circumstances and the policies of the bank.
Policies about opening an account online vary from bank to bank. The best way to find out if you can open an account online is to visit the bank's website and start the process of opening an account. You'll be informed if you're required to visit a branch to open an account.

, If you've decided not to open your account online, you'll need to visit the bank during their business hours. You will not need to make an appointment to open an account. You can either tell a teller that you want to open an account, or sign the sign-in list (if there is one) and wait to be served. Alternatively, some banks allow you to open an account online.

, There will be an application for opening the account in which you'll need to provide basic information about yourself. In addition, bring a photo ID, proof of residence (a utility bill, for example), and your Social Security card. Different banks may require different information, but you will need to furnish proof of identity in some form.


You might also want to think about a 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) that you'll use for your check card, if you're issued one. That's the 4-digit number that's effectively your password for the card. Someone who steals your card won't be able to access your funds without that PIN.
If you don't have a Social Security number (for example, because you're a nonresident or resident alien), you can apply to the IRS to get an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).Once you have an ITIN, bring it with you when you go to open your account.
If you don't have a photo ID, you still might be able to open a bank account. In that case, some additional documentation may be required. Check with your local branch to determine what type of documentation is required.

, Read carefully over the paperwork regarding the account before signing. Make sure you understand the account policies, including fees charged for bounced checks, fees for transferring money between accounts, and interest rates on savings accounts. If you have any questions, ask them before signing.

, Now that your account is formally open, it's time to deposit the funds that you brought with you to the bank. If you're unclear about how to fill out a deposit slip, talk to the person who assisted you with opening the account. He or she will be happy to help.

, After filling out the paperwork, your account can generally be used immediately. If you ordered a checkbook or a debit card, wait for them in the mail. Activate the debit card according to the mailed instructions, if applicable.


You might get a temporary debit card when you open the account. A permanent debit card will likely be mailed to you.
You'll also likely receive temporary checks when you open the account. Use those checks until the other ones arrive in the mail.

Consider opening a basic checking account.,
Consider opening a Money Market Savings account.,
Consider opening a regular Savings account.,
Consider investing in a Certificate of Deposit (CD).,
Speak with an investment representative to discuss alternative options.",How to Decide Which Type of Bank Account to Open," A checking account is an account that you can make both deposits and withdrawals on a regular basis, and there are generally no transaction restrictions. You will probably want to open a savings account with a checking account as they earn little to no interest, so your money will not grow. A checking account also offers you the flexibility of writing checks out of the account to pay for things like your phone bill, cable bill, etc.;
, A Money Market Savings account is similar to a checking account in the sense that it allows you the flexibility to write checks out of the account. However, a Money Market Savings account will typically have transaction limits, such as only being able to write out a certain number of checks per month. The benefit to opening this type of account is that you will earn a higher interest rate than you would on a checking account. Interest rates on a Money Market Savings accounts generally go up in tiers, and you will earn interest based on the total deposit balance you are carrying in the account.

, A regular savings account is a great option for just about everyone. You can also make regular deposits and withdrawals without transaction restrictions when you have a Savings account. A Savings account also offers you the benefit of earning interest, just like a Money Market Savings account would. However, a Savings account earns a regular interest rate that does not vary, even if your deposit balance changes. This is a great way to save money for kids that may be saving up for college, a car, or their future house.

, A certificate of deposit will generally earn you a higher interest rate than any other type of account. However, there are downsides to investing in a Certificate of Deposit. First, you will need to commit to having your Certificate of Deposit for a certain time period - generally anywhere from 1 month to 10 years, or more. The longer you choose, the higher the interest rate you earn. Secondly, if you choose to withdraw money before your term if up (maturity date), you will be subject to penalties which will result in earning less money.

, If none of these accounts are appealing to you, or you have a large amount of money that you are looking to invest, consider speaking with an investment representative to discuss alternative account options. Generally when you look to invest with an investment representative, you will have a higher risk of loss, but you may also have the chance of earning more money from your investment.

Decide how many copies you want.,
Select shipping options.,
Enter your payment information.,
Review your card and order.Before completing your order, you should be able to review your order and make sure everything looks good.",How to Make ID Cards Online," Think about the purpose of the card, how many cards you will need, and what kind of design you want to use. Planning before you begin creating and ordering your ID card(s) will make the process easier and ensure that you get exactly the kind of card you need. Consider, for instance:


How will the card(s) be used? For instance, to permit access to a building or site? To differentiate an employee or group member from non-employees/group members? To prove someone’s identity?
If the card(s) will be used to prove identity, what security features will be used? A photograph? Bar code? Magnetic stripe? The right feature depends upon the capabilities you or your company/organization has.
How many cards do you need? Just one for yourself? One for each member of a group, organization, or company? Does each person need an individualized card, or is a standardized card for each group member sufficient?;
, There are numerous online ID creation services to choose from.If you are not already familiar with one or more, a quick online search should produce several. You can also ask for a colleague to recommend a service to you. In any case, choose a service that is reliable, cost-efficient, and that can deliver the options you need.

, Templates can save you time and effort by pre-selecting the design for you. Usually, if you use a template you will just need to click on the areas you want to adjust (such as text or a picture). If you design an ID card from scratch, you will have to decide where to position all of the information.

, If you don’t see a template that looks right for your needs, and you don’t want to or don’t have time to design one yourself, you can ask the ID printing service to create a custom design for you. Some services will announce this as an option when you begin the card design process.


Custom design services will probably entail a higher fee.

, There may be an additional fee for options. Examples of options you may choose include:


Orientation (portrait / vertical or landscape / horizontal)
Text font
Text to appear on the card (name, organization, etc.)
Background color or image
Lamination
Holograph
Material to print the card on (paper, plastic, etc.)
Punching a hole in the card
Including a bar code

, You will need to have a photo file stored on your computer or accessible to you online. In most cases, online ID creators allow you to simply click on an area of the card you are designing and insert the photo file you want to use. Most services also give you the option of editing the image (for instance, resizing or cropping it).

, You can enter in the appropriate information for this use, and the ID creator will encode it in the magnetic stripe.

, You will be given the option to choose these accessories; usually, there is an additional fee for them.

, If you are printing an ID just for yourself, you may only want one copy (or you may want to order a backup). If you are ordering IDs for others, such as key cards for your employees, you will want to order enough copies for all of them.


If you are ordering cards for multiple people, decide if you want to use a standard group card, or if you want to include personal details on each person’s card (such as the person’s name, picture, or employee number).
Many online ID manufacturers will offer discounts for ordering multiple cards., You may be able to choose between standard or expedited shipping, as well as add-ons like tracking.Typically, there is a fee for choosing such shipping options.


Some ID manufacturers may provide incentives, such as free shipping for orders over a certain amount.
Make sure to enter the correct address that you want the ID card(s) shipped to.
Take note of the estimated shipping date or tracking number so that you will know when to expect your ID card(s) to arrive.

, Once you have completed the ID card design process, chosen any accessories you want, and entered your shipping information, you are ready to pay for the card order. The online service will prompt you to enter information such as a credit card or bank account number to charge for the cost of the order.

, Make sure that your card looks the way you want it to, and that you have ordered enough copies.

Examine the company's published material.,
Attempt telecommunication first.,
Engage in written communication.,
Learn the physical area of the company.,
Travel to the company.",How to Locate a Company1," For situations where you may have gotten a business card, letter, and/or hand out at a meeting, these are good documents to find such information.Look out particularly for the company's letterhead at the top of any letter and/or legal sized documents. Usually these have the company's name, address, phone number, and perhaps e-mail and website also in the layout. The company's social media contact info may also be in the display.
Business cards can be more varied, so you may only get some of the information from a company such as phone number, e-mail, website, and/or address--in some mixed and matched layout.
If the document you have is something entirely non-standard, still attempt to extract contact information out of it or at least the company's name. You can use the other search methods later on in the article to find the company.;
, This is the best way to introduce yourself to the company and get an understanding of what sort of business you are dealing with at the moment--even if you have dealt with them before.You can use the telephone or e-mail contact in this instance. If you are contacting a particular individual you met before, for example at a job fair, you can try addressing or asking for them directly and reminding them of your prior meeting.
For example, you may have met the human resources director of the company and are calling the number he gave you on a business card. You can ask to speak with him directly and say something to the effect of, ""Hello, do you recall our meeting at the job fair your company held last week...""
You may be able to put more details within an e-mail than a phone call, but the phone call is a bit more personal.

, This is after initial contact, and you are pursuing some further business with the company.Whether your business is employment, sales, communication, etc... you need to establish two-way written communication with the company.
You may be able to get the postal address from the company's materials as mentioned in the earlier steps.
Another way to get the postal address during this method is to ask for it some time after the initial contact phase--in a follow-up phone call or e-mail. This has the added bonus of showing your continuing interest in the company. You can also let the contact know in advance that you will be making formal written requests.
An example of this might be you intend to partner your business with the company you located, so need to send legal documents in written physical form.

, After you have learned the location of the company, you can learn about the area itself.You don't need to learn the minute environmental details, unless that is a direct bearing on the business at hand, but learning the general climate and its impact on the company may help.
For example, if the company you are locating is an amusement park--finding out the time of year it general gets warmer and colder would be beneficial.

, This should be done once communication between you and the company is well established, and you have a decent understanding of their locality.


Expect that some of your impressions of the locality, business, and employees will change upon arrival.
Exercise polite business etiquette at all times. Show respect, but be firm in your own requests.
For example, if you've located a cafe you want to partner with your bakery, then you need to make a persistent offer without offending them.

Identify gaps in employee efficiency.,
Provide a secure internet network.,
Make sure your employees have a productive working environment.,
Check that your employee’s salaries are competitive and include full benefits.,
Reduce company travel time for your employees.,
Implement an employee recognition program.,
Create an employee efficiency committee.",How to Implement Efficiency Strategies1," Before you can create employee efficiency goals, you need to identify any gaps or issues in employee efficiency at your company. If you have several departments in your company, you may want to try to identify at least one to two efficiency gaps in each department.For example, you may have an efficiency gap between employee hours and completed projects. Though your employees seems to be working full workdays, projects are not being completed and profit margins are not being met. You may then analyze how your employees are working. Perhaps they do not have access to the latest technology, leading to slower work processes and a failure to meet project timelines. This may then be one efficiency gap for your employees: a non productive work environment.
Another example you may notice is that your employees do not seem as motivated or energized in the workplace and as a result, client relationships are suffering and projects are not going as smoothly as they should. You may then identify another efficiency gap: low motivation and incentives for employees.;
, Many employee inefficiencies, like miscommunication among employees and clients, poor employee performance, and missed deadlines, can be traced back to a poor internet network. You can address this inefficiency by making sure the company’s building has a secure and robust internet network that can keep up with the company’s workload. This is especially important if your employees use the internet to communicate with clients and with each other. A slow or faulty network can lead to missed emails, failed client communication, and delayed feedback from clients, thereby slowing down your employee’s productivity.

, As an employer, it is also essential that you provide a productive working environment for your employees to make sure they are being as efficient as possible. This could mean ensuring they have access to the latest desktops or laptops and well functioning electronics like printers, scanners, and fax machines. You should also make sure there are fully functioning conference phones in each meeting room and provide mobile phones for company use if your employees are often on the go.You may want to also make it easier for your employees to share information among each other by using Google Drive or another file sharing program. This way, important documents do not get misplaced or forgotten, allowing your employees to use technology and file sharing in the most efficient way possible.
Switching to online file sharing will also cut down on the amount of paper waste your company produces every year, thereby eliminating inefficiencies like high waste production and money spent on recycling and reducing waste in the office.

, Another possible cause of employee inefficiency is a lack of competitive compensation. If you are underpaying and overworking your employees, this could lead to resentment, low motivation, and high stress levels among your employees. Make sure you are providing salaries for your employees that are competitive based on the market and include full benefits, such as healthcare and a 401K or another employee retention program.Most employees will work harder and better if they know they have job security and stability and can rely on their employer to provide a fair, competitive wage. Healthcare and a retirement plan are also big incentives for employees to work efficiently and can help you keep your employees for a long period of time. This will then reduce the need to spend money on hiring and training for new employees.

, Travel on company time and company expense can lead to reduced operational efficiency and wasted resources. Focus on reducing the amount of time your employees need to travel to get to a client or to a job site. If possible, rely on video conferencing and email as much as possible to reduce the need for employee travel and only allow employee travel when it is absolutely necessary., Make your employees feel they are essential to your company, and necessary for improved efficiency in the company by creating an employee recognition program. Designate a supervisor or lead from each department to choose one employee who represents hard work, diligence, the company culture, and/or operational efficiencies.


The program could then reward recognized employees with a bonus, a name entered into a draw, or even a shout out of social media. The reward does not need to be expensive or lavish. Rather, it should spotlight the employee and ensure they feel recognized by the company, other employees, and clients.

, To keep up to date on employee efficiencies, you could encourage supervisors or leads to form an employee efficiency committee. Try to have a representative from each department or area on the committee so it is well rounded. Schedule monthly meetings to discuss how to improve the employee efficiencies and ensure at least one to two efficiency goals are created each month.

Perform a web search for the company.,
Verify the company's information with official sources.,
Establish the company's credentials.Run the company's name through the Better Business Bureau for a quality of service check.,
Make e-contact with the company.,
Determine if a physical visit is necessary.",How to Locate a Company2," There are numerous web search engines, but you should use one that is not over-loaded with ads and spyware.


Make sure your virus scanner is running and up to date.
You probably won't find a completely ad-free search engine, but if the site has so many ads it's slowing down the response--avoid it.
If you cannot find the company as you typed it, try advanced searches with different combinations. For example, if you are looking for companies that sell batteries you can mix in electronics, hardware, video game stores, department stores, etc...
If you are getting too many results, then you can narrow the search down by adding some words such as a probably location (region, or city), or another qualifier. #* For example, if you need a shop that sells a particular brand of wine in your area you can refine the search by typing in ""vineyards,"" and adding in the names of counties nearby, and/or the variety of wine.

, Once you have the company's basic information from the search, you can use related sources to double check the authenticity.If the company's physical location is readily available, check the locality's chamber of commerce website or city government's website for information. If neither is available or has no listing, try multiple local travel guides.
You might also try state and federal government sites for assistance.

,
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Federal Trade Commission may include the company's information within official government rolls or the company's respective state may retain that information.

, If the company has a safe website, check it out thoroughly first. This should also have their contact information.


If the website is noticeably lacking in contact information, this could either be simply poor design or a sign the company is not interested in direct contact.
If you have trouble finding contact information from the company's electronic displays, contact one of the official repositories you saw them listed in before to see if they have another means to make contact.

, Depending on what business you wish to conduct, a physical visit may be required.


If the company is making contact difficult, and your business with them is not urgent, you may wish to reconsider doing business with this company at all. Under these conditions, you should get more information on the company's behavior from other reviewers before proceeding at all.
If you have made successful contact and/or you insist on further activity with the company, then you may need to personally travel to their location. For example, if this is an online company you ordered a product from and you wish to tour their production line, a physical visit would be one way to see their process in action.

Collect several comprehensive guidebooks.,
Narrow down the search to a manageable sized region.,
Mark several phone numbers and addresses to attempt to contact.,
Contact a chamber of commerce.,
Contact the company directly by phone or certified mail.",How to Locate a Company3," You will want a good selection by region and theme. Make sure these are up to date guides.


Any standard bookstore or travel shop should have the guides you would need.
Look for guides that include multiple geographic areas in local, state, and regional detail. For example, if you are looking for companies in Texas, you want guides that might include the Dallas metro area, Texas, and the American South-West or Mid-West.
Include guides that have indices of businesses preferably in alphabetical and categorical order, this will help you flip back and forth between finds.

, As you figure out where your company is located, you can focus on the guides for those areas.


If you're still not sure what your company's name is, use the category index first to get an idea of the types of business that do what is you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for fishing gear shops--see what's in the sporting goods section.
Use the alphabetical index to see what variations there might be on the company's name if you have a partial idea of the title.
Once you have the company name(s) picked out, you can use the guide's information to see how many locations these businesses may have and can narrow your search to find the particular office you want.

, Use the smaller list you made in the previous step to create a contact list.


Ideally, this should be just a few companies to contact to find the one you are trying to locate, perhaps no more than 5 to 10. If there are more than this number, you should attempt to narrow your search in the guides some more.
If you can verify the information from the company in more than one of the guides, do so.
Mark these companies in the guides, and write their information out on a separate location/list.

, Note the physical location each company is in and use either a phone book or directory assistance to contact the chamber of commerce.If the company is in your immediate area, you can use a phone book to contact your chamber of commerce.
If the company is in another area, use directory assistance to get the number of or connect you to the chamber of commerce. Directory assistance can be reached by dialing ""411"" on most U.S. phones.
Once talking to the chamber of commerce, verify the company's information with them--especially the name and physical address. If there is a problem with the information, the reasons could be numerous including the guide being in error or the company going out of business after the guide's publication.
If the information is correct, or it's not, mark it so on your list and do this for each you saved from your guides.
Determine which company or companies you want to make further contact with.

, After you've established the company's physical location and contact information, you can try communication.A phone call would be faster than mail. If this is a company with a relatively low electronic and social media presence, you might give them your phone number in return if you consider it safe to do so. For example, if you are contacting an old paper mill, you may want the foreman to call you back at a more convenient time.
If you use the U.S. Postal Service for your initial contact, you should consider certified mail or at least a return receipt when sending correspondence. This way the recipient at the company has to sign for the letter, or at least the USPS will let you know when and exactly where the letter was delivered via a tracking number.
For example, if you want to contact an old television show set with a reclusive producer--the certified mail method will at least verify someone is at the location. Or they have to refuse delivery.

Define the process you are modeling.,

Make sure you can rearrange parts as needed.,

Brainstorm improvements to the as-is model.,
Identify how improvements will help the business or the customer.,
Build the to-be model.,
Implement the new model.",How to Make a Business Process Model," Define a process in your business operation that has a clear starting point and output. The process can be simple, like the redirection of a customer complaint, or complex, like the entire order and shipping process for an online product. The process can involve one department or business organization level or several of each. Whatever process you are measuring, just be sure that it can be easily split into clear parts with easy-to-identify relationships between them.For example, one process that can be modeled relatively easy is the receipt of an online order and checking whether or not the customer has the money to pay for it and if the item is in stock. The output is that the order checks out (in stock, able to be paid for) and is sent to the shipping department.;
, Any process requires a first step, which can realistically be anything. However, the starting point of a business process should be what raises your process to action. In other words, it is the input that the business seeks to convert into an output. Starting points generally fall into one of several categories:


External events. These include the initiation of a transaction or a transmitted alert from another business system. For example, a problem in automated system that requires human attention is an external event.
Content arrival. For content management systems, the starting point might be the arrival of a new document or other form of content.
Human intervention. This includes customer complaints and other human intervention within or outside of the business.For the previous example, the starting point is the receipt of a customer order.

, Next, you will need to identify each individual step in your process and how it is connected to the other steps. On the most general level, you will have events (steps that require no action by the business), activities (performed by the business in response to input), and decision gateways (splits in the process where the path of the process is decided by some qualifier). Between these objects, there are connectors, which can be either be solid arrows (activity flow), or dashed (message/information flow).


In traditional business process modeling notation (BPMN), the steps are represented by different shapes depending on their function. For example, events are circles, activities are rectangles, and decision gateways are diamonds.For the previous example, we would use steps such as ""customer order"" (an event), ""process order"" (an activity), ""Check credit"" (an action), ""Credit?"" (a decision gateway that leads to one of two other actions, depending on a ""yes"" or ""no"" determination), and so on.

, In order to make your process as clear as possible, you should determine which part of the business completes each step. Different parts of the process may be completed by the accounting department, customer service, or order fulfillment, for example. Alternately, for a small business, these steps may be completed by specific individuals. In BPMN, the associated person or department for each activity is either denoted by a designator next to the step or by a ""pool,"" a horizontal division in the flow chart that shows which part of the business performs each step. Pools may be further divided into ""lanes,"" which specify a particular part of the company or person within the pool.For the previous example, we might just write outside of the step ""check credit"" that this action is performed by the business's online retail platform (if this is the case).

, BPMN can take many forms, from sequential modeling to causation model. It can also be done using anything from specialized software to post-it notes or a whiteboard. It is up to your business to choose which method works best for working with your process model. However, keep in mind that these models usually work best with group input, so you may be better off using the type of modeling that can be worked on most easily by the group., When you are creating your model, make sure you can move around each step as necessary. You may find that some parts of the model can be consolidated, moved around, and reordered to make the system flow more effectively. Make sure also that the labels associated with each step, if any, can be moved easily with the step., Begin by including the starting point of the process at the top left of whatever platform you are using to illustrate the process. Identify each subsequent step, including decisions between them, and places that steps in order from the first one. Check each step as you add it to make sure there are not any steps between that step and the previous one. Continue until you have reached the output of the business process.For the previous example, your steps might be as follows:


Customer order (event) to process order (an activity) to check credit (an activity) to credit? (a decision gateway).
If the customer's credit doesn't check out, you would move to the step contact the customer (activity), labeling the arrow between the steps with a ""no"" label. Then, you would move to cancel the order (activity).
If the customer's credit checks out (a ""yes"" response), you would move on to check stock (activity) and connect the steps with an arrow labeled ""yes."" Then, you would check the stock in the decision gateway labeled as ""stock?"".
If the item is in stock, label the arrow ""yes"" as before and send the order to shipping (an activity).
If the item is not in stock, you would move to contact the customer and cancel the order (both activities).

, First, look over your model with a coworker or a group. Examine it for any potential holes or missed steps. Then, follow the actual business process and compare it to your model. Alternately, you can run the model in a focus group or meeting to see any steps that don't flow or are left out., Once you've run through your model to make sure that it works, start looking over it again to locate areas where resources aren't being used efficiently or where communications or steps that need to happen are not completed. Again, having a coworker or a group of coworkers present to help you with this adds to your ability to find these issues.For the previous example, you may realize that the process fails to let customers know that the item may be back in stock soon. This cancels the order that could otherwise be fulfilled within a number of days.

, Using your list of issues with the as-is model, identify potential fixes to the problems. You may find that issues can be fixed by focusing on three primary areas: automation, geographical coordination, and removing middlemen. Automation may help you reduce resources or time required for a step. Geographical coordination can include outsourcing steps for reduced cost or efficiency. Cutting out middlemen involves reducing the number of participants in the process to reduce the chance of miscommunication or cut costs. Other areas for locating improvements may include:


Informational: measuring more data regarding the process to find issues.
Sequential: rearranging steps.
Tracking: helps you monitor process progress.
Analytical: improves decision-making at decision gateways.For the previous example, you could think about implementing a system for checking when an out of stock item will be back in stock and alerting the customer to an estimated delivery time.

, Before implementing a new system based on your improvements, make sure that the improvements actually help either the customer or the business, or both. Making a change just because you can may result in unnecessary additional costs or more process mistakes.

, Convert your suggested improvements into steps and place them in your previous model appropriately. For the previous example, this might include creating an activity step to check whether the item will be in stock soon after the decision stock? and the ""no"" arrow. This would be placed before the ""contact customer"" activity and would change the output of that activity from letting the customer know that the item will not be shipped to letting them know when it will be shipped and that it will be later than expected.

, Test the model using the previous method and then implement it in your business. Make sure to test it regularly and reassess it for inefficiencies and issues."

Set up weekly check ins with clients.,
Ask clients for feedback on your company’s efficiency.,
Monitor project timelines to ensure deliverables are met.",How to Implement Efficiency Strategies2," To improve client efficiency, you can personally check in with your clients, or focus on specific high need clients, and discuss possible inefficiencies or issues. Ask your clients how their overall experience with the company has been, as well as how they feel their project manager, leader, or contact is doing in terms of time management and communication.You should also make sure employees are maintaining active communication with their clients and touching base on a daily or weekly basis. Though your employees may have a lot of projects on their plate, it is important that they keep communication with their clients open and accessible. This will show they can efficient with their time and maintain an efficient relationship with clients.

, You should be willing and ready to note any feedback from clients you receive in your weekly check in. Create a client feedback system where feedback is entered weekly or monthly in a survey or checklist. You can then review the feedback with your employees to give them a sense of client expectations and needs.You can also use client feedback to identify client inefficiencies, such as missed deadlines or failed communication. You can work with your employees to create possible solutions for these inefficiencies, such as scheduling deadlines one week early to ensure they are met or maintaining daily check ins with clients to keep communication open and accessible.

, While you do not want to micro manage your employees or your clients, you should have a good sense of where client projects stand and recognize when deliverables are being met. This may mean walking the floor of the office several times a day to check in with certain teams or areas or scheduling daily or weekly check in meetings for employees working on certain accounts or projects.Try to identify projects where clients are high need or high risk and keep a close eye on these. You may also want to ensure the employees on the account or project are prepared to tackle the needs of the client and can respond well to the client expectations. A big part of setting a project up for success is making sure the employee and the client work well together.

Identify key efficiency gaps for the fiscal year.,
Improve the company’s technology every fiscal year.,
Update the company’s efficiency needs based on employee and client feedback.",How to Implement Efficiency Strategies3," Take a broad view of company efficiency and try to identify at least four to five efficiency gaps you would like employees to focus on for the fiscal year. This will ensure your goals are current every year and can build off the goals of the previous year.


You may have company efficiency goals like improving the work environment by switching to a more sophisticated computer program or computing system, reducing the amount of paper waste produced in the office, providing better compensation for long standing employees, and ensuring clients receive more effective project management from employees.
Once you have identified the key efficiency gaps for the year, assign one goal to each department or area in the company. This will ensure it is clear who is accountable for addressing the gap and increase the likelihood that the gap will be addressed.

, Most companies can improve their efficiency by improving their technology every year, from upgrading to faster computers to investing in several scanners or printers for use in the office. Focusing on the latest technology will keep operational efficiency high and allow your employees to work to their full potential.If you have growing IT needs and demands, you may want to consider outsourcing your IT needs to a contractor or outside company. This may be a necessary expense if the company is not able to keep up with the IT needs of clients and employees, and allow your company to focus on providing excellent customer service and meeting deadlines, rather than IT issues.

, Use feedback from your clients and your employees to add to the company’s efficiency goals and make sure these goals are up to date and current. Let your employees and your clients know that they are active participants in implementing efficiency strategies at the company and that you rely on them to help the company become more efficient."

Link employee development to learning delivery.,
Align learning activities to business objectives.,
Maintain regulatory compliance.,
Track learning effectiveness throughout the organization.,
Create seamless on-boarding plans for employees.",How to Get the Most out of Your Learning Management Investments," Development plans help employees improve in their current role, better prepare them for a future role of interest (which is important in the context of succession planning), or both. While employee skill, competency, and behavior gaps are typically identified during the performance assessment process (or a 360 feedback process), learning delivery is the mechanism to close the gaps. A few key questions to consider to link employee development to learning delivery are:


Are recommended courses and programs automatically presented to users within their development plans to facilitate training and coursework?
Is the transition between employee development planning and learning management seamless to users (e.g., same user interface, look and feel, does not give the user the impression of a disconnected process)?
Is systems integration effort and cost required to tie development and learning delivery together, or do all the requisite capabilities reside on a common technology platform that natively connects the functions out of the box?;
, Part of the promise of integrated talent management is improving alignment between workforce activities and overall business strategies and objectives. This alignment is typically achieved through performance management and goals. Managers and their directs establish goals as part of the performance management process and align the goals up through the organization. Alternatively, the organization cascades goals down to the workforce. In either scenario, it is often the case that employees need specific training to achieve their goals.


Part of the challenge in linking these functions has been technical in nature. Many organizations continue to use multiple systems (e.g., performance system, learning management system) that are not integrated. Yet as many organizations continue to gravitate toward single platform solutions that natively connect functions such as learning, performance, and goals, the technical integration challenges can be eliminated. These single platform solutions also make it much easier to report on key metrics such as the effectiveness of learning programs on performance since all of the data resides in a centralized repository. With this data in hand, HR leaders are better equipped to monitor and continuously improve their learning processes and programs.

, Learning management systems (LMS) are an important mechanism for managing compliance and certification training within an organization. Without a central tracking repository, and no way to report globally, organizations can quickly fall out of regulatory compliance. A few key questions to consider to maintain regulatory compliance are


Can compliance-related courses be automatically assigned to new hires as a part of the on-boarding process? Can triggers and alerts be established to automatically inform employees when they need refresher training?
Does your current learning system provide a library of pre-defined competencies? Does it provide tools for managing competencies, including competency categories, supporting definitions, behaviors, on-the-job activities, and development opportunities? Can you easily import your existing competencies into the system?
Does your learning system include robust reporting and analytic capabilities to facilitate compliance reporting? Does it come with out-of-box standard reports? And is the complexity of the reporting and analytic engine abstracted so that non-technical users can run their own reports without IT intervention?

, Within many organizations, there is no systematic way to track the impact of learning programs on organizational outcomes. These outcomes may include workforce productivity or even individual performance. Part of the challenge lies in the fact that data is spread out in various silos across the organization and there is no common employee system of record. A single, fully-connected talent platform that covers the gamut of HR functions and processes, including learning, can alleviate some of the problems since the data is all in one place. And with a robust analytic and reporting function, previously unavailable insight can be gained.

, An effective new hire orientation and on-boarding program is essential to ensuring the long-term success of new employees. Yet employees – and their managers in many cases – often find it difficult to know which training courses to take, especially if development planning is not a part of the on-boarding process. As a result, a lot of time and frustration can occur early in a new employee’s career within the organization, which can lead to an early engagement deficit or even increased turnover.

Identify features (factors) which exist in internal and external environment of your company.,
For each category, go over the identified features and select those which are important to you.,
For each category create ranking of features.,
Identify relations between features.,
Now do the math.,
Now you should have four subtotal scores: one for Strengths and Opportunities, one for Strengths and Threats and so on.,
Identify which features have the biggest impact of given strategy and work on them.",How to Identify Strategy with a SWOT Analysis," These features can be divided in four different categories. Strengths and Weaknesses are internal factors; Opportunities and Threats are external factors. Create 2x2 matrix and write down the features. There are a lot of resources how to properly identify these factors. Every factor in each category could be an answer to different questions. For instance:


For Strengths: In which areas your company has competitive advantage?
For Weakness: Are there any areas inside your company which limit growth?
For Opportunity: In which areas your target market can be identified as friendly?
For Threats: Is there any external situation which can cause any trouble?;
, Remember, as the Pareto Rule states: roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. For instance: when you identified ten weaknesses, select 2 to 5 which you think are most important in your current situation.

, Easiest way is to assign score for each feature and sort them accordingly to assigned score. Higher score means greater importance of previously selected feature.


Choose whatever scale you need, but the easiest method is to assign scores between 1-100.
Make sure that the total score of all features in given category is equal to 100.

, Relations define whether some internal feature has influence on external one. For each category and for each pair of features from these categories answer:


Strengths and Opportunities: Whether given strength strengthen given opportunity?
Strengths and Threats: Whether given strength overcomes given threat?
Weaknesses and Opportunities: Whether given weakness limits use of given opportunity?
Weaknesses and Threats: Whether given weakness intensifies impact of given threat?

, Collect answers from previous step. For each pair of categories (Strengths and Opportunities, Strengths and Threats and so on...) calculate total score. The easiest algorithm is just mathematical sum.


Add score of left-hand feature (strength) to score of right-hand feature (opportunity) for all pairs which has relation identified as existing (for instance: Yes, this strength overcomes this threat); all pairs which has non-existing relation are counted as 0.
Sum up all added up scores and get final results for each pair of categories.

, Compare scores, each score represents suggested strategy for your current situation:


If Strengths and Opportunities has the biggest score, your strategy should be Aggressive
If Strengths and Threats has the biggest score, your strategy should be Diversification.
If Weaknesses and Opportunities has the biggest score, your strategy should be Turnaround.
If Weaknesses and Threats has the biggest score, your strategy should be Defensive.

, For example: for defensive strategy identify most dangerous weakness (Note: it should not be necessarily one with biggest score assigned by you in previous steps - that is the point of relation step) and try to limit it.


Create goals for your company and execute some actions which would limiting this weakness.
Then get back to your analysis in a month or so, update it and check if features from previous SWOT still exist and latest strategy recommendation is still valid.

Understand the business process improvement method.,
Prepare for change.,
Lead your team through the BPI effort.,
Maintain the changes you made while making sure people do not revert back to old practices.",How to Lead a Business Process Improvement Effort," The goal of a BPI effort is twofold: to improve customer experience and to improve business practices and operations. There should be a clear beginning and end to specific projects within your BPI effort.


Take an inventory of your current processes.
Identify different areas where you could potentially improve your process or procedure. Prioritize what needs to happen first.
Identify specific goals and objectives by listing steps you will take to improve in these areas.
Create a plan for organizational change.
Ensure that everyone within the leadership team knows their role, how different departments are involved, and the expected time frame and cost of the BPI effort.
Review your plan. Make sure it is realistic and that others in your business are on-board with these changes.
Lead the change effort. Communicate clearly to the employees involved about what is changing and why the change is warranted.
Continue improving business processes. Organizations should always be trying to cut back on costs and improving the experience for their customers.;
, Before you actually implement the BPI effort, you need to get your workplace and your team ready for the changes that are about to take place. To lead during this stage, you will need to have strong meeting management skills. You will also need to ask questions and start conversations.


Create a case for change. Make a direct correlation to how these changes will affect the customer.
See the business from the customer's perspective and identify what can make it better. For example, look at how user-friendly your product or service is, determine if you are meeting customers' expectations, and whether you are able to keep up with demand.
Foster the right environment for change by appointing a leadership team to oversee the BPI effort. Have clearly defined goals for this team.
Develop methods to create this change, a communication plan for announcing it, and a schedule or time line for implementing it.

, When it comes time to actually lead the change itself, practice good communication, project management, observation and awareness, as well as strategic thinking skills.


Collect additional information that will help you effectively design your BPI effort. Be thorough in looking for potential obstacles.
Implement the change by making sure that resources are available for the team to use.
Address obstacles that continue to slow or stop the process.
Identify and celebrate quick wins to keep employee morale high.
Keep momentum going during this phase or you risk losing a sense of urgency from the rest of your organization.

,


Continue to collaborate with others in the organization.
Recognize and celebrate big wins.
Monitor the changes recently implemented and observe how they are affecting both the company and the customers.
Address any problem areas and strive to keep the BPI effort going.

Analyze executive compensation.",How to Find an Annual Proxy Statement," The SEC maintains a database, known as EDGAR, which contains financial filings by publicly traded companies. You can visit the SEC website at: https://www.sec.gov/index.htm.


Once on the website, locate the drop down menu entitled “Filings.” It is located on the blue banner across the top of the page.
Click on the drop down menu “Filings,” and from the options listed click on “Company Filings Search.”;
, After clicking on “Company Filings Search,” you will be directed to an EDGAR search page that allows you to search by company name. In the search box, enter the company name for which you want to locate a proxy statement.


EDGAR also allows you to search by the company’s stock ticker symbol. A ticker symbol is the abbreviation that the company uses on the stock exchange. For example, the ticker symbol for General Electric Co. is ""GE."" You can search for stock ticker symbols at: http://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/lookup.asp.
Your search may return one or more companies matching the name that you entered into EDGAR. Look through the list and locate the company for which you are searching.
Once you locate the correct company, click on the CIK number located to the left of the company’s name. This will redirect you to a list of the company’s filings.

, After clicking on the CIK number hyperlink, a list of the company’s filings will appear. You will be provided with the filing type number, a hyperlink to the documents, a description of the document, the date it was filed, and the File/Film number. The documents are listed with the most recent filing at the top.


Scan down the list of “filings” (filing type) and look for “DEF 14A. This is the code for the proxy statement.
Click on the “Documents” button to the right of the filing type. You will be redirected to all of the documents and graphics that are part of the proxy statement.
Generally the first document will be the proxy statement, DEF 14A. Click on the hyperlink and the proxy statement will open.

, If you are a shareholder in a company, the SEC requires that the company provide you a notice of all proxy material. This notice will contain a link whereby you can download or review a proxy statement online. The company is required to provide you this information at least 40 days before a meeting at which shareholders are able to vote.


The notice will also provide you the date, time and location of the meeting.
You will also be provided with instructions on how you can receive a paper copy of the proxy statement., Generally, you will receive a notice in the mail detailing how you can access your proxy materials. Some companies allow you to receive your notices electronically. If you did not receive your notice, you should:


Check your email to see whether your notice was sent electronically. You should also check your junk mail folder.
If you did not sign up for electronic notification, you can contact the company to see why you have not receive your materials. If you moved and failed to provide your new address to your brokerage firm or to the company, your notice may have been sent to your old address.
Most companies will have an investor relations department that assists shareholders with issues. You can search on the company’s website or conduct an internet search for the name of the company and the words: investor relations. This should direct you to the appropriate office.

, If you are not already a shareholder, you can become a shareholder by purchasing shares in a company directly, rather than through a mutual fund or retirement account. In order to be considered a shareholder, your name must be recorded as the shares’ owner in the company’s records. Generally, within three days from your purchase of the stock, your name will appear on the company’s record books, and you will be deemed the holder of record in addition to the legal owner of the shares.Most commonly, investors purchase stock in the following ways:


Investors purchase stock through a broker or brokerage firms. Common brokerage firms include Charles Schwab or Smith Barney.
Investors can also purchase stock through online stock trading platforms such as Ameritrade or E-Trade., Since shareholders in a company have the right to vote on important corporate issues including approving a merger or selling the company, public companies are required to provide shareholders with important information about the company. The proxy statement helps shareholders make informed voting decisions and provides important information on how to vote and what issues are up for a vote.


Proxy statements may reveal relationships between board members and management, important issues about executive compensation, and the stake that each executive and board member has in the company., There are at least two ways that a shareholder or a potential investor can analyze a company’s proxy statement. The first way is to read the proxy statement in its entirety. This way may be best if you are new to reading proxy statements. While these documents can sometimes be 100 pages long, reading or even scanning through the document will help you get a better sense of the format of the document and the type of information required by the SEC.


The benefits of reading the entire document is that you get all of the details shared in the proxy statement and you learn more about the company.
Individuals who are new to reviewing proxy statements may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information contained in the document and unwilling to make a significant time commitment to reading through the material.
However, by reading some parts in depth (discussed below) and scanning through others, a reader will get a much clearer sense of the companies activities., A second method for reviewing a proxy statement is to search the document for specific categories of information. This method works better for those who are already familiar with the layout of proxy statements since it will be easier for them to navigate through the sections to find specific information.


In order for this method to work, you need to choose an objective and make that objective central to your research.
For example, if you choose compensation as your objective, you can quickly scan down the pages of the document until you see something that refers to compensation, such as the compensation table. You would then closely read the information listed in the table and the footnotes related to the table.
Any information unrelated to your objective goes unread, which makes this a much faster method to evaluate the information in a proxy statement., The executive team provides the “backbone” of a company. It not only runs the business but also sets the tone for office culture and provides inspiration to the company’s employees. A bad management team can derail a successful company.When evaluating a proxy statement, consider the following:


Who is the executive team and what is their background? The executive team may include: the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or President; Chief Operating Officer (COO), Vice President of Operations or General Manager; Vice President of Marketing or Marketing Manager; Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or Controller; Vice President of Production or Production Manager.What is their previous experience and how did they perform in previous positions?
You can read about the management team in the management section of the proxy statement.
It will provide you information on the executives and board of directors as well as who established the company, and the culture of the company., It is important to note whether a board of directors is comprised primarily of the company’s executives or whether there are also independent board members. An independent board member is a person who does not have a major financial stake in the company and does not own any shares.Boards that are primarily filled with independent members tend to provide more value to the company, making it a better financial investment.
Independent boards are more likely to replace a failing CEO, if he or she is not benefitting the company.You can locate information about the board of directors in the management section of the proxy statement.

, All shareholders and investors should closely analyze executive compensation. This information is contained in a distinct section of the proxy statement and includes a chart to more clearly delineate the salary and perks, such as, country club fees, company apartments and cars and drivers, that each executive receives. When evaluating compensation in the proxy statement, you should consider the following:


How does the company explain its compensation program?
What is the compensation program meant to reward?
What does the compensation program include, such as base salary, bonuses, perks?
What triggers the payment of each type of compensation? For example, what does an executive have to do to receive his or her bonus? Is a bonus tied to performance or not?
How is compensation calculated? Is there a specific formula that the company follows?
How does the company’s compensation decisions fit within the broader goals and aims of its compensation program?
When reviewing executive compensation, you should be asking yourself whether an executive deserves the big bonus that he or she is receiving.For information on executive compensation, you should read the section on executive compensation but also the table summarizing compensation. The footnotes to the table often contain “hidden” compensation that executives read."

On a budget, a party in a break room or at the company president's home can create an intimate environment. With some decorations, music, and mood lighting, it can still have a great ambiance.
On a moderate budget, you might look into local community centers, churches, or local parks. Most charge a fee to rent space, but the fee is usually minimal.
With a bigger budget, you could rent a convention hall or a local historic meeting place. You could even rent out a nice restaurant or a country club.

, Be sure to give everyone plenty of notice, especially if you plan to spend a lot of time and money putting the party together. You can send a save-the-date many months in advance.


Decide if you will invite significant others and/or children. Be polite but clear about your expectations in the invitation. If you plan to keep it employees-only, you can add a small line at the end of the invitation that says, ""Employees only, please."" Otherwise, you can ask invitees to ""Please RSVP for you and a guest."" For a family-friendly affair, be sure to emphasize that ""Families of employees are welcome to attend.""
As with any party, the invitation sets the tone. If you send a quick email, your employees will assume it is a casual affair. If you mail a crisp envelope and an embossed card, hand addressed, you are communicating that it is a more formal party.

, This can be as simple or complex as your budget and tastes allow. For a low-budget affair, having a company-wide potluck can be fun and affordable!


Consider hiring a catering company if many people will be attending or if you plan to serve a whole meal or complex, fancy hors devours.
Decide if you want to include alcohol, and if so, if guests will receive a limited amount or if you will have an open bar. Be aware that open-bar parties often lead to intoxication.

, In addition to music (which can be in the form of a live band or a stereo system, depending again on your budget), think of ways to incorporate your company's history into the evening's events.


Consider asking the owner, president, or department heads to give a toast or short speech about their best memories with the company.
If budget allows, you can prepare and show a video or slideshow about the history of the company. You can hire a production company to put something like this together, or do it in-house or by yourself with a lower budget.

Give your employees and/or stakeholders a keepsake.,
Consider making a charitable contribution.,
Make a time capsule.",How to Celebrate a Corporate Anniversary2," Depending on your budget and how many keepsakes you will need to purchase, there are many great ideas that can be customized to commemorate the founding of your company.


Branded apparel, a desk clock engraved with the company name and anniversary year, or a mug with your company logo might make great keepsakes to show your employees or stakeholders that they are appreciated.
If you have a large budget and a production department in your company, you could even make a company history book or a short documentary to distribute to your employees.

, One way to give back to a community for a successful year of business is to give a donation, spend time in volunteer work, or make improvements to a local public space.


Consider giving your employees an optional day of volunteer service in the community to do a group project. You can work with groups like your local food bank, Habitat for Humanity, or your local parks service for day-long projects.
Perhaps you would like to create some type of monument for your corporation that will stand the test of time. A park bench, new playground equipment, or even trees planted along a freeway can be erected with a plaque specifying that it was donated on behalf of your company's anniversary.

, A time capsule is a great way to make a ceremony feel special and gives you something to look forward to in future years. It is also a great way to get employees involved in the ceremony.


You might put in items that represent each year of the company's history, each department in the company, or each employee (for a smaller company).
Hold a company-wide ceremony to put items into the capsule and reminisce about the founding of the company and its vision going forward.

Look at the past.,
Use this as an opportunity to re-examine your direction.,
Choose an anniversary theme.",How to Celebrate a Corporate Anniversary3," Big anniversaries are a great time to reflect on how your organization got started and how it has since developed. Think of it as an exercise in strategic thinking.Think about the big questions about your company's past: Who founded it, and why? What was the original vision of the company? Reaffirm the values that are the hallmark of what you stand for as a company, but be willing to reassess those that have not served you well.

, A major corporate anniversary is a great time to issue new vision plans or mission statements for the coming years.


Try filling in the blanks to complete this statement: ""Our company was founded with a vision for _____. Our goals were ____, _____, and _____."" Then think about whether your company met those goals, and whether it might be time to set new ones.

, Particularly if this is your company's centennial or other huge milestone, consider choosing an appropriate theme that builds on your company's past and current values to mark the anniversary year.For example, the year might be spent in ""Innovation,"" ""Service,"" ""Diversity,"" or other value that will help to strategically situate your company for success in the coming years.
Consider launching a company-wide initiative to give form to the year's theme. For example, your departments might set benchmarks or goals to measure innovation or service projects.

Realize that this isn't about reaching out to the right candidate, it's about putting in place the process whereby you can make the right choice.,
Know your business needs and let those guide you.,
Select the candidate according to their fit.,
Do your homework.,
Don't be fooled by the candidate's inner vision, passion and aspirations and think that this is the right person for the job.,
Use mosaic vision.",How to Calibrate the Expertise and Expectations of a Job Candidate," More often than not, candidates are called for an interview and their caliber is judged in an hour only. Is it the right way? Or should a business re-look and review the entire approach?;
, Too many businesses, despite knowing their strength and market size, are proud to recruit candidates from much bigger organizations, thinking that such employees will add great value. However, this is an attempt to engage an elephant to pull a cart. Elephants can indeed do more work than a bull but the nature of the job and the job brief won't fit the elephant. After some time, the business will realize that the employee recruited is not contributing and hence should be shown the door.

, For skills-based work, a thinker or a creator would be a wrong choice. Every job brief should have a clear growth map as to what extent the function can possibly grow and contribute to the organization in future. If the growth potential is limited, however talented the employee may be, the opportunity is going to be very limited for the selected candidate.

, Before hiring an employee, the HR and the organization must question the fact whether the candidate is hired for his/her leadership and vision or for his/her administrative capabilities and contribution to the ongoing work.

, When the ‘present’ is in great need, the future is always a mirage. When an employee is hired based on his future contributions, demanding performance from such candidate in the current activities will certainly create a mismatch. This should be understood by both the organizations as well as the candidates looking for a career.

, The assessment of the candidates during interview should be done through the ‘compound eyes’ by using ‘mosaic vision’. This is applicable to the candidate as well in selecting the organization to work with. They should not jump to a job without knowing the brief, as it may jeopardize their career or may delay or deny the growth prospects.

Understand “hard” versus “soft” inquiries.,
Check if the inquiries impact your credit score.,
Identify when to challenge an inquiry.,
Obtain a copy of your credit report.,
Review the report carefully.,
Contact the entity that made the hard inquiry.,
Dispute hard inquiries online.,
Write a letter.,
Mail the letter.,
Receive the results of the investigation.,
Include a statement of dispute.",How to Dispute Credit Inquiries," Credit inquiries fall into two categories, “hard” and “soft.” A “hard” inquiry occurs when a financial institution like a mortgage lender or credit card provider reviews your credit history in order to make a lending decision.Typically, you authorize the hard inquiry when you apply for credit.


A “soft” inquiry, by contrast, occurs when a person or company checks your credit score for reasons other than lending credit. The person checking may be an employer or the owner of an apartment building who pulls the information as part of a background check. Soft inquiries sometimes occur without your permission.;
, While both hard and soft credit inquiries may appear on your credit report, only hard inquiries (which are inquiries you authorize), may negatively impact your score. Multiple hard inquiries hurt your score because they may signal that you are unable to qualify for credit but desperate to receive it.The impact of a hard inquiry will depend on your credit history. Some people will not be affected by one hard credit inquiry.

, If a hard inquiry occurred without your permission—e.g., because you were the victim of identity theft—then you may want to dispute the inquiry. This is especially true if you think it has lowered your score.


Most hard inquiries cannot be removed and will remain on your report for two years.However, if you did not authorize the inquiry, then you should challenge it.
Even if an unauthorized credit inquiry hasn’t hurt your score, it might in the future, especially if you are looking to take out credit soon.

, You should begin by pulling your credit report and checking to see if you have any inquiries. You can request a free annual credit report in the following manner:Call 1-877-322-8228 and request that a report be mailed to you.
Visit annualcreditreport.com and request the report. You should get immediate access to it.
Complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. A copy of the form is available at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf.

, You should go over your report to see what hard inquiries have been made. Make a notation of any inquiry that you are unsure of or want to challenge.

, You should try to gather as much information as possible about who made the credit inquiry and why. You can begin by calling the organization listed on your credit report as having made the inquiry.If the credit report does not list a phone number, then call the credit reporting agency to ask for it.If the organization claims that you authorized the inquiry, then ask for proof. They should be happy to share with you a copy of the form that you signed.If the organization claims you gave oral permission, they should still be able to share with you a printout that lists the representative who you gave the permission to, as well as the date and time., You can dispute any inquiry online by using each credit reporting agency’s online dispute mechanism. You should dispute with each agency individually. Keep a record of the day and time when each dispute is made.


You can reach Equifax’s online dispute system by visiting its website and then clicking on the “Credit Report Assistance” tab at the top. Then select “Dispute info on credit report” from the drop-down menu.Experian’s online dispute system is available by going to the “Consumer Assistance” heading and then selecting “Disputes.”You can reach TransUnion’s online dispute system by clicking on the “Credit Reports, Disputes, Alerts & Freezes” tab, located at the top of the page., If you do not want to file a dispute online, then you can write a letter. In your letter, you should state the facts and why you did not authorize the hard inquiry. Also specifically request that the entry be deleted. If you are the victim of identity theft, then make sure to mention that in your letter and provide a copy of the police report as well. Also explain what other legal action you have taken to secure your identity.


A sample letter is available from the Federal Trade Commission at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0485-sample-letter-disputing-errors-your-credit-report-information-providers. You should revise it to suit your circumstances.
Make several copies of the letter for your records.

, Make sure to mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested. In this way, you will have proof that the credit reporting agency received it. The address for each major credit reporting agency is as follows:


Experian’s National Consumer Assistance Center, P.O. Box 4500, Allen, TX 75013.Equifax Information Services, LLC, P.O. Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374.TransUnion LLC, Consumer Dispute Center, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19022., The credit reporting agency is required to investigate the dispute and must do so generally within 30 days.It will forward the information you provide to the organization that made the hard inquiry on your credit history.


The organization that pulled your credit history must then investigate the disputed information. It will then report back to the credit reporting agency. If the organization decides that you were right and that it did not have authorization to make a hard inquiry, then it must notify all three national credit reporting agencies of that fact.The credit reporting agency must also send you the results of its investigation in writing. This written notice should contain the contact information of the entity that pulled your credit history.

, If the resolution is not in your favor, then you can ask that a statement of dispute be included in your credit file. In the statement, you explain why the inquiry was not legitimate. This statement will then be included in all future credit reports.The statement should be no more than 100 words (maximum 200 words if you live in Maine).The credit reporting agency should provide guidelines.
You should avoid “making excuses.”Do not write that you were busy and gave someone permission to do a hard pull on your credit report because you weren’t thinking clearly.
You should also give serious thought to not including a statement at all. As financial experts point out, if you dispute anything on your credit report then someone reading the report will assume everything else on the report is accurate (since you haven’t disputed it).You might want to save any explanation for when you speak to a creditor face-to-face.

With this information, a company called FICO calculates a score, which ranges from 300 to 850 (with a higher score being best). The factors FICO uses to calculate the score include:payment history (about 35% of your score)
how much of your available credit you have used (about 30%)
length of credit history (15%)
any new credit opened (10%)
types of credit used (10%);
, If you fail to make a payment, open several new credit accounts at once, or are denied new credit, then your FICO score can fall. However, sometimes creditors report inaccurate information. You can dispute these inaccurate items and try to get them removed in the hopes of boosting your credit score. These are common inaccuracies reported to credit reporting agencies:reporting incorrect payment status (such as “past due”)
reporting a loan modification as a “foreclosure”
stating that an account you closed was instead closed by a creditor
refusing to remove negative information after seven years

, The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act gives consumers the right to challenge inaccurate or incomplete information. If the credit reporting agency cannot verify the disputed information, then it must delete or correct it within 30 days.Credit reporting agencies (CRAs) also cannot report negative information that is too old. For example, negative information more than seven years old should not appear on your report. Bankruptcies more than 10 years old cannot be reported, either.The law also allows you to seek damages from any violator. If the CRA does not timely remove unverified information or does not perform a proper investigation, then you might be able to sue in court.

, You are entitled to one free credit report every year. You may request it over the phone, online, or through the mail.To request by phone, call 1-877-322-8228.
To order online, visit annualcreditreport.com and request a report.
To request a copy of your report by mail, send a written request to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. You can use the Federal Trade Commission’s form available at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf.

, Once you receive your report, you should study it closely to find any negative information that is erroneous. You cannot get negative information removed if it is accurate. However, you should challenge any negative information you believe has been reported mistakenly.

, To strengthen your position, you should try to gather evidentiary support that an error was made. For example, if you see that a credit card payment is listed as more than 60 days past due, then you should try to find cancelled checks that show payment had been made and accepted before that date.


If a creditor erroneously reported a loan modification as a “foreclosure,” then get copies of the modification agreement.

, You should always send a letter to both the credit reporting agencies as well as any creditor who forwarded negative information in error. Generally, the creditor’s address should appear on the credit report.


If not, then contact the CRA on which the negative information appears and ask for a phone number or mailing address.

, Begin your letter by opening a blank word processing document. You should insert your address first, aligning it with the left-hand margin. After typing the address, move down two lines and enter the date.Two lines beneath the date, you should enter the credit reporting agency’s address.

, You can use a contact person’s name if you have one. Otherwise, you can open the letter with “Dear Sir or Madam:”., You should use the first paragraph to explain why you are writing. For example, you can type, “I am writing to dispute the following information in my file. I have highlighted the items I wish to dispute on the attached copy of my credit report.”, You should use the second paragraph to identify the items you want investigated. Also request that the item be removed from your report.


You can write, “The item listing a foreclosure is inaccurate, as I received a loan modification instead. I am requesting that you remove the item from my report.”, In the third paragraph, tell the CRA what documents you have enclosed that support your position. Be sure to send photocopies because the CRA probably won’t return them.


Here is some sample language: “Enclosed are the loan modification documents. Please reinvestigate this matter and delete the disputed item as soon as possible.”, Type “Sincerely,” and then leave enough space for your signature. Below this space type your name.You should sign the letter in black or blue ink.


Remember to type “Enclosure:” at the very bottom of the letter. Then list any enclosures, such as a copy of your credit report., You should mail the letter first class, return receipt requested to each of the three CRAs.Hold onto your receipts. They will serve as proof that the credit reporting agency received the letter.


Be sure to keep copies of all of the letters that you send. Maintaining proper documentation of your communications is critical.

, Each CRA has a website on which you can report errors. Before beginning, identify the credit report number on the credit report that you wish to dispute.


You can reach Equifax’s online dispute system by visiting its website at www.equifax.com and clicking on the “Credit Report Assistance” tab at the top. Then select “Dispute info on credit report.”To reach Experian’s online dispute system, visit the website at www.experian.com and click “Disputes” under the “Consumer Assistance” heading.You can reach TransUnion’s online dispute system by visiting its website at www.transunion.com and clicking on the “Credit Reports, Disputes, Alerts & Freezes” tab at the top of the page., CRAs may request additional documentation or information from you in order to facilitate investigation. You should provide this information as soon as possible.

, Even if you use the online reporting system, you should still send a letter to each CRA. By sending a letter, you maintain a hard copy record of your communication.


Also save the receipt that shows that the letter was delivered to the CRA.

, A CRA is required to investigate any dispute typically within 30 days of its filing.As part of the investigation, the credit reporting agency forwards the information you provide to the organization that reported the information.The contacted creditor will then investigate the disputed information. If the creditor cannot verify the disputed information, then it must notify all three national CRAs.Once the CRA completes its investigation, it must send you the results in writing. It must also send you a written notice that contains the name, address, and phone number of the creditor who reported the disputed information.

, Lenders will look at your credit history (including your score) to determine whether to extend a loan. Other parties also may want to look at your credit history. For example, many landlords now pull credit reports in order to gauge whether they want to rent to an applicant.


You may also need to give permission to prospective employers to look at your credit history. In 2012, 47% of employers conducted credit checks., You have the option of submitting a statement of dispute if the CRA does not find that the information was reported erroneously. The statement can be up to 100 words. Both Experian and TransUnion allow you to add multiple statements, but Equifax allows you to add only one.The purpose of this brief statement is to explain your side of the story. You can explain why you believe the disputed item has been included erroneously on your report.
You can also use the statement if you have a legitimate reason for having messed up your credit. For example, if medical issues caused you to be late in your payments, then you might want to explain that fact in your statement.You should also think about not adding a statement. Instead, you could explain the reasons for your poor credit to any lender or employer/landlord you eventually meet with in person., If you need to explain a poor credit score to a prospective employer or landlord, begin by acknowledging that your credit is poor. You want to convey that you take financial fitness seriously, so don’t minimize it or claim it is no big deal.Be brief but honest. If you got into financial difficulty because of an illness, say so. Whatever the reason, explain it succinctly. If you delve into too much detail, you threaten to make your credit history a bigger issue than it may be.You should practice telling your explanation to someone else. Try to simplify your explanation so that it takes only a single sentence.

, Instead of trying to minimize bad credit, explain what steps you are taking to improve your score.You might offer to show proof that you have been making payments diligently for the past year.


If you are submitting an application to a housing rental company, then you can submit four months’ worth of bank statements and paystubs along with the application. You could also submit a recent tax return. This information will bolster your argument that you have taken steps to improve your credit."

Call the creditor to negotiate.,
Insist that the creditor have the charge-off removed from your profile.,
Get the agreement in writing.,
Make payments on time.,
Enforce the agreement.",How to Dispute a Charge Off2," Sometimes, debtors can persuade a creditor to agree to remove a charge-off in exchange for payment on the debt. Tell the creditor that you will pay the entire debt (or commit to a payment plan) if the creditor will promise to remove the charge-off. You may even be able to persuade the creditor to settle the debt for less than the amount you owe, perhaps as low as 50% of the total.Before you call, examine your finances. Can you afford to pay off the entire debt? If not, how much can you afford to set aside every month to pay off the debt? You should have two numbers in mind when you call: your starting offer, and the maximum amount you can afford to pay to settle the debt.
If the first person you speak with will not negotiate, ask to speak to someone with more authority., Let the creditor know that you are only willing to pay if the creditor will remove the negative report from your credit profile. You want your credit report to indicate that the debt has been ""paid in full."" Otherwise, the creditor will report that you settled the debt, and your credit report will read ""settled.""A settled charge-off is better than an unpaid charge-off, but will still negatively affect your credit score.If the creditor will not agree to report that the debt has been ""paid in full,"" ask the creditor to list the account as ""paid as agreed"" or ""account closed"" instead., Ask the creditor to send you a copy of your new agreement. The agreement should be on company letterhead and signed by the creditor.Do not send a payment until you have received the signed agreement and have had a chance to review it for accuracy.


When you review the agreement, make sure that all of the terms are accurate. The agreement should specify how many payments you will make, how much each payment will be, when each payment is due, and that the creditor will update your account and remove the charge-off from your credit profile.

, Once you have a signed copy of the agreement, you can begin making payments according to the agreement's terms. Pay by check or money order and use certified mail with a return receipt so that you have a paper record your timely payments., Once you have made all of your payments according to the agreement, contact the creditor to verify that they will remove the charge-off from your credit profile. If the creditor refuses or neglects to remove the charge-off after you fulfilled the terms of your agreement, submit a dispute with the credit reporting agencies.

Keep the celebrating for the things that really matter and for major achievements.",How to Avoid Undermining Business Success By Celebrating Too Often," While the notification of success or achievement will always serve in part to motivate the people around, in a real sense it has the potential spoil the achiever. The achiever may feel that there is inadequate recognition over time or they may not enjoy sharing the glory with others that they feel haven't contributed as much as them. Or the achiever may feel that the constancy of celebration somehow diminishes the value of the process that was used to reach the success. Not all celebrations will encourage those who helped to reach them.;
, In nature, many plants live as annuals. Their life cycle ends within one year starting from germination, growth, flowering and seeding. Again, the same process starts. We shall take Ocimum (Ocimum sanctum) or the basil plant as an example for our discussion. f the flowers of Ocimum plant were removed continuously as and when they appear, the plant would continue to grow and sustain for the next season. An annual plant can be made to live for many years if the flowering can be stopped. Once the flowering is allowed, the plant would die with the season.

, The death of the plant after flowering is likely to be the end result if every achievement is celebrated; the achiever too will wilt, their enthusiasm and creativity ebbing, their season of flowering wilted and exhausted by the constant celebrating which keeps raising the bar of expectations, even unwittingly. Moreover, the celebration energy fills the space of the creative energy; yet, it is not the celebration but the performance and process that has produced the achievement.

, To get more achievements, performance needs to be enhanced and not the celebration of the achievement. Certainly, celebration gives happiness and happiness may produce some mental strength.Bu t whether the mental strength will assure enhanced performance and enhanced achievement is doubtful if the process of the achievement is not well understood. This view is not against celebration of success by any means. However, it is about tipping the balance back more evenly to ensure that understanding and enhancing of performance is also taken into account by the business leaders. In sports, if the sportsmen celebrate their victory in one game, they might become a looser in another game. Such kind of tangible result is what a business should look for from its employees.

, As with a person, a business must keep moving forward and not rest on its laurels. In business, some people love to sing a song of the business's past glory. What the business has achieved several years ago or even a century ago will be taken as its capability potential. However, what has been gone before should not be stretched beyond a point to predict what more of what can be expected. When half a meter of rubber thread is stretched, it might stretch to two meters. By seeing the above, one should not judge that if the rubber thread is stretched further, it would expand beyond two meters. In all reality, it may break. Success should not be defined beyond the time of occurrence too far into the future.

, Too much celebration annuls future achievements. This would shift a person from doing and creating to showing and proving. It codes deeply in the subconscious mind of the achiever to wrap up to the past quickly and to not have courage for future. Moreover, every celebration should be around the reasons for the success and not on the mere success. The moment the result is produced, it is dead and what remains alive is the process led to the result. Only when you apply the same process again and again with some modifications that are required with time, are similar and differentiated results possible.

, If you decide to request your free credit reports online, make sure you only use annualcreditreport.com. This is the only site that is officially verified and approved by the FTC.Other, unauthorized credit reporting sites may not be truly free — they may, for instance, require you to sign up for a free trial service that will automatically start charging you if you don't specifically cancel it. Some malicious sites may even be blatant attempts to gather your personal information.


This means that it's a bad idea to use search engines queries like ""free credit reports."" Many of the results you'll get from these searches will be websites deliberately designed to imitate the ""real"" free credit report website.


, All of the methods for requesting your credit report above will require you to provide basic information about yourself. This includes, but may not be limited to, your:


Legal name
Birth date
Current address
You'll also need the address of your previous residence if you have moved within the last two years., The major piece of private information that is requested when you request a credit report is your Social Security number (SSN). This number is unique for every U.S. citizen and is used for a wide variety of important financial tasks.


If you don't know your SSN and can't locate your card, you should contact your local SS office to ask for a replacement. You may also call 1-800-772-121 or visit ssa.gov. You will probably be required to prove your citizenship with a birth certificate or passport.

Get contact information for the appropriate credit bureau.,
Gather evidence.,
Draft your dispute letter.,
Finalize your letter.,
Mail your letter to the credit bureau.,
Wait for a response.,
Follow up to make sure the information is corrected.",How to Dispute a Negative Credit Report1," Typically the address or phone number you must use to dispute an item will be on your credit report or on the credit bureau's website.The credit bureau also may provide a way for you to dispute an item online. There are some benefits to this, including the convenience and the ability to check your account for status updates rather than waiting for a letter in the mail.You also can find contact information on each credit bureau's website. The websites of the three major credit bureaus are www.experian.com, www.transunion.com, and www.equifax.com.
These websites include other information about filing a dispute including the information required to correctly identify yourself and the item you want to dispute.;
, You will need documents or information to prove to the credit bureau that the listing is inaccurate.You may want to include a copy of the credit report where you found the inaccurate item. Make a copy to include with your dispute letter, and mark the inaccurate item by highlighting or circling it.
To prove the inaccuracy of the information, compile any relevant statements, receipts, or cancelled checks and make copies.
For example, if a creditor is reporting on your credit report that you have an account past due, but you paid the account in full and closed it, you could use a copy of your last statement from the creditor showing a zero balance as well as any letters you received confirming the account was paid in full and closed.
In addition to accounts listed on your credit report, you also typically can dispute other information such as an incorrect name or address. Evidence to support this sort of dispute would include a copy of government-issued identification or your birth certificate.

, You must notify the credit bureau in writing that you dispute an item on your report.Generally, you want to type your letter using standard business-letter format. Most word processing applications have a template for this format.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a sample letter that you can adapt to your own situation. Go to http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0384-sample-letter-disputing-errors-your-credit-report and copy the sample letter into your word processing application.
Make sure you change the bracketed words to reflect the correct information.

, Proofread your letter for typos or other errors before you print and sign it.After you've signed your letter, make a copy of it for your records before you mail it off.
Along with your letter, include copies of any of the documents you gathered to support your claim that the information is incorrect. Make sure you're sending copies and not originals – particularly for identification documents that may be difficult to replace.

, Notifying one credit bureau typically is sufficient. If an error is found, it must notify the other major bureaus of the problem.You might want to mail your letter using certified mail with returned receipt requested, so you'll receive a notification when your letter is received by the credit bureau's complaints department.

, The credit bureau must investigate and report on your dispute, typically within 30 days.When it receives your dispute, it must forward all information to the individual or business that originally reported the information. The information provider will review the information and report back to the credit bureau regarding its accuracy.
The credit bureau must send you the results of this investigation in writing. If the investigation resulted in a change to your credit report, it must include a free copy of your credit report for you to confirm the changes made.
Keep in mind that if an item is incorrect in one report, it also may show up on your other two reports. While you're waiting for a response, you may want to check these reports and verify their accuracy.
You are entitled to a free credit report once a year. If you haven't already taken advantage of this, you can get one of the other reports for free by visiting https://www.annualcreditreport.com. This site was created by the three major credit bureaus and is the only place approved by the federal government for requesting the free report you're guaranteed each year by law.
If you've already received your free report, you will have to pay for additional reports. The credit bureaus are prohibited by law from charging you more than $12 for a copy of your credit report., Even if the credit bureau agreed to remove the item from your report, you must continue to monitor your report to make sure it doesn't return.Unfortunately, if the disputed information shows up on your report again, you'll have to go through the same dispute process to have it removed. However, once an item is changed or removed, the credit bureau can't put it back in your report unless the information provider verifies its accuracy.
If the investigation doesn't resolve your dispute, you can ask the credit bureau to include a copy of your dispute with your report, so anyone who checks your report will know which items you've disputed.
The credit bureau also may provide information regarding the dispute to anyone who's checked your credit report in the past six months. Keep in mind you may be charged a fee for this service.

Was it a credit card? A utility bill? A medical bill? Furthermore, you need the following information to help you decide how to respond:


Is the collection notation accurate? Or is the account inaccurately listed as in collections? If you were never behind on payments, then your account should not be listed as in collections. In this situation, you have a strong case to get the collection notation removed.
Does the collection agency own the debt? If the account is really in collections, then you should try to figure out if the creditor has hired a collection agency to help it collect from you. Ask whoever calls you, or write the collection agency to ask. If the original creditor still owns the debt, then you might have few options.

You cannot have accurate information removed from a credit report.Consequently, if your account really is in collections, then you might want to work out a payment plan with the creditor. Or, if the collection account is more than four years old, you might not want to do anything. The older an account, the less it impacts your credits core.


Has the debt been sold to a collection agency? Often, the collection agency pays pennies on the dollar for the right to the debt. Therefore, your $10,000 credit card debt might have been bought for a few hundred dollars. If your original creditor has sold the debt, then you might want to try and get the collection removed from your report. Because the debt is worth so little to the collection agency, they might not contest your attempt to remove it.How old is the collection account? Collection accounts should automatically fall off your credit report after seven and a half years.;
, Bad debts eventually become unenforceable once enough time has passed.However, it’s possible to “re-age” the account if you agree to start making payments.Once a bad debt has been re-aged, the collection agency can sue you to collect payment and the collection will stay on your credit report.


To illustrate: say you defaulted on a credit card in 2004. The account should no longer be on your credit report and the statute of limitations on the debt should have expired. However, if you agree to make a partial payment on the debt in 2015, then the collection account becomes “live” again. The clock starts over.
Accordingly, you should be careful about what you say to collection agents who call you. You cannot make payment or even agree to make payment.Either can re-age an old debt.
If you don’t know what to say on the phone, hang up on the collector.

, If you have questions about how to respond to debt collection, you should contact an experienced attorney who represents consumers. You can find a lawyer by visiting the National Association of Consumer Advocates. You can use the “Find an Attorney” feature at their website.Take any correspondence with the creditor/collection agency and a copy of your credit report to the attorney.
If you cannot afford a lawyer, then see if there are any legal aid organizations in your area. Legal aid organizations provide free or low-cost legal services to those with low incomes. To find a legal aid organization near you, visit the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lsc.gov. You can search by zip code.

, Before disputing a collection account, you should see how many collection accounts have been reported on your credit report. You are entitled to one free credit report from each of the three main credit reporting agencies (CRAs) every year.You can request your free reports in one of three ways:Telephone: call 1-877-322-8228 and request your free reports. They will be mailed to you.
Internet: visit annualcreditreport.com and request the reports.
Mail: send a written request to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. You can use the Federal Trade Commission’s request form available for download at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf.

, When you receive your reports, go through each of them and look for collection accounts. You should highlight all of them. Common errors with collection accounts include:The account is not really in collection.
The collection account is listed as “installment,” “revolving,” or “120 days late.” These are terms used for non-collection accounts and should not appear with any collection account.
The account balance is wrong.
The day of the first delinquency is wrong. This date matters because the collection account should fall off your credit report after seven and half years from the date of the first delinquency.
Both the original account and the collection account appear as “in collections” on your credit report. Your credit score will suffer more if both accounts are listed as in collections. Instead, the original account should be listed as “charged off” or “transferred to a collection agency.”, If the collection account is five or six years old, you might just want to wait for it to fall off in a year or two. The older the account, the less it counts toward your credit score. However, should you try to correct the account balance on a collection account, then the collection notation can be “re-aged” and to the account will be factored in your credit score again., Try to find evidence that your credit report is inaccurate. If you have never been late on payments, then get copies of cancelled checks to show when payment was made. Similarly, if you are disputing the date on which you became delinquent, then you should find letters from the creditor reporting that you have missed payment.

, Consumer advocates recommend that you dispute errors on your credit report using letters instead of an online reporting system.CRAs may push you to report online, but you should always write a letter as well. In your letter, explain the facts and why you believe the collection account is inaccurate. Also include a specific request to delete the account.


You can type up your own letter or use a sample letter provided by the Federal Trade Commission at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0485-sample-letter-disputing-errors-your-credit-report-information-providers. You should adjust the letter to reflect your situation.
Be as detailed as necessary to adequately explain why the collection notation is inaccurate. If you need to use extra sheets of paper, then do so.
Once you complete the letter, make sure to keep several copies for your records.

, Use certified mail, return receipt requested. The receipt will serve as proof that the CRA received your letter. Mail a copy of the letter to whichever CRA’s credit report shows the erroneous collection account:

, This is the most challenging task as it requires that you look back 10 years and recall information about each of the projects you've worked on. You will need to remember the project name, description, hours worked on each projects, hours spend on business analysis tasks on each projects... etc

, A great technique for doing so is to first (1) understand the deliverables produced in each task and (2) matching them against those you've produced. This will allow you to determine if your past experience is inline with what the BABOK® defines as business analysis experience.

, This is the number of courses that you spent working on all project activities regardless of whether they were business analysis tasks or not.

Visit http://www.annualcreditreport.com and enter your information. You can get a copy of your report immediately.
Fill out the Annual Credit Report Request Form available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf. Mail the completed form to the address printed on the form.;
, You want your credit report to be accurate. To that end, you should go through and identify any errors. Highlight any credit accounts that don’t belong to you.


Also highlight any other errors you see. You can report all mistakes at the same time.

, You might have closed an account in the past. This situation is different than if the credit account was never yours to begin with. You can have closed accounts removed after a certain amount of time has passed:An account that was closed but in good standing can stay on your credit report for up to 10 years. If the credit information is positive, you might want to leave it on your report.
A delinquent account that was charged off will remain on your report for seven years plus 180 days from the point you became delinquent.
An account in collections will remain on your account for seven years plus 180 days from the date it became delinquent. Also, an account in collections may show up twice on your credit report. It may show up once for delinquency and once for collection.

, Visit their website at https://ww2.equifax.com/personal/. Click on “Credit Report Assistance” and then “Dispute Info on Your Credit Report.” You can submit your information online.

, Even if you report online, you should also write a letter, which will serve as evidence of your communication. In your letter, you should identify the closed credit account and ask that it be removed. Also explain why it should be removed, e.g., you never opened the account or it is so old it should have fallen off the report by now.


You can use the Federal Trade Commission’s sample letter, which is available at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0384-sample-letter-disputing-errors-your-credit-report.

, Make a copy of the letter for your records. Make copies of any attachments, such as the copy of your Equifax credit report. Mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested.Equifax’s mailing address is Equifax Information Services, LLC, P.O. Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30348., After Equifax receives your complaint, it will contact the entity that reported your credit account and ask them to investigate. Equifax must get back to you within 30-45 days. Equifax should explain in writing the results of the investigation.Equifax should also send you the identity and contact information for the entity that reported the account.

, If Equifax won’t remove the closed account, then you can write a statement of dispute for free.This statement will be included whenever someone requests your Equifax credit report.


Generally, you should only include a statement of dispute if you have legitimate reasons for disagreeing with Equifax’s decision not to remove the account.
For example, you could write, “I never opened this account though Equifax refuses to remove it from my credit history. I am investigating whether I was the victim of identity theft.”

, You can ask the entity that reported the credit account to remove it. You should write them a letter and mail it certified mail, return receipt requested. Equifax should have given you the contact information for the entity. Remember to include a copy of your Equifax report with the credit account highlighted or circled.


The FTC also has a helpful sample letter you can use: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0485-sample-letter-disputing-errors-your-credit-report-information-providers.
Tailor the FTC letter to your situation. If you never opened the account, then ask that it be removed. However, if the account was closed because you were delinquent, then you can explain why you were unable to pay your bills and ask for a good faith deletion.If you are asking for a good faith deletion, then keep your tone courteous.Remember, the creditor doesn’t have to remove the closed account information.

, A creditor or collections agency might want to negotiate with you after you contact them. For example, they might agree to take the negative information off your account if you agree to make payment. This is called “pay for delete.”Be careful. By agreeing to pay, you might re-start the debt.


For example, a collections account should fall off your credit report after seven years. If the account is six years old, it should fall off in a year. By agreeing to start making payments, however, the account becomes new—it is now zero years old. If you can’t make all of your payments, the creditor will back out of deleting the account, and it won’t fall off for seven more years., Your delinquent account might only be one or two years old. In this situation, you might want to negotiate because the account won’t fall off for five or more years. However, before talking with the creditor, you should meet with a lawyer to get advice.You can reach a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral.If you are low income, then look into legal aid, which provides legal help for free or for a reduced price. You can find legal aid by visiting http://www.lsc.gov.

, If the creditor agrees to remove the closed account, then continue to monitor your Equifax account. Although you only get one free credit report a year, you could still sign up for credit monitoring with Equifax for $19.95 a month."

Brainstorm ideas.,
Decide on an idea.,
Research your invention.,

Consider hiring a patent attorney.,

File for a patent.,
Create a prototype.,
Create a presentation.,

Advertise your invention.",How to Invent a Product," The first step in coming up with a truly unique and useful product is to brainstorm ideas. Consider your area of expertise - what are you most interested in and know the most about? In order to invent something from start to finish, you will need to stay within your realm of knowledge. Otherwise, you may have a great idea but no understanding of how to implement it.


Try making a list of all the things that interest you. These could be hobbies, jobs, or products that you use on a regular basis.
For each activity or item of interest to you, make a list of possible improvements that could be made in the form of an invention. This could include variations of the product or activity or useful add-ons.
Make a hefty list. It is better to have too many ideas than too few, so continue listing until you can think of absolutely nothing else to add.
Keep a journal with you at all times, to constantly add new items to your possible-invention list. Keeping your ideas all organized in one place, a journal, will also help you to remain mentally clutter-free and allow you to review your ideas at a later date.
Don’t rush the brainstorming process. Inspiration may not hit you like lightning, and could require a few weeks or months of listing ideas before your epiphany strikes.;
, Once you’ve spent some time considering all possible options, choose your best idea for an invention. Now you’ll have to spend time considering the details of the project. Draw a few sketches of what you imagine your invention will look like, and then consider some important questions.


What could you add to improve this product? What about your invention is so special that people will feel compelled to bring it into their lives? Why is your invention so great?
Think about changes that might need to be made. What parts of your invention are superfluous or unnecessary? Is there any way to make it more efficient or cheaper to produce?
Consider all aspects of your invention including all the required parts, and important details about how it works or what it will do. Keep these answers and ideas in your journal so you can refer back to them., When you feel confident in your invention and have made any useful alterations, research it to make sure your idea is truly unique. If another product like yours has already been patented, then you won’t be able to mass-produce your invention or receive your own patent.


Search online for products that match the description of your invention. If you have a name for your product created already, search this too to make sure that it is not already being used.
Visit stores that offer products similar to what yours will do. Search their shelves for similar products, and even go as far to ask store workers for items they might sell with a similar purpose.
Visit a Patent and Trademark Depository Library near you. Here, you can search all patents and categories for other inventions like yours. You are also free and able to use the help of the librarians to aid in your search.
Get a professional patent search done to verify that there are truly no other inventions on the market similar to yours.
In the US, patents are granted on a “first to file” basis, rather than a “first to invent” basis. This means that as soon as you are able, file a patent on your invention so that nobody else can copy you. Proof (typically in the form of a journal) that you invented your product first won’t help you get a patent before someone else who filed first., Although you don’t have to be the first person to invent your product to get a patent, you will still need to keep a record of your invention including the complete range of specs and uses.


Record the process of inventing your product. Write down how you came up with the idea, what inspired you, how long it took, and why you want to make it.
List all the things you will need to create it, all the possible parts and materials for your invention.
Keep a record of your research showing that you did not encounter any other products on the market that are similar in design to yours and already have a patent. You have to prove that your invention is unique in order to qualify for a patent.
Consider the commercial sales value of your invention. There are fees involved in getting a patent even if you don’t use a patent lawyer. Before committing to these fees, make sure you’ve recorded the commercial value and potential income based on sales of your invention. This way, you will know that the earning potential of your product outweighs the amount you will pay in fees.
Create an informal drawing of your invention. You don’t need to have anything fancy created, but having an accurate drawing of your invention may be required to file for your patent. If you are not an artist yourself, consider having an artistic friend or family member create the drawing for you.

, Although patent attorneys can be very expensive, their help can be invaluable. The main job of a patent attorney is to help get you a patent and to deal with patent infringement.


Patent attorneys can give advice based on the most recent changes in patent law to make sure you are always up-to-date.
Should someone infringe on your patent (once you get it), your patent attorney can help you take legal steps to deal with the issue or sue them if necessary.
If your invention is classified under the “technology” category, a patent attorney can be especially helpful in making sure similar technological advances are not already underway by other companies or businesses. Technology is one of the fastest growing areas of development, and one of the most difficult areas to be patented in.

, A provisional patent application, also called a PPA, shows your invention as being in the process of getting a patent. This means that you will be safe from others copying your idea while your patent application is still being processed.


This step is optional, but can be very helpful in saving you from heartache and frustration should someone get a patent on the same invention as you slightly before you do.
You will have to pay a fee ranging from $65-$260 based on the business you work for and the item you wish to patent.

, Once you have organized all your information on your invention, you can file for a regular patent application, or RPA. These are filed through the USPTO on their website or an office, if you are located near one. Simply follow the step-by-step directions provided on the form and provide all necessary information before sending it in., With your patent in the works, it is a good time to create a working model of your invention. Don’t worry about making it with expensive materials or going through an extensive process, just make a version of your invention yourself.


You aren’t required to make your prototype out of the same materials as your invention would be mass-produced in, unless it is absolutely imperative to the creation of your product.
If you can’t manage to make the prototype on your own, you can pay a company to make one for you. This can get pretty expensive though, so make sure that you always try doing it yourself first.

, With your patent and prototype in hand, you are on the road to success! The next step is making a presentation that completely covers the bases of your invention. You can use this to show to both potential manufacturers and buyers, although you may create slightly different versions of your presentation for each purpose.


Make sure that your presentation is very professional, no matter what way you create it. You can make a powerpoint, video, or physical presentation-board to show.
Use lots of useful information, diagrams, and images. Be sure to cover the specs of your product, uses, and long-term results or benefits.
Although it is optional, you could opt to hire a graphic designer to put together a spectacular presentation for your invention. Making it as visually appealing as possible will encourage the interest of manufacturers and buyers alike.
Be sure to have your speaking worked out for the presentation as well. It’s not enough to have great diagrams and images, you need to be good at public speaking. Don’t memorize notecards, but have an idea (with the aid of notes if necessary) of everything you want to say and answers to common questions that may be asked.

, Find local manufacturers that create products similar to yours and appeal to them to produce your invention for you. You may have to send them an introductory letter to begin with, explaining who you are and what you want from them.


After you hear back from your letter (snail mail or email), get your presentation ready. You will probably have to go present your invention to them and explain what you want from their company.
Make sure to leave them with a copy of your presentation and information so that they can review it even after you have left.
Emphasize why and how your invention will not only help people, but make the manufacturer lots of money. They are business people like you, and want to know what they get on their end of the deal if they partner with you.

, Once you get a manufacturer on board with your invention, start mass-producing it! Although it will probably be best to start in small batches (your manufacturing company will talk to you about this), you can start creating your invention in the hundreds or thousands.

, You’ve gotten everything down; your patent, your prototype, a manufacturer, and finally your invention has been mass-produced. Find ways to advertise it to get the maximum selling potential.


Meet with local business owners and store managers to discuss selling your product with them. You can show your presentation to explain why doing so is a great option for their business in addition to helping a local entrepreneur.
Create advertisements for your invention. Invest the help of a local graphic designer to create pictures and videos that have people begging to buy your product!
Find ways to show your advertisement in your area. Many newspapers, TV stations, and local radio stations are all able to advertise your product for a small fee.
Spread the word among your friends and family. Getting the people you’re closest with onboard with your idea will help to get word of your invention out and about into new communities and populations.
Hold local information sessions and booths and entrepreneurial conferences and business fairs. Look into the cost for having a booth to advertise your product at conventions near you."

Clarify the types of awards you will be applying for.,

Check for local awards.,
Begin your application.,
Plan your written submissions.,
Submit your application.,
Keep a copy.,
Tell a good story.,
Make sure you include everything.,
Follow Up.,
Display the award where possible.",How to Apply for Business Awards," You need to be sure that you are applying for awards you can actually win. Otherwise, you will just be wasting your time. This involves two different parts. First, make sure you qualify for the awards. This means that the award allows entries from your industry, your location, and from businesses of your size. Second, only apply for awards that are looking for the things you do well. That is, play to your strengths.


If you are known for excellent customer service, for example, apply for awards that judge customer service. If you are known instead for product quality, consider avoiding the customer service award.;
, Having (or not having) certain awards can be a standard of comparison between competing businesses. Visit your competitors' websites or stores to see which awards they display. If you don't have these awards, apply for them. This will eliminate one more advantage that your competition may have over you.


Look especially closely at awards your competitors have won in multiple years. Applying could be your opportunity to steal it away from them., Some of the biggest small business awards are offered by national organizations and companies. Winning of these awards will bring widespread recognition to your business, but the competition will be fierce. If you think you have what it takes, apply to one or more of the following awards:


SCORE Awards.
National Small Business Week Awards.
DREAM BIG Awards.
Stevie Awards.
Entrepreneur Magazine's Entrepreneur Awards.
Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.
Deloitte Technology Fast 500., Each industry may have special awards for outstanding businesses within that industry. Check with trade publications, special-interest magazines, industry websites, and other industry-specific magazines to see if they have any business awards you can apply for., Your local Chamber of Commerce or local magazines may have programs that give awards or recognition to businesses. Make sure to check with these organizations to see what awards you can apply for. These may not give you national recognition, but you will gain greater recognition in your community., When you've found some awards to apply to, don't wait until the last minute to apply to them, instead start your applications now. If there are many of them, create a schedule for filling them all out. Consider spending your free time at night or on weekends to fill out these forms. If you get the award, it will all be worth it., Before you write your application, sit down and plan out figures and facts that you want to include. Make sure to have a list of key point ready so that you can say everything that you want to say. During this process, make sure to check your list against the requirements of the award. Use the requirements as a guide. Add in any details or information that you may have left out.Keep in mind that it is okay to provide more information than is required, just be sure that you do not leave out anything that is required.

, Before you submit your application, have a coworker or family member proofread it for errors and to make sure you included everything that was required. Check to see that all required documents are attached and in the correct formats. And most importantly, be sure to submit your application on time. Being even a few minutes late may disqualify your submission., After applying for one business award, save a copy and use the document for applying for other awards in the future. Doing so will make the process of applying for awards more efficient and save you time, even if you have to edit large parts of the document to fit the criteria for each award.

, Award reviewers sift through hundreds or thousands of applications, so you'll have to make yours stand out. To do so, you'll have to tell a good story. That is, when you apply for your award, don't just tell the events in a matter-of-fact way. Instead, Use your experiences from the difficult road you've had as a small business owner to craft a story that explains the hardships you've faced, the impacts of your decisions, and how your business has interacted with and been built by the people involved with it.


Don’t rely on financial descriptions and instead focus on tangible effects and the emotional impacts of events and business shifts.
However, keep your story short and sweet; judges don't want to read a novel., It's very easy for your application to be immediately thrown out because you didn't follow the rules. To avoid this follow every provision in the application instructions. Include every required document and format everything exactly as instructed. This helps you prove to judges that you really want to win., After you've applied for an award, make sure to institute some way of tracking whether or not you have won it. Many awards will notify you, but sign up for the awarding organization's newsletter to make sure you don't miss anything. You can also follow up with judges or the organization after applying to thank them for their consideration. Making it clear that you really want the award just might make a difference in the judges' selection.Make sure that you do not pester the judges. Just follow up in a professional manner, similar to how you would follow up with a job interview.

, If your business is shortlisted or ranked by an award, and especially if you win one, make sure you show that off to your customers and employees. The award may provide you with a standard press release to use, but if they don't be sure to make a press release of your own explaining the award and that you won it. Additionally, you can send out a newsletter to customers that summarizes the award and the story behind your winning it. This is a good opportunity to thank customers for their support.


Post links on social media to the page on the award's website that shows your business and its victory.
In some cases, you can display the award's logo on your storefront or advertising. However, some award programs will charge a fee for the use of their logo."

, The best time to ask for a referral is while you are still actively completing a project with a client. That way, the client is still fully engaged with you, and has a clear idea of what kind of work you do., There’s no need to beat around the bush. If you’ve been doing great work for a client, it’s completely reasonable to ask for a referral. You can make the request in person, over the phone, or through email.For example, if you decide to request a referral via email, let your client know what you are asking for within the first couple of sentences.
You might start with something like, “Dear Robert, As I work toward expanding my practice over the coming year, I am reaching out to trusted clients to help me generate more business.”

, Your client will be better able to help you if they know exactly what you’re looking for. Target your request to someone the client is likely to be familiar with, or someone who has similar needs to the client’s.For example, instead of just asking, “Do you know anyone else who might need a real estate agent?” try asking, “Do you know any other young couples looking for a starter home in this price range?”

Diversify your income streams.",How to Be a Successful Business Owner," That is, you should start a business that focuses on what you have experience in. That experience can be either prior work experience or a personal hobby that you're ready to turn into a career. Even if a business idea seems highly profitable in theory, don't start that business unless your heart is in it. While profit is important, it likely won't keep you coming in early every day and driving growth.

For example, imagine you have experience making coffee as a barista or waiter and want to turn your passion for good coffee into a small business. You would already know a good amount about the industry and be able to apply not only your knowledge but your passion to your work.;
, While the financial benefits of business ownership can be great, most successful business owners don't start with money in mind. To get your business off the ground, you'll need a clear purpose. This purpose should be something more intangible than money, like giving back to your community by creating jobs, solving a problem that you see in your daily life, or pursuing a passion. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't also strive for profitability, just that your primary goal should be the achievement of a greater purpose.For our coffee shop example, your purpose would be serving the perfect cup of coffee to every customer. Alternately, it could be to form a community in your coffee shop where people can meet and spend time with friends.

, Before you get started, take some time to do market research and get to know your customers and your industry. The U.S. Small Business Administration provides a great deal of information on which services and products are in demand.You will also want to think about who will be buying your product or using your service and learn the best way to appeal to this population.

With the coffee shop, ask yourself: Am I trying to appeal to ""coffee snobs"" who don't mind waiting five minutes for their pour-over? Or is my focus on the people who are on their way to work and want to grab a cup and run? Or both? Understanding the people you plan to serve can help you serve them better.

, You should always start with a business model that can be up and running quickly on a low budget. Too many small businesses start with grandiose goals that will require a large amount of startup capital and investors. However, successful businesses will have a model that can be used on a smaller scale. This proves to potential investors that your idea is a valid way of making money, and increases your odds of ever getting investment money (if that's what you're looking for).For example, imagine that in our example, you want to start a large operation that sources, imports, roasts, and packages its own coffee beans that are then either sold or served to customers at its coffee shops. Rather than seeking huge contributions from investors to buy all of this equipment, you should start with a small coffee shop first, then maybe try sourcing and importing beans, and work up from there to build a brand.

, One of the most important parts of successful business ownership is getting over your own ego and seeking help. Your biggest sources of advice are going to be your group of business associates and other professionals that share your goals. Surround yourself with knowledgable and successful people and feed off of their ideas and enthusiasm.Also seek general small business tips online; the web is a goldmine of information. Just be sure your information is from a reliable source.

, A good mentor in this case is someone who has already run or is running a successful business of their own. A good example would be a family member or family friend that has been successful in business. This mentor can help you with anything from knowing how to manage your employees to properly filing your taxes. Because their knowledge comes from direct experience, they're able to help you more personally than any other source could.While your mentor doesn't have to have founded the same type of business you are starting, it would help. For example, another coffee shop founder would be the best source of information in our coffee shop example, but a restaurateur  could also be of significant help.

, That is, avoid being caught up in every business opportunity that comes your way. It's better to be perfect at one thing than mediocre at five. This applies as much to making decisions to diversify your business as it does to deciding to take on additional projects for yourself outside of your primary business. Focusing on one thing will allow you to commit all of your resources there and be more productive in that endeavor.Continuing with our example, imagine that you see another coffee shop making money by selling customized coffee-related merchandise. This may make you want to jump into this market as well. However, doing so before establishing your primary objective, making coffee, would introduce significant risk, and may detract from your ability to focus on coffee quality.

, While making a profit should certainly be one of your goals, it should not be your main focus when you are starting out. Cash flow is far more important — many small businesses run out of money before they have even been around long enough to generate a profit, and must close their doors. Pay careful attention to your overhead costs and sales during the first years, and let profit take a backseat., In order to be successful, you'll have to make a habit of recording each and every expense and revenue that your company has, as well as every dollar that flows through it. By knowing where exactly your money is coming in and where it's going, you're more capable of recognizing financial difficulties before they arise. In addition, doing this will give you a better idea of where exactly you can make cuts to expenses or increases to revenues.For example, in our example, you would keep detailed records of how much coffee you bought and sold in a given month and what you paid for it. This could you help you identify if, for example, the price of coffee beans was steadily increasing and help you plan whether or not to raise your own prices or consider switching suppliers.

, While this may seem obvious, just try to think of areas where you could generate the same effect by spending less money. Consider using pre-owned equipment, finding cheaper forms of advertising (for example, fliers rather than newspaper ads), or negotiating better payment terms with suppliers or customers to save a few dollars here and there.Try to maintain very low spending habits and only spent money when and where you absolutely have to.


In our example, this could mean starting out with used coffee grinders (as long as they still functioned well) and trying to get as many supplies as possible from the same supplier (cups, lids, straws, etc.).

, Your costs, and therefore your profits, depend on a successful supply chain organization. By fostering good relationships with your suppliers, organizing deliveries, and consistently providing customers with timely service, you can increase your profitability and reputation. Successful supply chain management can also help you eliminate any part of your business with wasted resources, like raw materials or labor.


For example, our example coffee shop would want to be on good terms with its coffee bean supplier and have an organized supply chain structure for a number of reasons. This is especially crucial for ensuring that you never run out of coffee, but could also mean that you could get more consistent deliveries, try new types of coffee bean when they become available, or negotiate lower prices.

, Much like a good mentor, a strategic partner can provide you the boost you need to grow your business. Foster strategic partnerships by reaching out to businesses you think could benefit yours, whether they are suppliers, technology providers, or complementary businesses. A good relationship with another company can provide you both free advertising, lower your costs of doing business, or allow you to expand to new markets, depending on the partners you choose.For example, your coffee shop could benefit from a strategic relationship with a supplier that gives you access to discounts or new products. Alternately, a strategic partner in a complementary business, such as a pastry shop, could help you both reach new customers and increase your revenues. This could be done either through recommending each other or by offering product's from your partner's business and vice-versa.

, It's very important that you realistically assess your ability to pay back any debt that you take on. While starting and running a business is always risk, try to minimize your liabilities by only taking out as much as you absolutely need. And when you do take on debt, be sure to structure your cash flows such that you are paying it off as quickly as possible. Prioritize debt repayment before you do anything else.For example, if you took out $20,000 to get your coffee shop started, don't think about expanding your product offerings or upgrading your coffee grinders until you've paid that loan back.

, Have a 30-second speech ready that explains your business as briefly and efficiently as possible, including information about your purpose, your service/products, and your goals. Having a practiced pitch that you can rattle off to anyone can help you in situations where you're trying to make a sale to a customer as well as it can when you're trying to bring an investor on board.If you can't explain your business in this short time, your business plan needs refining.


For your coffee shop, you'd want to explain what you do (sell coffee), your services (the drinks you offer), what makes you special (maybe the coffee you serve is rare or locally-roasted), and what you plan to do next (expand to another location, new products, etc.).

, Earning a positive reputation is like free advertising; your customers will spread the word of your business to friends and come back frequently.Treat each and every sale like the success or failure of your business depends on it. This also means that you should be consistent with every action your business takes and every interaction with customers.For your coffee shop, this may mean throwing out a burnt batch of coffee so that your customers are always served the absolutely best product you can offer.

, You should always look to your competitors for ideas, especially when you're starting out. Chances are, they're doing something right. If you can figure out what that is, you can implement it in your own business and avoid the trial-and-error they probably went through to get there.One of the best ways to do this when you're starting out is to examine your competitors' pricing strategies. In our coffee shop example, it would be much simpler to price your coffee similarly to competitors rather than to experiment with different prices on your own.

, Once you've gotten established, you should always be on the lookout for places you can expand. Whether that means moving to a larger storefront, increasing manufacturing space, or opening a new location will depend on your business and goals. Successful business owners realize that one of the primary opponents to long-term growth is remaining stagnant. This means taking the risk of expansion rather than resting on your laurels at one, original location.


For our coffee example, maybe there is a nearby area that you find is underserved by coffee shops. Once your primary location is up and running smoothly, you should investigate opening a new shop in that area. This could also mean moving up from a small stand to a full coffee shop, depending on your circumstances.

, Another way to increase the value of your business is by seeking out other areas where you can make money. Assuming you've already established your primary business, look around and see where you could offer a different service or product. Maybe your customers frequently visit your store for one item and then immediately go to another store for a different item. Find out what that other item is and offer it.Some easy diversification options for your coffee shop would be offering pastries, sandwiches, or books for purchase.

Always thank your clients for their referrals.,
Keep reminding your clients to refer you.,
Time your follow-up requests strategically.",How to Ask for a Referral2," If you show your appreciation for every referral, your clients will feel more motivated to keep sending business your way.There are a lot of ways to express gratitude for a referral:

Give your client a simple written or verbal “thank you,” or send a thank-you card.
Send a simple gift, like flowers or a nice pen.
Treat your client to dinner.
Some businesses may offer referral incentives, like a gift card or discount on future services. However, non-monetary rewards tend to generate a stronger sense of trust and community., Even if you haven’t done business with them in a long time, don’t be afraid to keep in touch with your clients and let them know that you still appreciate their support. Send an occasional email or note card to touch base. Ask them how they are doing, and state upfront that you are interested in any business they might be able to send your way., Don’t bombard your clients with referral requests and reminders constantly. Choose a regular schedule for getting in touch with key referral sources.For example, you might send out reminders once every three or six months.
If demand for your services tends to spike at a particular time of the year, send out referral requests a few weeks before that.

, Develop a simple referral form that clients can fill out on their phone or computer, and send them the link when you make a referral request.You may be able to get a referral form template from a website like Jotform or Formstack.
Since a lot of people rely heavily on their phones for email and other forms of communication, ideally your form should be mobile friendly.
Make the form shareable over email or social media, if you can.

, Review sites like Yelp and Angie’s List offer a great way for clients to get the word out about your business. Looking at positive reviews from other satisfied clients can also give them ideas about how to put their own experience with you into writing.Put links to your review site pages on your website, and include them in email communications with clients.
Encourage clients to review your business on these sites. Ask them to point potential referrals in the direction of your positive reviews and testimonials online.

, It will be easier for clients to refer you if they can easily provide some informative marketing materials to potential referrals. This could take the form of a brochure, a downloadable PDF, or even a simple referral card with your company’s basic information and a “Referred by _____” form.These materials should aim to provide clear, simple answers to a few very basic questions about your business. In simple terms, describe who you are, what you do, and why the potential referral should choose you.

Read about successful women.,
Research women in your field.,
Consider a field with fewer women in it.,
Determine how to balance work and family.,
Overcome pay inequality.,
Be confident.,
Be assertive.,
Handle criticism well.",How to Be a Successful Business Woman1," There are many successful career women out there - in business and in other fields. Researching and learning about their background and career paths will help to motivate and inspire you. Reading their stories will give an idea of what the path to success looks like and what obstacles you might encounter along the way.


The web is a great resource for researching successful business women. There are some interesting and insightful articles on websites such as Forbes and Harvard Business School.
You can also read the memoirs or biographies of a number of successful women and gain an insight into their professional experiences - both good and bad.


Sheryl Sandberg. An excellent example of one such memoir is ""Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead"" by Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook. She discusses issues such as the low level of women in corporate and governmental leadership roles, the pay inequalities faced by women in the workplace and the difficulty of balancing career ambitions with raising a family. She encourages young, female graduates to ""believe in themselves, raise their hands, sit at the table, take risks and support each other.""Anne-Marie Slaughter. Anne-Marie Slaughter is a Princeton professor who rose to prominence in 2012 when she wrote an article in The Atlantic titled “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All,” a frank assessment of her difficulty balancing her work as director of policy planning at the State Department for Hillary Clinton with her responsibilities as the mother of two sons. In the article, she argued for “changing social policies and bending career tracks to accommodate our choices” rather than expecting women to simply run themselves ragged in order to play by the current rules of the workplace.Hillary Clinton. Former Secretary of State and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has long been an advocate of women's rights. Clinton has emphasized the need to extend family and medical leave and to encourage women and girls to pursue careers in math and science. She says: ""We need to empower women here at home to participate fully in our economy and our society. We need to make equal pay a reality."" Many will argue that Hillary Clinton is actually not a very good example. This is because not only is she not a business woman, but she is also under the threat of investigation.

;
, No matter what field you're in, there are sure to be successful women who've paved the way for others. Finding out about successful women in your particular field will give you a better idea of what a typical career path might look like and highlight some practical steps you can take to become successful.


Research what schools the women in your field went to, what internships they did, whether they worked abroad, where they got their first job, and any other information regarding their career path.
Figure out what these women did right, then use that knowledge to work out a career plan of your own.

, Historically, women have been underrepresented in fields such as science, engineering, technology, mathematics and computer science. By pursuing a career in one of these areas, a woman may benefit from certain incentives designed to encourage more women to enter these fields, such as scholarship programs and grants.

, Perhaps the greatest concern for women in the workforce is how to balance work and family life. Women are usually in their key childbearing years while simultaneously trying to advance their career and climb the corporate ladder.


Surveys have shown that most women leave their jobs due to caretaking conflicts or workplace climates which are hostile to the demands of parenthood.The best way to ensure a balance between work and family is to find a company which offers a combination of parent-friendly policies such as paid maternity leave, company-sponsored childcare, flexible scheduling, family healthcare benefits and paternity leave.

, Despite making fantastic progress in terms of the number of women in the workforce and the proportion of those who go on to reach managerial and executive positions, there is still a long way to go, especially when it comes to equal pay. The frustrating truth is that women earn significantly less than men, for the same work. Although factors such as education or the decision to have a child can affect pay levels, the main problem is that women consistently undervalue themselves and fail to effectively negotiate with employers for higher salaries.In order to overcome pay inequality, you should:


Do your homework. Find out what other people (men and women), with the same qualifications and in similar positions, are earning.
Learn how to negotiate. Once you know your value, you should work on selling your qualifications, skills and achievements. Never undersell yourself. Don't offer a salary figure first, and provide a salary range if you are pressed about it.
Never say yes to an offer immediately. Think of the first number they provide as an ""initial offer"" and continue to negotiate if you feel you are being undervalued.
Realize that you are entitled to ask for a raise. If you are already in a job where you feel that your contributions are undervalued, or you find out that a colleague is being paid more for the same work, don't be afraid to ask for a raise. Just be sure to build a convincing case: do your homework and find out the salary range for similar roles both within and outside the company. Be prepared to talk about your positive contributions to the company including any recent successes or problems you have solved. Highlight any positive feedback you have received from others on your team. , Having confidence in yourself and your abilities is essential in becoming a successful businesswoman. People will view you as you portray yourself. If you project confidence, people will believe that you are confident.


Self-doubt is natural, but don't let it overwhelm you. Remember that you are where you are because you're good at what you do.
Project confidence through your body language. You can do this by standing tall and keeping your head held high. Greet people with a firm handshake and a smile. Most importantly of all, make eye contact with the person you're speaking to. Try not to glance at them before quickly looking away, remember to hold their gaze, as this is a sure sign of confidence. If you have to address a room of people, try to make eye contact with every person in the room for at least a second or two.
If you're having a bad day where your confidence feels shaken, try to reassure yourself using positive affirmations. It may feel silly, but looking at yourself in the mirror and repeating something like ""I am great at what I do"" or ""I am determined to reach the top"" can really help you to rediscover your confidence and determination.

, One of the most enduring stereotypes about women in business is that they are weak and emotional. The best way to overcome these stereotypes is to disprove them. In order to gain respect as a formidable businesswoman, it is important to be assertive.


You can convey assertiveness through both your speech and your actions - have confidence in your decisions and don't second-guess yourself. Speak authoritatively, in a clear, confident manner and people will have no reason to doubt your decisions.
When faced with criticism, try to be as rational and collected as possible. Consider what has been said and decide whether you can use the criticism constructively or whether you should just disregard it. Whatever you do, don't let it be a trigger which causes you to doubt yourself and your abilities. , The capacity to handle criticism and grow from it is a very important aspect of success. However, there is a big difference between constructive criticism and destructive criticism. You need to learn how to recognize and handle each of them.


Destructive criticism is a comment or accusation designed to hurt your self-esteem. It is not intended to help you or allow you to see what you did wrong and improve on it. An example of destructive criticism would be a coworker saying ""How could you be so stupid?"" or ""What were you thinking?"" The best way to deal with this type of criticism is simply to ignore it.
Constructive criticism, on the other hand, usually has a good intention behind it. It is intended to help you to improve and should be viewed as a positive. An example of constructive criticism would be: ""Thanks for your report. It was a good effort, but I think it could benefit from more statistics to support your findings."" The best way to handle this type of criticism is to thank the person for their feedback and to use their comments to improve your work in the future.

Find your passion in life and follow it.,
Be organized.,
Network.,
Be creative.,
Get a good education.,
Be willing to learn.,
Be willing to work hard.,
Stay persistent.,
Be brave.",How to Be a Successful Business Woman2," In order to reach the top, you need to be passionate about what you do. Think about it. It's so much easier to motivate yourself to work hard when you're energized and excited by what you're doing.


The road to success is long and has its fair share of ups and downs. Working towards something you're passionate about will give you strength during the tough times and added satisfaction during the good.
If you're not sure where your passions lie, think about going to see a career coach or a good psychologist. They will help you to identify your strengths and weaknesses and gain a clearer vision of your life goals.
Remember that not everyone has a pre-existing passion, it may take some time to find yours. It is also possible to become passionate about a job, with enough hard work and dedication.

, Success is the result of long-term planning and daily action. Good organization helps you gain control of your time so you can plan and complete the tasks needed to achieve your goals.


Focus on what's important. Remind yourself of your long-term goals and revise them when necessary.
Learn to prioritize. Decide what your goals are each day, then set daily priorities in order to achieve your goals.
Finish one task before you start another. Multi-tasking is overrated. Focus 100% of your attention on every task you set your mind to, whether it's responding to emails or filling out paperwork. This reduces the chances of you making a mistake or overlooking something important.

, Networking can be very helpful to your career. Networking is about making connections and building enduring, mutually beneficial relationships with other professionals. It enables you to find out about exciting career opportunities, learn of new developments in your field or discover the solution to a problem you face at work.


Networking is all about communication — making phone calls, conducting information interviews, writing letters or connecting through online networking sites.
Once you have made contact with a person, it is important to try to develop a relationship with them, to keep in contact with them and to help them with any requests or favors they might have. You never know what they might be able to help you with in the future!
One of the best ways to network successfully is to do informational interviews. This is where you organize to informally meet with a senior colleague or other professional for lunch or coffee in order to ask questions, gain valuable information and insights and create business relationships. Once the meeting is over, thank them for their time, ask for a business card and try to stay in touch.
Remember: no matter how hard you work, unless you’re aware of an opportunity, you’re not going to get a shot at it. Your network will open up opportunities for you and your career, both now and in the years to come.

, Creativity is a word that's thrown around a lot in the world of business. Employees are expected to ""think creatively"" and come up with ""creative solutions"" to the obstacles they face at work. But what does being creative really mean? Creativity is essentially whole-brain thinking - requiring the imagination and intuition of the the right side of the brain, combined with the logic, strategic thinking and critical analysis of the left. It involves coming up with innovative, yet effective ways to deal with the problems you encounter and providing a unique perspective on the world around you.


When faced with a problem at work, use a blank sheet of paper, start thinking about possible solutions, and write down anything that pops into your mind. Try to free your mind from the shackles of reality and practicality. Allow your brain to think freely and to make associations you wouldn't normally make. Creative thinking requires thinking outside the box.
Become more playful in your work. Use images and colors when writing reports. Use toys or props to stimulate creative thinking. Give a presentation from the back of the room. Break away from convention in order to think creatively.

, An education from a high-ranking university can be instrumental in getting you to where you want to be in life.

If you begin to feel demoralized, remind yourself of everything you've achieved already and how far you've come. Remember that your greatest achievement might be just around the corner!

, Being a successful business woman means you have to constantly push yourself beyond your comfort zone, take risks and be fearless in pursuit of your goals. Each individual success will increase your confidence and encourage you to strive for more. Even when things don't go as planned, remember that it's not the end of the world and you can do better next time round. Be strong, confident and brave and you will soon reap the rewards."

Find a credit monitoring review site.,
Look through the criteria listed.,
Read the full reviews.,
Consider any potential biases of the reviewer.",How to Choose a Credit Monitoring Service1," Not all sites are equal and some are actually run by the companies selling the services. ConsumerReports.org is a non-profit site aimed at consumer protection, so they might be a good choice. Next Advisor, though not a non-profit, also aims to be independent in their reviews, and they are accredited by the Better Business Bureau with an A+ ranking. These are the places to go first, but you can also do an individual search on any particular company to see what comes up in a web search.Understand that these companies review the credit monitoring companies, rather than monitoring credit themselves.;
, Review sites will often include what credit bureaus the credit monitoring services monitor. They will also generally include price comparisons, notes about free trials, and a link to a lengthier review that will describe the company and their experience of it in more detail., To understand the company's strengths and weaknesses, it's best to read the full review. While a chart of the key differences will allow you to get a basic sense of a company's quality in comparison with other companies, the full review will allow you to get a sense of the experience of working with that company., If you are unfamiliar with the site, or there are significant differences between one particular company and all the rest, you should take the review with a grain of salt. You may even want to compare any of these review sites with ConsumerReports.org, a nonprofit organization that reviews products and services with the interest of the consumer in mind."

Check the price.,
Make sure that the company monitors all 3 of the major credit bureaus.,
Check how often the company will update your credit report and credit score.,
Find out what the company will monitor.,
Check to see if the company includes 24-hour customer support.,
Try a free trial.",How to Choose a Credit Monitoring Service2," You will have to pay either a monthly or annual fee for the monitoring service. Also check exactly what you are paying for. Sometimes you can eliminate certain services that you will not use in exchange for a lower rate., Most credit monitoring services claim to give you reports from all 3 reporting agencies: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. However, only a few actually do. Make sure that the company you choose will give you access to the reports from all 3 bureaus since your credit report can differ a little between each agency.A reputable company will say clearly which of the three bureaus they get their data from, or if they get data from all three.You can use free credit monitoring through Credit Karma and Credit Sesame, but these reports might be limited to information from less than the Big 3.

, The company that you choose should update your information at least once a month. Updating once a month is sufficient enough to track changes in your credit report and score. Anything less than that and you may miss a big change or not get alerted right away., Look for a credit monitoring company that will monitor your reports and will alert you right away if they suspect identity theft or any other suspicious activity. You may want a service that will also alert you to any changes in your report or score, good or bad. They should also alert you if any new accounts are opened in your name., You will want to choose a company that offers complete customer service. Since something can happen to your credit at any hour of the day, it is best to have a company that has 24-hour customer service support. Look for a company that offers 24-hour phone service and real time email response., Most services will let you sign up for a free trial period. This period can vary anywhere from 7 days to a month. Trial periods are a good way to test drive a credit monitoring service to determine if they have the features you are looking for. You will most likely have to enter your credit card information when you sign up for the free trial, so make sure you keep track of when your trial period is over.You may want to do a web search on the company first to see if other users had any trouble unsubscribing if they were unhappy with the trial.
Subscriptions automatically roll over after trail period unless stopped and may be billed for a longer period than a month. In these cases, getting your money back can be a hassle.
To avoid this, you'll need to call and cancel your subscription before the free trial period ends.

Companies will often have a rating from A+ to F with A+ being the best rating the BBB can give. Checking with the BBB can help you feel more secure in trusting a credit monitoring company.You can also check with the State Attorney General Office to determine if a service is reputable., This can be an easy way to find out if a friend has found a particular credit monitoring service to be helpful or if there are any credit-monitoring horror stories to look out for.

Revolving accounts are charge accounts with a credit limit that must be paid each month. Credit cards are an example of revolving accounts.
Installment accounts are credit accounts in which the amount and number of payments is predetermined in a fixed amount. Car loans are installment accounts.

Guard against identity theft if your spouse has died.,
Find out if your child’s credit has been compromised.,
Check on the finances of aging parents.",How to Check Someone's Credit Scores3," The FCRA is a federal law that governs how credit reporting agencies manage your credit information. Its goal is to protect individuals’ privacy and identity. It also protects your right to access and correct any inaccuracies in your credit report.Finally, it specifies who may or may not obtain a credit report on someone else.


Under the FCRA, you can obtain others’ credit reports only if you need it to qualify them for a job, insurance, government benefits or tenancy. Also, having power of attorney makes it legal for your to view that person’s credit report.

, According to CNN.com, in 2010, nearly 60 percent of employers ran credit checks on potential new hires. They see it as an important part of the hiring process, like checking someone’s references.Some employers check applicants’ credit because of the nature of the job for which they are applying. For example, banks, brokerages, the government and other financial institutions want to hire people with a proven ability to manage their personal finances.
Other employers use credit histories as a way of weeding out weak applicants. They see the existence of high debt or credit delinquencies as a possible distraction that may affect job performance.
Federal law allows employers to see a modified credit report for job applicants or employees. This is sometimes referred to as a credit header. It omits account numbers to protect privacy. If an employer decides not to hire someone based on a credit report, the applicant must be given a copy of the credit report and told of their right to challenge it under the FCRA., As a landlord, you want tenants who pay their rent and take care of the property as if it were their own.

According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the problem is increasing because identity information about the recently deceased is so easy to get.The government publishes the names and social security numbers of the recently deceased on the Social Security Administration’s website in order to prevent welfare fraud. But identity thieves need only to download this Excel file from the website.
Some genealogy websites publish social security numbers and maiden names of the deceased.
It can take up to a year to settle the affairs of a person who has died. During this time, bills continue to come in and creditors are notified of the death. Identity thieves think a few extra credit card bills in the person’s name are not likely to get noticed.

, If your child is receiving credit card solicitations in the mail, then you might want to check for fraud. Identity thieves target minors because they think it won’t get noticed.

You want to check your child’s credit report and address any problems before he turns 18 and begins applying for student loans or a credit card account.Typically you cannot pull a minor’s credit report online. You must call the credit reporting agency directly.

, Senior citizens are often targets of fraud. Look for unusually high balances on credit cards or lines of credit for which they did not sign. Thieves sometimes convince the elderly to cosign on loans. When the loan doesn’t get paid, the cosigner becomes responsible for the debt, and this can negatively affect a credit score. Also, if an elderly person is suffering from dementia, he may randomly apply for credit or use credit irresponsibly.You will need power of attorney or a court-appointed guardianship to obtain a parent’s credit report.

, Although the concept of a credit score can feel abstract, it is valuable to understand credit and to know your score, especially if you are planning to apply for a loan or other significant financial step in the future (buy a car, buy a house, etc).

Your credit score (or FICO score) is a 3-digit number between 300 and 850 which represents your success in borrowing and repaying money.A higher number indicates a better credit score.
Credit scores are affected by many forms of financial transactions. Credit card payments and the number of credit cards that you use, loan payments (including student loans), the number of years you’ve been accruing credit for, and the amount of money that you owe all influence your credit score.A credit score is important to financial institutions and credit card companies; banks and credit unions will use your FICO score to determine your eligibility for loans.

, Many individuals sign up for a free 30-day trial or for a “one-time” $1 credit report, without realizing that Experian will roll these one-time registrations into a permanent subscription. While finding out your credit score is useful, many people don’t appreciate Experian’s automatic subscription policy.

Always read the small print, especially when giving Experian money, or if they already have your credit card information.
Many individuals sign up for Experian (or another credit-monitoring service) because they are concerned about credit fraud. You can do this yourself by watching your monthly bank and credit card statements; keep an eye out for suspicious charges or fees.

Pay cash in full.",How to Buy a New Car With No Credit History," Before heading out to make a car purchase, you need to look realistically at your finances. If you have no credit history, that doesn’t mean you’re bad at paying off debts—it just means you haven’t had reason to, and creditors like to see evidence that you can pay your loans. The bigger the cash down payment, the better, because it cuts down on the total financing amount and may improve your chances of getting accepted for a loan.Look at your checking account and do some budgeting. How much extra income can you take out of checking right now without negatively affecting your bills?
Look at your savings account. What money is expendable?
If you don’t have much available for a down payment, consider starting a strict savings plan and going car shopping again once you have more money. Lenders are more willing to take you without credit when you can pay at least 20% for the down payment.Also consider how much you will need to set aside monthly for car insurance, gas, and maintenance.;
, It is helpful to know how lenders are going to see you before you start applying for car loans, especially without a credit history. This may seem counterintuitive if you don’t have a credit history, but you may be surprised to find things on your record. Pull your credit history from all three of the credit bureaus—TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax.

You can find your credit reports in several ways. On the bureau websites, they charge about $40 for a one-time check of all three reports and your credit score, but a law called the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that the bureaus give you a free report once every 12 months.You can also inquire about a free credit report from your bank.
Mistakes on your credit history can affect your interest rate and whether or not you get accepted for a loan, and you can dispute these mistakes.You should submit your disputes in writing to the credit bureaus., Opening a credit account as soon as you decide you want to take out a car loan will help your credit score if you have no history. For example, a secured credit card is useful because it doesn’t require a credit history to apply for.Bring documentation of this credit card to lenders when applying for a car loan.

, You can purchase credit insurance specifically for covering your loan in a loss of income situation. Credit insurance covers your payments, either partially or in full, in the event that you are unable to pay your loan. This can help protect your credit score against events beyond your control. Credit life insurance, disability insurance, and property insurance are all options available to consumers.

A lender may feel more comfortable extending you a loan if they know you are willing to cover it in an emergency.

Consider the monthly cost of these types of insurance. It can be expensive.

, At the end of the car buying experience, you will be asked if you want to tack on extra expenses like extended warranties and payment protection plans. Make sure you know how much these kinds of extras cost, how much help they are, and if you can afford them.


Extended car warranties can ensure you don’t have to pay for big repairs. The flip-side of this is an extra expense, sometimes over $1,000. And keep in mind that if you are buying a relatively new or used car, you probably won’t even need the warranty since they often only cover major repairs like engine or transmission failure.New cars, as well as some used cars, have warranties that protect the vehicle for years, so extended warranties rarely make financial sense.


Payment protection plans are similar to credit insurance, only they are provided by the dealers themselves. The deal is that if you can’t make your payments, the dealer offers to cover you for a few months.However, payment protection plans are highly restrictive and the dealer only becomes liable if the purchaser dies, gets seriously ill, or becomes unemployed. Most financial professionals discourage the purchase of payment plans since they are expensive and rarely pay off.

, Once you’ve reviewed your finances and seen your credit score, think about what lenders are looking for and consider if you have it. Lenders look favorably on people with a mid-range credit score (620-680), higher income, and having been with the same employer for a few years.If this doesn’t describe you (and it likely doesn’t if you have no credit history) that’s not a deal breaker. There are other ways to get a loan without a credit history.
If you don’t have these things, you may want to find a co-signer who does to help prove that you are good for the loan. However, by co-signing on the loan, your co-signer is now legally liable for any payments you fail to make, which can have negative consequences for their credit score or financial health. Make sure both you and your co-signer know the associated risks before signing.

, In order to prove that you are not a risky investment to lenders, you need to provide proof of employment. Gather both paper and electronic copies of as many of these documents as you can locate:Last year’s W2 tax form
Pay stubs showing 6 months of employment
An offer letter from your current employer with the salary listed

, Some lenders will take assets as collateral when you have no credit history. If you have large investments that you are willing to put up as collateral, this may make lenders more inclined to take you on.Financial institutions are more willing to accept collateral in addition to the auto being financed and the borrower is likely to get better terms at these financial institutions than at a dealer that does not accept collateral.
Of course, if you have no credit history, this means you were given the assets or paid cash up front for them.

, Having people who can vouch for your commitment to paying back loans is helpful, especially if you have taken personal loans from people and paid them back. Make a list of at least six people with their names and contact info.References are also useful in applying for discounts such as a first-time buyer discount.

, If you want to be considered for a discount by a car dealership, show proof of being a student (or recently graduated) or in the military. Loan companies may also look favorably on your participation in such organizations.

Proof can be your ID card, enrollment papers, or diploma.

, Lenders will make credit history inquires on their own, but having your report and score on your person can improve your odds, especially if you made recent changes to mistakes on your history. Having these numbers can also help your salesman find a price that could potentially be balanced by a good interest rate.

, When you go to a dealer for a new car, chances are your salesman will try to find you a loan using his system. However, you might be able to get a loan from your bank at a better interest rate. If you bank at a credit union, your odds are higher of getting a loan because these institutions are smaller and more willing to work with you personally.You may also be able to get a loan with a credit union even if you don’t bank there.
Consider the website Peer to Peer, where you can get a loan from an individual instead of an institution.Consider borrowing money from a relative.

, Find someone who has good credit amongst your friends and family to co-sign on your car loan. This will boost a lender’s confidence in the loan. Make sure it is someone who trusts you, because the record of this loan goes on both your credit reports.


If you ever default on this loan, the lender will look to the co-signer for payment, making your relationship very uncomfortable.

, If you are offered a loan, make sure it has a low enough interest rate to keep your monthly payments low. For example, someone with a mid-range credit score (620-680) is looking at an interest rate of between 5 and 6%.A credit score lower than that is looking at an interest rate anywhere from 6.5 to 13%.

, Although monthly payments might be higher, getting a loan for a shorter amount of time means paying less interest in the long run. If you can handle it financially, try to get a loan for four years or less.

, Some lenders and car lots will give you discounts based on things you have done and memberships you have. If you qualify for a discount of any kind, bring the paperwork for it.


Some places (both dealerships and lenders) will offer discounts for being a student, a recent graduate, being in the military, or being a first-time buyer. All of these discounts tend to come with strict requirements. For example, the first-time buyer discount may require 10% down, references, a steady job, and car insurance.
You may be able to get a lower monthly payment if you lease instead of buy.

, If you are jobless when you start the car search and no lenders will take you, consider pausing the search until you have worked steadily for several months. This will build your reputation as a responsible citizen. Be sure to bring in proof of employment when you resume the search.


Also consider doing things to boost your credit while you wait, such as getting a credit card.

, Ultimately, the easiest way to buy a car without any credit is to pay cash for the entire vehicle. This practice is wise because it keeps you from going into debt and defaulting on loans, but it is also risky because it means you will continue to have an empty credit history.


Car dealers who receive $10,000 or more in cash are required to report the transaction and its specifics to the IRS.

Pay rent on time.,
Obtain a credit-builder loan.,
Apply for low balance credit card.,
Use store credit for large purchases.,
Give lenders incentive to extend credit.",How to Build Credit Fast1," A lot of people who have little in the way of traditional credit do rent a home or an apartment and pay rent on time. Most renters don’t get credit for their rental payments on their credit report, but that doesn’t have to be the case. There are several services which (for a fee) will report your rental payments to one or more of the major credit bureaus, and tell you which credit cards and lenders will take your rental payments into account.There are quite a few rental reporting services, all coming in at varying price points. One of the best is RentTrack, as they report to all three credit bureaus and are priced very modestly.;
, The term “credit-builder loan” is somewhat of a misnomer. In reality, it isn’t much like a loan at all. While you might apply for a credit builder loan like any other type of loan, the bank doesn’t give you the money it lends. Instead, it deposits the entire amount in a savings account. You make monthly payments on the loan, and when it’s completely paid off, they release the funds to you.Credit-builder loans have their good points and bad points. The advantage of a credit builder loan is that it does usually improve your score—by about 30-40 points. The disadvantage is the interest; you still pay interest on the loan. So it’s less like a loan than it is a subscription service to improve your credit score.

, “Starter” credit cards are low-balance credit cards with high interest rates and often an annual fee. They are offered to people with no credit history to help them start building their credit score. They should be used for small purchases. Try to pay off the full balance every month to start building good credit., If you are just moving out on your own for the first time, you may need many expensive items like furniture, appliances, or even a car. These can be difficult to purchase without any credit. The store or dealer may offer financing options, including store credit. Many of these may be interest free for a certain period.

Store credit cards often offer discounts on their goods. While they have high interest rates, they are often available to people with no or low credit scores. If you need appliances or furniture, you may want to open a card with a store.If you need a vehicle, you can use dealer financing to purchase or lease one. Remember to choose a car within your budget. Do not buy a car unless you absolutely need one to get to work or school.

, Many lenders may not be eager to extend credit to someone with no payment history. If they are unwilling to give you a low balance card or a decent loan, you might try to convince them by lowering their risk. There are two primary ways of doing this. You can get a co-signer for your loan or you can sign-up for a secured credit card.

Finding a co-signer is one of the most effective ways of building credit when you have none. A co-signer agrees to make payments on the debt in case you default. They assume responsibility, and it is their creditworthiness dictating the terms of the loan.Secured credit cards are like credit-building loans in that they’re not really credit—they are subscription services that improve your credit score. The subscription costs come in the form of interest and other fees."

Check your credit score.,
Minimize the use of credit cards.,
Read your contract.,
Make payments on or before due dates.,
Keep account balances low or fully paid each month.,
Maintain savings for emergencies.,
Monitor credit transactions for accuracy.",How to Avoid Bad Credit1," A credit score is a number that lets lenders know how likely you are to pay back your loan on time. Knowing your credit score will help you determine whether or not you need to change your paying habits. To get your credit score, contact your credit card company, loan officer, or at an online credit score service like Annual Credit Report.

Credit scores generally run from between 300 and 850. Above 700 is generally considered to be a good score while a score under 600 will restrict your access to loans.
A credit report lists all of your credit activity, including any open accounts, debts, liens, ongoing foreclosures, and all inquiries that creditors have submitted. Many free credit reports do not actually contain your credit score. Reports are still useful, however, because they allow you to check for mistakes.Your credit card company may provide your credit score for free on your monthly statement or through your online portal. Others, however, may make you pay to receive your credit score.There are many factors that contribute to credit scores. These include your bill-paying history, your current unpaid debt, how many loans you have, how long you’ve held your loans, your credit ratio, and any new applications for credit.;
, Credit cards are a common source of debt. If used responsibly, credit cards can help build good credit, but if allowed to get out of hand, credit cards can quickly lower your score. To use credit responsibly, make sure that your credit card balance does not exceed more than 20% of your total credit limit.

Pay more than the minimum towards your credit card debt each month. Ideally, you should be paying back the full balance each month. If you do not pay back the full balance, you will accrue interest on the debt you have not paid, which will increase the debt over time.Use the card for small purchases, such as gas or groceries, or for purchases that get you special cash-back bonuses through your bank.

, Reading your credit card contract or loan agreement will help you understand what you need to do to remain on good terms with your debt. Hidden penalties can sometimes hurt your credit. Some common things you may want to look out for include:

Penalty APR: If you don’t pay your balance on time, the lender may increase your interest rate.Acceleration clause: If you miss enough payments, the lender may declare the entire balance due at once.
Balloon payments: Your loan may have small monthly payments with a large final payment at the end, known as a balloon payment. Sometimes, this final payment is too large for you to afford paying it. Failure to pay the balloon payment may cause the lender to initiate repossession or foreclosure., One of the most effective ways to avoid bad credit is to make all payments on your bills and debt on time. There are many reporting and monitoring agencies that alert the credit bureaus if you are late or delinquent on any payment. Late payments can cause your credit score to drop.

It is important to pay each of your bills on time. This includes credit card bills, rent, utilities, and even cable and cell phone bills.
Pay your bills at the same time each month. For example, each time you get paid, take time to sit down and make payments.
Keep track of due dates by noting them in your calendar. You can even use technology--set reminders to help you remember each payment date.
Many utility companies and credit agencies will allow you to set up automatic payments each month. These will automatically charge you when the bill is due for payment.

, Using credit responsibly can be a good way to build your credit score. However, hitting the limit on any of your credit lines will lower your score. You should also avoid maintaining large balances on any of your cards.In addition, avoid creating a high debt-to-income ratio. This ratio measures your income to the amount you pay in debt payments each month. A high ratio (over one third of your income going to debt each month) can make you less creditworthy.


Try to keep your credit card balance under 20% of your credit limit.

, It can be tempting to use your credit card when there has been a costly emergency, but you can avoid this debt by keeping at least three months of your wages saved in an emergency fund. Do not touch this money unless you absolutely need to.

If you have children or dependents, you may want to save more than three months of your wages.
If you have no emergency fund currently, try saving a little bit of your paycheck each month to put into an emergency fund. Start with whatever money you have to spare, no matter how small., You are able to request a free credit report once every twelve months. You can get this report from each of the major credit bureaus— Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Go over the report carefully, and double check all transactions on the report. If you see a mistake, report it immediately to have it removed.

Sometimes, credit reporting agencies will confuse people with similar names. If you have information on the report that does not belong to you, it may be a case of mistaken identity.
If you have been divorced, your ex-spouse’s information may still be on the report. If this happens, report it immediately.
Occasionally, a debt that has been paid may still be listed as delinquent or it may be listed twice. Report these discrepancies immediately.To report a mistake, you can write the credit reporting bureau a letter or you can use their online platform. Provide documentation of the mistake. By law, they must either open an investigation or delete the mistake within three days. They inform when they have done this."

This can help you track your purchases and keep a budget as well. If you are spending too much on something, you can identify it and cut back.

, Payment history is the biggest single factor determining your credit score, accounting for about 35%. It’s simple advice, but easier said than done. Nonetheless, over the long term, it’s the best way to rehabilitate your credit.Pay debts according to the terms set forth in your contract. Make sure to pay at least the minimum payment (but ideally more) before or on the due date. Avoid paying late, and never miss a payment.
You may want to set up automatic bank drafts if you’re worried you’ll forget about payments. These will automatically take the money from your account each month.
The best way to build credit fast is to pay the full balance on your credit card each month.

, Once your credit is rehabilitated to the point that you can qualify for a loan, you should take out a small loan or line of credit in a different form than the type of credit you already have. The mix of credit is only about 10% of your total score, but it is a factor.For example, if you only have one credit card, purchase an appliance on an installment plan or take out a small personal loan. It’s never a bad idea to save up the amount of the loan before you apply, put it in a separate account, and simply have the loan payments automatically draw from that account.

, Applying for too many lines of credit may reduce your credit score. Avoid applying for new credit frequently. If you feel that you need more credit, try asking for a credit increase on a current card instead., You can get a free credit report from each of the credit bureaus once a year (meaning up to three different occasions). The report is a comprehensive picture of your credit history—what you’ve paid and when you paid it, what your debts are, and when you applied for new lines of credit.

Just go to https://annualcreditreport.com, provide your name and identifying information along with your addresses for the past two years. Once you get your report, examine it for any mistakes. As many as one in five Americans has an error on their credit report, so check diligently. A mistake can be virtually anything, like a bankruptcy attributed to you when you never went bankrupt, or a bill a creditor says is delinquent when it isn't.If you find a mistake, do the following:First, point the error out to the credit bureau itself. Send a physical letter via certified mail, along with a copy of the report and any documentation supporting your claim. Look at a sample letter to see how to do this.
Repeat the process with the creditor (not the credit bureau) who has filed the incorrect information. Request that the creditor send you courtesy copies of any correspondence they initiate with the credit bureau.
It's always best to put everything in writing when you're dealing with creditors or credit bureaus. Writing makes them accountable for their words, and ultimately, for their claims to you.

, After you dispute an item on your credit report, the reporting agency is obligated to make an investigation with in thirty days. Although it would be nice if the credit bureaus always did the right thing, sometimes they don't. And sometimes those mistakes are so big the consumer has no choice but to go the legal route. If you're at the end of your rope, contact the following:The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is one of the newest federal agencies, is the watchdog organization policing the credit bureaus. If you would like to file a complaint against a credit reporting agency, you can do so at http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/#credit-reporting.
Your state's attorney general or offices of consumer protection are your next best bet. All states don't have an independent consumer protection agency, but the state where you reside does, start with them first, as they have the most experience with consumer complaints. Find your attorney general at http://www.naag.org/naag/attorneys-general/whos-my-ag.php


, Emergencies can be costly, but you should avoid using your credit card to cover them if possible. Try to save up at least three months of your wages in an emergency fund. Use this money if a medical emergency or unexpected unemployment occurs.

Three month’s wages is a general guideline. Some people, especially those with families to support, may want to save up more.
To start your emergency fund, put aside a little of money from your paycheck each month."

Learn what your credit score means.,
Negotiate negative items off your report.,
Limit credit to 30% of amount available.,
Avoid closing lines of credits.",How to Build Credit Fast3," A lender uses credit scores to determine how likely it is that you will pay your debts on time. Your credit score is based on a number of factors, including your payment history, current unpaid loans, history of bankruptcy or foreclosure, and the number of loans you have out.

There are three agencies that collect information and report on your credit score. These are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
FICO scores are the most common type of credit score. They range from 300-850. A good credit score is over 700 while scores under 600 may make it difficult for you to borrow money. FICO requires six months of credit history for a score.
VantageScores also run from 300 to 850, and they will assign a letter grade from A to F on your score. They only require one month of credit history., It’s not a foolproof strategy, but you can sometimes negotiate with a creditor to remove a negative item from your report. Counterintuitively, this works best when you still owe money to the creditor. Try the following:Write your creditor and offer to pay the balance of the account if they will remove the item from your credit report (or at least mark it as “paid as agreed”). If they agree to your offer or you agree to their counteroffer, get the agreement in writing and uphold your end of the bargain.

, If you’ve got a credit limit of $1000, you should be able to charge $1000, right? Actually, if you want to keep your credit score in good shape, it’s best to carry a balance of no more than 30% of your available credit (and no less than 10%). This is called the “amounts owed” section of your credit score, which isn’t the most straightforward name. It means the amount owed relative to your credit limits, and not the entirety of the amount of debt owed. A credit score is based on a variety of factors, including payment history, total debt load, and length of time accounts have been open. The amounts owed is one of the most important components of the score, and it's also one of the simplest to tweak.
If you can’t afford to get your balance down below 30% of your limit right away, one possible fix is to call your credit card company and ask for a higher credit limit.

, If you cancel a card or another line of credit, the total amount of available credit you have will lessen, which will negatively affect your score. If you have one card you don’t use very much, charge a small recurring bill, like a phone bill or a trash bill, to the card. That will keep it active and with a small but manageable balance.(note that their use should be avoided except in emergency)

Avoid using these extra lines of credit unless you absolutely need to because of an emergency.

If you spend more than you make each month, you will need to stick to a monthly budget so that you can start paying off debt and increasing your credit score.
Sometimes unpredictable life events happen. Losing your job or getting sick can cause you to rely heavily on credit while spending your savings. Creditors are often willing to work with people experiencing hardship. Eliminate unnecessary spending, renegotiate your debt, and ask family for support.

, Write down everything that you buy in a month. This includes food, drinks, entertainments (such movie tickets and video games), restaurant bills, clothing, and other products. Tally up how much you spend on these, and look for ways to reduce unnecessary spending.

For example, try not to buy new clothes unless you need them. You can buy clothing on sale or go to a second-hand clothing store for deals.

, A budget will help you determine exactly how much money you can spend a money while still saving and paying off your debt. You should write down all of your expenses, such as rent, bills, utilities, entertainment, gas, and food. Look for areas where you can reduce your spending so that you can save more money.

Your budget should include how much each month you plan to save. Set this money in your savings account when you first get paid. You should do the same for credit card statements and debts.

, A reputable credit counseling service can do wonders for your financial well-being. They offer a variety of services, including budgeting and money management classes, but one of the most useful is debt consolidation through debt management.Debt consolidation is a process by which the credit counseling service collects a complete statement of all of your debts.

For many people, it is an effective way to bring accounts current and climb out of debt.

, You may be able to negotiate with your creditors on a new payment plan. This might be one with new monthly payments or lower interest. You may be able to offer them a lump-sum payment for part of the debt in exchange for forgiving your late fees. Reach out to your creditors to see if they are willing to negotiate.

Explain to your creditors any hardship in your life that might affect your ability to pay. For example, unemployment, hefty medical bills, or a death in the family may convince them to help you out.
Talk to them calmly. Do not demand things or yell at the creditor.
Once you arrive at an agreement, ask for a copy in writing from them."

, Credit application is incomplete. Perhaps you left out some important information or made an error on the application. Any large discrepancy between your application and your credit file can count against you. The lender will wonder if you are hiding something. Always double check your application.

, Inquiries are made whenever you apply for credit. Requesting your own report also counts as an inquiry, but is usually not held against you. At the creditor’s discretion, as few as four inquiries within six months’ time may be considered a sign of excessive credit activity. The creditor may then presume that you are trying desperately to get credit and are being rejected elsewhere.


NOTE* Generally, several inquiries for a ""major"" purchase, like a home or auto loan are counted as ""one"" inquiry.

, These may arise simply from typing mistakes, or from confusing your name with someone else’s similar name. Since the credit bureaus handle millions of files, the possibility for error is substantial. Errors can be found and corrected only by carefully reviewing your file for accuracy at least once a year and then taking the necessary steps to correct any errors that you do find.

, Insufficient credit file. Your credit history is too scanty for the type or amount of credit you requested. You need to develop your credit history more fully before qualifying for the level of credit you are now requesting.

Be patient.",How to Avoid Bad Credit2," Get a copy of your credit report by visiting annualcreditreport.com. This report is free to obtain once per year. When you have your copy, check it closely to see if there are any misreported or duplicated debts on your credit report. If so, contact the credit reporting agency (Experian, TransUnion, or Equifax) and go through their error disputing process. If they cannot remove the debt, you may have to contact the lender listed on your report and have them change it. Removing these types of errors can dramatically improve your credit score., If you have any late payments or delinquent debts on your credit history, this is likely negatively impacting your credit score. Contact the lender to work out a repayment plan so that you can eventually have the bad debt removed from your credit report. When paying off debt, start with the debt with the highest interest rate and then, once that is paid, move on to the debt with the next highest rate. This can help you avoid accruing additional interest debt while you work to repay your debts., Creditors are not required to submit information about your credit history to the reporting bureaus. You may be able to convince your creditor to remove or modify certain statements on your credit report. Talk to your lender or loan officer to see if you can negotiate a solution.

If you have made good payments recently, you may be able to convince them to take off an older mistake. Alternatively, if you only missed one payment, you might be able to use your strong history of paying on time to convince them that it won’t happen again.
If you have missed many payments, you may be able to offer the creditor a settlement, where you pay the amount due and avoid late fees and high interest rates. If you pay back the money due, they may be willing to remove it from your statement., If you feel like you are unable to fix your credit on your own, help is available. You can visit a credit counselor. Most credit counseling services are non-profit, and you can receive advice in person, over the phone, or online.Credit counselors can help you figure out a debt management plan, and also help you create a workable budget.
When you contact the office, ask what kind of services they provide and what qualifications the counselors have.

, In general, you should avoid applying for new credit frequently. Applying for new credit cards or other types of credit can have a negative impact on your credit score if you do so frequently. If you need more credit to make a purchase, ask for a credit increase on a current card instead.

However, if you only have one or two open credit lines, opening others can help decrease your credit utilization ratio, which can improve your credit score., A bad credit score can be a major setback in achieving your financial goals. However, you can take steps to repair your credit. Just be aware that there is not a fast, simple way to raise your score.It can take several months, and even years, to raise your credit score. You need to pay all of your bills on time and demonstrate your financial responsibility.
Be honest. Do not try to hide your poor credit from potential landlords, lenders, or employers. Instead, honestly and openly explain your circumstances."

Implement a budget to control spending.,
Identify any bad habits that might affect your credit score.,
Avoid certain loans.,
Build your job history.",How to Avoid Bad Credit3," One way to have ""good credit"" is to have a high credit score. Your credit score is a number used to tell lenders, potential employers, landlords and others what kind of financial risk factor you have. Many lenders rely on FICO credit scores for this number. FICO stands for the Fair Issac Corporation, which is the company most relied upon to calculate credit scores.Credit scores can range from 300-850. The higher the number, the better. There is no set number for what defines ""good"" credit. Some lenders consider 650 good, while others go a bit higher or lower.
There are three credit bureaus that keep files on your finances and release credit scores: Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. You can get your credit score from these companies through their websites for a small fee.
Your credit card, bank, or websites like Credit Karma or Credit Sesame may be able to provide you with your credit score for free.
Your credit score will fluctuate over time, based on five factors: amount owed, new credit, length of credit history, credit mix, and payment history.

, A monthly budget can help you prevent spending money that you may not have on items that you do not need. To create a budget, track how much money you make each month, and then tally up your expenses. Separate necessary expenses—such as rent, utilities, and insurance—from non-necessary items—such as eating out, going to the movies, or shopping.

Set aside part of your paycheck each money to put into savings.
If you are in debt, allot part of your paycheck each month to paying it off.
Write down everything you buy and how much it costs. This can help you determine where your money is going. You can then eliminate or reduce places where you are spending too much., Be aware of your spending habits, and look for patterns or habits that cause you to spend more than you can afford each money. You should not be putting more money on your credit card than you can afford.

If you rely on a credit card to get you through the money, you may want to develop a budget to see if there are any places where you can cut down on your spending.
Avoid using a home equity line of credit for other types of purchases, as not paying it off could result in foreclosure.Co-signing someone else’s loan is generally a bad idea, as it puts you at risk if they do not pay back the loan. This can damage your credit just as much as taking out a loan yourself., Sometimes a loan can help your credit. Examples of ""good"" loans are mortgage or car loans from a reputable lender, such as your bank. However, there are many types of loans that can be detrimental to your credit.Payday loans should be avoided at all costs. These loans, which are granted to anyone with proof of income, can have exorbitant interest rates.
Auto-tile loans are usually not a good idea, because the rates on these are usually high. You are also putting yourself in a situation where you might have to forfeit your car.
Certain car loans can also be very bad deals. If the interest is in double digits, or it will take you more than 5 years to pay back the loan, it is not a good loan.

, Lenders look for several factors when deciding what type of loan they will grant you. One thing lenders look for is that you have a history of reliable income. You will often get a better loan rate if you can show that you have worked at the same job for a number of years.A solid job history can help you get loans and higher credit amounts on your cards.

Understand the benefits of creating new credit accounts.,
Decide if you need to create new tradelines.,
Apply for a secured credit card.,
Apply for credit accounts through department stores and merchants.,
Consider more traditional credit products.",How to Add Tradelines to Your Credit Report1," When you create a new credit account, you accomplish a few things. First, you create a new tradeline, which is a new opportunity to have a positive record on your credit report. Secondly, opening new tradelines can improve your credit score by increasing your total available credit, and adding to the types of credit you have (providing you are very responsible with payments). Two key factors that determine your credit score are the types of credit you have, including things like mortgages and credit cards, and the amount of credit you have compared to how much you have used. Having more kinds of credit improves your credit score, and having more credit also improves your credit score (providing most of it is unused).
Adding tradelines to your account can easily destroy your credit score if you are not extremely responsible with the new credit accounts. In fact, a wise suggestion is to not even use the new credit you have, or only use it once a month for a small amount just to show positive repayment history.;
, If you already have good credit from a variety of different credit sources and a good history of paying off that debt, chances are you don't need to add additional tradelines. The important thing is to strive for quality over quantity. You want several different lines of credit, like a credit card or two and a mortgage payment, that you've paid consistently for years. In addition, be sure to stay well below the limit on your credit cards. It won't hurt you to add more tradelines if you're careful with them, but after a certain point adding more won't significantly increase your credit score., One tradeline that is both easy to get approved for and hard to abuse is a secured credit card. This is an excellent place to start if you want to add tradelines to your account and have poor credit. A secured credit card requires a security deposit equal to the amount of your credit line.


Simply deposit the predetermined amount in your account, and then you can borrow against it.
You can apply for a secured credit card online through your local bank, or you can visit the branch and apply there. Most banks offer some form of secured credit card.
Like unsecured credit cards, these cards do have fees, generally an interest rate and an annual fee. It is wise to shop around beyond your local bank to compare interest rates and annual fees to make sure you are getting the best deal possible.

, Gas stations, credit unions, department stores, furniture retailers and jewelry stores are among creditors who sometimes have relatively lenient qualification processes and are, therefore, good places to start if you don't already have strong credit. These cards usually offer discounted purchases from the store as well.Consider this option if you have poor credit and and are having difficulty getting approved for a traditional card. It is also important that you frequently use the store through which you are getting the card. This will allow you to build credit while saving money at the store.
Note that these cards often have higher rates than traditional credit cards. As a result, it is important set clear limits to how much you can spend. Namely, never spend more than you can afford to pay in a single month. It is important to remember the goal of adding tradelines is to improve your credit, and it is therefore important to be very strict with any new credit accounts.

, If you have the credit score and feel like you can responsibly manage more credit, consider applying for an additional credit card, or a line of credit. Generally speaking, try to apply for a type of credit you do not have. If you already have a credit card, consider applying for a line of credit. This shows creditors you can handle different types of credit.If you are unable to obtain approval for these types of products, consider using a co-signer. A co-signer is a friend, relative, or other individual who is willing to agree to pay the loan if you cannot. This can help gain approval. Remember that if you stop paying, you can damage the credit of your co-signer.
Whatever new credit you get, use it sparingly. A good rule is never use more than 50% of your available limit.

Check your credit report, from all three bureaus, every year.",How to Get Your Credit Report for Free1," This is the website set up by the three credit reporting agencies – Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian – to allow customers to easily request a credit report. This is the only site authorized to issue free credit reports, so be sure to use it, and not other “impostor” sites.;
, You will need to provide basic information to establish your identity, including your:Birth date
Social security number
Current address
Previous address if you have not lived at your current address for 2 years

, The three reporting companies get their information from different places and so may have slightly different information. They also present it in different ways. If you are about to seek credit for a large purchase like a car or house, it is a good idea to get all three reports to make sure your credit information is accurate. If you are not about to make a big purchase, it makes more sense to space out your requests so that you can keep track of your credit information over the course of the year.Equifax – Equifax conveniently groups accounts into “open” or “closed”, making it easy to review your current accounts. It also provides an 81-month credit history for each credit account, reflecting whether the account was paid or overdue in each of those months. For more on the Equifax report layout and codes used, see here.

Experian – The most helpful feature of Experian reports is that they tell you when an account or a negative report is scheduled to fall off your credit report. Experian also offers an 81-month payment history for each account. Experian is also the only company to report on-time rent payments, as opposed to just late ones. For more on the Experian report layout and codes used, see here.

TransUnion – TransUnion tends to have the most up-to-date previous address and employment information. You can correct the employment information via their website when you get the report, though this will not change your credit score. They are also the only credit agency to report your monthly balance and payment as part of your credit history. For more on the TransUnion report layout and codes used, see here.

, Each credit reporting agency will ask you questions regarding your credit history in order to verify that you are who you say you are. The questions will concern your credit accounts – when they were opened, how much you owe, etc. – and your previous addresses.


Don’t be worried if you don’t recognize some of the information. “None of the above” is a very popular answer in credit companies’ identity verification questions.

, You will be able to view all the reports you ordered online. If you register an account with the reporting companies, you may be able to return to view them for up to 30 days. Otherwise, you will only be able to view them once, so be sure to save the reports or print them.

, If you're not the internet type, there are two other ways to request your free annual credit report:



By phone – To request that your report be mailed to you by phone, call 1-877-322-8228 and ask for a copy of your report from each of the three reporting agencies. You will go through a simple verification process over the phone, similar to the online process, and should receive a copy of your report within 2 to 3 weeks of your request.

By mail – To request your report by mail, you will need to complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form available here and then mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. You can expect to receive a copy of your report in approximately two to three weeks from the date your request is received by AnnualCreditReport.com.

, If one of the bureaus gets false information from your credit company, or it simply makes a mistake, it pays to fix the problem quickly. A lingering blemish on your credit report might go unnoticed and then get buried if you fail to request a report every year, leaving you with a mysteriously low credit score and no reasons why.


Print and archive your credit report. Having a physical copy is so old-school, but it's also smart. Having copies of your credit reports dating back to when you first started using credit may come in handy if you ever need to show proof, for example, in a dispute with a credit company or the bureau itself.

Comply with the robber’s demands.,
Defend yourself as a last resort.",How to Stay Safe at an ATM," Ideally, there should be plenty of people around and enough light for everyone to see you. Don't use an ATM in a deserted location. It might be well lit, but if you are robbed or hurt, no one will be around to help you., This will minimize the likelihood of being robbed, because chances are better that there will be plenty of people around. Also, robbers simply tend to prefer the cover of darkness to the light of day.Avoid using ATMs at night whenever possible. If you must use an ATM at night, use one that is well lit and near a busy road or business., Robbers usually prefer to target isolated individuals, as opposed to groups of two or more. If you can bring a trusted friend (or even better, group of friends) along with you to the ATM, you’ll make a much less enticing target.Make sure you trust everyone in your ATM “herd,” though — you don’t want to get scammed by a friend-of-a-friend!

, Only roll down your window when (and as little as) necessary. This minimizes the chance of a criminal getting into your car and robbing you., Keep your eyes open for anything out of the ordinary, and trust your instincts. If something feels off, assume a problem and go elsewhere.Tell-tale signs include people walking up to you with their heads down, people standing suspiciously close to you while you use the ATM, or people loitering nearby, watching you at the ATM.

, If it’s during business hours and the bank is open, why not just walk up to the teller and withdraw some cash instead? Or, consider getting cash back when making a debit card transaction at the grocery store or other retailer., Never write down your PIN number on a piece of paper, or your hand, or anything else. Memorize it so that when you go to an ATM, people won't try to sneak a peek at your PIN (or even steal your card) while you're looking at the numbers.Make your PIN something you can remember, but not something obvious like your year of birth, house number, or — worst of all — “1234.”

, Keep your bling and your fancy purse or jacket at home when you hit the ATM. Stick with sweats or something else that doesn’t shout “look at all the money I have!”, Savvy thieves can make alterations or add components to the ATM that let them collect your personal information. Or, they may be able to jam the cash dispenser, hoping you’ll head into the bank to report it while they walk off with your money.


If anything looks out-of-place or newly-added to the machine, find another ATM.

, This will protect you against people who might see your PIN numbers as you type them in.Never feel embarrassed about doing this, or even politely asking someone to take a step back if they’re close enough to get a good look at your transaction. Try “I’m sorry, but would you mind taking a couple steps back while I finish my transaction? Thanks.”

, It’s just simple math — if you get robbed of $50 instead of $150, you end up at least a bit better off. Also, if the robber can see that you’ve only taken out a small amount of cash, they may decide you’re not worth the effort or risk., Weigh the minimal chance that the ATM spit out the wrong amount of cash versus the huge enticement this activity offers to a robber. Just pocket your cash quickly and go.


This will bring unwanted attention to you and your money. Always wait until you are in your car or somewhere safer.

, Never leave them behind, even if you crumple them up a bit and shove them into the little trash slot the ATM may have.If you don't need to keep them, tear them up thoroughly and take the ripped pieces with you to throw away at home. Even a receipt that you don't want can be found by someone else and used for malicious purposes.

, Never accept a seemingly kind offer of help if the machine freezes up on you, especially if the person says something like “Here, let me show you a trick to fix this. I’ll just punch your PIN in for you … what is it?”Police officers and bank employees will never ask you for your PIN number. If they need that kind of information, they can get it without your assistance.

, If anything at all seems out of the ordinary, cancel your transaction immediately. Go somewhere else to get your cash.If you don’t obviously have cash on you, you make a much less appealing target for a robber.

, If a robbery attempt seems imminent or you sense that you can safely get away from a robbery in progress, then run. You may even want to throw your wallet or cash on the ground as you go — remember, that’s what the bad guy wants., If you’re cornered, caught off guard, or the criminal has a weapon, compliance is almost always your safest option. Don’t try to be a hero — do what the robber says and give up your cash. It can be replaced; your life cannot., Unfortunately, some bad guys may be intent on harming you as well as robbing you. If, and only if, you are confident that your safety is a risk regardless of whether you give up your cash, defend yourself. Don’t worry about “fighting fair” — go for sensitive areas like the eyes, throat, groin, and knees.


If you can incapacitate your attacker for just a moment, run away immediately, even if you must leave your cash behind.
Look for self-defense or martial arts classes in your area so you can be better prepared.

Switch to mobile banking.",How to Use an ATM," People using ATMs will occasionally be targets of robberies and other crimes, so you'll want to be sure to be safe. First, make sure that the area is well lit and you are alone. Be on your guard if other people show up. Stand so that your screen and key presses are masked.


You'll also want to look at the machine itself. Devices called card skimmers are becoming more common and, while there is no universal signal that an ATM is compromised, if something seems off about how the card slot looks then you'll just want to find another machine to use.
Only use ATMs during the day in well trafficked areas, if possible.;
, Mobile banking cards come in two varieties — debit cards and credit cards. Debit cards are most frequently used in ATMs; they're linked to the exact amount you have in your bank account. Credit cards can be used in some cases, but fees and interest rates usually make them expensive to use. Insert your card into the card slot, facing in the direction indicated by the image on the machine.


Particular machines may have a special fee (usually when in a tourist area) which should be labeled on the machine.
If you travel out of the country, there may be additional fees associated with the distance or currency change.

, For example, if you own a Chase debit card, look for a Chase ATM or local branch. Although you can use almost any debit card on almost any ATM, you will likely be charged an additional fee for withdrawing money if the ATM is for a bank other than one you have an account with. Additionally, some of the services offered by the ATM may not be available if your card and ATM don't match.

, Most ATMs will offer transactions in several different languages, usually at least three or more dependent on where you live. Where in the process you change the language can depend on the machine, but it is usually directly after inserting your card.

, ""PIN"" stands for ""personal identification number,"" and it's a four-digit password people use to access their bank account. Enter your PIN number when asked to by the machine, making sure to shield the pad with your hand so that nearby onlookers can't see it. You should also watch out for cameras that are placed on the ATM itself, as these can be placed by criminals in order to steal your card information.

, You can withdraw money for almost any ATM, regardless of the associated bank (though this may incur fees). You will usually have two withdrawal options:


Fast cash - which allows you to quickly withdraw a set amount as labeled on the machine. This is usually either $40, $50, or $60.
Targeted withdrawal - which allows you to specify how much you want to withdraw by typing in the amount.
Be careful of your limits. Most ATMs and banks limit how much you can withdraw from an ATM in a given day. The limit varies widely based on your bank and your account type, but limits between $300-$1000 are common.

, You can deposit money as well, as long as you are using an ATM associated with your bank. You should be presented with the choice of what account you want the money deposited in to. The funds may not be immediately available, or only some of them may be immediately available. There are two ways that you can deposit money:


Deposit cash. This is usually fed into the machine, though sometimes a deposit envelope may be required. If you are using a modern ATM, you should be able to insert a stack of bills, often between 30-50 bills at a time, and the machine will count them up automatically.
Deposit checks. Older machines may require that you use a deposit slip in order to deposit a check, but for most modern machines you can simply feed the check into the ATM. The ATM will provide you with specific instructions, and a deposit envelope if you don't have one.
If you do need to fill out a deposit envelope, it's better to get the envelope from the machine and then exit out of the transaction, filling out the details and inserting the check into the envelop in your car or other safe location. Simply return to the machine, reinsert your card, and start the process over again once the envelope is prepared.

, You should have the option to check your account balance, or how much money you have available in your account, so long as you are using an ATM associated with your bank. This balance is often printed out on a receipt or sheet of paper, although it may be displayed on the screen as well.

, Many bank's ATMs will allow you to transfer money between multiple accounts you hold with the same bank, or even transfer money to other people's accounts. Occasionally you may also have the option to make payments, such as paying pre-set up bills or fees on your bank account itself.

, Once you've completed your transaction, you'll have to follow the on-screen prompts in order to exit out and get your card back. Often times, a short cut can be to simply press the red X on the keypad, which is similar to the ""back"" option on a computer.

, It's easy to forget to take your money or card when you're in a hurry, but be careful and be extra sure to take all of your belongings when you're done. This includes a cell phone you might have set down on the machine!

, Be aware that for everything but withdrawing money, you can now use mobile banking if you bank with one of the major banks. Mobile banking, which uses your smart phone, allows you to deposit checks, check your balance, transfer money, and includes many of the other services of the ATM.

Report any in-store accounts to the credit bureaus.,

Confirm that previous, successfully paid accounts are listed.,
Add your utilities payments to your credit report.",How to Add Tradelines to Your Credit Report2," This is a commonly recommended and handy way to add tradelines to your credit account with very low risk. Quite simply, credit accounts can often have more than one authorized user. If you ask someone you have a trusting relationship with to add you to their account as an authorized user, the tradeline will be added to your credit report. This means you can benefit from the other person's positive repayment history.


On the other hand, you can also do major damage to the other persons credit history (and they can in-turn do damage to yours).
To correct this, ask to be added as an authorized user, but be given no access to the accounts. This means you will not receive a card or any other means to spend with. At the same time, make sure the person who authorizes you has excellent credit history and stable income to make sure they do no damage to your credit history. IZM Credit Services offers this type of service.

, Three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) determine your credit score, and creditors typically report your credit information to them. However, not all creditors do so, and this is especially true for various in-store accounts (like with a department store for example) for which you may have an installment loan. You can get these added to your credit report, which will add tradelines.For example, you may have bought a refrigerator, jewelry, a washer/dryer, or a new hot tub. You may be paying these items through an installment loan, and you may be paying these items regularly, and on-time.
These stores often do not report credit information to the bureaus unless the account has gone to collections. However, they should be reporting positive information as well. You can simply ask them to report your account to the credit bureau's if you have been re-paying on-time and on-schedule.
Make sure they report the information to all three bureaus.

, Once you have added in-store accounts, you want to actually check your credit reports to see what is currently on there. The reason for this is because it will be important to confirm that all your current credit is on there (especially fully paid previous accounts). To get your credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com. You can get one free credit report every 12 months from each of the three bureaus through this site.


Make sure to obtain reports from all three bureaus to make sure there are no inaccuracies or inconsistencies between them.
Note that the credit score is not free ( a small fee needs to be paid) but your main interest is in the reports, so you can check what tradelines are currently listed.

, All your current accounts should be listed on the report, but it is important to note that former loans that were appropriately paid can and should also be listed as tradelines. If you have successfully paid off a loan, creditors should know about it, as this helps give them a more complete picture of your behavior as a borrower.


For example, you may have a previous auto-loan, or student loan that you successfully paid off. If these items are not listed on your report, it is very important you call your lender and request the item be sent to the three credit bureaus.
If they state they have sent it to the credit bureaus, the issue may be on their end. In that case, you can contact them to ensure to see where the error was and how they can correct it. This simple step can add greatly to your credit.

, Utilities, like department stores, often only report you to the credit bureaus if you account has been sent to collections, or if you have not been paying on-time. If you have been regularly and successfully paying your utilities bills, however, this should reflect on your credit report. You can contact your utilities company and ask them to add the data to your credit report.Not all utility companies will comply, but many will. It is always worth it to ask, as the results can significantly improve your credit report.

Understand how adding rent to your credit report works.,
Choose one of the three rent reporting services.,
Recognize that rent reporting does not affect your FICO score.",How to Add Tradelines to Your Credit Report3," Rent tradelines were typically not allowed on your credit score. However, this changed in 2011 when Experian announced they would be including rent. Recently, TransUnion also announced that they would also be including rent data. It is important to know that unlike other accounts, you cannot report rent directly to the credit bureaus yourself, and you must use a third-party service to do so.The three third-party rent reporting services are William Paid, Rental Karma, and Rent Reporters.

, All three services generally work the same: you submit and verify your payments to the reporting service, and then they send the information to the credit bureaus. The major difference is cost.


Rent reporters is free for the first thirty days,and then costs $9.95 per month. Rental Karma is free, and William Paid is free but only if you pay your rent via electronic funds transfer. If you pay with cash or credit card, the fee is 2.95% of the rental amount.
Visit the websites for each of these services to register or to learn more.

, While creditors will see rent tradelines on your account, it currently does not affect the main credit score, which is known as the FICO score. It does, however, affect your Vantage Score, which is another type of credit score that your creditors will often take into account.

Know the difference between your credit report and credit score.,
Take steps to improve your credit score.",How to Get Your Credit Report for Free2," All three reporting agencies report the same type of information on their reports:Identifying Information – Your names, address, social security number, date of birth, and places of employment.
Credit Accounts – These include mortgage accounts and home equity loans, revolving accounts (credit cards), and installment accounts, where the amount and term of payment are fixed, such as car or student loans. The payment history for each account will be recorded for 81 months (or more in the case of TransUnion). Satisfactory and negative accounts will be reported separately, with negative accounts usually reported first.
Credit Inquiries – Hard inquiries occur when you apply for a loan and authorize a lender to ask for your report. These inquiries negatively impact your credit score if there are too many in a short period. Soft inquiries are when a creditor orders your report in order to send you a “pre-approved” offer. Soft inquiries do not impact your credit score.
Public Record and Collection items – This includes bankruptcies, foreclosures, lawsuits, wage attachments, liens, judgments, and information on overdue debt from collection agencies.

, The first thing to do with your credit report is to scroll through it to be sure there is no inaccurate information. This will help to protect your credit score and to prevent identity theft. Make sure you check:Name – There should be no names listed other than your own.
Address – Be sure the only addresses listed are places you have lived. If another address appears, it may be a sign of identity theft.
Credit Accounts – The report will list all your present and past credit accounts, along with information regarding whether payment has ever been late, and if so, how late. Make sure all accounts belong or belonged to you, and check to be sure any negative information is correct.
Public Records Information – Check to see if your report lists any delinquent accounts, bankruptcies, foreclosures, lawsuits, wage attachments, liens, or judgments, be sure they are accurate. This sort or information can devastate your credit score, so be sure it is accurate if reported.

, You can inform reporting companies that you think information is inaccurate via their websites while reviewing your report, or you can write the companies. They must investigate the disputed item and forward your dispute to whoever provided them the information. You should also report the inaccurate information to the creditor in question, otherwise they may report it again and it will reappear on your credit report. If the reporting agency refuses to remove the disputed item, you can ask that a statement of your dispute be included in all future credit reports.Equifax – You can start an online dispute here, call them at 866-349-5191, or write them at: Equifax Information Services, LLC; P.O. Box 740256; Atlanta, GA 30348.Experian – You can start an online dispute here or write them at Experian; P.O. Box 4500; Allen, TX 75013.TransUnion – You can start an online dispute here, call them at 800-916-8800, or write them at TransUnion LLC; Consumer Dispute Center; P.O. Box 2000; Chester, PA 19022., If you do find inaccurate information, it may be a sign of attempted identity theft. To safeguard your credit, contact Experian, TransUnion, or Equifax to put 90-day fraud alerts on your accounts. These alerts will inform lenders and creditors that they need to take extra precautions to verify your identity before issuing any more credit. You only need to contact one agency, and they will tell the other two to put alerts on your accounts., Your credit score is a number that lenders use to determine your eligibility for loans or credit cards, and it is calculated using your credit history. One website describes it this way: ""If credit was a term paper, the score would be your grade at the top and the report would be the feedback your professor wrote about how well you performed on the back.""If viewing your report online, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion will all give you the option to pay to view your credit score. Scores are as follows:


600 or less – This qualifies as bad credit, meaning you will find it difficult to secure credit for a car loan or mortgage. You will probably only qualify for a secured credit card, which requires a deposit before you can make charges, much like a debit card.
600-700 – This is average credit. You will qualify for loans and credit cards, but with higher rates and worse terms
700+ – You have good credit and will be approved for most loans with competitive rates and also by most card companies, so long as you don’t have too many credit card accounts or too much debt.
780+ – This high rating requires a history of at least 5 years of on time payments, along with a mix of debt – credit cards, student loans, mortgage, etc. You should be able to get top rates on loans and any of the best credit cards.

, The simplest ways to improve your credit score are to pay your debts on time and to reduce your debt to total credit ratio on your revolving debt (credit cards) to 20% or less. You can do this by either paying down your balances or obtaining more credit.

, Each agency has a different procedure for requesting and obtaining your report.


Equifax: Request your report online, by calling: 800-685-1111 or by writing to Equifax Disclosure Department, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374. When writing, be sure to include your name, social security number, current and previous addresses, date of birth, and telephone number.

Take your cash.",How to Get a Cash Advance Through an ATM," Most credit cards have some sort of cash advance option, but you may not be able to get one if you're behind on your payments. Make sure your account is in good standing before attempting to get a cash advance.Check your statement online to make sure you haven't missed a payment or reached your borrowing limit. If either of these is a concern, you likely won't be able to get a cash advance.;
, Your bank or credit card company needs to authorize you to withdraw cash from an ATM using your credit card. Call your bank or credit card company's customer service department and ask how to start that process.


Most cards automatically offer the option, but some either do not offer it or set restrictions.
For example, some cards end the cash-advance option once your balance reaches a certain limit.You may be able to get this restriction removed by calling customer service and asking. Again, this is more likely if your account is in good standing and you don't have late payments on your record.

, People sometimes try to use a PIN they’ve set up on their other cards, but you need to know the PIN for this particular credit card. Make sure you know the correct PIN before attempting to withdraw cash. Too many wrong attempts could freeze your account.

, Many credit cards come with preset PINs that users never get around to resetting. If you've forgotten the original PIN, call the customer service department and ask about how to reset it.This usually involves dialing an automated 800-number and changing your PIN over the phone.
The automated system may ask you to enter your existing pin to make the change. If you don't know your existing PIN, ask a customer service representative to send a new PIN to you in the mail.
Note that it may take 7-10 days before you receive it. If you know you'll need a cash advance soon, inquire about your PIN at least two weeks in advance.

, Read through your account agreement before withdrawing any cash. You should understand the costs involved before taking action. You may be able to do this by logging into your account and searching on the website for your bank or credit card company.


Standard terms for cash advances may include fees of 3-5% of the amount withdrawn., Find out what interest rate you'll have to pay on your cash advance, when it starts accruing, and how often it will accrue. Make sure you'll be able to pay the interest before you take out the advance.Median annual interest rates for cash advance on most credit cards is currently around 24%. Generally, the cash advance rate is 5%-6% above the rate of purchases.Interest on cash advances often begins accruing immediately. Even if you pay off the advance as soon as possible, you may not be able to avoid paying at least some interest., Always ask if your next payments will go straight toward your higher-interest balances. If not, the cost of your cash advance may become punitive.Pay off cash advance balances as soon as possible. The high interest rates on them mean the debt can quickly grow well beyond the amount you took out as an advance.

, Look for one associated with your bank. Otherwise, you might get charged a fee of $2-$5 by both your bank and the out-of-network ATM.


Once again, log into your account and browse the website. There should be a tool you can use to locate a nearby ATM.If you’re abroad, search the website for foreign affiliations that offer fee withdrawals. You can find these relationships with many European and South American nations. They can save you a lot of money for both debit and cash advance withdrawals.

, Insert your credit card and enter your PIN. The menu of choices should include a cash advance option. Enter the amount of money you want as your cash advance.

, If there will be any extra fees for your transaction, the ATM will ask whether you accept them or not. To receive your cash, you will need to accept these routine fees.

, After you've accepted any fees, the ATM should give you the cash you asked for. Make sure to finish up the transaction and take back your credit card before leaving the ATM. Otherwise, the next person who visits the machine might be able to take out further advances on your card.

Learn how your credit score is calculated.,
Know how your credit score influences loans.",How to Improve Your Credit Score1," There are three national credit bureaus TransUnion, Equifax and Experian that calculate your credit score, and your score can differ depending on the agency, as they may have differing information about your credit history.There are five major components to your credit score. Each of them is weighted differently.Payment history (35%) — The most important component of your credit score is your payment history. Do you pay your bills on time? Do you have a history of late payments? If so, how late? Have you ever been turned over to collections? You can expect that late payments will deduct points from your score.
Amounts owed (30%) — What's your overall debt load? If you've taken on too much debt, then your score could suffer.
Length of credit history (15%) — How long is your record when it comes to managing credit? If you're brand new to the scene, then lenders will view you as a risky borrower when compared against someone who's been paying off debt for decades.
New Credit (10%) — If you've just taken out a bunch of new loans and/or opened credit card accounts recently, your score is going to take a hit.
Types of credit (10%) — A healthy mix of debt (a mortgage, a credit card, and a car loan) is viewed a little more favorably than debt consisting entirely of credit cards. However, you don't want to open a new credit account just to have ""balance."" Instead, focus on the other components of your score.;
, When you are looking to take out a loan, perhaps for a mortgage or to buy a car, lenders are going to look at your credit score to help them determine if you are a good risk— meaning, you will pay back the loan. They will also use your credit score to help them determine the the interest rate on a loan. If you have a high credit score, you will likely qualify for lower interest rates.A low score may mean a higher interest rate, or even being denied a loan.

Different lenders may use industry-specific scores. For instance, a credit card company may look at your FICO Bankcard Score, or an auto lender may order your FICO Auto Score, to give them a more specific look at your relevant credit information.When applying for a personal loan, student loan, or mortgage, your credit score from all three bureaus may be examined."

, You can avoid fees by using your bank’s ATM, but most machines will allow you to check your balance for free.

, Your “PIN” stands for personal identification number, a four-digit number you should have set up when you opened your account. Then, look for the menu that gives you options. Scroll through these options until you find one that includes the word “balance.”

, Then, you will be able to go back and make a withdrawal or print that balance.

, Ask for a receipt. Your checking balance will be printed onto your receipt for your records.

Check your bank balances frequently.",How to Withdraw Cash from an Automated Teller Machine," This way you will avoid having to pay processing fees. Many banks belong to a large network so you can check on their website to find out which ATMs will not incur a processing fee.;
, If you have children in your car it is much easier to use a drive-through ATM. If you are walking up to a drive-through, watch out for cars.

, Look for a diagram on the ATM to show you how to insert your card. The machine will not accept your card or will send it back out if you insert it the wrong way. Then you will know the correct direction to insert it.

, In the U.S., you will usually be offered a choice of English or Spanish.

, This is the number you would have given your bank when you opened your checking account. If you forgot it, you will have to call your bank. Then touch or press Enter or Go.

, The ATM will ask you if you want to withdraw from your checking or savings account if you have both. Some ATMs will offer preset amounts called ""Fast Cash"" where you can select $20, $40, $60, etc.

, For example, if you want to withdraw $20 you would type 20.00 and press or touch ENTER or Confirm. Remember that most ATMs only give cash in increments of $20, so don't request $25, $65, etc.

, The cash will come out of a slot usually located in the lower left hand corner of the ATM. If you do not have enough money in your checking account there will be a message stating this on the screen.

, This could range from $1 to $5.

, It is always a good idea to request a receipt and put it in your wallet until you have the chance to record the transaction in your checkbook., Always count your cash to make sure you received the correct amount. If it is incorrect you will have to go into the bank during regular business hours to correct the problem.

, This is a good opportunity to check balances, make transfers between checking and savings accounts or to make a deposit if your ATM offers these features. Touch or press Yes or No when the screen asks if you want to make another transaction.

, Remember to record the amount you withdrew into your checkbook or however you keep track of your checking account balances. You can then toss out the receipt unless you need it for tax purposes.

, Be particularly careful in airports and bus and train stations. Politely ask the person to stand back farther, or you could find another ATM.

, This way hidden cameras installed by thieves will not be able to read the numbers you type in. Beware of card slots that look like they have been tacked onto the ATM., Try not to use them late at night and limit your visits to as few times per week as possible. ATMs found in gas stations, grocery and convenience stores and kiosks have been found to have had fraudulent card reading devices more often than those located outside of banks.

, This is the best way to guard against theft and fraud. Notify your bank immediately if you notice any withdraws that you did not make. You will not be liable beyond the first $50 if you report the fraud within 2 days and no more than $500 if you report ATM fraud within 60 days."

Chose ATMs that are well-monitored and well-lit.,
Be aware of your surroundings.,
Minimize your time at the ATM.,
Protect your PIN.,
Store your money quickly and securely.",How to Safely Use an ATM1," Visit an ATM that is in a well-lighted area, or one that is monitored by surveillance cameras or security personnel. This is true of both indoor ATMs and drive-up ATMs. If possible, try to use during daylight hours.


Drive up ATMs are often safer than walk-up ATMs because of the privacy and safety of your vehicle and locked doors.;
, Before using your card, be vigilant and look around for anyone who may arouse your suspicion. If you feel the least bit apprehensive, avoid using that particular ATM and search for a safer option.If using a drive-up ATM, keep your engine running, keep your car doors locked, and keep all windows rolled up (except the one you are using).
At a walk-up ATM, always lock your car doors and take your keys with you. Never leave the car running.
Some ATMs require that you use your card to open the door to gain access to the ATM. Avoid letting anyone follow in behind you, and make sure the door is completely closed behind you when in the vestibule.

, Prepare all transactions before going to the ATM. Have your card ready so you won’t have to fumble around with your purse or your wallet. Also, if you’re making a deposit, have all checks endorsed and have the envelope sealed if you’re using one., Never share your PIN information with bank personnel, strangers, or anyone not associated with the account. When typing in your PIN, use your free hand to cover the keyboard. Some ATMs come equipped with screening devices but you can never be too safe., When withdrawing money from an ATM, be sure to place your card, money, and receipt in a secure place such as your wallet or purse before leaving the ATM. Discreetly count your cash to ensure you have the correct amount and store it quickly."

Request your credit report and score from the three national credit bureaus.,
Dispute items on your credit report that are incorrect.",How to Improve Your Credit Score2," The contact information for TransUnion, Equifax and Experian can be obtained online at their websites or from the Credit Info Center. The first thing you need to do is know where you are now, in order to fix any errors and determine where you need to improve.The information on the credit report is the data used to develop the credit score, so ensuring the information is correct is critical.
You can obtain one free credit report per year from each of the three agencies. Therefore you should request one report every four months so you can continually monitor your reports. Your credit history is free but you may have to pay a small cost to get your actual credit score. Some banks and credit unions offer credit score information to their customers for free.Many services that advertise that they will give you a free credit report or score are scams. They will stand there between you and the credit companies in order to harvest your data and then sell the data to marketing firms.
You're considered to be a poor risk if you have a credit score under 620., You will have better luck if you deal directly with the vendor who reported the incorrect information than depending on the credit bureaus to take your word for it. For example, perhaps you paid off a car loan but this was never reported to the bureaus as paid by your bank. The bank should then report the correction.


For other types of reporting errors such as fraudulent use of your identity, provide all the forms of proof that you have to the bureaus, such as cancelled checks, stamped invoices, police reports, etc. Put everything in writing and follow up at least once per week by phone with the bureaus until the mistakes are corrected on your report.If you have some late payments showing on your credit report, these can really hurt your score. Collections, judgments and tax liens are devastating. You can try to negotiate with the entity that reported the collections, etc., for removal of such negative notations.
Be aware that unlike what you may have heard or read elsewhere, getting negative information removed from your report is not an easy thing to do. Be persistent, factual and patient.

Make a budget and stick to it.,
Get out of debt.,
Apply for a secured credit card.,
Refinance loans as appropriate.,
Contact the lender if you cannot make payments on time.,
Build up different types of credit.,
Meet with a credit counseling agency.",How to Improve Your Credit Score3," Creating a budget, either written or online, will help you get rid of your debt, improve your credit, and stay out of debt. While the credit bureaus won't see your budget, it will see the good results of your sticking to it., Getting rid of as much of your debt as you can is the first and most important step in improving your credit. Make a list of all debts and prioritize which ones to pay off first.


Try the avalanche technique. To pay your debts off as quickly as possible, start by paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. Continue to pay off your debts, working your way down from the highest interest rates to the lowest.
You can also try the snowball technique. With this method, you pay off your smallest debt first and work your way up. This is not always the most efficient way to pay off your debts in terms of saving money, but the sense of accomplishment that comes with successfully paying off a debt, even a small one, can help motivate you to keep at it.
To remove the temptation, ""retire"" of some of your credit cards as you pay them off. Too much credit can be a bad thing. Closing credit accounts can have a negative effect on your credit score; a better solution is to pay off excess cards and stop using them without closing the account. Cut up the card so you won't be tempted to use it.

, If you are having trouble getting credit due to a poor credit score, or you are a first timer, apply for a secured credit card from your bank. This type of card uses money in your savings account as security. This is an easy way to establish a great credit history.)

, Note that ""paying off"" loans increases your score. Oddly enough, occasionally refinancing your mortgage and trading in cars with loans on them ""pays off"" loans, too. If you do refinance, do it for no points and a lower rate.

, If you experience a job loss or other misfortune, contact your lenders right away. The worst thing you can do is ignore them. Explain your financial situation and agree on a new payment schedule that you can manage. Get the agreement in writing and ask them to include a note that your payments will not be reported as late.

, A ""healthy mix"" of different types of credit builds up your score better than simply one type. For example, you might have a car loan, mortgage or line of credit and a credit card.


Let's say two people have $10,000 total in total credit each, and both are making timely payments. One has only one credit card. The other has a credit card, a car payment and a bank line of credit (overdraft protection). The second person's score will often be much better than the first one's.

, If you need any kind of advice to help get out of debt and improve your credit history, find a find a low or zero cost agency to help you. There might be free services available from your employer, military base, credit union, housing authority, or a local branch of the U.S. Cooperative Extension.Beware of for-profit companies that charge you a fee and promise to have all or most of your debts forgiven. Even if they pull it off, your credit score will plummet.

"
"
Pay your bills on time, regularly.,
Reduce your debt to credit ratio.,
Resist responding to ""pre-approved"" credit card offers.,
Take advantage of 0% interest offers.,
Be stable.,
Age is another personal characteristic that the credit bureaus factor into their ratings.",How to Improve Your Credit Score4," This is absolutely essential to better your credit score. Each late payment dings your credit score and presents a picture of unreliability. You must determine that, going forward, you will be paying your bills on time. The biggest chunk of your credit score is based on your payment history.


Never bounce a check. This along with late payments will stay on your credit report for seven years. Ask your bank for a small amount of reserve credit that will cover any “insufficient funds.”
Pay at least the minimum amount due each month plus $10. Make sure the payment arrives at least one day before the due date.
Keep in mind that late medical bills and apartment rent are generally not reported to the credit bureaus (although you do need a place to live).
It's much easier to keep track of due dates if you pay your bills online through your bank. Then you can schedule payments for any date even if it's not due for a few months. Plus you’ll have written proof that the payment was made on time, and you won’t have to worry about delays in the mail.

, The next big chunk of your score after your credit history is determined by the balance on your available credit. Seek to keep your balance for each card at approximately 30 percent of the limit, or less. This means that if your credit card limit is $1000, you should aim at having a balance of not more than $300.


Ask for an increase in your credit limit for the cards you currently have if you have used over 30% of the current limit. But don’t spend it!
Having high available debt and low indebtedness helps a lot. In other words, if you have lots of available credit (credit cards you don't use), and little or manageable debt, that looks better than being in hock up to your eyeballs, or just having no established credit at all.
If you pay off your credit cards in full anyway, consider paying them off a day or two before the billing cycle is closed (check online or on your statement for the day, and the current total). That way, your bill will show a very small or even negative amount, which gets reported to the credit scoring institutes. This increases your credit score up to 50 points (if everything else is unchanged).

, These come by mail or are sent to you online. It's easy to think, ""What can it hurt to apply? They say I'm already approved."" The reality is that each time one of the national credit bureaus receives an inquiry from a credit card company, your score goes down a few points.


This includes store card accounts; the less you have, the better.
The fact that frequent checking harms your score also means that you need to avoid checking your score compulsively.

, It can be to your advantage to transfer a current balance to a 0% interest card for a period of time, sometimes as long as a year. But don't close the old account. Your credit history looks better to the credit bureaus if you have long-standing, established accounts. This looks good even if many of your accounts are never used anymore.


Taking advantage of these 0% offers outweighs the disadvantage of the credit card company making an inquiry to the credit bureaus.

, There are several ways to impress the stability of your life on a credit score reviewer. While these may seem less important than other factors, it all helps to raise your score:


Buy your own home. Owning a home is viewed as considerably better than renting one. Although affordability of housing has changed in recent years, owning a home is still within the reach of many who save regularly and spend within their means.
Avoid moving around a lot. If you physically reside at the same address for a long time it is better for your credit history than if you move frequently.
Get married. If you examine two people with very similar credit histories, the one who is married will have a markedly higher credit score than the single person. Strange, but true!

, Older is better. Even though you cannot magically increase your age, it is nice to know that as time goes by, your credit score automatically improves.
