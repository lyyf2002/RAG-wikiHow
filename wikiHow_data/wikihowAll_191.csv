Choose bank ATMs over non-bank locations.,
Don’t re-enter your PIN if the ATM swallows your card.,
Look for card skimmers.,
Be aware of cash trapping scams.",How to Safely Use an ATM2," ATMs at banks usually have better surveillance and so avoid tampering by criminals. It is easier for criminals to rig non-bank ATMs at locations like the grocery store, shopping mall, or convenience store., Criminals can insert a blocking device into the card slot which causes your card to jam. Once you re-enter your PIN, the criminals will have access to both your lodged ATM card, and you PIN. When you leave, the criminals will then remove the blocking device and make withdrawals from your account.Criminals will also pose as “good Samaritans” who suggest you re-enter your PIN, or will offer to hold down the cancel button while you enter your PIN. In reality, they’re attempting to memorize your PIN number.

, Card skimmers are devices that are added to the ATM to capture personal information including your account number, PIN, and account balance. They are usually mounted on the side of the machine or right on top of the card entry slot, and resemble normal card slots or scanners. Look for duplicate card scanners or suspicious labels that say “card cleaner” or “slide card here first.”, Criminals place a thin sleeve or other device that will trap your cash when it is dispensed from the cash dispenser. Your transaction will appear to be normal, but you will not receive your cash. Once you walk away (either to alert the bank or out of frustration), the thieves will remove the device and steal your money. If you have a friend nearby, send them for assistance. Otherwise, leave the scene and immediately contact your financial institution.


Avoid using your cell phone while at the ATM. This may put you in a more dangerous situation.

Retrieve your money, receipt, and card.",How to Safely Use an ATM3," You can use your debit or credit card at any ATM owned by your banking institution without charge. Your bank card may also be used at ATMs owned by other financial institutions, but there are often fees associated with these transactions. Not only will the ATM operator charge a fee, but your bank may also. Try to choose an ATM that is operated by your financial institution to avoid fees.


Charges by the ATM operator can range anywhere from $1.50 to $10 per transaction in certain locations.Charges from your bank can range from $1.50 to $3.50 per transaction.

, The insertion slot is usually labeled and surrounded by lights. Look for pictures on the ATM machine that demonstrate the proper way to insert your card. If inserted incorrectly, the machine may not read your card.Some machines require you to insert and extract the card in order for it to be read by the machine. Others will pull the card into the ATM and will not return it until your transaction is complete.

, The machine will prompt you to select a language depending on the country in which the machine is located. Press the button that corresponds to your desired language. The machine will sometimes save your preference for future use so you don’t have to repeat this step again., An ATM pin is a 4-digit code that is used to confirm a user’s identity and allow access to banking transactions. This has to be set up prior to using your bank card at an ATM. If you know your 4-digit PIN, use the numeric keypad to enter it, and then press “enter”.Simply press the “clear” button if you make a mistake while entering your PIN.
Always make sure to cover your PIN entry so others can’t gain access to your account.
Make sure you are entering the correct PIN number for your card. There’s a chance that you may be locked out of your account if you enter the incorrect PIN number too many times.

, The ATM will prompt you to choose the bank account from which you want to make all transactions. Select the desired account. For example, if you have both a checking and savings account at your financial institution, you’ll have to select your desired account., The type of transactions vary from machine to machine, but the most used transactions are withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries.A withdrawal is when a customer chooses a set amount of money to have pulled from their account of choice, and dispensed directly from the ATM.
A deposit is when the ATM accepts cash and/or checks to add as a credit to the customer’s account of choice.
Balance inquires allow the user to view the current available balance of funds in their account of choice.

, Use the keypad to enter the numerical value of the funds that are being withdrawn or deposited to the ATM and press “enter”. If you are withdrawing, make sure your requested amount doesn’t exceed your available balance.Most ATMs will only allow you to enter funds in increments of 10s and 20s. Except for when transferring funds between accounts or making bill payments, generally avoid trying amounts that involves coinage or are less than $20.
When making deposits, some ATMs require envelopes. Be sure to read the on-screen directions to ensure you are properly inserting cash and checks.

, If withdrawing cash, your cash will be dispensed once your transaction is finalized. Discreetly count your money to ensure you received the correct amount. The ATM will ask you if you require any other transactions. Press “no” (unless an additional transaction is required). When prompted for a receipt, press “yes”. Retrieve your receipt and bank card to finalize your transaction.Don’t forget to retrieve your bank card! This is the most important step in maintaining the safety of your account.
Never leave your receipt at an ATM. Always take it with you to guard against the unauthorized use of your card."

Follow up on your deposit.",How to Deposit Cash with USAA1," USAA has a number of locations nationwide where you can manage your USAA accounts, primarily using an ATM. Click on ""ATMs and Locations"" under the ""Help"" menu to get started.By default the map shows all USAA locations nationwide. You can zoom in and out on the map.
Clicking on a dot on the map brings up specific information about that location and the services available there.;
, On the USAA ATM locator page, limit your search results to ATMs where you can deposit cash. You can put in a city or zip code as well, or just click on dots from the map. There aren't many ATMs where you can deposit cash.If you frequently have cash deposits, you may want to check this map before you open a checking account with USAA. There are large areas of the country where no cash deposit-taking ATMs are available, including the Pacific Northwest, most of the Midwest, and parts of the South.

, If you live in an area where a cash deposit-taking ATM is nearby, you have a relatively easy way to deposit cash with USAA. These ATMs will take up to 30 bills at a time, and don't require any deposit slips or envelopes.Double-check that the machine counted your cash correctly, and keep your receipt.

, Depending on the location where you made your deposit, there may be a hold on your funds. There should be information on your receipt telling you when your funds will be available.Check your USAA account within 24 hours to make sure your deposit is accurately reflected in your account.

Your name, address, bank name and address, and your account number should all be on the deposit slip already. Before depositing cash, check to ensure this information is present and correct.If the information is not present or incorrect, talk to a representative of the issuing bank.
If you did not receive deposit slips when opening your account, contact the bank where you have the account. Many banks offer unnumbered deposit slips in their lobbies (in which case you will have to fill in your account number manually).;
, There should be a space to the left of the deposit slip for you to write the date of your deposit. This will help the transaction proceed smoothly and prevent confusion., Locate the line on which you are expected to total your cash. Typically, the cash deposit line is the first line on the right side of the deposit slip. It has a small black triangle next to it, along with the word “CASH.” Total the amount of cash you’re depositing and write it on this line.If you’re depositing checks along with cash, you can write the totals of your checks on the subsequent lines.

, When you’re done filling the slip out, add up your cash and check deposit amounts. Write the grand total at the bottom of the deposit slip. For instance, if you deposited two checks worth $50 and $100 in cash, you’d write $200 at the bottom of the deposit slip."

Don't confuse credit cards with debit cards.,
Don't take out a bank loan to establish credit.,
Don't open more lines of credit than you need.,
Don't get hooked into a credit repair scam.",How to Establish Credit," For someone who's looking to establish credit from an absolute blank slate (or start repairing a bad credit history), a ""secured"" credit card is generally the best bet. These credit cards (which are available from most local banks and credit unions) work basically the same way as a collateral-secured loan — you give the credit issuer a certain amount of money, and in turn the credit issuer gives you a line of credit that you can spend as you please.


Because these sorts of credit cards essentially come with a ""security deposit,"" they're often some of the easiest credit cards to get — the credit issuer isn't worried that it won't get its money back because you've already given them collateral.
Your credit issuer may still ask for evidence of your financial history when you apply for a secured card. Even if you've never had a line of credit before, you can still make a case for yourself as a responsible candidate by presenting evidence that you've been prompt about paying off your major expenses. For example, if you've been making utility, rent, or car payments, showing the bank your receipts or cancelled checks used to make the payments can demonstrate that you've been meeting your responsibilities.;
, To get a good credit history, you need to use your credit! Once you have your new secured credit card, start using it to make small purchases, like groceries, meals, movie tickets, and so on. Track your spending carefully and never let it get out of hand. A good rule of thumb is not to spend any more than about half of your credit line at any one time — however, most financial commentators will agree that less than 30% is even better.Having lots of outstanding debt can impact your credit score, even if you're eventually able to pay it back.
Once you start getting the bills for your credit card, pay each one off in full as soon as you can. By doing this, you're establishing a history of prompt repayment. Future credit issuers love this — it proves that you're reliable about paying your bills back and that you don't typically spend more than you can afford.

, After a time period of responsibly spending and paying back your bills with a secured line of credit, you may be able to qualify for an unsecured (ordinary) credit card. Sign up for one of these cards at the same bank that issued your secured card and start using it to make small, responsible purchases just as you've been doing with your other card.


These credit cards are slightly more risky for banks to loan because they don't require you to put down collateral, which means that there's a chance that they won't get their money back. Thus, it's in their interest to give these cards only to people who they trust to be smart with their money. Since you now have a demonstrated history of paying back your debt, it should be easier for you to get an unsecured card, although the credit limit may be low initially.

, Banks aren't the only entities that can issue credit. A wide variety of businesses (for instance, department stores, airlines, gas/petrol companies, and many more) issue their own credit cards. Often, these store cards come with a special one-time signing bonus (like 10% off your purchase) or the ability to earn ""rewards points"" towards in-store credit.


If a business that you frequently use issues credit cards, consider signing up for one when you make a major purchase, as these cards count towards your credit history just like bank-issued cards.
You'll generally want to avoid signing up for more than just a few store credit cards, however. Having many different credit card bills to pay raises the risk that you'll eventually forget one. Plus opening many lines of credit can sometimes damage your credit reputation., Once you have multiple lines of credit, you'll want to continue with your habit of paying off your debts as quickly as possible. If you can, pay off your credit card bills as soon as you get them or by the due date. If, for any reason you can't afford to completely pay off your debt one month, pay as much as you reasonably can. This will help you avoid the long-term expenses of interest payments on credit card debt (which, compared to basic personal loans, are usually high).Try to avoid the dangerous situation of amassing so much credit debt that you can only afford to make the minimum payment each month. This will cost you lots of money in interest payments in the long term (and will usually hurt your credit score). In this case, you may be in need of credit counseling services (see Part 2 for more information).

, Being able to make a major purchase like a car or a refrigerator with one lump payment upfront is very convenient, but in doing this you may rob yourself of a great opportunity to boost your credit score. Instead, try opting for a store financing plan. (Most stores that sell high-priced products will allow you the option to pay them off over time rather than pay the entire cost up-front.)


Keep the money you would have used to make the lump-sum purchase separate from your normal funds so that you'll still have enough to make the entire purchase when the time comes. When you get the first monthly bill, pay off the entire cost of the product. Since this sort of financing plan is technically a loan, paying it off immediately looks great on your credit history.Paying off your purchase immediately also keeps you safe from interest charges — many sellers will have a special ""interest free"" repayment window at the start of the loan (often 90 days).

, Perhaps the single most important thing you can do to establish good credit is to make a point to pay back all your credit card bills by their due dates. This is a great way to build your credit in the long-term. On the other hand, missing payments or frequently opting to make only the minimum payment on your debt makes it appear as if you can't afford to maintain your current level of debt, which will make it difficult to get more credit in the future.

, It's important to remember that it's not just your credit card bills that you'll need to pay on time — ordinary expenses like rent, utilities, car payments, and so on are also important to your credit score. Some vendors that you pay for these expenses don't regularly report your credit activity to credit agencies. However, if one of your bills becomes delinquent, they usually will report this.Thus, while paying your monthly expenses on time won't usually be useful for credit purposes after getting your first secured credit card, failing to meet these expenses will have negative consequences for your credit.

, When it comes to your credit, knowledge is power. Consumers have a wide range of legal rights and protections when it comes to navigating the world of credit. Knowing your legal protections can make it much easier to build healthy credit and avoid common pitfalls, so visit FederalReserve.gov or FDIC.gov to find complete information on this subject.As just one example, consumers are legally protected from being discriminated against based on their race, sex, religion, and much more. In addition, consumers also have legal protections against credit card companies that attempt to mislead them or hide information from them.

, One of the most important pieces of knowledge you have in your arsenal as a consumer is that you can legally request one free credit report per year from each of the major credit reporting agencies. These reports can help you keep track of long-term trends in your credit and can alert you to any negative factors you may be unaware of. See How to Check Your Credit Score for more information (or visit AnnualCreditReport.com).


The three credit reporting agencies are Experian, Transunion, and Equifax. If you find an error in a report, contact the credit issuer to correct the mistake with the reporting agencies.

, Your relationship with your credit issuer is an important one. If you're on good terms with each other, you may get preferable interest rates and forgiveness policies in the event of minor mistakes. If you ever have any questions or concerns regarding your credit, don't hesitate to contact your credit issuer — nearly all will be more than happy to assist you. You may also want to contact your credit issuer to request line of credit increases or to renegotiate the terms of your repayment plan.


Contrary to many people's first instincts, your credit issuer is actually one of the first people you'll want to get in contact with if you anticipate that you'll have a hard time paying back an upcoming bill. Credit issuers want to keep you as a paying customer, so if you've been responsible so far, many will be willing to work out alternate repayment plans in the event of hardships. If you have an especially good history, this one-time anomaly may not even impact your credit.

, The best possible course of action for your personal credit is to never get into a situation where you have more debt than you can reasonably pay back. If, however, this does happen, you may want to enlist the services of a credit counselor. Credit counseling agencies are organizations that can help you manage out-of-control debt, work with your debtor to re-organize your payment schedules, and get your finances back in order.


While working with a credit counselor can damage your credit if you end up paying less than you owe, the damage is likely to be much less than if you default on your bills or declare bankruptcy, so it's almost always preferable to these alternatives.
Depending on your situation, this sort of help may be free or there may be a small fee attached.
For information on reputable credit counseling agencies near you, consult the website of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC), a non-profit organization set up to offer free-and low cost services to help with credit problems.Unfortunately, some credit counseling agencies are known to take advantage of troubled debt holders in their vulnerable state. Only work with reputable credit counselors accredited by major national organizations like the NFCC. See the ""avoiding scams"" in Part 3 for more information.

, Though they look almost identical and can both be issued by banks, credit cards and debit cards are two entirely different things. Debit cards don't operate on credit. In other words, when you make a purchase with a debit card, the money comes directly out of your checking account as if you've written a check for the purchase. No credit issuer is loaning you the money — you're paying with money that you already have.


For this reason, you can't usually use a debit card to build credit (unless your card has the optional feature to be used as a credit card.)

, If you stay on top of your credit card bills, credit cards are usually an easier and smarter way to build credit than personal loans. While paying off a loan on time is good for your credit, it's usually a waste of money to use it solely for this purpose. Loans require you to pay interest — on the other hand, it's usually possible to pay credit cards off in full without incurring interest if you use the earliest available repayment schedule.Thus, as long as you keep up your habit of paying off your credit card bills as quickly as possible, there's no real incentive to take out a loan for the purpose of building credit.
For major purchases, however (like homes and cars), loans are unavoidable, as you can't typically charge these sorts of purchases to credit cards. In these cases, simply pay back your loan as quickly as possible to minimize the amount of interest you pay.

, Having a few manageable lines of credit is a good thing. Having many lines of credit can be a very bad thing. As noted above, the more lines of credit you have, the harder it is to keep track of your payments. Worse still, if you get behind on your payments and get into the deadly habit of using one card to pay off another, you may quickly find yourself in a financial ""death spiral"" that's very hard to get out of.For these reasons, many credit agencies consider opening many lines of credit to be a ""warning"" sign for risky financial behavior, so this may cause a dip in your credit scores.

, While there are an abundance of fair, ethical credit counseling agencies available, some ""bad apples"" exist to take advantage of customers who are in dire financial straits. These agencies may promise a ""clean slate"" or an easy way out of credit troubles, but instead use exploitative and even illegal practices to profit from your situation, all while pushing you even deeper into debt. As a very general rule, if any sort of credit service seems ""miraculous"" or ""too good to be true,"" it's probably best not to trust it. Here are a few common ""danger signs"" to be on the lookout for — consult the website of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for more information:Agencies that make you pay them before they do any work for you.
Agencies that tell you to dispute parts of your credit report that you know are correct.
Agencies that tell you not to contact your creditors directly.
Agencies that tell you to lie to creditors or lenders or misrepresent your Social Security number (note that these are federal crimes).
Agencies that can't prove their affiliation with the NFCC or another similar national organization.

Locate a USAA Preferred ATM.,
Purchase a cashier's check or money order.,
Get a prepaid debit card.,
Maintain another account for cash deposits.,
Write a check from another account.",How to Deposit Cash with USAA2," While you can't deposit cash into a Preferred ATM, you can withdraw funds, check account balances, or move funds between accounts without accruing any ATM fees.Look for ATMs that have an ""Allpoint,"" ""MoneyPass,"" or ""PNC Bank"" logo. These are USAA Preferred ATMs.
If you find a Preferred ATM attached to a bank branch, you may want to consider opening an account at that bank. You can use that account for cash deposits and also manage your USAA account from the same location.

, Turning your cash into a cashier's check or money order is perhaps the easiest way to deposit cash with USAA. Money orders never cost more than a few dollars, and the funds will be available immediately.Once you get your cashier's check or money order, simply deposit it into your USAA account using your mobile banking app. Because the funds are guaranteed, they will be available in your account immediately.
One limit of this method is that you may be restricted to normal business hours when you want to purchase a check or money order.

, With a prepaid debit card, you may be able to reload it with cash around the clock.

, If you already have a checking account at a brick-and-mortar bank, you can deposit your cash into that account and then transfer the money to your USAA account. This typically isn't the easiest or most efficient way to deposit cash with USAA.While USAA doesn't charge any fees for incoming transfers, the other bank may charge a fee to initiate the transfer. Find out how much the transfer is going to cost you before you open an account, especially if you're going to have frequent cash deposits.
Hold times are another thing to keep in mind. Using this method may mean your funds aren't available in your USAA account for several days.

, If you have a friend or family member who has a checking account with a brick-and-mortar bank, they may be able to work out an arrangement with you. Deposit the cash in their bank account, then have them write you a check for the total.Once you get their check, you can deposit it using the USAA mobile banking app on your phone.

Use an online bank with a physical location.,
Use a money order.,
Transfer the funds online.,
Use a wire transfer service.",How to Deposit Cash2," Some online banks also offer walk-in locations where you can deposit cash. If you’re near enough to this physical location, depositing cash is similar to the process by which you’d deposit it at a traditional bank., Money orders are like checks, but they are guaranteed by a public or private service like Western Union or the Indian Postal Service. Visit the money order service of your choice, then pay for the money order. From there, deposit it according to the instructions prescribed by your bank.The specific process by which you can deposit a money order vary depending on the online bank you use.
Generally, you can scan or take a photo of the money order, then send the image to your online bank. In some cases, you might need to mail the money order to the bank.
Check your online bank’s policy regarding money orders before you get a money order.

, If you use an online bank as well as a traditional bank, make a deposit at your local branch of the traditional bank. Then, transfer the funds to your online bank over the internet. The specific method by which you can accomplish this varies depending on the banks you use.Generally, however, you’ll have to set up an account online with your traditional bank, then select an “electronic funds transfer” or some similar formulation. You will then be prompted to provide the routing number for the online bank you wish to transfer the funds to.
If you exclusively use an online bank, open a bank account at a local bank. Look for one with the lowest monthly fees.

, Wire transfer services allow you to move money electronically from one account to another. They are provided by most major traditional banks. To deposit cash into your online account using wire transfer services, deposit the cash at your traditional bank. Request a wire transfer and fill out the bank’s transfer form.Requirements for using wire transfer services vary from bank to bank.
Depositing cash in your online bank via wire transfer may result in a brief hold time before the money is available.
There are often fees involved in using a wire transfer service. Ask about these fees before depositing cash using a wire transfer.
If you exclusively use an online bank, the only way to move cash from the physical bank to your online bank is to open an account with a traditional bank. Look for one with the lowest monthly fees.

Put cash on a reloadable prepaid debit card.,
Deposit cash through an ATM.,
Do not send cash through the mail.",How to Deposit Cash3," Instead of depositing cash in a bank, purchase a reloadable prepaid debit card. This card works the same way a regular debit or credit card does, and allows you to make purchases up to the amount deposited on the card.The process by which you deposit cash onto the card depends on the terms of the card. Some cards allow customers to deposit cash at the checkout register of certain big box stores. Cards that were obtained at banks usually require you to add more money to the card at the issuing bank.
Before purchasing a reloadable prepaid debit card, ask the issuer how to deposit cash onto the card. If you find the process too difficult, consider another option for depositing cash.
Reloadable prepaid debit cards are available online, at big box stores, and at many banks.

, Automated teller machines (ATMs) are machines that distribute and, in some cases, receive cash so that you can access your bank account even when the bank is closed. Banks that are not linked to ATMs that allow deposits will not be able to accept cash deposits.Find a bank with access to a large ATM network. To find an online bank with a large ATM network, contact several banks and ask the bank representative, “Do you offer access to a large ATM network?” If the answer is “No,” look for another way to deposit your cash.
Most online banks do not accept cash deposits via ATM.
Cash deposited through an ATM might be put on hold for several days.

, While many banks – both traditional and online – allow you to deposit checks by mail, you should never send cash by mail. Most banks disallow this, but even if you encounter a bank that does, do not deposit money in this manner. The risk of your money getting lost is too great. Convert your money to a money order instead."

Some modern bank ATMs may only accept non-envelope deposits. See elsewhere in this article for information on making such deposits.
Your bank may not permit deposits at ATMs not affiliated with it. Check your financial institution’s policies.;
, This part of the process is exactly the same as when you withdraw cash.


Locate the “deposit” tab on the screen or corresponding button indicated by the screen (on older machines). If there is no deposit option, you’re out of luck on this ATM.

, Sign them on the back in the marked area.


Add “for deposit only” below your signature for added security. If you lose this endorsed check, it can only be deposited, not cashed.

, If you are using a slip from your checkbook, your name, address, and account number should already be on the check.


If you are using a blank deposit slip, like those available in a bank branch, fill out your name, address, and account number. Add the date to any type of deposit slip.
Enter the total amount of cash to be deposited on the marked line, and individually list checks in the provided slots on the front (and, if needed, back) of the slip.
Enter the total amount of all checks and cash to be deposited on the provided line.
You don’t need to sign a deposit slip when depositing funds into an ATM. A signature is only required when you seek cash back from a deposit made at a teller window.
You may want to sign your checks and prepare your deposit slip ahead of time, for convenience and safety. Limiting your time at the ATM is safer and less likely to annoy those in line behind you.

, Older machines may have a small door that you lift open to reveal deposit envelopes, while newer machines may just spit them out of a slot.


Even if you have your deposit organized into an envelope, transfer it to the one provided by the machine.
Make sure you insert all your checks, cash, and the deposit slip into the envelope. Seal it securely.
Write in any information, such as name, date, and the deposit amount, requested on the outside of the envelope (as indicated by labeled blank lines).
The ATM may ask you if you need more time while preparing your deposit. Press the indicated button to give yourself added time to get everything in order.

, The slot where you insert the envelope should be clearly marked and may be indicated by flashing lights. It may also be the same slot where you received your deposit envelope.


When prompted by the ATM, either before or after making the actual deposit, enter the total amount of your deposit. Write the total amount down on a scrap of paper beforehand if you need a reminder.
Take care to be accurate. The bank should be able to correct any discrepancies, but it is quicker and easier to get things right the first time.
Confirm that you want a receipt and keep it for your records, at least until you deposits clear.

, Deposits of cash or check by envelope are manually counted and entered into your account, so funds will not be available immediately.


A common wait time for fund availability from an ATM deposit is the second business day after the deposit. That is, if you deposit the funds on Monday, they will be available Wednesday. But, if you deposit them Sunday (not a business day), it will also be Wednesday. Banks are required to consider ATM deposits made by noon to be made that business day."

, Pay each credit card bill in full as soon as you receive it, so you do not establish yourself as a 'late' payer. It may be necessary to obtain a ""Secured"" credit card if your credit scores are already low or non-existent. Do your homework and research as some secured credit card companies check credit before approval and will actually decline you.


Set up automatic payments with your credit card company and/or bank. Most credit cards will allow you to set up automatic withdrawals from your checking account every month to pay for your credit card. This way, you won't risk forgetting about your payments and registering as a late payer, dropping your credit score. Automatic payments usually let you specify whether you want to:
Register to pay the monthly minimum. Credit cards will force you to pay a small amount every month or risk a penalty.
Register to pay the balance on the credit card. The balance on the credit card, or how much you owe, will usually vary from month to month. Make sure that you avoid an overdraft when doing this.
Register to pay a set amount every month. This set amount can be somewhere in between the monthly minimum and the balance payments.


Realize that this method might not work for everyone; if it doesn't, follow another way of establishing credit.

, This is also called a secured credit card. This is a program which many major banks will have, where you pay a deposit on a credit card (usually equal to the limit) in order to get a card even when you have less than perfect credit. Using this starter card, you can build credit.Just make sure that the card is reported to the major credit reporting companies.

, Many places asking for your credit score will also look at other information, like if you can keep down a job. If they see you're changing jobs every few months, then your credit score won't really be enough to help you: you'll look too risky. Keep down one job for a few years at a time to appear more stable. This will help you with things like getting a mortgage.


If you appear reliable, they may be willing to forgive a slightly less than ideal credit score.

, Much like the above, many places will look at your housing history. If you move too much, you're a risk. However, if you stay in one apartment or house, you seem much more reliable.

, Choose one that offers the lowest interest rate and if possible one that offers a cash back percentage on purchases you make. Try not to start a new credit card until you have at least okay credit, because each application counts against your score, as does being denied.


Apply for a major credit card, such as Visa, American Express, Discover, or Mastercard. These will help you move into the 700-score territory faster.
If you can't get a major credit card, think about getting a ""secured"" credit card, which works after you deposit money with an issuing bank. (Essentially, a debit card.)

, Lenders see bank accounts as signs of financial stability and consistent savings behavior. Given this, evidence of continuous use of checking and savings accounts increases your chances that a bank will offer you a credit card.


You shouldn't, however, just open accounts left and right, as this makes you look bad rather than good. Just have more than one and make sure that there's money in each of them.
Alternatively, contact your bank or credit union, open a charge account with them, and deposit a specific amount of money 'into' the account. This is called a pre-paid charge account.

, It will look better if the bill you are paying at the end of the month is a low one. Keep your outstanding debt as low as possible in order to improve your score even further.

, If you've done a good job of building an okay score and then find that you're very slightly late on a single payment, you may be able to get that late payment taken off your record by asking very nicely. If you have a good history with the entity you were late in paying, they may be willing to take it off if you ask.

, Having good credit over a long period of time will go a long way towards convincing lenders that you're a solid bet. Don't rush the process.

, Budget out how much money you have coming in, how much money you'd like to save, and what sorts of things you need to pay for on a monthly basis.


Having a budget is great even if you're not interested in fixing your credit. A budget will allow you to save more money, be prudent about what financial decisions you make, and — of course — fix your credit.
Budget out how much you can afford to spend rather than how much you'd like to spend. There's a difference. If you set aside $200 every month for discretionary purchases, a $600 flat-screen TV will have to wait three months before you can pull the trigger. Don't pull the trigger right away and be $400 in debt for two months.

, What's the good of having a budget if you don't really stick to it? If you say you're going to spend $120 on groceries every week, don't go over $120. It's simple to say and hard to do. But it's essential for a good credit score.

, Make sure that you do not charge more than you can actually afford to pay at the end of the month. Some illustrative examples:



Do use your credit card to pay for gas. If your income is $2,000 per month, and your gas expenses come out to $140 per month, you should be able to afford to pay off $140 on your credit card every month.

Don't use your credit card to pay for a $1,500 mattress. If your monthly income is $2,000, putting a $1,500 purchase on it right away is a bad, bad idea. You'll be paying it off for several months and could miss a payment.

, You should be able to make more than the minimum payment on the card, slowly working towards being able to pay it off entirely. If you can't afford to make more than the minimum payment, you aren't being financially responsible and have taken on too much debt.

, Approaching 70-75% of your credit limit or maxing out your cards frequently will look dangerous and irresponsible to lenders because it often is.Credit cards are a safety net, so leave a little extra room. Just like you wouldn't want an actual safety net the exact same size as your body, you don't want zero room for movement on your credit cards.

, If you don't know what your credit looks like, it'll be hard to fix it. You can get one free annual credit report through the government-run AnnualCreditReport.com. For your credit score, you will have to pay a nominal fee; they are not offered for free. When checking your report, make sure you:


Dispute any additional accounts that aren't yours or that you didn't open.
Dispute any reports of late payments that were in fact paid on-time.
Dispute any bankruptcies older than 10 years that are still listed as due even though you settled them in bankruptcy.
Dispute any negative information older than 7 years.

, Your FICO credit score will improve if you avoid one big balance on a single card and instead have several small balances on different cards.


This is because the FICO formula looks at the difference between your balances (how much you owe) and your limits (how much you can charge per month). A low balance-to-limit ratio makes for better credit score than a high balance-to-limit ratio.
Even if you pay your balance, a high balance-to-limit ratio is not ideal. If you spend $4,000 on a $5,000 limit, you've got a .8 ratio, which is pretty high. Shoot to get a .1 ratio, which means that you're spending 10% of your available limit.

, Don't let your credit cards sit there unloved. If you don't use your credit card at all, your credit score will go down. The credit score formula prefers to see a card that is getting regular use over a credit card that is lying fallow.

, You want your information reported to the major credit reporting companies, if possible. These are the ones lenders are most likely to check, so if you only have one credit card and it reports only to a small company, you're in trouble. This is where having more than one credit card or bank account, etc, can come in handy.

Acquire your ATM card.,
Verify that the card you received is one you applied for or requested.,
Sign the back of the card.,
Go to an automatic teller machine.,
Call your bank.,
Log in to your online account.,
Go to your bank.,
Make a purchase.,
Change your PIN number.",How to Activate Your Atm Card," Your bank will send your ATM card to you in the mail. Most banks will also send you a separate document that contains a temporary PIN number. Some banks send the PIN number first. When you get the information with your PIN number, your card should arrive within a few days.


Some banks don't send you a PIN number. Instead, they require you to either activate the card and choose a PIN number, or use the 3-digit security code on the back of the card to activate the card before choosing a PIN number.If you are getting a replacement card, your old PIN number will still work.;
, If you're not expecting an ATM card, contact your bank immediately to find out if the card you received is legitimate. Some banks will issue a new debit card if there was a problem, like potential fraud, associated with your existing debit card.If you did not request a new debit card, make sure to find out if you need the debit card. Make sure to read the fine print or contact the bank to make sure the debit card doesn't have hidden fees or that switching to a new debit card is required.Examine the card's expiration date. If the expiration date is approaching soon, contact your bank. This is often a sign of a fraudulent card.

, As soon as you receive your new debit card, sign the back of it. If this is a replacement debit card, or you received a temporary card, destroy those old cards now.Cut the card up so that the name and number cannot be identified. This helps protect your identity and information.

, Choose an ATM that is well-lit, situated in a visible location, and owned by your banking establishment. Insert your card, use your PIN or your temporary PIN, and follow the instructions on screen.Some banks may require you to go through an activation screen, while other banks may automatically activate the card when you enter the PIN. Others require you to do a balance inquiry.You may conduct transactions at ATMs that are second- or third-party owned once you activate your card, but they cannot perform the functions necessary to activate your card.

, Most banks provide a toll-free number you can use to activate your card. This number may be located on a sticker on your ATM card, in the letter mailed with your card, or on their website. Call the toll-free number. Give the information requested when prompted, which usually includes the last four digits of your social security number, zip code, and security code on your card., Many banks provide an activation service via the Internet. Log in and select the option to activate your card. Most online activation services require you to enter the security code on the back of your card.Some banks offer mobile apps that allow you to activate your card.You may have to have a preexisting online banking ID to use this option.

, Another way to activate your card is to take it to any branch of your bank. You can ask the bank attendant to activate the card for you., Some ATM cards allow you to make a purchase to activate the card. Use the card in the store, enter your PIN number, and the card will be activated., If your bank sent you a temporary PIN number and allows you to create your own, change your PIN number. Creating your own PIN number for your ATM card creates an additional level of security for your account. Memorize your new PIN number, and do not carry that number with you in your wallet."

Learn locations of ATMs associated with your bank.,
Find a bank that doesn't charge ATM fees.,
Use your phone to help you.",How to Avoid ATM Fees1," If you want to avoid ATM fees, the easiest way to do so is to use an ATM associated with your bank. If you have a nationwide bank, such as Chase Bank or Bank of America, you can find ATMs across the country.


Try to learn where ATMs associated with your bank are located. Some chain stores typically have ATMs associated with a certain bank. Walgreens, for example, usually has Chase ATMs in their stores. If you need cash while you're out, always be on the lookout for ATMs associated with your bank.One downside with a nationwide bank is that interest rates will not be as high as they would be with a local credit union.;
, Not all banks will penalize you for using an out of network ATM. If you habitually struggle to find the right ATM, consider switching to a bank that does not charge fees or that will reimburse you for ATM fees. The banks Ally and Schwab do not have ATMs of their own, so you will not be charged for using another bank's ATMs.Online banks and small credit unions frequently do not have ATM fees. However, you may still have to pay convenience fees charged by ATM owners., If you're struggling to find an ATM associated with your bank, use your phone to help. Many map applications have an ATM finder feature. You may also be able to download a digital map of nearby ATMs from your bank's website. If you're in a bind and need cash, use your phone to assist you before resigning yourself to pay a fee. If you only have to walk a few blocks to find the right ATM, it may be worth saving $3."

Apply to rent an apartment.,
Get added to an existing rental agreement.,
Request that companies report your monthly payments.,
Make your payments on time.",How to Build Credit Without Credit Cards1," When companies check your credit rating, it helps you to build credit. These inquiries show that there is interest in offering you credit. If you apply to rent an apartment under your own name, the rental company will most likely make an inquiry to the credit bureaus.Renting an apartment involves the risk that you might not pay or might damage the property. It also involves an obligation to pay on a regular basis, just like a credit card.
The company may also report whether you are paying each month. Those payments may show up on your credit history, helping you to build credit.
Rental companies and property managers do not have an obligation to report payments. Some may do so as part of their standard practices.Even if though don't they may be willing to if you ask them to do so. There is a cost for them to report, but also a benefit. When more people report, they can better evaluate future tenants’ applications.;
, If you live with other people and can't or don't want to move into your own apartment, make sure your name appears on the rental agreement.


Renting a room from a friend or sharing an apartment will not help you build credit if your name is not on the lease.
Contact the property manager or landlord and ask them to add your name.

, Everyone has recurring monthly bills. These include phone, cable, power, water, trash, and other such utilities. Your payment history for these bills can help to build your credit.


These companies rarely report your activity, unless you don't pay. But, some may do so if you request it.Call or write to the various companies that you make regular payments to, and ask if this is possible.
If you live with other people and split utility bills, it is a good idea to make sure your name is listed on at least one of them.

, Make sure to always pay your bills and pay them on time. Failure to do so may damage your credit.Companies will report any failure to pay your bills, even if you have not asked them to report your payments to credit bureaus. They will also report any payments that are very late.

Verify that the ATM accepts no-envelope deposits.,
Endorse and prepare your checks.,
Feed checks into the marked slot when prompted.,
Make sure that the total amount is correct and complete your transaction.,
Deposit cash into the appropriate slot according to the ATM’s limit.,
Find out when deposits will be credited to your account.",How to Use an ATM to Deposit Money2," This is increasingly becoming the standard in ATMs at bank branches, and it is becoming more common in other locations. Look for notices on the screen or on the machine itself.No-envelope ATMs usually have clearly-marked, separate slots for checks and cash.
Insert your card, enter your PIN, and follow the prompts to make a deposit. The ATM will verify at some point whether you can make no-envelope deposits.

, You will not need a deposit slip for a no-envelope transaction.


You may want to add up the total dollar amount of your check deposits beforehand, in order to compare to the total tabulated by the ATM. You will be able to go through deposited checks individually if there is a discrepancy.

, Many machines can read the checks regardless of orientation, but it can’t hurt to stack your checks neatly and facing in the same direction.


You do not need to feed the checks individually at most newer machines. The maximum number of checks you can feed at once should be displayed on the screen or machine; one national bank chain states a maximum of 30 checks at once., You should be able to go through checks individually and make corrections if needed.


Many machines offer the option of printing an image of the front of your check(s) on your receipt. Use this option if you’d like an added layer of proof of deposit for your records.
Rejected checks -- those with unreadable printing or handwriting, for instance -- should be returned to you at the end of your transaction. Contact the bank if this does not happen.

, One common maximum for a stack of cash is 50 bills.Again, the machine should be able to read cash in any direction, but a neat stack can only speed the process.
Unlike envelope deposits, where they can be deposited together, cash and checks will need to be deposited in separate transactions. Deposit one, indicate you’d like to make another transaction when prompted on the screen, then deposit the other.

, This will vary by financial institution.


One advantage of non-envelope cash deposits is that the money is immediately available in your account because it has been scanned and confirmed. Envelope cash deposits, on the other hand, need to be opened, counted, and entered. If you need to add funds to your account right away and don’t have access to a bank branch, a non-envelope cash deposit may be your best bet.
Check deposits will still require time to clear after being posted; one national bank considers non-envelope check deposits made by 8 pm to be posted that business day, and it should clear on the second business day after (posted Monday, cleared Wednesday, for example)."
"
Ask for cash back.,
Get cash in social situations.,
Go directly to your bank.",How to Avoid ATM Fees2," If you want to avoid an ATM fee, ask for cash back at the register. Many grocery stores and drug stores offer cash back. Big banks usually do not charge a fee when you're getting cash back. Simply pay with your debit card and select the cash back option on the screen.One downside to cash back is that you can only withdraw so much using this method. Many stores limit cash back to $20 to $40.

, You can find creative ways to get cash in social situations. For example, if you're out to dinner or a bar with friends, offer to pay for food or a round of drinks on your card. Have your friends reimburse you with cash. This helps lessen the confusion for the waiter or bartender. It also allows you to get cash without having to go to an ATM., If you live close to your bank, you may want to make a trip and withdraw money directly from the bank instead of an ATM. If you need a lot of cash, say over $100, this may be the easiest option. If you use cash frequently, try to make a point of going to your bank once a week. Withdraw as much cash as you think you'll need. This will eliminate some of your reliance on ATMs.

"
"
Plan ahead.,
Pay with cash only when necessary.,
Evaluate whether you really need to make a purchase.",How to Avoid ATM Fees3," At the beginning of each week, consider your plans. Are you going anywhere or doing anything that requires cash? Try to make a trip to an ATM associated with your bank and withdraw as much as you need. If you go into each week with as much cash as you need, you're less likely to end up in a bind where you need to use an ATM fast.


Be careful to budget. Make sure any money you're taking out of an ATM won't affect your ability to pay any bills or living expenses.You may want to avoid carrying a lot of cash on you, however. If someone steals your wallet, you'll simply lose the money you were carrying. Withdraw around $100 at the beginning of your week. Then, only take the amount you think you'll need when going out., It's usually quicker and more convenient to pay on your card, even if you're only spending a few dollars. If you're good at budgeting and check your account balance regularly, use your card unless it's absolutely necessary to pay with cash. This way, you're more likely to have cash when you actually need it. This lessens your reliance on ATMs.


For example, if you're bar hopping use your card at bars with no tab minimum. Save your cash supply for cash only bars or bars that have a high tab minimum for cards.

, When you're thinking of going to an ATM, pause and ask yourself if this purchase is really necessary. If you have to use an ATM that charges a fee, it may not be. Add $3 on to whatever you're thinking of buying and decide whether it's still worth it. For example, a $2 taco at a food truck may seem like a bargain, but if you have to use an ATM that charges a fee you're really paying $5. Maybe you should save your money and eat at home."

Apply for store credit.,
Get a car loan.,
Get a student loan.,
Apply for a personal loan.",How to Build Credit Without Credit Cards2," Any type of credit or loan you can get will help to build your credit, as long as your name is on the application and you make your payments on time. If you plan to make a major purchase like a new TV or stereo system, consider applying for credit at the store.Stores will often offer financing to those who do not have a credit card or cannot pay cash. This will help build your credit history and credit rating.
These types of loans are often expensive, with high fees and high interest rates.This because stores know the people that need these loans either have bad credit or none at all. The increased fees compensate the companies’ increased risk. Still, this can be a good option to build your credit.
You can often prepay on store credit with no penalty. This saves on interest payments. If you have the cash for the purchase, you can pay the application fee and then pay off the loan in the first month, or after 6 months. This can save you a lot in interest. Check the small print and ask the about prepayment possibilities and prepayment penalties.

, Financing the purchase of a car, either through the dealer or through the bank, is another way to build your credit. If you are considering buying a car, then consider getting a loan.Car dealers are especially motivated to get you the financing you require, since they want to make the sale. They earn the fees for starting the loan.
If you do not qualify for the loan on your own, consider using a cosigner. A cosigner is someone else who puts forth their good credit and promise to pay. This can help you get approved for the loan.

, If you are in school, they will offer various forms of financing. Students loans are typically easy to apply and qualify for.


A student loan will show up on your credit history as soon as it is approved. In the short run this actually lowers your ability to pay ratio. This is because your debt has increased. As soon as you start making payments though, the payment history will help you to build credit., Applying for a small loan and making the payments on time will help build your credit history and credit rating.


You can apply for a personal loan at your bank, sometimes using your savings account as collateral.This is another good reason to have a bank account.
The process of applying for any loan will require you to request and fill out a form, like application for a bank account.
Enter your personal information. This will include your social security number, contact information, employment history, and driver's license. If you apply for a loan with another person, you'll need their information and signature as well.
The bank will conduct a credit and employment check before deciding to give you a loan.

If you go to a bank branch, a banker will be happy to help you through the process of opening an account.
Many banks' websites allow you to open an account online. They include detailed instructions and information about account options.

, To open a bank account, you'll need to provide the bank with some information about you, as well as anyone else who will be using the account. You will need the following information:


Social Security number
Driver's license or state ID card (number, issuing state, and expiration date)
Employment information (current and previous, if you've worked less than one year at your current job)
Contact information including street address, phone number, and email

Pay taxes.",How to Build Credit Without Credit Cards4," An important part of building credit is establishing your ability to make payments. This requires you to have income. Your employer will likely do a credit check and may report your income.


Creditors define ability to pay as the ratio of debts to income.For example, if you have a debt to income ratio of 50%, that would mean half of your income is already committed to paying existing debt. It also means you probably have a limited ability to make additional payments, which would hurt your credit rating. This means that the higher your income is, the higher your ability to pay will likely be.

, Being with a company over a year is another benefit since it shows more stability.


Even if you don't love your job, try to stick with it for at least a year before moving on. Regular paychecks show creditors stability., Working under the table (off the books) will not help you to build credit. These earnings are not reported, so as far as creditors are concerned, they don't count.


Creditors must be able to verify the source and amount of your income. If they cannot, they will not know that you have an ability to pay.

In some cases, you may just be bored with your old room and need to rearrange the furniture. However, take into consideration that tearing down a wall to expand a room is going to take much more money than if you change the bedspread and repaint the walls. Visualize how your ideal room would appear and how the room would feel. Do you want the room to feel open and spacious or snug and homey? Do you want the room to have a warmer feel or a cooler feel? Paint a picture in your mind of what your desired outcome is, and make sure it will be a haven that you and others enjoy spending time in.


Spacious Feel. Natural lighting is an important key for this kind of feel. Leave most of your windows uncovered to maximize the open, airy effect. Note that it is easier if your room already has large windows. Lighter colors tend to make something look larger and also compliment the natural light. Pale yellow, sky blue, lavender, or even plain white are some colors you may want to use. Aim to have a lot of open floor space but not too much openness that the room feels uncomfortable.
Snug Feel. These rooms are usually smaller, but it is possible to have a large room feeling snug. The goal is to have a minimal amount of open space but not so little that you feel trapped and can't move. Various shades of brown often give a room a snug effect, as well as dark reds and oranges. Carpeting also makes a room feel homey.;
, It is very hard, if not impossible, to remodel a room that you can't even walk through because of all the clutter on the floor. If your room is not already clean, tidy it up.


Tackle your clothes, tidying is a good time for looking through your closet so have two piles: one pile for dirty clothes, and one for clothes to give away. The clothes that are clean and you want to keep you fold or hang in your wardrobe.

, What do you no longer need in your room? Do those pink princess pillows no longer fit your style? Use plastic bags to sort out stuff that you are getting rid of. This would be a great time to have a yard sale. Something that you leave unappreciated could be the same thing your neighbor's niece has been begging for. You will also make a bit of money to use for when you are buying new items for your room. Anything that you can't sell could be given away to charity or as hand-me-downs.

, Some of the things you don't desire can be modified in some way. What about that light pink chair with hearts all over it? This could be painted over in a different color/s or patterns to fit your style. You can also change pictures in hanging picture frames to fit the theme of your room or paint the walls a different color. In a bedroom, simply changing the comforter set and repainting the walls can have a huge effect while being cheap at the same time.

, Replace some of the old items that you have eliminated before with their new counterparts. That fluffy pink bed-set from before can be replaced with a new one that fits the style of your room. Make focal point objects like bed-sets and blankets match the colors of the walls. This will pull your room together and make it look nicer.

, After all the old stuff is gone or modified, accessorize your room with new items or furniture. Items such as potted plants, rugs, or wall murals can spice up a room to give it the exact flavor you were wishing for. Some websites or other WikiHow articles can help you with this.

, When you are done, step back and look at your hard work. Think back to the picture you painted in your mind earlier. Is this what you had planned? Is it better? Worse? In some cases you may feel you need to start over. However, don't do this if you aren't completely sure. You may just need to touch up a few things or rearrange the room until you get it to where you like it.

Draw colder air into the conservatory.,
Install roof vents.,
Have some form of opening and closing the conservatory roof vents.,
Install conservatory ceiling fans - in the summer a ceiling fan will provide a down draught that will aid cooling and by reversing the direction of the fan in the winter they can re-circulate warm air trapped at the top of the roof downwards.,
Install extractor fans - it can make frequent changes of air in the conservatory, and modern technology and designs mean that they are virtually silent when running under normal circumstances.",How to Ventilate a Conservatory," If, for example, you have a south facing conservatory adjoining a north facing room, you should draw air in from the bottom of windows in this room to get a good draught of cooler air flowing into the conservatory.;
, Since heat rises it is sensible to have some form of ventilation in the roof of the conservatory and one or more opening roof vents, depending on the size of your conservatory. You will need to make sure that you specify ones that provide good sealing and that are water and draught proof.

, This can be done in several ways. The simplest method is using a Hook & Pole to manually crank the roof vent open or shut. Other than being the most economical way of opening and closing roof vents, it is also the most attractive solution as there is no mechanism to install. For security, the roof vent can also include a locking mechanism that prevents the vent from being opened from the outside.


Alternatively, you can install a Teleflex® or other mechanism which can be controlled from a winding handle some distance away from the roof vent. These mechanisms can also be electronically controlled for even easier use from a wall-mounted switch or remote control unit. You can also make them totally automatic with a digital control system that will adjust the opening to maintain your desired temperature in the conservatory and close the vents completely if it rains.

,


When specifying a ceiling fan make sure you choose one with a large blade span for a large conservatory. You may need to fit more than one to maximize their benefit. The distance the blades turn from the roof is also important, place them too close to the roof and they will not have sufficient air to work with.
Ceiling fans can help you save on heating bills in the winter and air conditioning costs in the summer by using the warm or cool air already available more efficiently. If you buy ones with built in lights you will also save having to duplicate electric wiring to multiple units. Most ceiling fans can run at variable speeds, but make sure of this before purchasing.

, They can be noisier when turned on to maximum power, but if you specify one with a large enough motor maximum power will rarely be needed.


An extractor fan in the summer makes a great deal of sense, but using one in the winter means you will be throwing away great volumes of expensively heated air.
If you plan to use your conservatory in the winter and are heating it, you should look at installing heat recovery extractor fans. These are environmentally friendly since they can recover 70-80%, or sometimes even more, of the heat that they extract and return it to the conservatory.
Extractor fans installed in conservatory kitchens will need to be stronger than those used in other domestic rooms as they have to cope with extracting condensation, cooking smells and heat from appliances.

, You will want to go out to the property and find the ""Point of Commencement"", or POC, as described in your legal documents. Look for any lot corners and other survey evidence, both on your property and any surrounding lots that you have access to. These can take the form of ""X""s chiseled in concrete (such as sidewalks or curbs); nails, in asphalt, concrete, on the tops of walls, and along street center-lines; rebar or other metal stakes in soil; or City markers, which may be found under small manhole-like covers (they should be shown on any maps of the area).

A metal detector is helpful for nails which often corrode and become hidden in asphalt and for stakes, which are often buried. You must find at least one of the points mentioned in the legal documents. The more, the better.

, Find another control point at least a hundred yards or so from one of your found control points. The farther, the better. This point should appear on the map of the area (for example, the corner of another lot down the road).

, Find a spot where you can physically see as many of your control points as possible and the front lot corners and, if possible, the back corners that you wish to establish later (you're guessing here, but try). Mark it with a big nail, or spot of paint as appropriate. The mark must be solidly placed, so that it won't move.

, Set up your transit or theodolite over the mark you set. This can be tricky. You may have a peephole at the base of the unit, or you can use a plumb bob. Set up the tripod such that the unit is directly over the mark, with the device looking more or less level.

, You should have two bubbles and two thumb wheels at the base of the unit. Adjust them such that both bubbles are centered. Now recheck the peephole, and adjust the position of the device by loosening the plate at the bottom and sliding the device so the mark on the ground is in the cross-hairs or under the plumb bob.

, You will need a helper with a pole. Ideally, the pole will have a bubble level so the helper can hold it upright. Also, if your instrument measures distance, it will need a prism at the top. Now, you'll need to zero the device. With the helper holding the pole, find it in the telescope. Then, unlock the angle scale and rotate it so the indicator points to 0 degrees. Electronic devices have a button for this.

, Lock your scale, and have the helper move to each point you found. Sight the pole and write down the angle on the scale. If you can measure the distance, do so; you do not have to do this for faraway points, but it helps. If you're using a tape, make sure to pull it tight and keep it level. Both ends have to be at the same height. You can measure distances longer than the tape by marking points in between. Use the transit to place them exactly along the line between the transit and the point you are measuring.

, You will go do some math now, and it will take a while.

, You can do this with paper but a simple CAD program is much easier. Begin by plotting the theoretical position of each point you found. Start with any control point you found, and use the documentation to construct a complete map that includes your parcel and all the points you found. This map MUST be to scale!

, Now, start with a new sheet of tracing paper or a new CAD layer, or just a different color. Here, you will be recreating the physical evidence. Draw a mark for the point you set earlier, and draw a line representing your backsight. Now, draw lines toward each shot you took using the first line as 0 degrees. If you have distances, you can establish exact points. If you are using CAD, group or make a block of all these lines so you can move them as one object.

, The data will never match the map exactly, so you must pick one point to establish a starting point. Place the data over the map and see how everything matches up. If you have a marked lot corner, you should use it if the other data seems consistent. Otherwise, use your best judgment.

, Rotate the tracing paper or CAD block around the point you chose earlier, aligning the data to the map. You have now established the position of your control point—the spot you marked near the beginning.

, All of the measured data should match the map now. If not, you need to find out why.

, Draw lines from the control point (on the data layer) to the lot corners (on the map) that you need to set. Determine their distance from the control point and their angle relative to the backsight.

, Go back and set up over the control point and backsight again. Rotate the instrument to the calculated angle, and use the tape to establish the distance.

, Use a spot of paint or a wooden stake. If you can't see all of the corners, set up a second control point visible from the first one. Measure it, add it to the data layer, set up your station over it, and use the first point as a backsight to set the remaining corners. Repeat as necessary.

, You don't want to confuse later surveyors.

Find a closet close to your kitchen.,
Relocate whatever you keep in your closet.,
Install a suitable door.,
Give the closet a good cleaning.,
Put in some lighting.,
Take out any poles that you will not need when the closet becomes a pantry.

,
Get some shelving.,
Balance the affordability of do-it-yourself work with the precision of professional installation.,
Be creative with the space.,
Fill your new pantry with anything you need to store.",How to Transform a Closet into a Pantry," A pantry is best located near your kitchen since most pantry items are food, cookware, dishes and other utensils.


Look for a closet in a clean, dark place that can be converted to a pantry. Make sure it does not share a wall with a laundry room or a room that holds a lot of computers or electronics. That might contribute to overheating your pantry and spoiling your food.;
,


Hang coats on hooks you keep on the wall, or on hangers in your bedroom closets.
Use other storage in your house or apartment for what you were keeping in the closet. Make use of basements, attics, other closets and storage in your bedrooms, den, living room and office space.

, Avoid an inward door because that will take up too much space in your pantry and make it hard for you to get to anything you store behind the door.


Use the closet door that is already in place if it works for you. Most pantries have a door that swings out, towards the kitchen.

, You will probably be storing food in the space once it becomes a pantry, so you will want it clean and fresh.

, The closet might have overhead light, and if it provides enough illumination for you, leave it as is.


Hire an electrician to set up the wiring required for good lighting. You will need to be able to see everything in your pantry, especially if it is deep.
Install a light that can be turned on by a switch or a string that hangs from the overhead light.

,, Shelving will be very important in transforming a closet into a pantry.


Measure the height, width and depth of the pantry to estimate how many shelves you will need.
Look for thick, solid shelves that will make organization easy and efficient. Remember that you will have cans and boxes of differing sizes. You might want to vary the amount of space between shelves. Some pantries also use wire shelving.
Consider ease of access. While deep pantry shelves may allow you to store more canned goods, having to reach all the way back into the deepest part of the pantry might be difficult.

,


Ask for quotes on what it would cost to have your shelves installed by a professional. If you buy the shelving at a major home repair store, you can ask for a consultant to come and help you.

, Some people are satisfied just to have a pantry with some shelves for their food. Others like more detail and put racks to hold spices on the door, outlets in the wall to plug in appliances and decorative elements that make the pantry look custom designed and inviting.

, Use it supplies or dining linens.

Repeat steps 8-14 in the perpendicular direction.,
Check that the foundation has been leveled properly.",How to Prepare a Foundation,";
, Place stakes at each end, oriented as desired. It is important that the stakes lie along the same edge, namely, corners 1 & 2 as shown in Figure 1, not corners 1 & 4. Bang in the stakes using hammer or equivalent tool.

, For a 90° triangle, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 when c is the hypotenuse. Figure 1 shows how this relates to laying out the foundation. Find the distance A using A=sqrt(w^2+l^2).

, Lay it out starting at one of the first two corners staked out, more or less along the diagonal line shown in the figure above.

, From the original corner staked out that is not in contact with the string, measure out the length (or width) perpendicular to the side previously laid out. Hammer in the third stake at the point where the end of the string meets the measured out distance of this side. Note: The point of this step is to ensure that the foundation is square, so adjustment of the angle at which the string and/or side are laid out may be required.

, Start at the original stake not already used to anchor the string.

, Use the metal rake (and shovel if necessary) to roughly smooth out and level the entire area within the boundaries of the foundation. This step is just to ready the area to be leveled precisely, so don’t spend too much time trying to “eyeball” it.

, Do this as shown in Figure 2, making sure that no gaps are visible between the ground and the bottom of the 2x4. Note: If the board is shorter than the edge being leveled, place one end of the board at a corner to leave a gap beyond only one end of the board. Do not attempt to center the board.

, If the board is level and gap free, skip step 10.

, Keep the base smooth under the length of the 2x4 so that no gaps form. Do this until the 2x4 is level. If the board is as long as the side being leveled, skip steps 11 & 12.

, Cover the gap left along the edge being leveled. Leave at least 2-3 feet (60cm - 91 cm) of overlap between ground leveled in step 10 and the 2x4.

, Bring the unleveled ground to the same elevation as the area already completed. If there is still a gap of unleveled ground, repeat steps 11 & 12.

, Use the rake to level the ground in front of the board.

, Bring it 1-3 feet (30.5 cm - 91 cm) as shown in Figure 3, and repeat steps 9-12. Do this all the way to the other side of the foundation. In the area between board placements, use the rake to smooth out the ground, and bring it to the elevation of the area leveled underneath the boards.

, This means starting along either of the two edges that haven’t been leveled along their lengths. This should be easier than the first pass, as the foundation has already been leveled in one direction.

, To do this, lay the 2x4 diagonally across the center of the foundation, with each end pointing at opposite corners (the same orientation as the string in the beginning of this process). By placing the level on top, you should be able to confirm that the whole section is level.

However, all electricians know that just knowing how to pull wire in a home is mostly about speed and requires little or no thinking, so you would need to be more concerned about being “hit” by a nail than an electrical shock. Just keep safety in your mind at all times, regardless of how fast you want to go.
, Is the second most important thing to remember, because it’s obvious that it actually wastes more time when something has to be fixed. Your best feeling and understanding is number one when it comes to efficiency. If you keep at it and do rough wiring enough times, speed will mostly just come on its own; how nice is that?, When you hustle it sure will help you to finish more quickly, and make twice the amount that the one moving half your pace will. You must remember however, that there is only a limit to how fast our bodies can move and what they can do.

In the midst of bettering yourselves in this field, remember this old saying “You can’t cut down a tree with a dual axe; you must stop and sharpen it.”

, Wiring a house typically takes a lot of ""travel"" around the house, as you pull wire through for every switch and plug. This is one good way to become more efficient, but how many steps can you really reduce? This understanding can only come from considering your time, working out a rhythm, and doing your homework., Consider your biggest time sink: the wire pulling stages. All together it takes up to 2/3 of the work needed in wiring a home, and solving this problem comes down to how much wire you pull and staple at once. Most might think, “But nobody is that good”; well that’s where homework comes into use.


Homework is very easy and it's not time wasted.  Observe the home before you plan; a perfect day to do this would be after you just marked, boxed and drilled the first day. You can take notes as you go.







, More advanced pulling means more travel. If you're smart about your plan, you can draw it up with each wire to be run individually and then combine the runs traveling closest together into each one set of runs to be pulled and stapled together at a time.


You can even think about fewer trips up and down the stairs by including the drops and the ""down and under"" (around beams or high ceiling legs) you found during the earlier planning phase.











You can even do your box fill calculations for what meets code and fits in boxes during homework time.

, When you’re done your homework and have it with you, ready for pulling them and checking off at the same time. Everybody pulls different, but a few steps in the process can prevent a lot of danger, time wasted, and mix ups.

Next day you'll go to work and just have to look at paper, pull plenty at a time easily, staple up more at once, resulting in plenty of time saved for the second floor, basement and first floor.

, Knowing that there are all kinds of different tasks in wiring a home; perhaps 37, and every one of them is very easy to only do one at a time. When you know the tasks inside and out and can combined some of them together, though, “you are all set” for a quick run through. These are the tasks you'll have to complete, and below are more steps for doing them efficiently:

1. Mark the second floor low boxes
2. Mark the second floor ceiling boxes
3. Mark the second floor home run locations
4. Mark the first floor low boxes
5. Mark the first floor ceiling boxes.
6. Mark the first floor home run locations
7. Mark the basement ceiling
8. Mark the basement low boxes (if it’s a finish)
9. Lay out all of the recess cans and exhaust fans.
10. Box out the second floor low boxes
11. Box out the second floor ceiling.
12. Box out the first floor low boxes
13. Box out the first floor ceiling boxes
14. Box out the basement low boxes (if finished)
15. Box out the basement ceiling boxes
16. Second floor drill out
17(1). First floor low drill out
17(2). First floor ceiling drill out (not common but wiser to use a better drill and take homework notes)
18. Second floor home runs
19. Second floor long pulls (most do lesser at a time)
20. Short jumps (bedroom feeds and bathroom legs)
21. Cut in when everything is stabbed in the box (many do)
22. Nail plate the second floor
23(1). Pull the first floor home runs
23(2). Pull the basement home runs
24. First floor long pulls (lesser at a time)
25. Basement long pulls (lesser at a time)
26. First floor jumps
27. First floor jump arounds
28. Weatherproof jumps 29. Basement keyless
30. Cut in first floor
31. Brace 3 and 4 gang boxes
32. Nail plate the first floor
33. Basement jumps (if finished)
34. Cut in panel
35. High ceiling
36. Pan off
37. Clean up.

, Saving half of the time needed on the second floor, mark out for both the high boxes and the low ones.


, It’s time to mark up the second floor home runs everywhere that they are supposed to go.

, Combining 4 and 5 is the same way as marking the second floor, now it’s more complex, so greater care and more looking over is needed

, The old number 6 means marking the first floor, but it’s good to have a good understanding of what the basement home runs are like because they are all pulled in the same path as the first floors and could more than likely be of a different type of wire., Combines 7 and 8 (8 not always) but marking up everything that is needed in the basement and better to help with what’s needed for the first floor too., You should lay out all of the recess that is needed for 9 independently, especially if there are a lot of them, making the next task lesser to carry., Combining 10, 11 and 31 for the entire box out of the second floor and brace the 3 and 4gangs as you go.

, Bringing together 12, 13, and another part of 31 for the entire first floor box out and bracing., If it’s a finished basement go ahead and box both the highs and lows, or just the ceilings if not., The second floor drill out doesn’t have a lot to it; still it would be a good idea to think about any drops or down and under to be drilled right away.

, 17(1) and 17(2) in drilling the low holes on the first floor and carrying a ladder for drilling the ceiling holes needed. It’s better to use a stronger and longer lasting drill for what may be more, but as you go, being aware of any down and under or drops that could be recorded(taking notes) to add to your homework. Dropping bobbers into each more complex hole( ½ hot, switches, and home runs) for identification as you are pulling the first floor from the basement.


, Pulling the second floor home runs isn’t really much for saving unless you just pull more at a time., It would still vary depending on your understanding of it, but pull the second floor long shots., You have already done all of your pulls that require traveling, and you can now as you go throughout the second floor pull all the short stuff and cut in as you go. Be aware of everything you just pulled; trace it all down as you are doing your easiest tasks as you go and you’ll be able to detect if anything was missed, mixed, or double fed., Many homes may have sprinkler pipe or need to be foam sprayed, now would be more than half the time saved if you carried cardboard and the spray foam as you go., The home runs for the first floor and basement do go to different spots but flow in the same path as the weatherproof jumps,  saving more than half the time here with carrying them all at the same time. Look over where they are all going first and be sure to have the home runs on your spinners and the weatherproof jumps separately unraveled., The first floor long shots, basement long shots, first floor jump around, and basement keyless are ready. Homework is needed here even more useful  then the second floor long shot phase, because now pulling the more complex and plentiful runs you can just look at your homework, pull, and say, ""I'm done,"" still keeping the keyless on separate real.

, The basement and first floor jumps that was too short of a run to include in your homework can now be easily jumped, meanwhile cut in basement as you go., “Button up” the first now that the basement is 100% and cut it in(now it’s even more complex than the second floor so do remember all you pulled and trace it down), nail plate as you go as well as pan off., Isn’t a lot of time saved easily, but a High Ceiling can have all kinds of time saved to it too., Being aware of nothing missed and even thinking of refreshments as well.

, It’s easy enough to just put all things in the garage or outside and sweep up all the debris as throughout the entire house."

Choose the right room.You may not have a choice as to where your studio goes — it goes wherever there’s room for it.,
Clear out the room.,
Skip soundproofing unless you have a professional budget.,
Purchase acoustic treatment materials.Whereas soundproofing keeps sound from escaping the room, acoustic treatment aims to optimize the recording environment for ideal sound quality.,
Install your acoustic treatment materials.Depending on the brand and series of the actual materials you purchase, you might have been provided with brackets and screws, or you might need to purchase glue to affix the materials to your walls.,
Set up a desk for sound engineering.,
Set up a recording space.",How to Make a Studio1," However, if you’re lucky enough to have a choice of rooms, there are a few things you should keep in mind.


The room should be as large as possible. Forget an intimate little creative space — the best sound quality and working conditions are produced in large spaces. High ceilings would also help improve sound quality.
You’re going to be making a lot of noise in there, so choose a room as far away from other people as possible. Keep your roommates and neighbors in mind.
You also want to stay away from outside sounds as much as possible. The sound of cars passing on a busy street or rain slapping up against a window will get picked up on recording devices, so choose a room as isolated from outside sound sources as possible.
Avoid rooms with carpeted floors, as textile materials absorb too much sound and negatively affect the acoustics of the space. Look for rooms with hard floors — concrete, tile, or hardwood.
Asymmetric rooms are ideal, but they’re rare in home environments. A box-shaped room encourages sounds to reflect back and forth, creating a poor acoustic environment. If the walls aren’t perfectly parallel and perpendicular to one another, that effect is reduced somewhat.
Walls with irregular surfaces — built-in bookcases, for example — will also reduce that effect.;
, Clear out the floor space as much as possible, and take everything off the walls — especially fabrics like drapes or tapestries that will absorb sound waves and negatively affect acoustics. Remove anything in the room that might vibrate, like vases or decorative figurines that might buzz on their surface when someone’s playing the drums.

, You might think that soundproofing is the most important element of making a recording studio, but soundproofing is actually for the benefit of the people around you.


The walls are reinforced with dense building materials that absorb the sound produced within the room so it doesn’t bother your neighbors or other people in your house.
However, it’s very expensive and labor-intensive, usually costing thousands of dollars per room.As such, it’s best to skip this step if you’re just making a home studio for yourself. Instead, work out an arrangement with the other people who live in your home to create a recording studio that will work around their schedules.

, Though you’ll still have to invest some money in acoustic treatment materials, they are far less expensive than soundproofing materials.


You can purchase the three elements of acoustic treatment separately or in a package that eliminates a lot of guesswork. Companies that offer products and packages include Primacostic, Auralex, and Vicoustic.
You’ll need 1) acoustic foam panels, 2) bass traps that absorb low-frequency sounds like bass and percussions, and 3) (optional) diffusers.
The foam panels and bass traps will absorb sound reflections — not for soundproofing purposes, but to reduce the echo effect that you don’t want in a good quality sound recording.
The diffusers also aim to reduce the echo effect, but do so by dispersing or scattering the sound reflection off the walls so it’s not as noticeable.
Many people focus more on absorption than diffusion, so you might choose to skip the diffusers.

,


If using glue, look for a spray-glue that diffuses the adhesive evenly over a large area so you don’t end up with a gloopy mess.
Another option is a paste-based glue applied through a skeleton gun, which is essentially a caulking gun — a gun-shaped frame that holds the tube of paste stable so you can apply it evenly and precisely.
Install the panels evenly across the lengths of your walls. You don’t have to cover every square inch of wall, but you do need to cover the walls evenly. If you have a cluster of acoustic paneling in one corner of the room, but another corner is left with bare walls, you will have strange, poorly distributed sound quality on your recording.
You can space the panels out with up to a couple of feet between them, and you’ll still notice a significant improvement in sound quality.

, Once your empty studio space has been acoustically treated, you need to set it up for actual use. The first thing you’ll need is a space where you can work on production.


Use a desk large enough to hold your equipment. You might be working with a laptop alone, or you may have larger mixing boards. Just make sure your working surface isn’t too cramped to be effective.

, The recording space doesn’t have to be separate from the engineering space, so don’t worry about setting up partitions like you see in films and television in professional recording studios.


Lay out your instruments in a way that allows the members of your band to communicate clearly. Don’t place the drum kit on one side of the room and the guitars on another — you need to be able to pick up nonverbal cues from each other (louder, slow down, speed up, etc.).
Set up microphones next to each instrument.
Use clips or wire fasteners (like the kind that comes with bags of bread) to bundle cords together, and keep the cords tucked away as much as possible. With this many instruments and pieces of equipment in a room, someone can trip and hurt themselves if you’re not careful!
Make sure that your equipment is spaced out enough to give everyone room to move freely. Make full use of your studio space. If you’ve spaced out your acoustic treatment materials evenly, the sound quality should still be strong even if the instruments and/or speakers aren’t all producing sound from the same spot.

If you have kids, you could even designate a special shelf (or two) just for them and their favorite books.,
Kick back, relax and enjoy.

",How to Make a Library in Your Walk in Closet," If you have a collection of unwanted items in your closet, have a yard sale, donate them to the charity, or pass them down to family members or friends who can use them. With the money you earn getting rid of these items, you can buy more books or help to pay for bookshelves and any other modifications you want to make. If you find any books while cleaning out, you can decide whether to keep them for your library or sell them to exchange for other books.;
, What's a library without bookshelves? Get as many as you need, depending on how large your closet and your budget is. Shop around and visit markets or garage/yard sales for good deals.


You can put in freestanding bookcases, or if you are a bit handy, you can look for closet organizers or other systems that have shelves that mount directly to the walls.
Many organization systems are modular, meaning that if ever the time comes to relocate your library, you'll be able to reset the closet for clothing again easily.

, If you have enough books to fill up all the bookshelves you put in, great. Fill it with books about things you enjoy or that interest you. After all it is your library.


If you are fortunate to have more shelf space than books, you can continue to fill them gradually. Bookends will help to stand up the books until the shelves are full. In any case, there is no need to accumulate books you have no intention ever of reading.

, Be sure most of the bookshelves are filled. Also, don't cram books in the shelves if you have too many. Get a basket to hold the extras or place another bookcase somewhere else, perhaps just outside your closet.

, This might be simply a comfy chair with a lamp. If you like to write or if others are invited to read there, you may wish to include a desk, table, or sofa. Your seating may or may not share your closet, depending on your space and what you want to put there. Read Make a Reading Nook in Your Room for lots more details on creating a space to read.

, Write down the name of the book each person borrowed, the title and author, and the due date (if you have one), so you can keep track of where your books go.

, This is your choice of extra items you might want. (Chairs, beanbags, etc.)

, If you want other people to see and visit your library, hand out fliers or tell friends and family. If not, skip this step and enjoy your library in private.

, They'll love it and so will you, because they'll be taking an interest in reading and learning.

Purchase a spacious desk.,
Pair your desk with a good desk chair.As a writer, you will likely spend hours a day sitting in this chair, so it’s important you choose a chair that won’t cause back pain.,
Consider buying a standing desk converter.,
Decide where to place your desk in the studio.,
Furnish the studio with bookcases.,
Add a comfortable chair or sofa (optional).,
Ban all other potential distractions.,
Provide the comforts you need to get through the workday.",How to Make a Studio2," Your desk is where all of your work will get done, so you want to make sure that it will provide you with enough room to spread out and be comfortable.


Ideally, you should be able to fit your computer, a notebook, and a reference book across the width of your desk, so you can work from multiple sources at once.
Choose a desk that reaches a comfortable height when you sit in your office chair with your feet firmly supported on the ground.
The desk should come to about elbow-level on you when you’re sitting. This will help reduce the prospect of shoulder pain.Make sure there is comfortable leg space under the writing surface.
Look for a desk that has enough storage for any files and paperwork you need to keep on hand.
If the desk that seems most suited to your work lacks drawers for storage, you can purchase a file cabinet as supplemental storage.

, Instead of buying an office chair online, go to the store and try out the chairs you’re considering.


The backrest should mold into the S-shaped curve of your spine and provide lumbar support throughout.
It shouldn’t be overly rigid — there should be a slight amount of give to it if you want to lean back. However, you should not be able to lean back considerably.
The chair should have adjustable height settings to allow you to find your perfect height. Your feet should be firmly on the ground when you sit in the chair.
Armrests should be at a comfortable height. You should be able to rest your elbows comfortably on them without slouching (too low) or hunching up your shoulders (too high).
When you place your elbows on the armrests, they should be comfortably close to your body; if they are splayed out to your sides, the armrests are too wide.

, Research has suggested that sitting at a desk for several hours a day contributes not only to back and shoulder pain, but also to increased risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer.To combat the unwelcome effects of a sitting, sedentary lifestyle, you might buy a standing desk converter that allows you to transform your desk into a standing work station.


A converter gives you the option of using either desk setup — sitting or standing — without having to commit to either full-time.
Standing desk converters can be purchased at many office supply stores.
Measure the height of your work desk in the studio and try to match the standing desk converter to that height to see how it will actually work with your desk.
Look for an adjustable converter that you allow you to find the precise, perfect height for your standing desk.
The appropriate height will depend on your personal preference to some degree, so experiment a little. The lowest the desk height should go is elbow level; any lower and you may experience neck pain from looking down at your desk all the time., This may seem like a simple decision — “just put it wherever it fits!” — but anyone who’s spent a significant amount of time chained to desk knows that placement is important. Do a self-evaluation to determine what your strengths and weaknesses are in terms of ability to focus on tasks.


If you are easily distracted, don’t face your desk toward a window that will allow you to daydream or people-watch when you should be working.
If you have trouble finding inspiration, maybe you should face your desk toward a window. A little people-watching might knock an idea loose and get you back to work.

, Depending on what type of writing you’re doing, you may need a variety of books in your studio with you. If you’re a grant writer, you may need thick reference books at your disposal to make sure documents are formatted properly. If you’re a poet, you may simply want to read a few poems from your favorite volume to get your creative juices flowing again. Either way, you want your books to be right there in your studio with you, not off-site and unavailable.

, Many people find it useful to have a place where they can relax for a few minutes when they need to recharge. A comfortable chair or sofa can provide a nice spot to curl up and read that favorite volume of poetry while waiting for inspiration to strike.


Know yourself before placing a comfortable chair in your studio. If you think you’ll spend all your time lounging in it instead of getting your work done, don’t put one in your studio.

, Again, you have to be honest with yourself about the things that will prevent you from focusing on the task at hand. If you can’t work without background music, by all means, put a speaker in your studio. But if background music will distract you, don’t bring a speaker into your workspace. The same goes for television, snacks — anything that will keep you from meeting your goals.

, On the flip side of the previous step, you should provide yourself with everything you need to keep you going. Depriving yourself will only frustrate you, so keep your favorite brand of tea on hand, or a coffee maker. Decorate the studio to your liking so you feel comfortable and at home in the space.

Purchase storage bins.,
Organize your materials.,
Organize those bins.,
Clear out a workspace.,
Make sure you have a surface large enough to hold the materials you need for a given project.,
Protect the floors if necessary.,
Set aside a space for letting pieces rest.,
Decorate your studio.",How to Make a Studio3," Artists tend to accumulate a large amount of materials as time passes, so it’s very important that you have a system in place to keep track of all of your supplies. Clear plastic storage bins will allow you to tell what’s inside without having to open anything up and root around. However, if you have some other type of storage on hand, simply make sure that each bin is clearly labeled with its contents.

, Place similar materials together in your bins, making sure to put everything in an appropriate spot.


For example, you might separate your paints into separate bins by type: acrylic, oil, and watercolor.
A bin that contains brushes should not contain cloth samples or clay, because they are too dissimilar.
If you don’t have enough of a material to merit having its own bin, make sure the contents are as closely related as possible: for example, your painting knife with your paintbrush cleaners.

, After you’ve separated your supplies into discrete, labeled bins, you want to organize the bins into a system that groups similar materials together. For example, your bin full of paints and your bin full of paintbrushes should not be stored in opposite corners of your studio.


Attach sturdy shelving to the walls if possible to make your bin storage cleaner, more compact, and more aesthetically appealing.
If that’s not an option, looking for sturdy shelving units that can support the weight of your materials.

, Depending on the type of art you create, you may need only a desk, or you may need a wide expanse of open floor space. You’ll know what you need to prepare.


If you work with messy materials that seem to end up on the floor and walls, make sure you give yourself wide berth.
Establish your workspace in the center of an open area, where paint won’t splatter the walls or other objects.

, Depending on your materials and working style, you may simply need a single large desk or table centered in the workspace to hold your materials. However, if you work from an easel, make sure that there is a surface that can hold all of the paints you’re using, your brushes, your painting knives, etc.

, Many artists prefer to work in garage-like studios with concrete floors, and don’t mind if the floors get stained with the various pigments and supplies they use day to day. However, if your floors are wooden or carpeted, you want to lay down a layer of protection to prevent them from being permanently damaged by your work.


Look for a large, inexpensive area rug that you don’t mind getting stains on.
You can also create a grid of plastic floor protectors intended for office desks to protect your floors.
Just don’t use a protection method that will require constant upkeep, like spreading newspapers across the floor. Doing that would waste useful time every day when you could just breeze into your studio and get right to work.

, If you’re a painter, you might store wet paintings near an open window to help them dry, or you might point a fan toward the wet canvas. If you’re a sculptor, you may need a flat surface to allow clay to dry near a window or fan.

, This is where you will create your work, so it needs to be a space that inspires your imagination. Decorate the studio to your liking, choosing artwork for the walls, placing flowers here and there, and purchasing furniture that appeals to your design aesthetic. The happier you feel when you’re in this space, the more time you’ll want to spend here creating art.

Install appropriate flooring for dancing.,
Line a wall with mirrors.Mirrors can be incredibly expensive, but they’re necessary for a dance studio.,
Install a barre.,
Make sure the temperature remains comfortable.",How to Make a Studio4," There are many options for dance studio flooring, so check prices and surface characteristics to decide which one will be most reasonable for your budget and needs.


Hardwood floors of any type will work well for any type of dancing that is performed barefoot. However, if you are wearing hard shoes (tap shoes, for example), practicing on hardwood floors can result in permanent damage to the floor surface.
“Marley” style floors are the optimal surface for a dance studio. Made from a variety of materials from vinyl to fiberglass, they can cost anywhere from $20 per square foot to $70 per square foot, plus the cost of installation. These are suitable from all types of dance, from tap to modern to ballet.
If you can’t afford to install permanent flooring, you can purchase portable dance mats to cover your dancing space. If you don’t need to move around a great deal in your studio, you can purchase a single mat for around $150 dollars and have a 3’x6’ area on which to practice.If you need a larger space, you can purchase multiple mats and secure them with vinyl tape to ensure they stay flush against one another.

, Ideally, your studio will have floor-to-ceiling mirrors that span the entire length of one of your walls, but that’s simply not an option for many people.


Instead, look for inexpensive wall mirrors that are intended for bedroom use.
These mirrors, though narrow, are still tall enough to show you the length of your body.
Find a mirror model that allows for installation directly into the wall with screws. Purchase as many of them as you’ll need to give yourself a good view of yourself while you’re practicing.
Install them all across the length of your wall, making sure that they’re level with one another.

, The barre is the rail used by dancers to stabilize themselves while they’re practicing in the studio.It should come to about hip-level. There are two types of barres: ones that are installed directly into a wall, and ones that stand alone on supporting legs. If your studio is short on space, you might prefer the wall-mounted barre, as it leaves a little bit more floor space open for use.


The barre should be placed along the wall that holds your mirror, so you can observe your form while you practice at it.

, While dancing, it’s important that your body stay at a comfortable temperature to prevent both muscle injury from cold and dehydration and exhaustion from heat. A studio with windows can let in a natural breeze if you don’t have central heating and air conditioning. Otherwise, equip the space with fans, window units, or space heaters depending on your temperature needs.

,
When the floor is level and stable on the temporary posts, it is time to prepare for permanent supports.",How to Level an Existing House," The structure may not be as you expect and you may cause more problems than you solve.;
, With a taut string, water or laser level, make a straight line from one side of the foundation to the other. You may find this task easier if you hold the string off the sagging floor joists by attaching blocks of the same thickness at opposite sides of the basement. Nail them to the underside of the joists as near the foundation as you can. Measure the distance from that line to the bottom of the floor joists. Repeat this process in several locations under the house.

,, Make sure that the post is located on firm, level ground under the house. Alternate the placement of each layer of blocks by 90 degrees to improve stability.

, When the space above the temporary post is adequate to place the jack and reach the structural member above, start jacking the house up. As the house moves, add smaller blocks to support the center of the structure at the new elevation.

,, (See Warnings below.) Sheetrock cracks may appear.

,, Existing supports may be usable with minor modifications. Check the bottom of the supports for rot or other signs of trouble. If the bottom of the posts are no longer sinking, they can remain in place. By cutting the center supports shorter, a new beam can be placed on top of the shortened posts to support the center of the house.

Make sure you have a good sized shed, at least enough room for you, a friend and a table to fit inside!,
Decide on which colour paint you might use to do up the inside.,
Once you have painted your shed, you might want to add gloss onto it to stop you getting that horrible feeling when you run your fingers down a painted wall.

By now, you've pretty much got a cool den, but an idea is to put up hooks for coats and things and maybe a doormat or shoe rack could be added to stop your floor getting dirty.

,
If you have any big windows in your den, you could get curtains, blankets or large bits of material to cover them up, especially at night.

",How to Make a Den out of Your Unused Shed," Clear it out so there is nothing left inside.;
, If you are unsure of what colours to use, go to a DIY store and buy tester pots of paint, then paint small squares of the paint on to the shed to help you decide.,,, You don't have to buy shelves from a store, you can use planks of wood and ask an adult to drill them in to the walls. Try not to put anything valuable on the shelves. (see warnings)

, Your den will be starting to take shape by now! Your next step would be to add something to sit on, like a small sofa or some of those huge beanbags, or even just large pillows!

, At the moment, sitting in your den would be pretty boring. Instead of things used by plugs, the cheap way of getting these appliances, is using battery operated ones. These are usually quite hard to find in supermarkets and department stores, so you are best looking online. Keeping a drawer or box of batteries in your den would be handy, because if you didn't, if you had run out of batteries for something, you'd have to go back into your house and storm about saying, ""WHERE ON EARTH ARE THE BATTERIES?!!""

Figure out what the room is used for, or what you would like it to be used for, so you can divide it into separate spaces for each purpose.;
, If the furniture is currently pushed back around the edges of the room, trying pulling it inward, creating a walkway around the room. This often looks more aesthetically pleasing, and can help you conceptualize the room as multiple sections, instead of one large space.

, If you have a rectangular room that you want to divide, think about which divisions look best. A room, or a sub-section of a room, tends to be most pleasing when its width is between 1/2 and 2/3 of the length.If that is not feasible, try to divide the room into squares. A space with equal proportions is usually better received than a space in which the width and length are highly uneven, or almost equal but noticeably ""off.""

, If ceiling beams are present, you could divide the room along the length of a beam for a more natural appearance. Permanent features on the wall, such as a set of French doors or a fireplace, can become the central focus of a sub-section after you divide the room.

, If you have large living room furniture, it may look out of place once your living room has shrunk to make room for a dining space. If you don't want to replace your furniture, consider one of the less ""permanent"" dividers in the next section, so light and air still gives the impression of a larger room.

, Provide three feet (0.9m) of space wherever people will be walking, or more if the house is used by energetic children, larger people, or people with walkers or wheelchairs. If your new division does not allow for easy access to each part of the room, you may need to remove one or more items of furniture, or replace them with smaller pieces.

, A bookcase reaching above head height effectively divides the room while providing storage or decoration space. Many people use an open-backed bookcase for this purpose, in order to allow light through., Curtains hanging from the ceiling can be easily installed and removed, making them a good option if you want the option of changing the color or style of your divider. Hanging panels have similar benefits, and can be purchased in shorter lengths if you do not wish the rooms to be completely blocked off.


You can install light ceiling-mounted curtains yourself, by mounting extra-light cable across the ceiling with hook screws.You may want to consult an experienced handyman to find out which screws will work best for your wall and ceiling material.

, These installations are made from solid materials, usually wood or semi-opaque glass, and can block sound and smell more effectively than other options. Nevertheless, they can still slide out of the way when you wish to open up the room.


Sliding doors can be difficult to install without an existing opening. Hiring a professional is recommended unless you are experienced at home alterations.

, A large room doesn't always need barriers to feel divided. Place a long sofa with a low or nonexistent back across the center of the room to break the room up into sections while still allowing people to talk across it.This is a great solution if you wish to host a large number of guests, but dislike the empty or bare feeling of the room large enough to host them all.


Similarly, a kitchen counter or bar counter can divide a large room into a kitchen and dining area.

, A paneled room divider can be made of glass, fabric, wood, or other materials, and can be painted or decorated in any style. A transparent divider will let light through to keep the hint of a larger room, while an opaque one will create a more solid effect. Dividers require no special installation, and can easily be moved if you change your mind.


Room dividers may not be appropriate if there are energetic pets or children in your home, as they can be knocked over.

, A large space can look overwhelming if there is nothing to focus on. Arrange the seating and other furniture to face an object of attention, such as a television, fireplace, or large painting. If the furniture needs to be arranged inward, for instance toward the dining table, create a focal point with a chandelier or centerpiece.


Use portable furniture to rearrange the space if you would like to use different focal points at different times. For instance, one or two light chairs can be added to the living room in front of the television when you want to encourage conversation.

, If the room feels too large, even after dividing it, use furniture on a similar scale. A high ceiling can feel less imposing if there are high-backed chairs in the room to match. A coffee table could be replaced by a large ottoman to fill the space between seats more comfortably.

, If you enjoy gardening, pot a lemon tree, a fern, or another plant next to a corner or wall that looks empty. Tall plants are a good choice if you have a high ceiling, and add a natural appearance that can't easily be achieved with furniture alone.

, Tapestries are much larger than paintings, and can be used to fill walls on a grand scale. However, even a collection of small paintings hung in groups can make the room feel cozier.

, Place artwork on countertops and tables to draw attention to the smaller scale. Even just one or two pieces can give people something to focus on close up, rather than feeling dwarfed by the scale of the room.

, If you're willing to put in the work, a redesign with deep, rich colors such as burgundy or dark brown can make a room feel cozier. This can also help divide a room visually, by drawing attention to a smaller area with windows or wainscoting accented in different colors."

Get construction insurance.",How to Build Your Own Home (US)," You will need to either pay cash for the land, get a land loan from a bank, buy land from the seller with owner financing, or find a seller willing to wait for you to get house plans and a building permit and a realtor willing to wait months for their commission (highly unlikely). Buying the land with a land loan first allows you to take the land off the market so others cannot buy it before you do. It also allows you plenty of time to pick out house plans, submit the plans to the county for approval and obtain a building permit all while obtaining the best construction loan. Construction loans can include the land into the construction loan only if you already own the land with a land balance to add into the construction loan.;
, Though it may need to be customized to your particular state or county, this should assist you greatly.

, There are some great house plan resources on the internet. Just go to Google and type in ""house plans"" or ""architect"" for your local area and you will have more sources than you can handle. If you go with a stock house plan from the internet, you will still probably need to make some modifications for your local building codes and building practices. To do this, you will probably want to hire a local architect. Once you pick out a house plan that fits your needs and expected budget, simply buy a few sets and start getting estimated bids from builders.

, If you are looking to build in a development, check with the development's sales office for details.

, The goal of being an owner builder is mainly to save money. Some people can save quite a bit of money if done correctly. However, some people are not meant to be owner-builders, as it takes a strong personality to manage contractors. Possible problems when acting as owner builder:


Construction cost overruns
The best banks with the best rates require a builder or supervisor
Managing contractors to finish on time or to show up for work
Depleting your personal savings
The need to borrow more money
Loan extension penalties
Being taken by unscrupulous contractors
The need to refinance your construction loan
Foreclosure

, The builder/supervisor will help you with the cost breakdown and manage the subcontracting on an as needed basis. If one of your contractors gets out of hand or you need help of any kind, you can call the supervisor for assistance. The builder/supervisor can also help when technical inspector issues come up.# If you decide on hiring a builder to do everything, make sure you hire a reputable builder or supervisor with a good reputation and plenty of references. Ask your friends if they know of good builders, and when you start to hear the same name over and over you know you've found a good one. Ask the building inspector for a list of reputable builders. The most important point is shop around until you find a builder with the most reputable and honest background. Be sure to find a builder that has been in business for a minimum of three to five years in your particular location.

, This is the breakdown of each particular cost of construction of the home. The foundation, lumber, framing, plumbing, heating, electrical, painting, and builder's profit, etc. The builder usually completes this form to show you exactly what it will cost to build your new home. The most important thing to remember here is that you do not want to underbid any line item and you do not want to overbid any line item. You want accurate numbers from real bids (not guesses) and a 5% contingency for cost overruns


Good builders will send out the house plans to their contractors for specific bidding on each main item or can estimate the home themselves. The builder will send one set of plans to the foundation contractor, one set of plans to the framer, one set of plans to the plumber, etc, etc. When all the numbers come in, the builder will fill out the cost breakdown and come up with a total cost to build your new home.

, Be certain to check in on the progress of these builders to be sure you are getting quality work with few corner-cutting measures.


Bad builders will use the WAG method of estimating the cost of building your new home. The WAG method stands for ""Wild Ass Guesses"". This method is the most dangerous since it can lead to under and over bidding.
The last method of bidding is simply to overinflate every single line item on the cost breakdown. This is the most profitable method for the builder and the most expensive to the customer. This is why you want to find an honest, reputable builder with a good reputation in your community. Once the cost breakdown is completed and you plan on hiring this builder to build you new home you will need to type up a contract. The contract needs to equal the added total of the cost breakdown.

, There are two types of contracts:



Fixed Contract: This contract is simple and straightforward. Take the total of the cost breakdown and put that fixed number into the contract. The builder will provide a list of responsibilities.

Cost plus Contract. This type of contract is usually for large construction loan projects. The customer wants to make a lot of changes to their home as it's being built. The construction loan period to build the home is 18 months so construction costs can change drastically. The builder prefers this contract to protect the costs and profits.

, There are two methods that banks use to make sure your builder gets paid while building your home.

The Voucher Reimbursement system has been around for quite a while. As usual, you'll have some builders that are very familiar with this method of payment and do not like change. Most banks find that the voucher system is simply too much paperwork to deal with anymore. The builder is given a big book of vouchers that looks like a checkbook and when they want to get paid or need to pay a contractor they need to fill out a voucher form. This voucher form is a request for payment and as long as the contractor has signed the lien release, the bank will pay the amount requested. The bank will also request an inspection throughout the construction loan to make sure that the work is completed.
The Draw Reimbursement system is becoming the standard for construction loan funding for most banks. The main difference is that the bank puts the accounting responsibility on you or your contractor. The bank uses your cost breakdown as the guide for the draws. Some banks use specific schedules of 4 to 7 draws based on completed construction milestones, such as foundation or framing. The draw systems also allow the choice of taking draws on a monthly basis, collecting partial payment for work and material items that have been completed.

, There are three types of insurance needed to build. All banks require the first two insurances, course of construction and general liability. Workman's compensation is only required if your builder has employees.


Course of Construction Insurance. This policy is an all risk policy to include, fire, extended coverage, builder's risk, replacement cost, vandalism and malicious mischief insurance coverage.
General Liability Insurance. You or your builder can provide this policy. This policy is a comprehensive general policy or a broad form liability endorsement. The minimum amount of $300,000 for each occurrence is required. If the builder provides the insurance a general policy of $1,000,000 or a broad form liability endorsement is required.
Workman's Compensation Insurance. If your builder owns his own company and has employees that are helping to build your home, workman's compensation is required. If the builder simply subcontracts out the work and does not have employees per se, they will need to write a letter acknowledging that they do not have employees and are not required to have WCI.

If your builder tells you he is not required to provide any insurance whatsoever, he is most likely correct because it is not a law to have insurance to build a house. This requirement is set forth by the bank. So make sure you hire a reputable builder with insurance, it will help your construction loan close much faster. Ask your builder upfront if they have general liability insurance. If they do not ask if they have a problem providing the insurance. Some builder's cannot afford or simply do not want to pay for the insurance and then guess who has to provide it, yes, you do. You can save yourself a lot of headaches and money if you work with a builder that has insurance.

Make use of wall space by hanging art.,
Add plants to the living room.",How to Design a Living Room," Take some time to think about the main function of the living room. Do you have kids that need space to play? Do you plan on hosting a lot of parties? Does your living room have a large window with a great view? The function of the room should be the main influence in how you design it.If your living room has a natural focal point, such as a fireplace or a view, consider designing around it. Face the seating towards the focal point so that everyone in the room has a clear view. Add rotating armchairs so you can easily adapt the room to a space for entertaining.Some living rooms are large enough to split into two or more areas. If you have a large living room, and you need a space for kids to play, consider devoting a part of the room to a play area. Use a coffee table or sofa to create a natural divide between areas.;
, Avoid putting furniture too close to an entryway. Guests entering the room should have plenty of clearance.Keep plants and other room accents away from the entryways as well. You don't want your guests to have to fight past anything to enter the room. Leaving clearance around the entryway also makes the room more inviting., Arrange your furniture so that guests can walk around the conversation rather than through it. When designing the living room, you have complete control over how guests will move through the room.Pay attention to any doorways in the living room. If you have one doorway along a wall, then group your furniture in the area along the opposite wall.Two doors across from each other create a natural divide in the room, allowing you to split the room into two distinct areas.If you have several doorways to work with, you can split the room into multiple areas, each with a specific emphasis., If you have a small living room, try not to cram too much into it. If you have a large living room, you may be struggling with how to use so much space.Think about the emphasis of the room and how much space you have to work with. If you need extra seating in a small space, consider a combination of floating chairs and sofas. Being able to move the chairs allows you to remain flexible.If you have a lot of empty space in your room, incorporate it into your design. A big open room can be welcoming. Whatever you do, keep the room balanced., Don't rely on a single source of light to light your living room. Try to blend several layers of light from multiple sources.Use a combination of ceiling lights, table lamps, sconces, and floor lamps to achieve balanced lighting in your living room.Pay attention to the corners. If you have a lamp in one corner, position two more in the room to try and balance the light.Use tall lights to give the impression of a higher ceiling., Dimmers give you the opportunity to change the feel of the room whenever you like. If you like to host parties, you can use your dimmers to create a flattering light.Dimmer switches can extend bulb life and conserve energy.Consult an electrician if you want to add dimmer switches to your lights., If you plan on watching a lot of T.V. in the room, make sure your lights aren't going to cause a glare. To make the room more suitable for winding down, keep the light low.Certain areas of your living room may be devoted to a specific task. Put a lamp on your desk if you work in your living room. If you have a reading chair, position a lamp nearby., If you want to increase the visual space of your living room, consider adding a mirror. This works especially well for smaller living rooms.If you have a shortage of windows in your living room, use mirrors to open it up. Try situating the mirror across from a window to give the illusion of two windows., Rugs can make a room a lot more comfortable, as long as they're used in the right way. Make sure you get a rug that is nearly as big as the seating area.If a rug is too small, it can make the room feel smaller and disconnected.Keep the edges of the rug away from entryways or walkways to prevent your guests from tripping.Furniture should either be completely on, or completely off the rug. Don't straddle the legs between the rug and the floor or your furniture will wobble., Buy some original artwork to add some life to your living room. Go to art shows and find a piece that makes you feel something.There are a lot of stores that sell mass-produced prints of simple pieces. Use these if you find a piece that has some meaning to you, but try to avoid filling your home with a bunch of store-bought art.Original artwork doesn't have to be expensive. Check in your area for high-school art shows. You may find some pieces you like at a reasonable price., Indoor plants help purify the air in your home, and they make a room more inviting. Use potted plants, hanging plants, or shelves to add some greenery to your living room.Stick with plants that are easy to take care of, such as ferns, succulents, and other houseplants."

Choose a wooden table that you not mind ruining.,

Paint another coat of decoupage glue, if needed.,
Apply a spray-on topcoat.,
Let the topcoat cure before using the table.",How to Decoupage a Table," Old, stained, beaten, and scuffed up tables are great for this project. A small table, such as a coffee table, a side table, or an accent table, would be much easier to work with than a larger table, such as a desk. Metal tables are not recommended because they are more likely to chip later on.;
, If the table is raw wood and not the slightest bit shiny, you can skip this step. If the table is shiny, it has a topcoat, which can cause the decoupage to come off. If you think that your table has a topcoat, sand the table down with medium-grit sandpaper.You only need to sand the parts you will be painting and decoupaging.

, Dip a soft cloth in warm water, and squeeze out the excess. Wipe it across the surface(s) that you sanded. This will remove and dust or grit.This would be a good idea, even if you did not sand the table.

, Start by painting the sides and legs of the table. If you plan on covering the entire tabletop with paper, leave the tabletop bare. If you plan on just adding simple cut-outs to the tabletop, you can choose to paint it or leave it bare.


Let the paint dry, apply another coat of paint, then let it dry completely.
Acrylic paint and spray paint will work well for this.

, The possibilities are endless here. You can cover the entire table with a large sheet of colorful wrapping paper or fabric. You can also cut smaller shapes out of scrapbooking paper, and decoupage it over a bare, painted, or paper-covered tabletop. Choose something with a nice patter, especially if you are using wrapping paper; avoid designs that make it obvious that it's wrapping paper, such as ""Happy Birthday,"" balloons, or Christmas trees.


If you plan on covering the entire tabletop, cut the material down so that it is 1 inch (2.54-centimeters) bigger on all four sides.If you plan on pasting smaller shapes onto the table, cut smaller images out of scrapbooking paper. You can also use printed images, fabric, cards, magazines, etc.

, Apply it only to where you will be putting the paper. This could be the entire tabletop or just patches (if you are using smaller images).Be generous with the decoupage glue. You want it to be nice and thick.

, Flip the paper over so that the back is facing you. Coat the back of the paper with decoupage glue using a foam brush., Don't press it down just yet. Make sure that it is places exactly where you want it to be. If the placement is off, carefully nudge it back into place.

, Work your way from the middle of the table to the outer edges. You can smooth the paper down with a credit card, a ruler, or even a clean, foam roller.Some stores also sell special smoothing tools just for decoupage.


If you see air bubbles, pop them with a pin or needle, then smooth them down.If your paper has overhanging edges, do not press them onto the sides of the table. Leave them hanging loose.

, Let the paper dry for 30 minutes first. Next, apply a coat of decoupage glue using a foam brush. Apply the glue starting from the center of the paper and work your way outward towards the edges., You only need to do this if you covered the entire tabletop with paper. Run the block back and forth across the top edge of the table. This will saw off the excess paper. Discard any paper that falls off.Wipe off any dust.

, Use the same technique as before: apply the glue with a foam sponge, working your way from center-out. Let the glue dry completely before moving on., You do not have to do all of the ideas suggested in this part. Simply choose one or two that appeal the most to you, and run wild with them!

, Choose shapes that work with your tabletop's color and/or design. Cut them out along the outline with a sharp pair of scissors. Apply decoupage to the back, then place them onto the table. Smooth them down from center-out with a credit card.


You can do this step too, even if you already added cut-out shapes onto your bare or painted table. Consider layering the shapes to create unique images.

, Lay down a stencil onto you table. Apply acrylic paint over the stencil with a round, foam brush (pouncer). Dab the brush up and down over the stencil. Do not drag the brush across the stencil, or you will risk getting paint under it. Pull the stencil away when you are done, before the paint dries.Use colors that contrast with your design to make them stand out, such as white, black, silver, or gold.

, This method will work similar to stenciling and is great for a rustic design. Pour out some acrylic paint onto a plate, lid, or other pallet. Dip the stamp into the paint, then press it lightly against the table. Lift it away to reveal your stamped design. Repeat this step as often as you'd like.


Use a color that contrasts with your design. White, black, silver, or gold are great, neutral colors that will help the stamp stand out.

, If you have elegant handwriting, you could write passages from your favorite books, songs, or poems onto the table using a thin brush; cursive or calligraphy would work well here. If you are very artistic, you can even paint your own sketches onto to the table instead; birds and flowers make great motif.


Keep the designs and colors simple. Black is a great choice.

, This works great with cut-out images. Use gold or silver ink (or a thin brush and acrylic paint) to highlight certain features on your cut-outs. For example, if you used roses, you can add highlights to the tips of some of the petals. Keep it simple however; less is more!


Glittery paint may also work, depending on your design.

, You only need to do this if you layered on more paper, paint, or designs. Let everything dry first, then apply the decoupage glue with a foam brush. Work your way from center-out, then let it dry completely.

, Choose a waterproof, acrylic topcoat. Spray it onto the table. If you need to apply a second coat, wait until the first one dries. You can also use a polyurethane topcoat, but be aware that it may yellow over time.Topcoats come in many different finishes, such as glossy, satin, and matte. Choose one that works the best for you.
You can also use a brush-on topcoat if you prefer.

, Just because something feels dries does not mean that it is ready to be used. Read the can of your topcoat, and see what the complete drying and curing times are. In most cases, this will be about 24 hours. If you use the table too soon, the topcoat may get tacky."

Purchase the size of Formica sheet that fits best for your project.,
Measure the area you wish to laminate with a tape measure.

,
Mark the cutting line on the Formica with a pen or pencil.

,
Place masking tape on the cutting line.,
Lay the Formica on a flat, rigid surface.,
Use a circular saw or laminate shears to cut the Formica into large pieces.,
Install the Formica onto the countertop or other location.

,
Use a jigsaw with a fine blade to trim the Formica and make any rounded cuts.

,
Use a belt sander with a grit of 100 to smooth the edges.,
Cut the Formica to 1/8 inch (.32 cm) larger than the size needed.,
Remove any masking tape used for the larger cuts with the circular saw.

,
Install the Formica onto the location.

,
Trim the Formica to the exact size needed.,
Use a flat metal file to clean off any burrs or rough edges that may have occurred while cutting the Formica.

",How to Cut Formica," Formica sheets are between 1/16 and 1/32 of an inch (.15 and .08 cm) thick. Sheets can be 3, 4, and 5 feet (.9, 1.22, and 1.52 m) wide and 8, 10, and 12 feet (2.44, 3.05, 3.66 m) long. The smallest sheet available is generally a 3x8 feet (.9x2.44 m); however, some home improvement stores offer scrap bins if your project is small.

,,, Use extra layers of tape at the edge of the Formica where the saw will first start the cut. If the line is not visible through the tape, remeasure and remark on top of the masking tape.

,


You can use a scrap piece of plywood or OSB as a table to cut Formica. The surface you use will probably be scored by the saws, so be sure that what you are using is safe to cut on and can get damaged.
Cement would not be a good surface to cut on.

, Do not try to cut a curve with a circular saw. Cut out the shape's form, and leave the trimming for a finer saw and corners for a saw with a some flexibility.

,,, Belt sanders can be heavy to operate, and you may choose to sand the edges by hand or with a small metal file.

,;
,,, Use a trim router that features a laminate cutting bit.

Consider the scope.,
Assess your skill level.,
Learn the skills.,
Think about your safety.,
Decide if it's a job meant for professionals.",How to Determine if You Can Do a Home Remodel Yourself1," If the project is small, such as re-tiling a closet, that's probably something you can handle on your own. However, massive remodeling projects, such as completely renovating a kitchen, may be more difficult for you to handle. It can drag on for months and months if you don't know what you're doing. It's also important to consider your skill level. If you have never done any construction before, you probably don't want to start with a bathroom remodel project., It's important to think about your skill level before starting any project, and it's equally important to be honest about it. If you've never picked up a hammer, start with a small project, like painting a room. Even if you have some experience, such as you've assisted other people with remodeling projects in the past, you need to consider just how much you can handle. If you've never worked with plumbing, start with a smaller project than remodeling the kitchen.

, If you're not sure whether you have the skills, try working with someone you know who does have the skills. You can assist them on a project, which will let you know if you're up to the task of completing a similar task at home. Plus, you'll learn some new skills that you can apply to your home project.

, If you don't know how to use the power tools for the job, you may want to skip it unless you have the confidence to use tutorials to figure out how to use them. For instance, if you're not sure about how to use a power saw, you may want to skip projects that would require that tool until you learn more about it, as it can be very dangerous. Similarly, trying an electrical project without really knowing what you're doing can be very dangerous.It's also important to think about the safety of other people in your home. In other words, you need to know how to create a construction area that will be safe for everyone involved., Certain jobs are generally best left to professionals who have the training and experience, due to the fact that they need to be professionally designed. For example, doing jobs like electrical wiring and plumbing haphazardly will often mean it's not up to the code required by your city. In that case, it will need to be redone by a professional anyway, and by then, you've spent twice the money you would have in the first place.Jobs like electrical wiring, roofing, masonry, and plumbing should always be done by a professional unless you put in the hours to really learn what you're doing."

Check if the job requires a permit.,
Look at the building codes.,
Think about how much time you have.,
Take a hard look at your budget.,
Have a backup plan in place.",How to Determine if You Can Do a Home Remodel Yourself2," You can, of course, get a permit yourself to do the remodel job on your house. However, a contractor better understands what permits will be needed, and they will have an easier time navigating the system. If you don't want to deal with getting permits, leave the job to a professional.Many home remodel projects require permits, even something as simple as building a deck.
Check with your city's permit office to see if the project you're considering requires one.

, Many projects will require you to follow certain building codes. If you look at the building code for your project and you don't understand a word of it, the project may be out of your range at the moment., When considering a remodeling project, consider how much time you have to actually devote to the project. You may only have a few hours each week, or you may be willing to devote whole weekends to it. Either way, compare the time you have with the likely amount of time it will take to complete the project, as that can help you decide if you want to commit to the project., Even if you don't hire a professional, a remodel project can end up costing a lot more than you thought in the beginning. Make sure you have enough in your budget before you start to take care of unexpected expenses.Try taking your original estimation and doubling it. Do you still have enough to do the project?
For instance, if you estimate that you need $250 to re-tile the bathroom, you may or may not stay under that projection. When you pull up the tile, you may find that you also need to replace the sub-floor or frame underneath, which can significantly increase your costs. You may also find plumbing problems that need to be fixed, putting you well over your original estimate of $250.

, If you find you're in over your head, you need to have a plan in place of what to do. Maybe you can call in a more skilled friend for assistance, or maybe you'll need to hire a professional. Either way, you don't want to be stuck in the middle of a project that you can't complete.

Ask yourself whether it's worth the time.,
Consider whether the mess is worth it.,
Think about whether you'll actually save money.,
Don't do it just for the resell value.",How to Determine if You Can Do a Home Remodel Yourself3," You may be able to do a project yourself, but that doesn't mean you should. Consider the time and costs you'll entail doing yourself. If it's going to take you several weekends in a row or longer, is it worth it to you to do it yourself?Remember, time is money. If you're putting time into this project, that's time you don't have for other things, including your family and your job.

, Another factor to consider is the mess and complication it will add to your life. For instance, if you're working on the kitchen or a bathroom, the construction may make them unusable, meaning you'll have to find alternatives while you're working on the project., That is, you can save money by doing simple projects yourself, such as painting a room. However, professionals can often get better deals on materials, plus they'll have all the tools to do the project. You may find that it evens out when it comes to cost.Try comparing costs of doing it yourself to hiring a professional. Call around for professional estimates, and then compare that to what you estimate doing it yourself to cost. Don't forget to figure in more than you'll think you'll need, plus add in the cost of your time to the budget.
Keep in the mind that some projects may be cheaper to do yourself, while others will be cheaper to let a professional do them.

, While remodeling part of your home can increase the resell value of your home, often you won't recoup as much money as you put into the remodel. For instance, on projects like remodeling the kitchen or bathroom, you'll likely only get back about half of what you put into it."

Include storage, like a shelf or stackable totes, so you can keep your games orderly when they’re not being played.Small tokens or dice can be lost easily. You might want to have a separate sealable container to keep these from getting lost.
Some lamps or adjustable lighting can help set the tone for your games. Spooky games, for example, would benefit from dim lighting.

Hang posters of your favorite shows and movies from the walls.If you have enough space, you might install a projector in your attic. A sheet or a flat, white wall can be used as the projection screen.

, Due to the angle most roofs have, attics usually form a unique space. A couch, some chairs, and a coffee table will make this a great place where you and guests can enjoy each other’s company.In this room, you might want to keep a power strip with an extra phone charger plugged into it so guests can conveniently recharge if necessary.
Family photos, pictures from a memorable vacation, coffee table books, art, and so on can work well as conversation pieces. Decorate your hang out space with items like these.

, Set out a playmat or a low table so your kids have a place to draw, play board games, and so on. Storage for games and toys often fits nicely in corners or under sloping sections of the attic.To prevent your kids from being careless with their electronics, create a docking station near a wall outlet for storing and charging tablets, handheld games, and electronic toys.

Turn your attic into a home office.,
Store your books in an attic library.,
Turn your attic into a studio space.,
Add storage space to your home.",How to Use a Finished Attic3," Set up your desk and office chair. A wall clock can help you stay on task and keep track of time. Tuck a couch or comfortable chair into a corner or along a wall of your attic to make your office more homey and so you’ll have a place to rest if you get tired.If you don’t have water in your attic, a mini-fridge stocked with water bottles or a water cooler will prevent you from running downstairs and up again when you’re thirsty.
The temperature of some attics can be finicky. You might want to have a fan and space heater in your office for when it’s too warm or cold.

, Shelves can be built into the walls of your attic to give you plenty of storage for your library. If that sounds like too much trouble, many kinds of shelves can be bought at general retailers or furniture stores. Bookshelves can be made to fit your attic if you have an especially large collection.


Books are sensitive to humidity. You might want to buy and keep a dehumidifier in your library to prevent damage.
Include a comfortable armchair and a reading lamp to make your library into a reading room as well., If your attic receives good light, this can be an excellent space for a painting or photography studio. Since attics are usually somewhat isolated from the rest of the house, yours might be suited to being used as a music studio.Painting and photography supplies can be stored along a low part of the attic ceiling or in a corner. Arrange your work area in the spot with the best light.
If you intend on using the space for making music, you might want to improve sound insulation with things like thick carpets and wall hangings., Even if you don’t have any fancy plans for your attic, using it as extra storage space can be a lifesaver. Freestanding racks can be bought from most general retailers to make your attic into a closet space. Install adhesive hooks or wall hangers for hanging articles of clothing.


Bedrooms are often on higher floors. If one of these rooms is cramped, you might keep large items, like a dresser, in the attic. This way, there’ll be more space in the cramped room."

",How to Repair a Fiberglass Tub or Shower," You should make sure your shower or bathtub is fiberglass before going shopping, as these instructions will not give good results on cast iron or other types of fixtures.


Make sure your shower is fiberglass by tapping it with your knuckle or a wooden spoon or similar item which will not damage the finish. A fiberglass unit will have a soft, hollow, non-metallic sound, and depending on where you tap it, may even seem flexible.
Choose the appropriate color for the kit you will purchase. Most kits come with colorants (tinting products) to change the color of the product to match common colored fixtures, such as white, off white, or almond.
Make sure the kit you buy comes complete with everything you need, or purchase these materials and tools separately. The following is a list of what your kit may contain:

Polyester resin
Hardener (catalyst to harden the resin)
Fiberglass mesh or mat (for large or structural repairs)
Colorants
Sandpaper in assorted grits, from 80 grit (coarse) to 400 or 440 grit (very fine)
Thickener (to stiffen the resin for vertical applications)
Protective gloves resistant to the chemicals included in the kit
A mixing container and stirring tool


;
, Cut any jagged or protruding glass fibers around the damaged area, sand it lightly with a medium grit sandpaper to remove wax, oil, soap scum, or other surface contaminants, and rinse with acetone or another solvent to assure proper adhesion of the repair product.

, If it does not, skip to the step describing mixing and tinting instructions. If the crack is over one fourth of an inch (1/2 cm) wide, or is actually an open hole that the resin mixture will not fill alone, cut a piece of fiberglass mesh or cloth slightly larger than the hole. For large holes or cracks, more than one layer of cloth may be needed to get good results.

, Since individual products may vary, and measuring the materials you mix is essential, make sure you understand these instructions before proceeding.

, Place the container you will mix in (usually supplied in the kit you purchased) on this surface.

, Most kits have mixing proportions for fractional portions of the resin provided, such as 1/4th of the volume, 1/2, etc., mixed with an equal proportion of hardener.

, An example would be for almond, mix 5 parts white with 1 part brown, to 20 parts of resin. For basic white, use the white colorant added until the resin is thoroughly opaque. Mix these components thoroughly, and check the color against the fixture you are repairing before adding the hardener.

, Vertical surfaces need to be very stiff so the product does not sag, drip, or run. For horizontal repairs the material can be thinner, but it still should be stiff enough that it can be tooled smooth with the applicator.

, If you cannot find a workable proportion, you may have to make an educated guess as to how much you will need. Generally speaking, too much hardener will only accelerate the process, allowing less working time, and too little will delay the setting time. If you fail to add enough hardener to set the resin, however, it will remain tacky indefinitely. For a ball-park estimate, add 5 drops of hardener to each tablespoon of resin/colorant mixture.

, The longer you stir the material, the better the results will be, making sure that all of edges and corners are incorporated so that it hardens equally. Remember, though, that once you add the hardener, the reaction that solidifies the resin will begin, so you can only expect 10 to 15 minutes total working time before the resin becomes unusable.

, If you are using fiberglass cloth for your repair, place the piece you have cut over the damage, and press it into the resin repair mixture. Make sure you spread it evenly, and to a level slightly higher than the original surface so it can be sanded down and feathered smooth when you finish. Once the repair material is applied, allow it to harden, typically about 2 hours at room temperature.

, If you used fiberglass cloth, you may need to trim any fibers that are protruding with a sharp utility knife before sanding. Begin with a fairly coarse grit of sandpaper, depending on how much of the patch has to be removed to make it flush with the original surface. Work your way from a coarse or medium grit to a fine, then very fine grit sandpaper, until the repair is smooth. If you need to build up the repair further, mix another application and apply it to the damaged area, then repeat the sanding.

, You can apply this with a small artist's paintbrush, or if it is a small chip or ding, even a cotton swab will do. Smooth this application as much as possible, allow it to harden, then sand it with very fine sandpaper.

Measure the space you have for your mirror.,
Determine your budget.,
Consider what kind of frame you would like.,
Remember the mirror's purpose or function.,
Keep the style and shape of your mirror consistent with the bathroom décor.,
Decide on a mounting style.,
Before you buy, shop around.",How to Buy a Bathroom Mirror," Use a tape measure to get the height and width measurements of the space on the wall where you will hang or mount your mirror. Mirrors in the store will often look smaller than they do when you get them home and into your bathroom.


Keep the mirror from 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) from the ceiling. The mirror should not be taller than your vanity. Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of wall space on each side of the mirror as well.;
, Depending on the size and simplicity, the cost of a bathroom mirror can range from under $50 to over $1,000.


Set a budget before shopping so you know how much you can spend on the mirror. If you are buying a mirror just to update the space, decide on a range or a specific dollar amount that you will not go over.
Cut your budget in other places if you are remodeling the whole bathroom and you find an expensive mirror that you love. Reduce the amount you plan to spend on paint, lighting, or other fixtures to accommodate your mirror budget.

,


Create a custom frame using a designer at a frame shop or specialty store. You can select separate glass and frame details to create a unique look to the full mirror.
Choose a mirror without a frame if you prefer. Bathroom mirrors can be unframed, with only the mirrored glass to hang.
Purchase a mirror with the frame already built around it. The frames can be constructed of wood, metal, glass or other materials. Choose something that matches your bathroom décor.
If you are looking for a small, framed mirror that will mainly be used for shaving or applying makeup, you can purchase a mirror with extendable arms. It can be pushed against the wall to be out of the way, and pulled out into the position of your preference.

, Buy a simple mirror if you want it only to provide a reflection as you use your bathroom. If you want a mirror that does more, consider those that allow for storage, additional lighting, even a built-in television that reflects its picture on the mirror.

, This will keep the entire bathroom looking uniform and organized.


Adopt a current trend by selecting circular, unframed and beveled mirrors. This style will work well in a modern, updated bathroom that has neutral colors and polished brass or steel fixtures.
Use a wood or metal finish on your mirror and frame that coordinates with what you already have in your bathroom. If other parts of the bathroom are a light wood or a deep cherry color, match that with the mirror frame. If you have wallpaper, consider a painted frame that matches the pattern.

, If you plan to keep your mirror on the wall for a long as you are in the home, use permanent installation, such as glue or liquid nails. Use wire or mirror brackets if you plan to change the mirror or move in the near future. The hardware is less expensive, and much easier to install and take down.

, Check out hardware stores, bathroom design showrooms, online retailers and home and garden magazines.


Read product reviews, and talk to design professionals and sales associates in stores.
Ask about return policies and warranties. If you get the mirror home and into your bathroom and you hate it, or it breaks before you get it installed, you will want to be able to exchange it for something else.

Accessorize.",How to Remodel Your Bathroom on a Budget," Old tiles, cracked or broken tiles and missing grout let down the look of the bathroom. Fix everything that needs fixing first and you will be amazed at the improvement. It doesn't take long to learn how to tile and fix grout either––a little trial and error practicing and you'll soon feel comfortable doing it yourself. The main thing with tiling is to have patience and to observe accuracy without compromise––it's not a job you can rush.


Sometimes changing the color of the tiles can completely change the feel of the bathroom. The effort to do this can be well worth it, and tiles are generally quite affordable for the budget renovator.






If you need to fix the grout, see grouting a tile floor, regrouting tile, whitening grout and cleaning grout.





;
, A new coat of paint transforms a room. If your bathroom walls are covered in wallpaper, remove the old paper with a steamer (you can rent one for the weekend.) If you're painting over paint, remove all flaked, sticky, dirty areas by cleaning and lightly sanding over them. Ensure that the walls are free of mildew and damp before painting––if you do have recurring mildew, check the source and add mildew inhibitor to your paint.


Place painter's masking tape over all edges you don't want painted (moldings, tiles, wood, etc.) and cover furnishings, the tub and shower, etc. with drop cloths to catch paint splashes. Paint stains cheapen the finished look, so avoid them in the first place.






Neutral colors are best for longevity of bathroom style, particularly when selling the house. Stick to creams, beiges, whites and other low-key colors and use accessories to add splashes of color to the bathroom.






Consider contrasting paint colors to highlight areas, such as window sills and bathroom cabinets, where relevant and appropriate.






Wait for the sales on paint if you're really wanting to save a lot. If you know a painter, you might be able to get trade prices if he or she is willing to help buy it for you.

, Sand the wood on your existing cabinets and stain it, or sand the wood and repaint it with a color that complements the bathroom walls. Be sure to use waterproof latex paint and consider using white paint.

Fix any dents or broken parts of wood cabinets before painting, staining or varnishing them. Dents can be done using wood putty of the same color and then painted over. Loose parts should be nailed or glued back into place firmly. Anything loose should be screwed back on the wall or other backing to avoid any further loosening.






You can add splashes of color to your remodeled room with towels, curtains and rugs.

, Instead of buying new lumber, remove the old trim carefully. Remove the paint with a heat gun, sand the pieces and repaint or apply a varnish. The trim will look new at a fraction of the cost.

, Buy new cabinet and door handles, new towel racks and new light fixtures. Add a new mirror and your bathroom will have a whole new look. New doesn’t have to be “brand new.” Shop around at flea markets and thrift stores, check Freecycle or online auctions, and you can find both antique and modern fixtures for a bargain.


Never underestimate the power of changing door handles. A dingy old cabinet that is repainted and has a total handle change (using modern handles) can look like a completely new cabinet!
Feel free to improve on used finds––paint, varnish, mosaic and other finishes can turn them into something amazing.

, You can upgrade your shower and tub fixtures in an afternoon. Most of these kits come with a very detailed set of instructions.


Changing the taps/faucets, shower head and soap holders can really lift a bathroom. Be sure to match the colors though––having some brass and some silver looks mismatched and is something that you can easily remedy.






What do you do if you want to replace, say the shower cubicle, but not the bath, but the colors are a mismatch? Try painting or re-tiling with colors that do match, to draw away the eye from the mismatch. In the case of bathtubs, these can be repainted using specialist paints and a lot of grunt. Even plastic or acrylic bathtubs can be recolored if need be.







, People always look closely at a bathroom floor because it shouts hygiene (or lack of it). Therefore, it pays to have it present in the best way possible.

If your bathroom has a wood floor, rent a sander for the weekend and refurbish the floor. After sanding, apply 2 or 3 thin coats of varnish; your floor will look brand new.






If your floor has one or more layers of old linoleum, you can remove the linoleum (using a sharp utility knife) and either refinish the wood floor underneath, or replace the linoleum with inexpensive vinyl tiles.
For tiling, see above.
Number one rule––always remove carpet from a bathroom, especially if you're selling the place. While it was fashionable some decades ago to carpet bathrooms, it's never appealing to buyers due to the moisture and mildew factor, as well as the presentation. Tiles or wood flooring make far better options for the floor of a bathroom.

, Replace all your towels, curtains and rugs. Buy a new shower curtain and curtain rings. You can purchase everything separately, or shop for coordinating sets. Add a few pictures or plaques on the wall (but don't overdo it). Buy a new hamper and wastebasket. An assortment of new accessories can uplift the look of your bathroom even if you don’t touch the walls and floor.

Check the length of your shower curtain.,
Measure your space to ensure the curtain will hang properly.,
Add approximately 4 inches onto the curtain’s length.,
Use a tape measure to measure and mark the installation height.,
Increase the rod’s length by twisting counterclockwise.,
Expand the rod until both ends are fixed in the marked location.,
Confirm the rod is suitable for the space by testing the tension.,
Use a level to make sure the rod is perfectly straight.,
Check your hardware.,
Drill each bracket into the wall.,
Fit each end of the rod into the brackets.Once in place, make sure that your hardware is firmly installed and holding the rod securely before attempting to hang the curtain and liner.,
Place your shower curtain hooks on the rod.,
Line up the left edge of your liner and your curtain.,
Thread the shower curtain hooks/rings through the curtain and liner.,
Confirm that the rod is sturdy and the curtain slides easily.",How to Install a Shower Curtain," If it’s new, the curtain’s length will be listed on the packaging. Otherwise, you’ll need to measure it yourself using a tape measure. The standard shower curtain size is 74 inches x 74 inches – a perfect square., There should be 2 inches of space between the floor and the shower curtain. To effectively contain moisture, the curtain needs to hang at least 5 inches below the edge of the bathtub.The two inches of space between the curtain and floor prevents the bottom of the curtain from collecting too much moisture and dirt.

, This will give you a rough installation height for the curtain rod. You may need to adjust up or down slightly to meet your individual needs, but in general adding 4 inches onto the curtain length should give you a proper placement.

, Determine the spot on each shower wall where the rod should be suspended by using a tape measure. Mark the spot on each side by making a small dot with a sharpie. These dots are where the ends of the rod will be placed.

, Tension rods are made of two interlocking shafts. Find the point where the two shafts fit together and place one hand on either side of this point. Twist counterclockwise to lengthen the rod.


A tension rod is not fixed permanently to the walls. It is held in place by a strong spring inside the rod, which applies enough pressure on the walls to hold it in place.Twisting clockwise will shorten the curtain rod.

, Continue expanding the length of the rod by twisting counterclockwise until both ends meet the shower wall. Adjust the placement of the ends until they are exactly where you want them. Then expand the rod a little more until the tension creates a stable hold on both sides of the shower.


In general, tension rods can be adjusted to fit the width of most spaces without requiring any measurement beforehand.If you do want to measure beforehand, the rod’s final length should be approximately 1 inch longer than the space it will occupy to maintain a snug fit., Double check the tension by twisting clockwise to shorten the rod back into its original position, then repeat the process again. Confirm that the rod feels firmly affixed in place after repeating the process.


The more you have to lengthen the tension rod to fit in place, the less stable its hold will be.
If your rod is unable to maintain a strong hold, you probably need to get a longer tension rod.

, Take a level and hold it horizontally. Place the flat top of the level directly against the rod in the center. The tiny bubble will tell you if the rod is straight or crook.


Tweak slightly to make it straight, if necessary.

, Shower curtain rods meant to be permanently affixed to opposing walls will come with accompanying hardware. Every kit is different, but in general you should have 2 brackets and at least 8 screws to keep the brackets on the wall.

, After measuring and marking your installation height, follow the specific installation instructions that came with your rod to mount the brackets. In most cases, you’ll be using a drill to mount the brackets in the pre-measured spaces.


If you have dry wall you will need to use anchors with your brackets.Learn more about using dry wall anchors here.

, If any screws are loose, use your drill to tighten them to the wall.

, The standard number of shower curtain hooks needed is 12 and they are generally sold in sets by the dozen for convenience. If you’re using hooks that have some sort of decoration or embellishment, make sure the decoration side is facing out into the bathroom, not inward facing the shower.


These also come in ring form. The rings snap open and closed easily. Unsnap to open them, hang them on the rod, but do not snap them closed them yet.
Once you have the hooks/rings on the rod, make sure that they fit properly and slide easily along the curtain rod.
Most come in standard sizes that fit most curtain holes and rods, but if you’re using hooks/rings that are very large or very small, you may want to measure the size of the holes before you buy rings to make sure they will fit., Make sure the curtain is on top of the liner, closest to you. The liner will go beneath it. Find the holes on the top left edge of both pieces and line the holes up so that one ring can pass through both holes.


Liners are usually clear plastic and they act as a barrier between the shower and the curtain.
Liners aren’t required, but they are practical and commonly used, especially with shower curtains that are made of fabric that isn’t waterproof.

, Starting from the left side, thread one ring through the holes of both the curtain and the liner. Then move on to the next hole, repeating the same process. Continue threading until all 12 rings have been threaded through all 12 holes.


If you are using curtain rings, snap each ring closed after you thread it through.
Double check that the liner is on the wet side of the shower and the curtain is on the dry side, facing out into the bathroom.

, Arrange the curtain and liner as you normally would, and take a close look. Is the rod easily supporting their weight? Give a little tug, if necessary, to test the tension. Then slide the curtain open, testing that the hooks/rings move easily down the rod.


If the rod cannot support the weight, you may need to get a longer or more sturdily built tension rod.
If the curtain and liner aren’t sliding easily down the rod, you may need bigger hooks/rings to properly fit the rod.

Let the waterproofing dry.",How to Waterproof a Shower," If you’re in the process of building the entire bathroom from scratch, you’ll need to start by laying the foundation for the walls around what will be the shower stall. To do this, you can install cement or fiber backing board. The rest of the waterproofing materials will be applied directly to this wall backing.Another option is to put in ordinary drywall, then cover it with mortar to provide a layer of water-resistant protection.
Even though materials like concrete backing board are designed not to swell, split or mold when they come into contact with moisture, it’s highly recommended that you take the time to treat them with liquid waterproofing to ensure that they’ll last.;
, Measure the shower stall and use a pencil to mark the exact dimensions along the backing board. Then, run a strip of painter’s tape along the markings you made to create an outline. This will make it clear where the waterproofing materials are needed.It’s a good idea to extend your waterproofing an inch or so beyond the boundaries of the shower stall itself, just to be on the safe side.

, First, measure and trim the membrane to fit the flat sections of the walls, marking to indicate where key fixtures like the valve, shower head and temperature knobs will be situated. Cut the membrane into long, thin strips to fit the corners where the shower walls meet.Reinforcing membranes are typically made from tightly-woven fibers. When sandwiched between layers of liquid waterproofing, they’ll provide an additional layer of water-stopping protection.Leave 2-3 between the membrane and the corners and edges of the shower stall. A little blank space will make it easier to waterproof these areas separately later on.

, Once you've modified the membrane to the appropriate size, cut a large X-shaped slit in each of the spots you marked. When it comes time to install the fixtures later on, you'll be able to easily fit them into place over the membrane without losing an inch of waterproofing surface area.If you already have a showerhead, faucet and knobs picked out, measure them around the base before you cut the slits so you don't have to make them any bigger than necessary.
Do your cutting with an Xacto or craft knife, and place the membrane on a hard, flat surface that you don't have to worry about scarring up.

, Brush the waterproofing over the entire wall using a roller or handheld brush. Make sure it forms a thick, even coat, with no obvious gaps or bare spots.Paint-on waterproofing products contain liquid rubber, which both acts as an adhesive for the membrane and a forms a bond that’s too tight for moisture to penetrate., Carefully position the precut membrane and stick it to the wall by hand, starting at the top. Once it’s secure, go over it a few times using the flat side of a trowel to work out any creases or air bubbles.

You may need to use a liberal amount of waterproofing in order to get the membrane sheet to stick.
To help the membrane conform to the corners of the stall, try folding the strips in half widthwise or scoring the backside lightly so that they sit at a 90 degree angle.

, Apply the second coat directly over the reinforcing membrane. By the time you’re finished, the brightly-colored membrane should no longer be visible underneath.Avoid totally covering up the valve and fixture sites. You’ll need to be able to find these later once it comes time to install the finished surface.
Brush on the followup coat in the opposite direction of the initial coat. For instance, if you used vertical strokes to apply the first coat, use horizontal strokes for the second one. This will help create a better seal.

, Depending on the size of the shower and the thickness of the adhesive, this may take several hours. In the meantime, be careful not to touch the materials. Doing so may wear down the waterproof coating or cause the reinforcing membrane to come loose.

It may be a good idea to begin your project in the afternoon or evening, then wait until the following day to complete it.

, Set the sloped tray on top of the subflooring at the base of the shower stall. If your shower’s floor pan comes in multiple sections, make sure they’re properly aligned and locked before moving on. Use the circular template included with the installation kit to make a small mark or notch in the subflooring where the drain will be centered.Be sure to arrange the opening for the drain on the same side that the showerhead will be on.
Floor trays are included in most shower installation kits. They are typically sold pre-sized and ready to go.

, Remove the floor tray and find the place where you marked the drain. Fit an electric drill with a 4” hole saw attachment. Place the drill head flush against the subflooring and begin drilling, applying constant pressure all the way through.When you’re done, wipe the subflooring with a damp cloth to pick up any sawdust that’s collected nearby.

, Brush on the waterproofing the same way you did with the walls. Aim for a thick coat and even coverage.A handheld brush will be your best bet for applying the waterproofing to the floor.

, In addition to the tray itself, you’ll need to lay strips over the cracks where the floor and walls connect. Afterwards, measure and cut a large hole to fit precisely over the drain opening. Finish by applying one last coat of waterproofing over the entire floor.If the membrane you’re using isn’t large enough to cover the floor in one piece, you can trim and overlap multiple sections to get just the right size.
For showers with sliding doors, place a strip around the lip of the stall where you enter., Once the materials have had time to set up, they’ll prevent water from seeping into the wall behind and beneath the shower stall. You’ll then be ready to install eye-catching tile or a vinyl or acrylic liner. Enjoy a hot shower as a reward for a job well done!Perform at least one one “flood test” when you’re finished to determine whether you’ve waterproofed all parts of the shower stall successfully.
Don’t forget to later set the drain, showerhead and other fixtures in the openings you left for them.

Look to see if you have any leaky pipes.
If it is from heavy rains, check to see if it's weeping or seeping from the walls or if it is coming from your sump pump. Often times large amounts of water or poorly-maintained filters inside the sump pump can burn up the motor and cause it to quit functioning. If that happens, water is not being routed out of the basement adequately, which can lead to flooding.
If the water seems like it is coming from the walls, check your downspouts. In older homes with downspouts that have been buried, tree roots can interfere with water dispersal, and the water can be backing up into your basement.
Check the grade of the ground around the outside of your home. If the grade tends to slope toward the house, water will filter toward your home and follow the path of least resistance.;
,


If it's a leaky pipe, turn off your main water shut off for the home until you can have a licensed plumber address the issue.
For a malfunctioning sump pump, first, make sure that the sump pump is plugged in to the outlet. Check the filter and clean out the sediment as needed.
Fix your downspouts as needed. Consult a specialist at your local home improvement store to address questions and/or concerns as to what the best replacement method will be.
For issues with the grade of the ground around your home, you will need to add fill dirt to make sure that the ground slopes away from the home.

This is also a good time to think about new faucets, towel rods, door knobs, tiles, and so forth. Great places to get ideas include websites such as Pinterest and home design magazines. Be sure to save pictures of bathrooms you like. Here are some other design ideas to get you started:


Go with a theme, such as country or ocean. Write down things that might go with that theme, such as rustic wood, lavender, lighthouses, or starfish.
Go with a color scheme, such as all blues or all greens.
Go with a limited, modern look or an ornate, old-fashioned look.;
, The more you plan on doing to your bathroom, the more money you will have to spend. Something simple as changing out a light bulb or faucet probably won't be very expensive. Things such as adding a shower, or removing a wall, however, may require a higher budget.


Just because something is out of your budget does not mean that you should abandon your design. You could always go for a cheaper item that looks similar, or buy the item when it goes on sale. Many hardware stores also offer promotions and coupons.

, There are different types of renovations, and each requires a different amount of work, time, and money. Some renovations may also require the aid of a trained professional, for which you will need to hire a contractor.


Simple renovations include things like painting the walls, adding faucets, or changing the towel rack and lights. This sort of work can be done by anyone, and won't take very long.
Complex renovations include things like removing or adding walls, replacing bathtubs, adding a shower, or moving a toilet to another spot. These sorts of renovations require a contractor to do the work for you, and may require some time to complete.

, Things like switching out old light bulbs for new ones won't take that much time or effort. Changing a bathtub or moving a toilet also won't take much work from you, because they will be completed by a trained professional instead. Painting and adding new tiles, however, may take a lot of time and effort, especially if you choose to do the work yourself. For example, paint needs time to dry, and tiles need to be laid out in grout. This may also affect your budget.


You can do most of the work yourself, but it will take a lot of time and effort. It will, however, be much cheaper than hiring someone to do it for you.
You can also hire a professional instead. This may cost you more money, but you won't have to lift a finger or get dirty. Most professionals get their work completely quickly, because they have done it many times before.
Just because a bathroom is small does not mean that it will be finished sooner. If you need to order supplies, such as tiles, a small bathroom can take just as much time as a large bathroom., If you don't know where to begin when it comes to design work, you could hire an architect or interior designer to design a bathroom for you. He or she will know how to work with different colors and materials to create something visually pleasing. The architect or designer will also know how to place things in your bathroom to make them more efficient.

, If you need to do anything to the plumbing or electrical wires, you will need to hire a contractor. He or she will then take care of hiring workers, salaries, working hours, and so forth.

, Some places require certain rooms, such as bathrooms, to be a specific size. If the final design does not meat the requirements, the city won't approve your re-design, and you won't be able to renovate your bathroom. Be sure to check with your city if you plan on re-sizing your bathroom, and make sure that your design is meeting the building code. Here are some other things to keep in mind:Half baths usually range between 3 to 4 feet wide and 6 to 8 feet long in the United States. The larger the half bath is, the more comfortable it will be.

, Master bathrooms are meant to be used by two people. If planned correctly, they can be quite comfortable and roomy. If planned incorrectly, however, they can become cramped and lead to unnecessary elbow-jostling. Here are some ideas to get you started:Consider adding in a separate toilet room with a door; this will give you and your partner more privacy.
Having both a shower stall and a bathtub will allow two people to get clean at the same time.
If you choose to have two sinks, make sure that they are at least 36 inches (91.44 centimeters) apart. This will give both people enough space to spread out and not worry about bumping elbows.
Be sure to include pathways. If two people are going to be using the bathroom at the same time, they will need enough space to pass by each other. Plan on having 36 to 42 inches (91.44 to 116.84 centimeters) wide pathways in the bathroom.

, This is especially important if you are making renovations that involve plumbing. The last thing you'd want is to be stuck without a toilet or shower for several days. If you don't have a spare bathroom, you may need to install a portable toilet and an outdoor shower.

, You will also need to know the dimensions of other things, such as toilets, bathtubs, sinks, showers, and cabinets.If you don't take proper measurements, you may buy something in the wrong size. Taking measurements early will prevent the hassle of trying to return something that doesn't fit.

, There are different types of floor material that you can use in a bathroom. In general, what you pay is what you get. If you want something that looks good, is high quality, and lasts for a long time, you will need a larger budget. Here's some things to keep in mind:Porcelain and glazed tiles are easy to clean and take care of.
Marble and granite are expensive, but they look great.
Avoid porous stone, such as limestone. They absorb stains easily, which makes them difficult to clean. If you want a natural stone, then make sure that it is sealed.
Try to get something that is non-slip. Look for textured or matte finishes, or glazes that have sand in them.
Keep painted or stained cement in mind.
You can also get sheet vinyl or vinyl tiles. They are less expensive than the real thing, but they may not look or feel as great either.

, Because bathrooms get damp, wallpaper is not a good idea.The best paint to use for a bathroom is something that is either semi-glossy or satin; both are resistant to frequent cleaning and touching. Textured paint is also a great option if you are re-painting an old surface; the texture will conceal any bumps and imperfections. Whatever paint you decide to use, make sure that it is intended for bathrooms, and is both moisture and mildew proof.


Use light colors, such as sky blue, sea foam green, or lavender, if you have a small bathroom. They will make your bathroom appear bigger than it actually is.
Use darker colors to make large bathrooms appear smaller and cozier.
Go for gray or white if you can't decide. They are common bathroom colors.
Consider adding accent or trim colors to match your decor and towels.

, There are different types of materials you can use for your counter, if you choose to have one. Here are some things to get you started:Natural stone looks and feels luxurious. It is very beautiful, but it needs to be sealed properly so that it does not soak up stains. The drawback is that it can only come in flat slabs.
Resin is great for counters with irregular shapes. They are a great choice if you want to have a sink molded right into the counter. They can be made to resemble almost any material and don't need to be sealed. Despite this, they don't have the beauty of natural stone.
Laminate counters are cheap and come in many different finishes. They are also stain and scratch resistant. Unfortunately, they can also fade and deteriorate over time.
Consider covering your counter with porcelain or glazed tile. This will make it durable, and easier to clean.

, There are different types of tubs, sinks, and showers. For example, some types of sinks and tubs are free-standing and can be moved around if needed. Other types are directly molded into the counter or wall. Here are some things to keep in mind:Pedestal sinks look elegant and take up little space, but they won't fit in a counter, and you can't place a cabinet under them. You will need to install cabinets and counters in other parts of your bathroom.
Vessels and bowls are popular sink choices. They sit right on top of a counter. The downside is that you will need to clean under them, and you can't just wipe things off the counter and into the sink, like you would with a molded sink.
Molded sinks are often set right into the vanity. They are the most common, but also the most convenient.
Claw-foot bathtubs are free-standing and classical. They are often made from porcelain and can hold heat better. You will need to add a drain in the floor to catch any spilled water.
Molded bathtubs sit right on the floor, and are the most common. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Some even include fancy features, such as benches for shaving on and jet streams.
When you go to buy a bathtub, you might also want to sit in it to make sure that it is comfortable. After all, you will likely sit in your bathtub while using it at home., This includes things like storage units, caddies, cabinets, and shelving. You want your storage to look good and be functional. You should be able to reach your cabinets and shelves easily, and have access to them when you need to. You also want your storage to fit everything it needs to fit.


Cabinets don't always have to stick straight out of the wall. Consider having some cabinets recessed into the wall. This will save some space., Lighting is very important. If there is not enough lighting, then your bathroom could become dangerous. Take advantage of natural light first by letting as much of it in as possible. Plan on having at least 4 watts of artificial light per square foot.


You can let lots of natural light into your bathroom with skylights.

, Poor ventilation will lead to mould, decay, rot, and smells. Having vents, windows, and fans is always a good idea. When choosing a fan, consider getting a quiet one for master bathrooms, so that you don't wake your significant other if you have to use the restroom at night. Get a noisier one for powder rooms; the noise will give the guest more privacy, especially if the bathroom is close to a living room., This will include things such as towels, wash cloths, and bath mats. It will also include things like soap dispensers, mirrors, and towel racks. Try buying these items when they go on sale. They can be inexpensive, but the price will add up.

, You can find them behind toilets and under sinks. If you don't do this, you might end up with a flood.

, If you are painting your bathroom, you will want to cover the floors, sinks, counters, toilets, and light switches so that they don't get dirty. You can use paper, cardboard, or plastic sheeting. Be sure to tape the edges down so that the paint or dust doesn't get underneath is.


If you are removing any knobs, faucets, light switches, or towel rods, be sure to put them into a box so that they stay together. This is especially important if you plan on using these items again.

, This includes faucets, towel rods, and toilets. The less clutter you have in your bathroom, the easier your renovation will be. You can either donate the items you won't be using anymore, sell them online, or dispose of them according to your city's requirements. Some places will ask you to leave the item outside your home so that it can be picked up and disposed of, while others will require you to take it to a facility.

, Use a paint roller, and be sure to let each layer dry completely before adding another. Most paints will dry between two to four hours, but you might want to refer to the label on your can of paint for more specific drying times. If you don't do this, the paint may not cure properly and become sticky or bumpy.


Leave the last coat of paint until after you have installed all cabinets, shelves, sinks, and tubs.

, This also includes the backsplash tile behind the sink. If you are not changing the floors, then you can remove any protective coverings off the floor at this time.

, You will most likely need to hire a plumber to do this step for you, especially if you are going to move a toilet, sink, tub, or shower from one side of the bathroom to the other. After you have installed the toilet, sink, tub, or shower, be sure to caulk around the edges so that moisture doesn't seep through. If you don't caulk, water will get into the floor and cause mildew.

, You can place these wherever you want in your bathroom, but keep in mind that you will need to reach these items easily. Here are some guidelines for to get you started:Towel rods should be placed about 4 feet (1.22 meters) above the floor.
The top of a cabinet should be about 6 feet (1.83 meters) above the floor.
Place the toilet paper roll holder 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) in front of the toilet.

, Be sure to properly caulk around the faucets after you install them. When buying caulk, try to get an acrylic or hybrid formula. They don't need chemicals to remove. This will make any future re-caulking easier.

, When you are done renovating your bathroom, peel off any leftover painter's tape and discard any sheets of plastic or paper. Be sure to wipe down the counters and sinks, and to vacuum or mop the floors. This will make your bathroom look better and give it that nice, finishing touch.

Open the bolt caps to gain access to the seat fasteners, if necessary.,
Grip the nut fastening the bolt firmly.,
Unfasten the bolts with the appropriate tool.,
Remove the seat from the toilet.",How to Remove a Toilet Seat1," These are located at the back of the seat, where the seat hinges. Some toilets may not have plastic covers for the bolts. If yours does, open these covers by prying upwards on them with your finger or a screwdriver.


Use light pressure when opening the bolt covers. Generally, it takes little pressure to open these, and using too much force may cause damage to them.;
, You should find a nut screwed onto the threaded end of each bolt. Some nuts may have a shape similar to a wing nut, allowing you to hold it in place by hand. If you have a weak grip, the nut is not wing nut shaped, or the nut is stuck, try gripping it with a pair of pliers.


The fasteners of your toilet seat may be plastic. Use light to moderate pressure when removing plastic hardware to keep it from breaking or deforming., In most cases, you’ll need to unscrew bolts with a standard screwdriver. While holding the nut on the threaded end of the bolt, insert your screwdriver into the bolt head and turn it counterclockwise to unscrew the bolt.


Screwdrivers that are too small can cause the bolt head to deform, especially if the bolt is plastic. Use the largest size screwdriver that will fit your bolt head for best results., Collect the nuts, bolts, and any loose plastic or metal hardware (like the bolt covers) that also goes with the seat. Put these small pieces into a sealable plastic bag and tape them to the seat so they don’t become lost. Your toilet seat is removed, now you can install a new one.

Lubricate corroded metal hardware with a penetrating oil.,
Secure the seat with tape.,
Remove bolts with a socket set.,
Cut through unmoving hardware with a hack saw.,
Drill through resistant bolts as a last resort.",How to Remove a Toilet Seat2," Penetrating oil, like WD40, is intended to revitalize metal parts that have rusted. Spray metal hardware, like nuts and bolts, thoroughly with this oil to lubricate them so you can remove them more easily.


Wait about 5 to 10 minutes for the penetrating oil to seep into the narrow spaces of the hardware and break up corrosion.
If you don’t have penetrating oil on hand, you can mix together a solution that is 90% vegetable oil and 10% acetone to make your own., While applying various stubborn seat removal techniques, it’s likely you’ll jostle the seat or push against it. Depending on your situation and the kind of fasteners used to attach the seat, you may want to tape the lid and seat together in a closed or open position.


If your situation requires you to cut or drill off bolts to remove the seat, you may want to tape a cover material, like cardboard, in place to protect the porcelain of the toilet and the plastic of the seat as well., In some cases, you may be able to directly fit your socket wrench onto the nuts holding bolts in place. Some toilet designs may require a deep socket or socket extension for you to reach the nut. Turn the socket counterclockwise firmly to break loose the nut.Apply steady moderate force with your socket wrench. If the nut doesn’t loosen, intensify the force on your wrench to high for a very short interval. Do this several times until the nut loosens.
If the nut and bolt are already loose, the bolt may turn with the nut when you attempt to loosen it. Insert a screwdriver into the head of the bolt to hold it in place, then loosen the nut with your socket wrench.

, Take a broad knife, like a putty knife, and position it so it covers the porcelain of the toilet around the head of a bolt. This will protect against accidental scratches when you saw. Cut away at the hardware fastening the seat to your toilet a little bit at a time with the hack saw. This process may take a while.A regular hack saw will be able cut through unmoving toilet seat hardware, but a mini one will be easier to use in the narrow space.
Depending on the hinge of your toilet seat and the hardware connecting the seat to the toilet, you may have to cut through the hinge and the bolt or the bolt alone.

, Put on safety glasses. Insert a thin drill bit, like on that is 1/16 in (1.59 mm) thick, into your drill.Drill into the bolt with firm, steady pressure where the nut and bolt meet. Drill through the nut completely, then use increasingly larger drill bits to widen the hole. Remove the nut when it comes loose.


Save this technique as a last resort because there is a possibility that the drill bit might slip, causing damage to the porcelain or the seat.
When you’ve almost drilled through the entire nut, be very careful. Drilling into the porcelain or the seat may cause unsightly damage.
Drilled metal may have burrs or jagged edges that can cut you. Handle drilled metal with gloves.
Use pliers to try to pull the bolt off. Continue enlarging the hole as necessary and pulling at the nut with pliers until it comes free."

Clean the seat and its hardware regularly.,
Tighten nuts with rubber bushings.,
Add seat stabilizers to loose seats.,
Replace worn out parts.",How to Remove a Toilet Seat3," Dirtiness and buildup can contribute to the corrosion and degradation of your toilet seat and its hardware. For this reason, you should clean it regularly with a suitable general purpose bathroom cleaner.Check cleaners before using them on toilet porcelain or the seat itself. In many cases, abrasive cleaners should not be used on toilet seats. Check the labels of cleaners to verify their suitability.

, Rubber bushings can be bought at your local hardware store or home center. Slide the circular, rubber bushings up the threading side of the bolt with the tapered side of the bushing facing up at the toilet. Then tighten the nut with the tightening tool that came with the bushings.Many hardware stores will sell this product under a name like ""Toilet Seat Tightening/Fastening Kit.""

, Seat stabilizers can also be purchased at your local hardware store. Fasten these to seats that wiggle back and forth. The stabilizers should touch the inner rim of the toilet bowl. When the stabilizers are in position, fasten them permanently in place with the screws that came with the stabilizers., Over time, usage can wear out parts or weaken them. Thinness, brittleness, and visible discoloration are good indications that plastic needs to be replaced. Cracked plastic should also be replaced immediately.


Inspect other parts, like the hinges, the fasteners on the bottom of the seat, and the nut on the threaded end of the bolt. Replacing these before they degrade could save you a lot of trouble."

Determine the placement of the bathroom plumbing fixtures.,
Turn off the water to the house.,
Install the water lines.,
Connect the drain lines.,
Set the toilet in place.,
Install the sink.,
Hook up a tub and shower unit.",How to Plumb a Bathroom1,"


You will need to figure out the placement of your bathtub or shower, sink and toilet. This will determine where you will need to run the plumbing lines.
You will have to cut holes in the floor so that you can run the pipes to the fixtures, so determining the exact placement is important.
Locate and carefully mark all cut points and drill points
Measure again to make sure your markings are accurate. ""Measure twice, cut once"" may be an old saw, but it still has teeth.
Do all the cutting and drilling necessary. You want to do the prep work before you turn off the water, to minimize your ""dry"" time.;
,


Before doing any work on your plumbing, you will need to turn off the bathroom water lines. Locate the water valves and turn them off.

,


You will need to run 5 water lines into a standard bathroom: a hot and cold line for both the bathtub/shower and the sink, and a cold water line for the toilet.
You can either run these lines through the wall or up from the floor, depending on the location of your bathroom.
Attach flexible lines from the hot and cold waters line to the sink and bathtub faucets.
Using sandpaper, clean the copper pipes to make them smooth, and then solder the lines to the main water line.

,









For your bathroom, you will need multiple sizes of drain lines. The drain line for the toilet should be either a 3 inch (7.62 cm) or 4 inch (10.16 cm) line. After you attach the pipe to the toilet drain, the pipe should slope downwards toward the main drain line. The sink drain line will be 1.5 inches (3.81 cm) and the bathtub will use a 2 inch (5.08 cm) drain line.

, Toilets usually come in 2 pieces: a tank and a bowl. Start by installing the bowl.









Connect the closet flange from the waste pipe to your toilet. To do so, glue the closet flange into place so that the slots line up with the toilet's bolt holes.
Set the bowl over the bolts and on the flange. You may want to sit on the toilet and rock back and forth a bit to get it on correctly.
Check if the bowl is level, and then tighten the nuts and the washers of the closet bolts.
Attach the toilet's tank to the bowl using nuts.
Connect the water line and then caulk around the base of the bowl to secure the toilet.

, Start by positioning the stand to do a test fit.









Mark where the floor bolt should go and drill a hole through the sink stand and fasten it to floor using a nut and bolt.
Connect the sink to the hot and cold water lines. Also connect the handles, stopper and drain to the top portion of the sink.
Set the sink onto the stand and glue an adapter with threads to the drain pipe.

,









Mark the outline of the tub on the floor so that you can estimate where the drain will be.
Run the drain line and dry fit it.
Once you have it lined up, glue the waste line to connect to the tub's drain.
Set the tub and check that it is level.

Ensure your floor can support the weight of a shower before beginning construction because the concrete can be quite heavy.,
Prepare your shower drain prior to pouring the concrete or hire a professional plumber to install the drain you plan to use.,
Install the drain using PVC cement or use PVC connectors if your pipes are not PVC.,
Check local building codes to assure you are using liner that meets thickness requirements, and that the depth of your shower pan is sufficient.

,
Use 2x4 wood planks to build the shower floor frame for your concrete pour.

,
Spread the rubber membrane over your frame, with the edges overlapping the form by at least 10 inches (2.54 dm.),
Flatten the membrane snugly against the bottom of the frame, and then attach the material to the walls by nailing it at stud points at least 8-inches (2.03 dm) above the floor.,
Cut a hole in the membrane over the drain using a utility knife so any water that leaks through the concrete will be directed down the drain.

,
Attach the second part of the drain to the first part using the screws or bolts provided.

,
Screw in the drain to a height of about 1 1/4 inches (0.32 dm) to leave room for the concrete.

,
Cover the drain thoroughly with duct tape to protect it during the concrete pour.

,
Mix your concrete according to the manufacturer's instructions.,
Pour your concrete, spreading it out smoothly with a trowel.,
Clean all concrete from the drain.

,
Allow the concrete to cure for two to three days before tiling.",How to Make a Shower Pan,"


It may be a good idea to reinforce the floor below the shower pan with exterior grade plywood.;
,


You will need a two-piece drain.
One piece of the drain will sit flush with the floor and connect to drainage pipes beneath the surface.
The second drain piece will be on top of the membrane liner and poured cement.

,


Follow the PVC cement manufacturer directions to connect the drain and pipe.

,,,


Be sure there's enough material on all sides to extend up the wall to the correct height.

,


Local building codes requirements may vary.
Use nails with large heads to attach the liner to the wall.

,,,,,


A sandy mix concrete will dry to a good, smooth surface.

,


The concrete should slope from a 2 1/2-inch (0.64 dm) height around the outer edges of the shower pan to 1 1/4 inches (0.32 dm) around the drain.

,,


Be sure to seal your tile and grout with at least two coats to help repel the shower water.

Use a plunger on your toilet if it should get clogged.,
Unclog the sink using a plunger or an auger.,
Use a hose for the floor drain.,
Clear the bathtub drain using an auger.",How to Plumb a Bathroom2,"


Once the plumbing in your bathroom is complete, you may still run into problems in the future.
To unclog a toilet, press a plunger against the hole and push the plunger up and down.
If that does not work, you can use a closet auger, which has a coil at the end that goes into the toilet, and a handle at the other end which makes the coil go deeper into the pipes.

,


If your sink clogs, you can use the plunger or with an auger.
You can also clean out the trap under the sink by removing the cover to the trap. It will be located at the bottom of the pipe right before it enters the wall.
Stick a hanger or a wire through the trap to see if you can pull anything out. If that does not work, disconnect the pipe using a wrench and clean it out using detergent.

,


Remove the strainer for the floor drain and push the hose into it as far down as it will go.
Stuff rags around the hose at the drain entrance to close up the hole.
Turn the water on at full force and then turn it off again.
Continue turning it on and off until the water flows freely through it.

,


For the bathtub drain, unscrew the overflow plate and lift it out. Run the coil for the auger through the pipe to unclog the drain.

If you are replacing a bathtub with a steam shower unit, remove the bathtub before installing the steam shower unit.,
Ensure that the room containing the steam shower unit is built from mold resistant drywall, and provides necessary ventilation in order to prevent buildup of moisture in the room.,
Ensure that the electrical supply for the steam shower unit is GFCI protected, due to the proximity of electricity and water in the unit.,
Follow assembly instructions that came with your steam shower.,
Connect a hot water supply and a cold water supply to the steam shower unit.,
Also connect the drain for the steam shower unit.,
Level the steam shower unit by adjusting the leveling legs.,
If required and/or desired, finish around the steam shower unit to integrate the unit seamlessly with its environment.",How to Install a Steam Shower," A steam shower unit is designed much like a refrigerator in that it is a sealed unit and you slide it into place and it requires no silicone seams.
, Excess moisture can grow molds, mildews, and other structural damages. A single exhaust fan is sufficient for almost all residential steam shower installations., The size of the line will depend mostly on the size of your steam generator. Typical sizes of steam generators range from 3000 Watt to 6000 Watt. These would require 240 Volt, 40 Amp line, or 30 Amp for smaller steam generators. Electrician services may be needed in this step, in order to prevent electric shocks., Typical assembly time for a two person steam shower unit should be 2-4 hours for two people., Steam shower units will require a hot water supply and a cold water supply to feed the shower heads and jets as well as the steam generator. The steam generator uses cold water to generate steam. These connections will be 1/2"" flexible line connections in most cases. These flexible connections allow you to slide the steam shower to access the components and also for servicing., Steam shower units have a 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) flexible hose connection for a drain. This simplifies the drain connection as the existing location of your drain can be used so long as it is within the footprint of your steam shower unit., Typically seven to ten legs can be individually adjusted to provide a stable and level base., Any construction material that you use to finish around the steam shower must be mold resistant and suitable for wet conditions."

Determine your budget.,
Get inspired.,
Measure.,
Start sourcing your fixtures.,
Start talking to contractors/plumbers if you aren't going to DIY.,
Once you've decided on your contractor/plumber and have a date set for the project to begin, start purchasing your fixtures and finishes.,
If this is your only bathroom in the house, try to have a plan in place for dealing with the inconveniences.,
Renovate!",How to Plan a Bathroom Renovation," What are you able or willing to spend on your renovation? Write it down and stick to it. There are so many options out there that it's easy to get carried away once the project is in progress.;
, Start a board on Pinterest of all the bathroom designs and features that you like. Collect inspiration for your vanity, fixtures, flooring, lighting and colours. Once you have collected a number of images you'll usually start to see a trend emerge. Weed out all the images that don't fit with this trend, or your needs, and you'll have a good starting point for the look and feel of your new bathroom.This step will also get you well acquainted with all of the amazing fixture options out there.

, Plot out your space on graph paper and cut out a toilet, vanity, tub, etc. to move around till you have a layout you're happy with. There are plenty of online resources for bathroom layouts. Here are some space requirements that you'll want to keep in mind:


leave 30"" of clear space in front of any fixture
18"" from center line of toilet to wall/other fixture
recommended minimum of 36 x 36 interior for shower
a separate toilet compartment should be a minimum of 36 x 66 with a swing out or pocket door

, Now that you have a budget and floor plan to work within you should have a good idea of what you require. Make a list of all the items needed and start sourcing your fixtures based on your budget and style board on Pinterest. If you're doing your research online make sure to pin any items you're interested in to your Pinterest board. If you're visiting a showroom or big box store take pictures and note the size and price for reference later on.Things you'll need:


toilet
vanity or pedestal
tub, tub/shower, shower base + glass, or shower unit
shower valve and trim
faucets
tile
grout
mirror
lighting
accessories (toilet paper holder, towel ring or bars, robe hooks)
trim

, You now have a pretty good idea of the scope of your project and this will make it easier for your contractor or plumber to price the job for you. Show them your plan and fixture ideas so that if there is anything problematic they can bring it to your attention now and you can address it before the renovation begins.

, Most items, unless they are in stock, will take between 2 to 4 weeks to arrive. You don't want anything to hold up your project once you begin and by having all the pieces readily available you will limit the amount of time your house is turned into a construction zone.

, Do you need to rent a port-a-potty for the backyard for a few days or can you use your neighbour's or families facilities? Know that there are usually hidden problems that crop up when renovating and you could be without a bathroom for a few days longer then expected.

, You've laid the groundwork and put everything in place for a smooth and quick renovation.

Decide what your tray will hold.,
Choose how many layers of wood you will need.,
Measure your tub.,
Purchase lumber cut to size.,
Decide which objects need them.,
Map out their placement.,
Mark and cut your top board.,
Attach the two boards.,
Stain and finish your wood.,
Add handles.,
Attach grippers.",How to Make a Bathtub Tray," First, think about what you intend to keep on your tray during baths and how much space each object will need. Make sure that you use a piece of lumber that is wide enough to hold everything. Allow extra space so nothing is sitting on the edge of the tray. For example:


A 1” x 10” (2.5 x 25 cm) board should be wide enough to hold a book, candle, and glass with room to spare.However, be aware that lumber sizes (such as 1” x 10”) refer to when the wood is freshly cut, before it dries out and shrinks.So, if you have something wider than 10 inches that you want to place on your tray, you will need a wider board than a 1” x 10”.;
, Decide between making a simple tray with no raised surfaces or one with holders for certain objects. For the simplest tray, plan on using a single piece of lumber.Or, to minimize the risk of spilling stuff into the tub, purchase a second piece of equal size to create holders before attaching it to the base board.Alternately, you could rim the entire tray by screwing smaller pieces of lumber, like a 1” x 2” (2.5 x 5 cm), around all four edges of the base board instead of creating individual holders.

, Use a measuring tape to determine the width of your tub. Be sure to include the rim on either side, since this is where your tray will rest. Also double-check that the rim on either side is level with each other.Surround units (where the tub and the shower stall are all one unbroken piece) may incorporate designs without a level rim on the inside of the stall.

, Bring your tub’s measurements to the store. Select the size board you need (for example, a 1” x 10”). Ask the staff to cut it down to size to match the width of your tub. When you bring it home, double-check that the board rests on both sides of your tub’s rim.If you are creating holders, remember to ask for a second board of equal size.
To avoid confusion, remember that lumber sizes are H x W (for example, 1” high and 10” wide). Therefore you are cutting the board’s length to match your tub’s width.

, If you’ve decided on creating holders in a second piece of wood, consider what you intend to bring into the tub with you. Out of those, decide which would be most disastrous if they were to fall into the water (or even out of the tub entirely). These could be:


Paper materials, like books or magazines.
Glass objects, like a mug or wine glass.
Open flames, like candles.

, Depending on what you’re creating holders for, think about where on your tray is best to place each object. Consider what else you will be holding on your tray and how often you will be reaching for each item. Also consider which of your hands is dominant and most likely to do all the reaching. For example:


Placing a holder for a candle toward the back of the tray is always a good idea. This way you won’t be reaching over an open flame for anything else.
If you’re right-handed, placing a cup holder on the right side and a candle holder on the left is advisable since you will be reaching for your cup more frequently than the candle, and vice versa if you’re left-handed.
Also keep in mind that your hands and arms will probably become wet at some point. So if you’re creating a holder to place a book after reading, set this toward the rear or to the side of your cup holder so you don’t drip water over it when you take your next drink.

, First, designate one piece of wood to be the base of the tray and set it aside for now. Use the other piece as your topper. Now, for each object that will receive a holder, measure its bottom. Use these measurements to trace an outline on your topper to then cut out with a saw.Add an extra half-inch (1.25 cm) or so to each measurement to make sure the object has adequate room to fit.
For square or rectangular holders, use a table saw to cut them. For circular holes, attach an appropriately sized hole saw to a screw gun.

, First, sand the edges of each cut with sandpaper so they’re smooth, as well as the top of the base board. Then place the top board on top of the base board so they line up evenly. Use drywall screws to screw them together around all four sides.Make sure your screws aren’t so long that they poke through the bottom of your base board. Also remember that lumber is usually thinner than described. So, for example, use 1.25” (3.2 cm) screws for two boards that are each marked as one inch (2.5 cm) thick.
For a tighter seal, draw a line of wood glue along all four sides of the base board before setting the top board on it.

, First, smooth the board’s surfaces and edges with sandpaper and then clean away any sawdust. Then apply stain to match the color of your bathroom’s other wooden features, if desired. Once it dries, add a coat of wood finish (or, to make things simpler, use an all-in-one stain and finish mix to eliminate a step).Skip the stain if you want to, but definitely seal the wood with finish to protect it from moisture. Steam from your bath may warp unprotected wood over time.
Use a rag or brush to apply either one. When you do, brush or rub with the board’s grain, not against it.Allow the stain to dry overnight before adding finish. Do the same after adding the finish before proceeding to the next step.
Wear protective gloves when using stains and finishes. Also use a dropcloth or similar material to protect surfaces in your work area.

, Attach handles to the top of the tray, if desired, for easy transport. Use cupboard pulls or any other type of handle that suits your taste. Follow their directions for installation, since each type of hardware may have its own specific instructions. However, bear in mind:Cupboards pulls as well as other forms of handles may require you to screw through the bottom of the tray, rather than the top.
If so, expect the screwheads to project out of the bottom once they are screwed in. Even if you use flatheads, this may result in the screwheads scratching the rim of your tub.
To avoid this, create a pilot hole by attaching a countersink bit to your screw gun. This will cut both a pilot hole for the screw as well as a slight divot in the wood’s surface that will fit the screwhead.

, Minimize the chance of your tray slipping off the tub’s rim due to moisture and anything else that may make it slippery, like bath oils. Purchase a pack of self-stick rubber grippers. Peel the backing off each one and stick the gripper to the bottom of the tray where it will rest on the tub’s rim.Technically, you could also consider this step optional, but consider it strongly advised. Not only will grippers reduce the chance of your tray slipping, but their soft material will also minimize the risk of damaging both your tray and tub.
At minimum, use one gripper for each end of your tray. However, for best results, use as many as will fit between the tray and the rim of the tub, both lengthwise and widthwise.

Solder an extra-long copper stub and the tub spout cap into place.,
Check for leaks.,
Follow the manufacturer's instructions to use water-head screws or roofing nails to secure the tub rim in place.

",How to Install a Whirlpool Tub," You can buy a whirlpool tub that fits in the same space as a regular tub. Replacing your tub with a larger size adds steps to the process. However, some people enjoy the extra space of a larger tub.;
, You will probably need an electrical permit. In some areas, a special wall access to the motor and pump is required.

,,, Reuse your P trap if it is plastic and in good condition. Replace your P trap if it is metal or in bad shape.

,


Cover the floor with a drop cloth. Use a plumb line and level to mark the area of old tile that needs to be removed. Make sure that the new tile will cover the joint from the drywall you are about to remove.
Use a utility knife to cut through the drywall. If you use a saw, you are more likely to hit wiring or plumbing. Use a pry bar to pull out the tile in large sections or piece by piece. If necessary, you can use a hammer to make a hole in the tile to get you started at the top. Wear safety glasses while you are removing the tile.
Check the wall insulation. If it is dry and not moldy, you can reuse it. Otherwise it will have to be replaced. Cover moldy areas of the wall with a formula to preserve wood once they are dry before replacing the insulation.

,


Old tub removal can take place in a few ways. You can take it out whole or break it into pieces to remove it. Fiberglass or steel tubs can be broken into pieces with a reciprocating saw. Cast iron tubs can be broken with a sledgehammer. If you decide to break the tub, you should wear safety glasses. You may also want to wear earplugs.

,


Draw in your center lines. Make sure they are appropriate for the layout you have planned for your tile.
Install a 2 by 4 inch (5 by 10 cm) backing for your faucet using the dimensions recommended in the instructions. If necessary, install tub spout and shower head backers.
Assemble the copper pipes and solder them together. If you are soldering onto the valve, be certain to take off the cartridge beforehand. Also, you should wait to solder the tub spout until after you have put in the tub.
Check to make certain that the P trap will reach the new drain. If it needs to be extended, extend it at this time.

,,,


Different tubs are leveled in different ways, so it is important to follow the directions that came with your new whirlpool tub. In any case, the floor, not the rim of the tub, should support the tub's weight. Check the underlying structure if the floor is more than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) out of level. Install the edge supports according to the instructions included with your tub.

,,


If your tub does not fit at first, remove more drywall and then replace it.
Roll some plumber's putty into a rope with a diameter of about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm.) place the putty on the base of the drain and then insert the drain through the drain hole. Use a tub drain wrench to hold the drain in place and be certain the putty squeezes out on all sides of the edge of the drain. Tighten the waste line until the rubber seal is snug while holding the drain in place.
Mortar underneath the tub and seat the tub in the mortar. Do not put any weight on the tub until the mortar has fully hardened, at least overnight.

, Tighten all nuts by hand and then give them a quarter turn with slip joint pliers.

, Cut the spout to the length specified in the faucet instructions.

,


Connect the faucet handles temporarily. Open the water shutoffs and then turn on the faucets.
Check all joints and seals for moisture. If there is any moistness, re-tighten the slip nuts and check joints for broken washers.
Fill the tub until it reaches the overflow and starts to drain through it and check to make sure that the overflow doesn't leak.
Plug in the electricity for tub and start the jets running. With the jets running, check for leaks again.

Prepare the area for installation.,
Dry the surface completely.,
Dry-fit the pan.,
Fit the pan in place.,
Level the pan.,
Attach the pan to the studs.,
Seal the pan with silicone bath caulk.,
Let the caulk dry and check your seals.",How to Install a Shower Pan," Installing a shower pan requires basic home repair tools and some specialty items available at most home retailers. To do the job properly, you'll need:


Tape measure
Carpenter's level
Phillips and flathead screwdrivers
Power Drill
Drill Bits
Hammer
Caulking gun
Adjustable pliers (if needed)
Framing square
Silicone bath caulk
New shower pan
1 ½ or 2-in. screws
Washers
Wooden shims
Masking tape;
, Measure along all of the walls that will come in contact with the pan. Write these measurements down and take them with you when purchasing the pan. Your home center professional will help you select the correct size based on the measurements.









Most modern shower pans are either acrylic or fiberglass for ease of installation, but keep in mind that some shower pans may have to be special ordered if they’re not a standard model or size. Find this out before you tear out your existing shower.
Standard sizes are 36” x 36”; 36” x 42”; 36” x 48” and are usually available in white or almond. Most dealers will have these sizes and colors in stock. Larger sizes or “decorator” designs and colors will likely have to be special-ordered. Call your dealer to see if they have your size and color in stock.

, Clear all debris and old adhesive from the surface. Use a broom or a vacuum to clear loose debris. Use a wide-blade putty knife or a paint scraping tool to peel off old caulking and adhesive.


Make any additional surface preparations that are recommended by the shower pan manufacturer as necessary, such as applying a fresh coat of a water seal product to the surface below where the pan will be installed. Be sure to follow the instructions on the container for drying time. Do not install the pan until the water seal is dry.

, Make sure the surface area is completely and free of standing water and excessive moisture before setting the pan. A damp surface can breed mold and mildew. Additionally, when sealing with caulk, moisture can affect the adherence of the caulk and cause a defective seal.

, The first thing you’ll need to do after preparing the shower base area is “dry-fit” your shower pan within the space. Dry fitting means that you won't use any adhesives or fasteners at this time, because you're just checking to make sure everything fits. Be sure the pan fits snugly within the space, but not too tight or the pan may buckle. If the fit is too sloppy, you are likely to have movement issues that can cause seams to separate and create serious water seepage. A fit that is too loose will require additional stabilization of the pan.









Check to see if the drain cut-out in the pan lines up and fits properly over the drain pipe. Never force it to line up, as this can cause damage to the pan and to the drain pipe. A little movement (about a half-inch or so in each direction) of the pipe is fine, and will help when lining up the drain components.
Since drain components vary by manufacturer, follow the illustrations that come with your shower pan for test fitting. Once you are satisfied that everything fits properly, you are ready to complete the permanent installation.

, If you removed it after dry-fitting, replace the pan as it was before. Be sure to line up the drain cut-out and drain components properly. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on attaching drain hardware. Some drain installations may require a short coupling piece to be attached to the bottom of the drain attached to the pan, then slipped into the drain pipe in the floor, sealed with a compression gasket. Others may require a coupling extension pre-inserted into the floor’s drain pipe, then the pan slips over the coupler and is sealed with caulking and a rubber compression ring. Your particular pan kit will have more specific details.








, With the pan sitting in place, use a carpenter’s level and wood shims to level the pan, adjusting with shims as necessary. Don't shim so high that the pan becomes elevated or is “floating” above the solid base. Only minimal shimming should be needed if the sub-surface is level to begin with.









Once the pan is level, mark the top of the pan lip where it meets the studs, and mark the location of the shims in case the pan has to be moved.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions, but in general you want to avoid driving nails or screws through the lip of the pan unless directly specified. You can temporarily secure the pan to the studs by placing a 1 ½” or 2” screw through a washer, then insert the screw just above the lip of the pan so the washer overlaps the lip to hold it securely. Do not over-tighten, as this may crack the shower pan.









Use your carpenter's level again to make sure your fastening didn't throw the pan off slightly. When the pan is level, stable and securely mounted, it’s time to make all components water-tight.

, All locations where there was any penetration of the pan (i.e. drilled or factory holes) need to be filled with silicone bath caulk to create a waterproof seal. Also seal around the studs where the pan makes contact, helping to secure the pan.









Use a thin coat of caulk, about the thickness of a piece of masking tape, spread over each penetration location. Use just enough to coat and seal where nails or screws are used to attach the pan to the studs. Wipe up any accidental drips of caulk from the pan before they dry. If you discover them after they dry, you can usually peel them up with your fingernail or a plastic putty knife.
As you're working, don't let any caulk run over the lip of the pan, as doing so can affect the fit and seal of the side shower panels. If it runs over while being applied, wipe it off before it dries.
You'll also need to caulk the joint where the pan meets the floor. Be sure the surface is very clean and dry or you will not obtain a proper seal.

, Recheck all drain components and seal them with caulk if recommended by the manufacturer. When you're installing any compression seals around the drain components, always use a blunt tool the push it into place. Never use a screwdriver or other sharp object, which can permanently damage the seal.

Most shower heads are sold separately from arms, though both can be found at a hardware store, along with the following needed tools and supplies:Pipe wrench
Thread seal tape (Teflon tape)
Towels (at least 2);
, Depending on your home, there may be a shutoff valve near the fixtures for your shower, but in most cases you’ll likely have to turn off the main water supply. This will prevent water from leaking all over, making your installation more difficult.The main shutoff for you house can often be found near your water meter or at the point the main water line enters your home.Shutoff valves are generally either oval handles or round and wheel shaped. Engage the shutoff valve carefully; using too much force could damage the valve.
Turn on the water to your shower after switching off the water supply to drain any liquid still in the line. Some shutoffs are only partial, in which case water may still flow very lightly even after engaging the shutoff.

, Close the drain to your shower. This will prevent dropped fasteners and other small pieces of hardware from being lost down the drain. Lay down a towel over closed drain so that anything that falls doesn’t bounce off the floor or tub, but instead is cushioned by the towel., Removing the shower arm is not necessary for installing a wall mounted shower head. However, in some situations the original shower arm might not suit changes in bathroom décor, or it might simply be time for an upgrade. To remove the shower arm:


Use your bare hands to loosen the shower arm by turning it counterclockwise.
Apply an adjustable wrench or pipe wrench to the shower arm if it refuses to turn by hand. Use moderate, steady, counterclockwise force until the arm comes free.Insert the replacement shower arm by turning it clockwise into the fitting.

, If you plan on keeping your current shower arm, wrap a dry, clean towel around the base of the arm where it meets the wall. Grip the arm at this point with your wrench so the towel protects the arm from damage. Hold the arm in place with the wrench and unscrew the head counterclockwise by hand.


For stubborn shower heads, wrap the head in a clean cloth to protect the metal’s finish. Grip and turn the head with a suitable wrench, pair of channel locks, or pair of pliers with firm, steady pressure until the head comes loose., Clean the threading of the shower arm with a suitable general purpose cleaner and a fresh towel. Remove any Teflon tape from the previous installation. Wipe the fixture dry with the towel and then wrap the threads of the shower arm in Teflon tape.


Teflon tape should be applied to threading in a clockwise direction. Wind the tape two to three times around the bottommost threads of the shower arm.
In some cases, the Teflon tape might not sink into the threading. Use your fingernail to push the tape into the threading.
Some varieties of shower head may not require Teflon tape. Always follow the installation notes that came with the shower head for best results., Some shower heads may come with multiple pieces, extensions, or other features. Most commonly, a rubber washer will accompany your washer head. This inserts into the shower arm connector for the head.A diagram of how to insert the rubber washer into the shower head can usually be found on the packaging of the shower head or in the instructions that came with it.

, Screw the shower head clockwise onto the taped threading at the arm’s end. Do so slowly to prevent the threads from crossing or binding, which can damage the Teflon tape. When hand-tight, wrap a piece of cloth around the connection to protect the metal’s finish from being scratched. With a suitable wrench or pliers, tighten the connector a quarter turn more.


Avoid over-tightening your shower head. This can damage the threading or the connection nut, which can cause leaks., Release the shutoff valve to resupply your shower with water. Check your shower for leaks. Turn the shower on and off. Adjust the shower head. Turn off the water supply if water leaks from the connection between the shower arm and head.Place a towel over the connector between the shower arm and head and apply firm, steady pressure with a wrench to tighten it until leaks cease.
If leaks do not appear to be lessening as you tighten the connection, you may need to unscrew the head, remove and reapply the Teflon tape, and repeat the described installation process up to this point.

, If you’ve installed a new shower arm, you may need to use plumber’s putty to seal the space between the arm and the wall. This protects the wall from moisture damage. Apply the putty according to its label instructions. Enjoy your new shower head., An online keyword search for “shower heads” will yield results from major home centers, like Home Depot, to online only marketplaces, like Amazon. These online selections are often sizable, but some items may appear more desirable than they actually are.Call around to local hardware stores, home centers, and plumbing supply companies to check if you can see the shower head in person, where you’ll have a better opportunity to evaluate its quality.

, Some shower heads, like low-flow models, are designed to be water and energy efficient. These can save you money on water and electric bills. Green shower heads generally install similarly to normal models., As a general rule, metal shower heads tend to be better than plastic ones. Chrome finish and brass in the construction are good indications of quality. Metal hoses, for shower heads with hose attachments, stay flexible instead of becoming stiff like most kinds of plastic hose.


Chrome and brass do not rust, which makes these materials ideal for your shower head. These fixtures may be slightly more expensive, but will likely last longer and operate better."

Determine the ideal location.,
Decide on the type of stall.,
Purchase materials.,
Read the instructions that come with your shower unit or kit.,
Clear and prepare the intended shower site.,
Build a frame to support the stall (if applicable).,
Install the shower pan/prefabricated unit.,
Install the plumbing (if you have not already done so).,
Install the sides of the shower stall (if applicable).,
Finish the project.",How to Install a Shower Stall," Whether you're installing a shower stall to save space in a new bathroom, or to replace a tub, the stall should be located in proximity to hot and cold water pipes, an it must be able to have access to your drainage pipes.;
, A quick search on the Internet or a walk through the plumbing aisles of a home improvement store will reveal the many different kinds of shower stall on the market. A wide variety of options are available, including those with features such as a bench for sitting inside the stall, shapes ranging from rectangles to semi-circles, and sizes to fit any need. That said, there are also a few specific varieties, and the differences between them can impact the installation process.Single-piece prefabricated showers are complete units, usually made of fiberglass or acrylic. They tend to be more expensive than other shower stall sets, and some also claim that they can be more difficult to install. As you could probably guess, the complete unit can be a bit bulky, and for that reason difficult to carry through doorways or up stairs. On the plus side, they tend to be solidly constructed and easier to clean.
Interlocking multi-piece units will usually come in a set of four to six large pieces, including the shower pan (the base area where you would stand in the shower and that connects to the drain), wall coverings (for the side(s) where the unit will be mounted along the bathroom wall), side sections (that will not be placed along the bathroom wall), and a door. Quite a few of these kits are considered easy to assemble, and they generally cost much less than single-piece units.

, There is an extensive list of materials that will have to be acquired in order to complete this project. Here is a partial list.


Plumbing pipes and fittings. Not only do you need to make sure that you have enough pipe, you must also be certain to obtain the appropriate parts that will allow you to connect the new pipes to existing ones.
Shower unit/kit.
Waterproof caulk/sealant. It is probably best to obtain a silicone-based sealant or caulk, a variety known for their resistance to water.
Tools, such as wrenches and screwdrivers.

, While some provide very little detail, most will include instructions that explain how the shower will fit into place. Even those that don't directly explain the process you must follow will certainly suggest what prerequisites are required for installation.

, It may be preferable to remove bathroom tiles or other floor coverings and install the shower directly on the base of the floor itself. You must also identify the appropriate location for the drain hole--measure the shower pan to determine the location--and cut a hole through the floor.


If your plumbing is coming through a wall and not, say, a basement area in which the pipes are exposed, you must tear out the portions of the wall. Obviously, this must be one of your first steps.

, Some shower kits will require that you build a structure to support the shower pan or even brace a whole prefabricated unit. Oftentimes the unit will have to be screwed into place, and so you must build the required structures that will allow you to do so.For some units, at least some of the frame building will have to be completed after the shower stall has been put into place. Read the instructions carefully.
Some multi-piece shower kits come with a kind of frame that will be used to hold up the sides. Again, go through the instructions that came with your kit before you install in order to determine how your shower stall will fit into your bathroom.

, Slide the pan or unit in place and attach it using screws. , For some installations, this may have been the first task that was required. For others, it should be near the end. Follow these steps:


Turn off the main water supply.
Utilizing traditional plumbing methods, run hot and cold pipes to correspond with the holes for faucet handles in the shower stall. Attach the correctly threaded extension piping for the shower head, using thread seal tape and a pipe wrench. Install the faucet handles and the shower head. Turn the main water supply on and check for leaks.
Connect the drainage lines. Secure the drain pipe with the drain kit (that either came with the unit or was purchased separately). The drain should be sealed with plumber's putty and tightened into place to prevent leakage. (For more on plumbing a bathroom, see guides here and here.)

, Shower kits with multiple pieces will require this step, but it is one that really can be delayed until the project is nearly complete. If you don't want to work on plumbing inside of a tiny shower stall, chose to leave this step for the end.


For some kits, the side mounted to the wall will have to be screwed into place, while others just recommend that your use heavy duty caulk. Keep this in mind when purchasing your sealants, as some can also be used as adhesives.

, Cover any exposed framing with water-resistant drywall and seal all seams that will be exposed to water with the silicone-based caulk. Texture and paint as desired. Attach the shower door or curtain.

Determine the correct CFM rating for your bathroom.,
Consider the sound rating of your fan.,
Choose the location of the fan.,
Gather the required tools.",How to Install a Bathroom Fan1," The first thing you need to do when installing a new bathroom fan is determine the CFM rating for your bathroom, so you can buy the appropriate strength fan.


CFM stands for ""Cubic Feet per Minute"" and refers to how much air the fan can move per minute. Small bathrooms will need low CFM fans, while larger bathrooms may require fans with a much higher CFM.To calculate the CFM for your bathroom, multiply the room's cubic footage (length x width x height). For example, if your bathroom measured 120 square feet, you would multiply that by the height of the ceiling (say 8') to get 960. THEN divide by 7.5 to get a CFM rating of 128.
You will find the CFM rating of a new fan printed on its box.

, The next thing to consider is the sound rating of your new fan, which is measured in sones.


New fans usually have a sound rating somewhere between 0.5 (very quiet) and 6 (very loud) sones.
Some people prefer to have very quiet fans, while others value the privacy offered by louder fans, especially in public areas of the home.
Like the CFM, the sone ratings of new fans will be printed on the box

, The location of your bathroom fan is important. It should be installed at the center point between your shower and toilet for optimum ventilation. However, if your bathroom is very large, you may need to install more than one fan.


If you are installing a new fan, you will need to consider the layout of your attic, where the bulk of the fan will be located. It should be placed in the the space between two joists, in an area free from any pipes or other obstructions.
If you are replacing an old fan, the easiest thing to do is just to put the new fan in same location (unless you have a very good reason for wanting it in a different spot).

, Installing a bathroom fan is a manageable DIY project for homeowners with basic carpentry and electrical skills. Before you begin, it's a good idea to have all of the required tools and materials easily at hand.


In terms of tools, you will need some basic hand tools such as a screwdriver and a combination pliers, in addition to a power drill and a jigsaw.
In terms of materials, you will need a length of flexible duct pipe, a vent cap, screws, caulk and wire nuts. If you're running the duct pip out through the roof you will also need roofing cement, shingles and roofing nails.
You will also need a stepladder in order to reach the fan from below, safety goggles and a respirator to wear while drilling, and roof brackets, roof cleats or a safety harness for potential roof work.

Drill a reference hole and mark the ceiling.,
Cut the intake-port hole.,
Put the fan in position.,
Secure the fan to the joists.,
Find a suitable exit point for the duct pipe.,
Attach the vent cap.,
Wire the connections in the housing unit.,
Attach the grille.",How to Install a Bathroom Fan2," Take your power drill and use an extra-long, 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) spade bit to drill a reference hole in the ceiling, where you intend to place the fan. Measure the vent fan housing.


Head up to the attic, find the reference hole and clear away the insulation surrounding it. Use the the fan housing measurements to ensure that the fan will fit in the chosen spot, between two joists.
Go back to the bathroom and measure the fan's intake port. You will need these dimensions to cut the appropriate sized hole in your ceiling.
Use a framing square and pencil to mark the outline of the fan's intake port on the ceiling, using the measurements you just took.;
, Use your jigsaw to cut out the portion of ceiling you just marked. If you don't have a jigsaw, you could also use a reciprocating or drywall saw.


Don't let the cut section of ceiling fall to the floor after cutting, as it could pull additional pieces of drywall or plaster with it.
Use your free hand to support the rectangular piece of ceiling and gently lower it to the floor.
Remember to wear safety goggles and a respirator while sawing through plaster and drywall to protect your eyes and lungs.

, Before you lower the fan into the hole you just cut, attach a 90 degree duct elbow (to which you will later attach the duct pipe) to the appropriate outlet port using foil duct tape.


Insert a cable connector through the removable knockout hole on the side of the fan's housing, then slide the supporting metal brackets into place.
Center the fan over the ceiling hole and lower it into place, making sure any connection points are oriented correctly.

, Once the fan is positioned correctly, extend each of the metal brackets until they reach the joists on either side of the housing unit. Use drywall screws to firmly secure each bracket end to the joist.


Now that the fan is secure, take the length of flexible duct pipe and attach one end to the 90 degree duct elbow protruding from fan housing using foil duct tape.
Now is also a good time to run an existing or new electrical cable through the connector on the fan housing. You can secure the cable by tightening the screw on the connector. Be aware that you'll need to use a three-wire cable if your new fan includes a light.

, The next step is to find the shortest, straightest route from the housing fan to the outside. The longer the duct pipe is, the less efficient the fan will be.


It is essential to vent the fan exhaust outdoors. Venting it directly into the attic would promote mold growth and potentially cause the rafters to mold.You can run the vent through the sidewall or roof, whichever is most convenient. Just make sure the duct pipe is as straight as possible and that it won't be stretched too tightly.

, The process for attaching the vent cap will vary depending on whether the exit point is on the roof or sidewall.


If your exit point is on the sidewall, pick a point between two wall studs and take some reference measurements on the inside so you can locate the same point on the outside. Use a 4-inch hole saw to cut through wall from the outside, then secure the vent cap in place.
If your exit point is on the roof, draw an appropriate sized circle on the inside and use a reciprocating saw to cut it out. Then get on the roof (taking all of the proper safety precautions) and remove the shingles covering the newly cut hole. Install the vent cap, using roofing cement and roofing nails, then replace any loose shingles.
Move back into the attic and attach the end of the duct pipe to the vent cap's connector duct using foil duct tape. , Depending on the type of fan, you may need to wire the connections from the attic or from the bathroom. Make sure to read the manufacturer's instructions and double check that the power is off before proceeding.


Open up the housing unit and pull out the fan wires from the electrical splice unit. Strip 5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) back from each of the wires on both the fan cable and the electrical cable you inserted earlier.
Twist the same color wires together (usually white to white and black or red to black) and add the connectors. Wrap the bare copper wire around the green grounding clip or screw and tighten to secure.
Place the wires back in the electrical splice unit and reattach the cover.
If you don't feel confident about doing the wiring yourself, don't hesitate to call in a licensed electrician to install the fan or simply inspect your work when you're done.
Also be aware that aluminum (rather than copper) wiring requires special handling and any electrical work involving this type of wiring should be undertaken by a professional.

, Now you're almost finished. Plug the blower motor into the electrical receptacle and secure it with the screws provided.


Install the decorative plastic grille by slipping its mounting wires into the available slots in the housing unit. Make sure it sits snugly against the ceiling -- spread the mounting wires a little to create more tension, if necessary.
Turn the power back on and test your new bathroom fan to make sure it's working.

Turn off the power.,
Unplug the motor and disconnect the wiring.,
Go to the attic and remove the housing.,
Install the new fan.,
Attach the duct.,
Connect the wiring.,
Complete the outdoor work.,
Attach the grille.",How to Install a Bathroom Fan3," Before you begin, you will need to turn off the power to the fan from the circuit breaker box.

, Put on a pair of gloves, safety goggles and a respirator and remove the grille covering from the old fan. You may be shocked at the amount of dirt and debris that fall out of it!


Unscrew or unplug the motor blower assembly from the housing unit, then open up the electrical splice unit and carefully pull out the wires.
Remove the connectors and untwist the wires to disconnect them. It's a good idea to double check that power to the wires is off before doing this.
Loosen the cable clamp to free the electrical cable from the fan housing., In the attic, detach the duct pipe from both the housing unit and the vent cap connector duct.


Pull the electrical cable and wiring free from the housing unit.
Use a power drill to remove the screws securing the old fan's brackets to the joists, then lift the old fan from the ceiling.

, Head back down to your bathroom and remove the new fan from its packaging. If it has the same measurements as your old fan, you will be able to install it immediately.


But if the new fan is bigger than the old one, you will need to enlarge the hole in your ceiling. You can do this by tracing the outline of your new fan onto the ceiling, then cutting around the outline with a drywall saw.
If your new fan is smaller than the old one, you can caulk around the edges of the housing unit to fill in any gaps once the fan is installed.
Go to the attic and lower the new fan into the preexisting or newly enlarged hole. Make sure the unit is properly oriented for all electrical and duct work connections.
Slide out the extendable mounting brackets and secure them to the joists using your power drill and 1 inch (2.5 cm) drywall screws. You may need a helper to hold the fan in place from below as you do this.

, Once the fan is in place, connect a 90 degree duct elbow to the fan's exhaust port using sheet metal screws. Then attach a new 4 to 6 inch (10.2 to 15.2 cm) duct pipe to the duct elbow.


It is possible to use the duct pipe from the old fan, but if it is less than 4 inches (10.2 cm) in diameter you will need to install a duct pipe reducer before reattaching the pipe.
However be aware that using a smaller, older duct pipe will prevent the fan from working as efficiently.

, Insert the electrical cable through the new fans connector and secure it with a cable clamp.


Open up the electrical splice box (from either the attic or the bathroom, depending on the model) and pull out the fan wires.
Attach the electrical wires to the fan wires by twisting same color wires together (white to white and black or red to black) and attaching a wire connector.
Wrap the bare copper wire under the ground clip or screw and tighten to secure. Tuck all of the wires back into the electrical splice box and replace the cover. , If you replaced your old duct pipe with a newer, bigger pipe, you will also need to install a larger vent cap on your roof or sidewall.


Take whatever safety precautions are necessary for working at a height. Remove the old vent cap and use a saw to enlarge the opening to the size of the new duct pipe.
Pull the end of the duct pipe through the hole until 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) extends beyond the edge of the roof or sidewall. Secure in place with sheet metal screws and seal around the edges with caulk.
Secure the new vent cap over the end of the duct pipe. If the vent pipe is on the roof, replace any shingles that may have come loose.

, Return to the bathroom and install the motor blower assembly by plugging it into the receptacle and screwing to secure. Attach the decorative plastic grille, then turn the power back on to test if your new bathroom fan is working.

Decide what kind of shower you're going to install.,
Measure to determine the location of the pipes.,
Assemble the necessary tools and materials.,
Sweep the floor area and walls to clear all loose debris prior to installing the shower unit.,
Waterproof the walls.",How to Install a Shower1," Many showers installed are prefabricated units, making the installation a much easier do-it-yourself project for homeowners with basic carpentry and plumbing skills. Shower stall kits come in two basic types: single-unit stalls and multi-panel stalls.


Single unit stalls: The advantage of a single-unit stall is that the project is seamless and very fast. Essentially, you'll buy one ready-set unit that you'll secure to the walls and pipes, seal the seams, and you'll be ready to go.
Multi-panel units: Multi-panel units consist of a separate shower pan and two or more individual panels that are glued into place and require each seam or joint to be individually sealed. The advantage of this type of shower stall is that it is easier to handle one piece at a time if you are doing the installation alone.;
, When you've purchased a shower stall of the appropriate size for your space, you need to mark where the pipe will stub out through the shower stall to attach to the appropriate elements on your kit, regardless of whether you're installing a multi-panel or single-panel shower. Measure from the floor and from the corner of the walls in order to get accurate measurements.


Draw a rough sketch of the wall with the plumbing and properly indicate those measurements on the sketch. For example: from the corner of the wall to the center of the water control valve might be 18 inches (45.7 cm). From the floor to the center of the valve is 36 inches (91.4 cm). Repeat this for all fixtures that will poke through the stall surface. Whatever your measurements are, mark them on your drawing.
With a marking pen or pencil, transfer those measurements to the back of the unit where it will be mounted over those plumbing fixtures.

, Follow the instructions included with whatever shower kit you end up using for your project. Wall screws and other fasteners may be provided, or you may need to get them yourself. For most projects, you'll need the following tools and supplies:


2 or 4 feet (0.6 or 1.2 m). level
Tub and tile caulking
2 inch (5.1 cm) hole saw
Electric drill and 1/8th inch drill bit
Flat head and Phillips screwdrivers
Cedar shims
Your multi-panel or single-panel shower kit

, Use a broom or a vacuum to clear construction debris and dust from the area before moving forward with installation. Use a paint scraper or a putty knife to peel off old caulking and adhesive, and make sure that you thoroughly dry out the area before installing the pan on the subfloor.


If your subfloor is wet before you install the panels or the shower pan, you'll risk wood rot and other serious problems in the future. You need to make sure the area is completely dry before you begin installing the shower components, whatever type of kit you have.

, Install waterproof wallboard to the walls that will be covered by the shower stall. If it is a corner unit, it will usually be the two walls that form the corner. Waterproof wallboard is a fiber or cement-based product, usually either gray, green or blue in color. Shower board can be attached to the wall studs with nails or screws. Seal the seams with silicone caulking.


Never install a shower over regular drywall, as any moisture will eventually disintegrate the drywall.

Update light fixtures, especially the one(s) over the vanity or sink.,
Add accessories and finishing touches.",How to Redecorate a Bathroom," No matter what else you plan to do to your bathroom, having a bunch of clutter in there is certain not to make things any more relaxing or attractive. Throw things out if you possibly can. If not, install storage.;
, Unless you are planning to rip the bathroom down to studs (usually not a budget undertaking), start by thoroughly cleaning what you have. Don't forget to include floors, grout, mirrors, shower, and all the outside surfaces of your toilet.


Try a solution of half water, half vinegar to remove hard water deposits.

, Bathroom walls get a lot of moisture, and they can become mildewed or spattered. Even if you can't paint, give them a good washing. Make sure it's a washable surface, not a flat paint. Test on a hidden area first, if you're not sure.

, Paint is one of the least expensive and quickest things to change about a room. Don't be afraid to use a bold color in a bathroom, especially a small one. You'll be surprised at how it can transform the room.


Be sure to use a glossy or semigloss paint in bathrooms. Paint in bathrooms sees a lot of moisture.

, How do those old towel racks look? Would some that are brighter or shinier lighten things up and modernize matters a bit? Could you do with a matching hook by the shower or on the back of the door? Would the bathroom fit some drawers or shelves? Consider options for freestanding and built in storage.


Make sure to attach wall-mounted items securely, using drywall anchors or studs, as appropriate.

,, Tiles may be a job you can do yourself if you want to freshen up a worn surface cheaply. If you have a worn tile floor and you prefer not to pay to replace it yet, another choice is simply to put down a bath mat or throw rug to cover most of it.


Remember to seal stenciled tiles and new grout to help make it waterproof. #Update the faucet(s) and shower head. It is reasonably easy to replace a faucet yourself. It's also reasonably inexpensive, provided you choose a moderately priced faucet.

, Make sure you know a bit about electrical safety if you plan to install the new fixture yourself.


Try a shower spotlight if you don't already have one.

,


Try adding color coordinated bath rugs, towels, shower curtain, and a bathroom set that goes with the colors of the fixtures and paint.
If you have any natural light, add a potted plant or two. Try forcing a bulb in water or having a plant of lucky bamboo.
Try an elegant silk plant if you don't have the natural light to sustain a real one.
Don't forget the walls. Do you have wall space for a decorative plate or framed artwork? Make sure it's reasonably moisture proof.

Decide what kind of shower door you want.,
Measure the space where you're installing the door.,
Buy a shower door kit.,
Assemble the necessary parts and tools.",How to Install a Shower Door1," There are two common styles of shower doors: sliding doors and pivoting doors. Although they work differently, the installation process is nearly identical for both, so your decision should be based on personal preference.


It is highly recommended that you choose a shower door with a frame. Some shower doors are frameless for a more elegant look, but are much more complicated to install.
Some people prefer to use a sliding door for wide openings and a swinging door for small openings, since swinging doors tend to be a little narrower and can accommodate smaller spaces.;
, Using your tape measure, measure horizontally and vertically between the surfaces where the door hardware will be mounted, across the tub or the opening for the shower, and up the wall. Record these numbers to take to the store and shop around for a kit that's big enough to fill the space you need to fill.


For the most part, the metal tracks of shower doors will be slightly longer than the space you need to fill. They're made this way, to allow the same kit to be used for multiple projects. By cutting the tracks to size, you should be able to make most commercial kits work fine for the job.

, Take the measurements with you to your home center and ask for assistance in selecting the correct door kit. These should come with the glass door itself, the track pieces, rollers, and wall screws necessary for mounting the door on the wall. The other necessary tools and equipment are discussed in the next step.

, Shower door kits will come with a set of metal tracks that seat the shower door, so most of the assembly process involves installing the metal frame. This will be secured by a metal threshold that fits onto the front lip of the tub, two side columns that will be secured into the tile walls, and a single cross-member to connect the columns on top. Most shower kits should be universal, but hold the pieces up to the shower before you start installing them to make sure they fit. If the pieces are too long, you might need to trim them to size with a hacksaw. You'll also need some basic tools to complete the job:


Silicone-based caulk and a caulking gun
Tape measure
A power drill
3/16 and 7/32 drill bits (add a 3/16 masonry bit if drilling into tile)
Tile screws
Plastic wall anchors
Hammer
Masking tape
Permanent marker
A level

Drill pilot holes on the unit.,
Cut the hole for the fixture.,
Place the unit into position and secure it in place.,
Seal all the seams with caulk.,
Mount the shower door.",How to Install a Shower2," Wherever you marked pipe and fixture locations on the back of the stall unit, use an 1/8th inch drill bit to cut pilot holes in the shower unit. Go slowly and carefully so you don’t crack the interior finish.


It's important to drill pilot holes from the back of the stall to the front. This will make it easier when you use the saw to cut the larger holes for the fixtures.

, Once all pilot holes are drilled, remove the drill bit and insert the 2” hole saw into your electric drill. The pilot bit on the hole saw will be larger than the holes you just drilled, which should keep the hole saw from skating around while you're cutting the hole.


Start cutting the hole from the inside of the shower stall. Put very little pressure against the surface while the hole saw is cutting, and let the saw do the work. Once the saw has cut nearly all the way through the shower stall wall, ease up on the pressure until the hole is complete.
It is not unusual to have a little smoking or burning as you cut the hole, which is caused by friction. The hole saw will like be quite hot immediately after the hole is cut. After a minute or two, remove the cutout piece from the hole saw.

, Most single-unit kits will come with wall screws and fasteners unique to the model and you'll need to defer to the instructions on the unit to secure the shower to the wall. Most units will have between three and six fasteners per wall.


The flanges and handles, as well, will be unique to the model, usually quick-install models that will attach quickly and simply. Read the following methods for more specific instructions regarding the installation of multi-panel components, if necessary.

, Once the unit is secure, use tub and tile caulking to seal all surfaces that come in contact with the walls and floor for a water-tight seal. Seal the flanges with a thin bead of caulking and allow to dry for 24 hours before exposing to water.

, Shower doors on single-unit kits should snap right in, though models with sliding doors may be slightly more complex. Read the subsequent methods for more specific instructions regarding multi-panel installation of shower doors.

Set the shower pan in position on the floor.,
Screw the drain cover down into the shower pan.,
Level the pan.,
Seal the pan with a thin line of caulk.",How to Install a Shower3," Line up the drain hole in the bottom of the shower pan with the drain in the floor. Don't use any adhesives or fasteners, just fit it in and make sure the pan fits snugly within the space. You also need to make sure the drain cut-out lines up and fits properly over the drain pipe.

, Some kits may require a short coupling piece to be attached to the bottom of the drain to attach the pan. If so, slip this into the drain pipe in the floor and use a compression gasket (included) to complete the seal.

, Confirm that the pan is aligned with the walls and the rest of your plan for the bathroom. If it's not aligned correctly, your shower may leak, so it's important to ensure that the pan is level. Use a carpenter’s level use some wood shims to level the pan, if necessary.


You shouldn't need to use many shims, and don't raise the pan above the level of the panels. Only minimal shimming should be needed, if the sub-floor is level. Once the pan is level, it's a good idea to mark the top of the pan lip where it meets the studs and the shim placement, if you need to move things later.

, Draw a bead of caulk along the joint where the pan meets the floor, about the thickness of a piece of masking tape. Use just enough to coat and seal where nails or screws are used to attach the pan to the studs. You can wipe up accidental drips of caulk from the pan before they dry.


If you discover them after they dry, you can usually peel them up with your fingernail or a plastic putty knife.

"
"
Mark each panel according to the kit instructions.,
Test fit the panels.,
Fit the bottom edge of the panels into the grooves of the pan.,
Prepare your panels for final installation.,
Use adhesive to secure the panels.,
Carefully press the panel into place against the wall.,
Use wall screws, if necessary.,
Attach the final shower components.",How to Install a Shower4," Each panel will need to be identified and marked clearly, to make sure you don't install the wrong panel in the wrong location–an easy mistake if you're working quickly. Identify each wall panel per the instruction sheet that comes with the shower kit and label each panel using a piece of masking tape, writing “Panel A” or “Panel 1,"" depending on the instructions included.


Identify the panel that will be installed over the shower controls and fixtures and set it aside. Use your measurements of the fixtures on the wall where you're installing the shower and use these measurements to mark and cut the holes for the water control fixtures.
Cutting the holes will be easier if you lay the panel across a couple of saw horses for this procedure. Support the panel with a couple of 2 x 4’s or a sheet of plywood so the panel does not bend excessively and break. Cut holes slowly with your hole saw.

, For some kits, the panels need to be installed in a particular order to make the seals plumb and make the unit more waterproof. It's best to pre-assemble the walls to make sure everything fits, running through the process once before you attach it with adhesive or wall screws. Read the instructions closely to find out whether or not this is true of your kit.


Test fit the panels in the order determined to make sure they fit together properly. Some panel kits are manufactured to fit spaces of a specific size, while others are designed to fit within a dimensional “range.” The kit will specify the dimensions that will accommodate your particular kit.

, Shower pans are manufactured with either a grooved lip or a slightly offset lip around the pan where it makes contact with the walls. These are sometimes called ""exact fit"" or ""variable fit"" panels, and the process will vary slightly depending on what you've got.


Exact-fit panels will slide or snap together. Do this in the order specified in the directions that are included with the kit.
Variable-fit panels allow you to adjust the coverage along the long wall of your shower area. These panels may have a gap up to several inches between two panels, and are “joined” or covered by a formed vertical cap piece or a molded vertical soap dish type of unit that overlaps the two panels to cover the gap. Once in place and sealed, it appears to be a single panel.

, Make sure they are completely clean and dry on the surfaces that will contact the walls. When you're ready to apply panel adhesive and permanently install the shower panels, you'll basically repeat the steps followed to test-fit the panels, but this time, you will applying them permanently.


Some kits will require only screws or nails into pre-drilled holes; others will require panel adhesive that is safe for plastic or fiberglass. Some will require both. Refer to your instructions that came with your kit.

, Carefully lay the first panel to be installed face down on a firm, flat surface. Squeeze a bead of shower and tub adhesive on all surfaces that will come in contact with the walls of the shower area.


If the panel has a large surface area that comes in contact, or if the entire panel comes in contact with the shower wall area, make the bead in the shape of an “X” from corner to corner on the back of the panel.
Next, make another bead in the shape of a “+” from top to bottom and right edge to left edge through the middle of the “X” you just made, and a bead along the entire perimeter of the back of the panel, about 2 inches (5.1 cm) in from the edges of the panels to keep any excess from oozing out when you apply the panels.
Apply some adhesive to the shower pan where the panel will make contact. Be sure to squeeze a continuous bead along the pan lip so it forms a watertight seal.

, Make sure the bottom of the panel fits properly where it joins the shower pan. Use a dry towel to smooth the surface starting at the bottom and working up.


Apply adhesive to the other panels. Repeat as above, then press the remaining panels into place in the order used in the test fitting. Be sure to follow the order provided with the shower kit.
Remove any excess adhesive that has oozed out from pressing the panels in place before the adhesive has a chance to dry. Use the recommended solvent or water as noted in the “cleanup” portion on the adhesive tube. After several hours (when adhesive is dry) caulk all seams and joints for a watertight seal.

, Some shower kits will use screws or nails in addition to adhesive to secure panels. The holes for screws or nails should be pre-drilled into the panels along the outer edges. Once adhesive is applied and you are ready to permanently mount the panels, simply screw or nail through the pre-drilled holes to attach.


Do not completely tighten screws or pound nails in all the way until all panels are in place. This allows you to adjust the panels before fully securing them to the walls.

, Some kits will include molded corner, or seam tower pieces like molded soap dish or shelf towers. You'll attach these with shower and tub adhesive, as directed.

Measure and mark out where the track will go.,
Apply a thin ribbon of silicone caulk to the threshold.,
Place the threshold carefully firmly onto the tub.,
Pre-drill the holes you marked with tile drill bits.,
Hammer your plastic wall anchors into the holes.,
Hold the column back up to the wall and screw it in.,
Install the crossmember.,
Fit the door(s) onto the track.",How to Install a Shower Door2," You'll install the threshold first and the side columns next, so it's a good idea to measure everything out first before you start slapping it on the tub. This will ensure that your shower door will be even and level. Use your level to make sure the mark is true.


Mark where you'd like the threshold track of the shower door to go. Measure the width of the front lip of the tub to find the center point. You want to install the threshold of the shower in the center, so it will be even on the wall and secure. Mark the center point at each end of the tub lip and once in the center with a marker to give yourself a good indicator during installation.
Hold each side column on the tile wall, even with the marks you've made on the lip of the tub. Most of these columns will come pre-cut with holes where the screws will go, usually three of them. Use your marker to make a little dot where the screws will go later, when you're installing the columns.

, Load the tube of silicone plumber's caulk into the caulking gun, if necessary, and cut the tip to open the flow. Squeeze a thin line of caulk to the underside of the threshold, which should be the flat side.


Silicone-based plumber's caulk is water-proof and perfect for attaching the bottom rail to the tub. Water can't permeate the layer of caulk and escape beneath the rail, making your shower efficient and clean.

, Line the metal threshold up with the marks in the center point of the tub's lip and press it down to secure it, smoothing out the caulk underneath. Make sure the rail is secure and lined up perfectly with your marks in the center line. If it's off and it dries, the wall columns will be out of alignment and the shower door won't close properly, so this is critical.


It's a good idea to use a little bit of masking tape to keep the threshold secured to the tub while it dries. It shouldn't take long, five minutes at the most, but while you're working it's a good idea to make sure it can't be jostled and misaligned.
After the threshold dries, hold your side columns back up to the wall to make sure everything lines up evenly before you move on. You may have to remark the holes that you're going to drill if you made a mistake in securing the threshold. Check again with the level to make sure everything is true.

, Fit a small-gauge drill bit designed for cutting through ceramic tile into your power drill and drill into your pre-marked holes about two inches deep. Ceramic tile drill bits have a sharp point with a wide, flat-faced beveled edge that cuts through tile very efficiently.


Some people like to put a little piece of masking tape over the mark on the tile for the drill bit to grip onto while you're drilling. Because most bathroom tile is so smooth, it's easy to slip while you're trying to push the drill bit in, which can be dangerous. It also decreases the chance that the tile will crack or flake while you're drilling.

, Take the wall anchors that came with the shower door and hammer them into the holes firmly with the hammer. These create a solid base for the wall screws to grip into, securing the side columns to the wall. If you don't use these, there won't be anything for the screws to grip.

, Line the holes back up with the wall anchors and secure the column to the wall by screwing them in with the corresponding wall screws. They should seat perfectly into the wall anchors. Repeat this process with the other column to secure it.


Squeeze a thin layer of silicone into the gap where the column meets the tile, on both sides of each. To avoid seepage, it's usually a good idea to apply a thin layer of caulk around each column.

, For most kits, this is a simple press-on fixture that should fit snugly onto the top of the columns. As long as you've measured and screwed everything in correctly, it should snap right on, providing the top edge of the shower door assembly.

, Orient the doors so the handle is on the outside and won't interfere with the opening and closing. On some glass shower doors, you'll probably have to install the rollers into the recesses on the top and bottom edge, which should slip in easily, but will vary some, depending on the manufacturer. Consult the instruction manual for more specific instructions.


Maneuver the glass door so the rollers fit up inside the track, and gently lower it into the threshold. This may take a little practice, especially if you've got a limited amount of space. If you've measured and installed everything correctly, though, it should fit right in with some maneuvering. Make sure the door or the doors slide open easily and smoothly.

Cut the tracks to the appropriate size, if necessary.,
Measure and mark where the track will go.,
Drill the holes you marked.,
Install the bottom threshold track.,
Mount the wall tracks.,
Install the door swinging door.,
Measure and cut the top track.,
Seal any gaps using caulk.",How to Install a Shower Door3," Measure the width at the bottom of the shower opening. Transfer that measurement to the bottom shower door track and mark with your marking pen. If the track fits to size, move forward with installation. If it's too long, you'll need to cut it to the appropriate length.


Using a hacksaw, carefully cut the rail at the mark you made. Be sure the rail is held firmly as you cut to avoid damage to the rail or the saw. Use a file to remove the burrs from all metal pieces you cut.

, Before you go attaching the tracks on forever, you need to place them temporarily and mark where they need to go. Place the bottom track along the base of the shower opening with the higher lip of the track facing outward. Make sure the track sits flat along the surface. There should be about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) of play at each end.


Temporarily tack the bottom track into place with masking tape, then mark the position with your marking pen along the inner and outer edges. Do not remove the bottom track yet.
The wall tracks should be pre-cut to size from the factory. Slide the wall tracks into position with the bottom track. Make sure the wall tracks fit the bottom track exactly. Use your level to check for plumb.
Holding each track firmly, use your marking pen to mark the mounting hole locations on each wall then set the wall tracks aside.

, With a nail or a center punch, tap a small dimple into the marks you made for the holes in the wall tracks to use as a pilot hole. This prevents your drill bit from “skating” and damaging the surface. Drill your mounting holes using the proper bit for the surface of your shower.


If you are drilling into tile, put a small piece of masking tape over each spot to be drilled. This will help prevent chipping. Also, drill deep enough so the plastic screw anchors will fit properly. Anchors won't be needed on fiberglass.

, Run a bead of caulk, about the thickness of a bead of toothpaste, along the bottom mounting surface. Center the bead between the two lines you marked when you measured and run it the full length of the gap as well. Then, firmly set the bottom track into place over the bead of caulk.


Make sure the underside of the track makes contact with the caulking. If not, run a separate bead along the center of the underside of the track.
Hold the track in place for a minute or two, taping it down to hold it in place if necessary. It should be try in five minutes at the most, then you can move forward knowing that it's secure.

, Line them up with the mounting holes and make sure they fit properly over the ends of the bottom track. If you've measured correctly and marked correctly, they should snap right into place.


If your kit included them, place the rubber bumpers that come with most door kits over the screws and secure the tracks to the wall by using your screwdriver to turn the screws into place. Do not completely tighten the screws at this point, hand tight is sufficient.

, Swinging doors will need to be installed differently, according to the kit that you've purchased, so it's important to read the instructions that come with it and follow the directions accordingly. The door needs to be installed so it pivots outward, but for some kits that'll be on the left side and for some that'll be on the right side, and the mechanism works differently, depending. With some, the door will just snap into place, while screws will be used for other kits.


In most swinging door kits, a strip of rubber will be slid into the wall track opposite the pivot point, held with screws in some cases.

, If you had to cut the threshold track, you'll likely also have to cut the top track, since it'll be roughly the same length. Make sure the track fits snugly, connecting between the two wall tracks, and is properly aligned between them. It should just snap right on top.


Many door kits will have corner brackets that are attached with screws to hold the top rail securely. Defer to the instructions of your specific kit, if necessary.

, Finally, run a bead of bathtub caulk along all the points at which the tracks come in contact with the walls. Do this to both inside and outside surfaces to create a neat, watertight seal.


Let the caulk dry thoroughly and wait at least 24 hours before running water in the shower to test your work. It should be dry in a few minutes, but it's a good idea to wait and let things settle before you try it out.

Hang the inside sliding door first.,
Hang the outer door.,
Seal the seams.",How to Install a Shower5," There are lots of different varieties of shower doors, and the final steps will vary depending on the size, the style, and the particular kit that you've purchased. Doors installed for full tub-showers are very different than doors installed for single-unit stand-up showers. Likewise, sliding doors and swinging doors will vary.


If you're installing doors on a full tub, you'll need to measure out and center where you want the threshold track to be placed on the front lip. It will need to be centered, so take the width of the lip of the tub and mark the center point.
For stand-up showers, the track may just slide into place over the shower pan, or may be already locked into place, if you're using a single-unit kit. Always defer to the instructions included in the kit.

, Make sure all the surfaces on which you'll mount the metal door tracks are clean and dry. Run a bead of caulk along the bottom mounting surface, which may be the pan or the tub, according to the kit you're installing. Center the bead between the two lines you marked and run it the full length of the opening.


Firmly set the bottom track into place over the bead of caulk. Make sure the underside of the track makes contact with the caulking. If not, run a separate bead along the center of the underside of the track.

, Line them up with the mounting holes and make sure they fit properly over the ends of the bottom track. Place the rubber bumpers that come with most door kits over the screws and secure the tracks to the wall. The wall tracks will hold the bottom track into place. Do not completely tighten the screws at this point.


There may be no wall tracks for the kit on some showers. If there are none, disregard this step and move onto inserting the door itself.

, Make sure the track fits snugly and is properly aligned between the wall tracks. Many door kits will have corner brackets that are attached with screws to hold the top rail securely.


In some shower kits, the track bars are variable sizes, meaning that they're sold larger than what you may need, and you can cut them to size accordingly. If so, cut the tracks using a hacksaw and file them flush before installing.

, If you're installing sliding doors and both doors have towel bars, mount with the rollers and the towel bar facing inward. Lift the door into the top rail, then carefully fit the top and bottom rollers into the upper and lower tracks. The door should glide easily from end to end if seated properly. If not, carefully retry until properly seated. The door kit should have instructions with proper illustrations for your particular door.


Some doors need to have the rollers installed before popping the door into the place. If so, most of them will just pop right into place. Read the instructions.

, With the towel bar facing outward, mount the outer door in the same manner as the inner door. Carefully align and seat the rollers into the appropriate tracks. The outer door panel should slide freely over the inner door if seated properly.

, Run a bead of bathtub caulk along all surfaces where they come in contact with the door tracks. Do this to both inside and outside surfaces creating a neat, watertight seal. Let the caulk dry for at least 24 hours before running water in the shower to test your job.

Note that you will be making a rectangular shower curtain rod suitable for hanging shower curtains around the bathtub.,
Determine the approximate dimensions of the tub.,
Buy some wood dowel of approximately 1 1/4"" diameter at any home or hardware store.,
While you're there, purchase the inexpensive hand-held shower that fits over the tub spout, and a ball of string or twine.

,
The store will usually be happy to make the one or two cuts you might need to get the dowels to a suitable length.

,
Back home, lay the dowel on the floor in a rectangle, overlapping the corners a few inches.

,
Lash each of the corners together with twine.,
Install four hooks in the ceiling approximately where the corners of the enclosure will be.

,
Use some more twine to hang rectangle from the hooks.,
Install two shower curtains, each extending from the front of the enclosure to the back.,
Install the shower over the tub spout.

,
To shower, slip between the shower curtains, and use the hand held shower.

,
If you use PVC pipe, you can cut and lash them as described above, or you can also try the following method.",How to Create an Inexpensive Shower Enclosure for an Old Fashioned Bathtub,";
, If you don't have a tape measure, use a piece of string.

, You'll need one long dowel for each of the long sides of the tub, and one short dowel each for the front and back. Probably you'll end up purchasing three dowels and cutting one of them into two short pieces.

,,,, If you don't know how to do this, find anyone who's ever been a girl scout or boy scout to help you.

,, Adjust the length of the twine to hang this contraption somewhat level and centered above the tub.

, Overlap the curtains by about two rings. If your enclosure is really big you might need more shower curtains.

,,, This is only recommended if you're reasonably handy:


Mark where the corners/bends will be with a marker, allowing for a curve radius of about 6 inches (15.2 cm).
Heat up the marked section of pipe with a flame, such as a blowtorch or gas stove.
Do not breathe the smoke/fumes from the heated pipe.
Move the pipe constantly to heat the entire area.
It will probably take several minutes for the pipe to soften.
Once the PVC becomes rubbery, bend it to the desired position, and submerge in a sink full of cold water.
Continue for the other bends.
The pipe will inevitably have burn marks, sand or paint them if you like.

Apply the caulking.,
Apply a sealant.",How to Clean and Re Grout Bathroom Tile," Scrub with an abrasive rag, or rig a nylon bristle drill attachment. Pay extra attention to the bottom section, because that is usually the area with the most mildew. Rinse well.;
, Cover the drain. Carefully rake each joint with a diamond carbide rake. Be careful not to slip, or it will leave irreparable scratch marks. The surface should be wet during this part of the process.


If the grout is too solid to rake, hot water usually helps.
Remove caulking with a plastic scraper. Avoid using metal scrapers and steel wool, because they will scratch the enamel on the tub.

, Mix the grout thoroughly until it comes to a creamy consistency.

, Work in small sections so that the grout remains pliable. Make sure that the grout is packed in well. Allow twenty minutes to an hour for the grout to dry completely.

, Sponge the surface of the tiles until the joints are neat, and the tile surface is clean. Soak and rinse the sponge repeatedly to avoid dragging, and over saturation. Allow twenty minutes to an hour to dry.


Rubber gloves should be worn for this.

, When the surface is dry, it should look hazy. Polish the tiles with a fine rag, or an old t-shirt. Be careful not to apply pressure on the joints. If there are any stubborn spots on the tiles, they can easily be scraped off with a plastic scraper.


Gloves and a dust mask should be worn for this.

, Prepare the surface by thoroughly cleaning and drying. Most caulking won't adhere to a surface that is oily or wet. Apply silicone, or vinyl caulking to tub/tile edge to keep this area watertight. Caulk around the faucet handles, tub spout, and overflow as needed.

, When the grout has cured, (three to seven days), apply a tile sealant according to the manufacturer's instructions.

,
Wet your index finger with water and gently smooth the caulk against the side of the sink's rim and the counter top to completely seal the gap.

,
When you are happy with the results, insert a small screw into the tip to seal the tube of caulk, so you can use it again in your next project.

,
Let the caulk cure for at least 24 hours before using the sink.

",How to Caulk a Bathroom Sink," Make sure the area is clean and dry and has no dust or debris to get in the way of the caulk.;
, Caulk is a soft material that cuts easily and stretches when pulled.

, Pull the caulk free from the sink and counter.

,,, Cut just enough of the tip off to allow the caulk to fill the gap next to the rim; cutting away too much of the tip will mean too much caulk on your counter.

, Squeeze the trigger lightly to prime the tube.

Wipe off.,
Use a vacuum cleaner with an attachment to vacuum the joint.,
Allow the shower to sit overnight without being used.,
Load the caulk tube into the caulk gun, pulling the pressure rod back and sliding the bottom of the tube into the device.

,
Squeeze the trigger gently until the pressure rod makes contact with the base of the caulk tube.

,
Cut the tip of the tube at a 45-degree angle using a pair of scissors.,
Rest the opening of the tube against the point where one of the vertical seams of the shower enclosure meets the ceiling or the soffit.,
Squeeze the trigger gently and pull down slowly on the caulk gun, guiding the nozzle along the joint and squeezing out a steady stream of caulk.,
Rest the curved tip of the back of a plastic spoon at the beginning of your caulk line.,
Wipe the exterior of the caulk tube and the spoon with a damp sponge.,
Move on to the next joint to be caulked and repeat the steps until you have caulked all of the shower joints.,
Allow the caulk to cure for 24 to 48 hours before you use the shower again.

",How to Caulk Shower Enclosures,";
, Be careful not to scratch the surface of the shower enclosure.


If the caulk will not scrape off, then blow hot air against the surface using a hair dryer to loosen the seal.

, When all visible caulk is removed, wipe the areas that you are joining with a towel that has been dipped in denatured alcohol. The alcohol will remove any residual soap scum and will loosen any remaining caulk.

, This will remove any residual caulk that you may have missed during the scraping process.

, This will ensure that the surface is fully dry, which will help the caulk to adhere.

,,, Keep the opening narrow so that you don’t push too much caulk from the tube as you work, and make sure that the opening is in alignment with the base of the gun for easy application.

, Caulk the vertical seams and the corners of the shower enclosure first.

, Avoid frequent stopping and starting so that you produce a smooth surface.

, Push gently on the spoon so that you are pressing the caulk into the seam while smoothing the top of the caulk’s surface. Pull the spoon down the seam slowly until you have smoothed the entire application.

, This will keep caulk from drying on the surface and interfering with the smoothness of your application.

, Again, caulk the vertical seams and corners first, the horizontal seam along the back of the shower second and the horizontal seams on the sides of the shower third. Caulk between the shower door and the edge of the enclosure last.

Assemble the necessary tools.,
Examine the grab bar kit.,
Determine mounting location.,
Mark the location of the stud.,
Pre-drill pilot holes.,
Install the wall anchors.,
Seal the seams with silicone caulk.,
Test at the end by pulling on it.",How to Install a Grab Bar," Grab bars are relatively simple to install for experienced home repairers as well as weekenders with the proper tools. To do the job right, you'll need:


Pen or pencil
Masking tape
Electric drill
Grab bar, available at home repair stores
Glass and tile bit, sized to the wall anchors
General purpose or wooden metal bit, also sized
Hand screwdriver
Wall screws
Silicone shower caulk;
, Take everything out of the box, making sure the grab bar is in good condition. Check to see what screws are included and whether or not the anchors match the diameter of your tile bit. If not, you'll need to get a new tile bit.

, This will vary depending on who the intended user is, as well as the location of the studs in the wall. In general, the bar needs to be about waist high for the shower user, to make it useful.


Locate two studs on the wall to screw the grab bar to. Studs are typically spaced 16 inches (40.6 cm) apart, measured from center to center. You can locate them by knocking on the wall above the tile, checking in the room on the other side of the bath wall, or using a stud sensor.
Use a stud finder where there is not tile to find the studs. Can usually measure 16 inches (40.6 cm) on center from where you know there is a stud (usually a corner), but it won’t always work. Be sure to find both edges of the stud.

, Extend the stud marks down to the grab bar location with a level, then place a strip of 1-1/2 in. masking tape on the tile to indicate the location of the studs. A good location for a bar is at an angle between two wall studs on the long back wall of the tub. The bottom of the bar should be about 6 to 10 in. above the top of the tub. For studs 16 in. apart, a 24-in. long bar provides a nice angle.


Place marks on the masking tape where the screws will go to position the bar properly. Drilling through the masking tape is typically done to keep the drill bit from skating across the tile and scraping it up. It also helps to keep the tile from cracking in some cases.

, Since most showers are tiled, you'll need to use a glass and tile bit. These usually feature a spade tip, but you can also find diamond ones which are slightly longer lasting. Most anchors will recommend the appropriate hole size to drill. Find a drill bit that is as close to the size of the shank of the screw as possible without being bigger.


Most bars will need about an 1/8-in. hole with a glass-and-tile bit at the mark closest to the center of each stud to confirm the stud location. If you hit solid wood, drill the remaining holes. If not, poke a piece of bent wire through the hole and probe until you feel the stud. Reposition the grab bar and mark the holes over the new stud position. In most cases, the unused hole will be covered by the mounting plate on the grab bar.
Once you are through the tile, to go through wood or cement board (behind the tile), change to a wood bit afterwards to finish drilling. If you forget to change, the drill will be less effective and may ruin the bit. Use a 1/4-in. glass-and-tile or masonry bit to enlarge the holes through the tile, but use a 5/32 in. bit to drill into the wood.

, Different wall anchors are installed in different ways, but most varieties are simply plastic wedges that are hammered into the holes to provide something for the wall screws to grip onto. Put these into the holes you've drilled, then slide the screws through the grab bar, put the grab bar in the wall, and tighten. Follow the specific instructions included with your grab bar kit.


No. 10 or 12 stainless steel pan head screws are commonly used for the purpose. If so, make sure the screws penetrate the studs at least an inch. In most cases, 2 in. screws are long enough.
Don't use toggle bolts on the ends of the bar. Toggle bolts rely on the strength of the wall backing, usually drywall or concrete boards. Distributing 200+ lbs. over a square inch or two of this type of material will not make for a sufficiently sturdy grab bar.

, To keep water from seeping through the tile into the holes you've drilled, you need to put a small bead of silicone around the seam. Cut a small angle through the tube of caulk, then run a very small bead around the grab bar, where it meets the wall.


Some people like to caulk the back of the flange before screwing the bar to the wall. This helps to create extra security and strength in the bar.

, Give the caulk an hour or two to dry thoroughly, then give a small amount of force to make sure it is not loose, then try more force. Give the bars a good solid yank to test their holding power. Let the caulk dry for at least 24 hours before running water in the shower.

Choose your lighting.,
Use round hanging mirrors.,
Install a tub.,
Add some foliage.,
Select your artwork.",How to Create a Farmhouse Style Bathroom1," There are a range of acceptable options for farmhouse style bathroom lighting. The most common option is a downward-curving sconce in a vintage style of silver or copper. Use bare bulbs or a simple glass covering over your bulbs.Alternately, antique hanging light fixtures might work, or light fixtures that resemble a candelabra with candle-style bulbs.;
, Instead of the traditional wide, rectangular, across-the-wall mirror that you find in most modern bathrooms, choose a round hanging mirror.Alternately, use boxy mirrors with a square or rectangular shape instead of round hanging mirrors.

, Tubs, not showers, are the preferred bathing technology in the farmhouse style bathroom.A simple white tub elevated on four legs (known as a clawfoot tub) is the best option.Avoid installing a plastic shell-style tub. They are inappropriate for a farmhouse style bathroom.

, A small glass vase of lilacs will look great on a shelf in your farmhouse style bathroom.Alternately, place a tin or copper bucket with wild flowers or ferns on your counter.You might also like white flowers like daisies to match your white décor.
Avoid bold colors like bright red or orange.
Stick to a single color or species when selecting foliage for your farmhouse style bathroom.

, Imagery will help emphasize your bathroom’s farmhouse theme. Pictures of farm animals like chickens, cows, or horses are good options, as are scenes depicting crops and fields. Choose art that evokes farm life to put the finishing touch on your farmhouse style bathroom.You might also choose to incorporate antique signs that gesture toward small-town life of a previous era."

Remove the masking tape before the caulk starts to skin over.",How to Caulk a Bathtub," Clean all old caulk, mildew and soap scum from the edge of bathtub. Be careful not to scratch surface of tub. Wipe with denatured alcohol to clean and remove any moisture from each seam. Rubbing alcohol contains oil that leaves residue (to keep from drying out your skin) and should not be used for cleaning.;
, There are choices in color and price. It seems more silicone costs more. Silicone caulk for kitchen and bath has a mildew preventer built in it.

, This is a technique that professionals use to ensure a perfectly even-looking bead with no mess. There should be about an eighth of an inch between the two pieces of tape.

, Using a sharp knife, cut the application tip on score mark. Opening should not be so big that a bead cannot be formed. Opening should not be so small that caulk tube seems highly pressurized. Most tubes have a thin barrier inside the tube to prevent the caulk from curing. Pierce the barrier by inserting a wire, nail or pointed object inside tip.

, Caulk should flow out, not squirt or drip. Release trigger lock to relieve the light pressure inside tube.

, Tip should be slightly above surface, nearly touching. As you begin to press trigger, watch flow of caulk. With one steady motion, move caulk gun straight along seam, creating a uniform bead. Before flow stops, quickly release trigger and begin to press again as you continue to create a uniform bead the entire length of seam. Do not stop until you reach corner.

,,, Keep a few paper towels at hand to wipe your finger off if you need to.

, The bead should look neat and even, but you may need to clean it up slightly with your finger again for a perfect finish. Caulk must cure for 24/36 hours before exposing to water and moisture.

Shop around for your favorite style.,
Think about the overall fit of your sink.,
Look for durable materials that you will be able to clean.,
Browse the selections.,
Check for additional bathroom sinks online.",How to Buy a Bathroom Sink," To prevent the bathroom from getting too crammed, the center of the sink should be at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the closest wall. Use a tape measure to determine the length and width of the area you have planned for the sink.;
, Most sinks are around 34 inches (86.4 cm) from the ground. Vessel sinks, which sit on top of a counter or a vanity, can be tricky to measure because they tend to look like a bowl sitting on a counter. When you measure for a vessel sink, remember that there will be several inches of sink extending up from the vanity or counter, rather than dropping into it.

, Bathroom sinks can cost from under $100 for a basic sink to several thousands of dollars for more ornate or custom fixtures. Decide how much you are able to spend before you start shopping.

, Once you know what will fit in your bathroom, you can decide between the many different bathroom sink designs.


Keep a common and traditional look with a wall mounted sink. These are ideal for small bathrooms. These basic models have no floor support and the drain is often visible beneath it.
Choose a pedestal sink if you have limited space, but you want to conceal the plumbing. These sinks are secured to the floor and have no wall mounting.
Create a trendy look with a vessel sink. These look like large bowls and come in many different materials and colors.
Maintain a versatile bathroom with a drop-in sink. Also called self-rimming or top-mount sinks, these can be installed into any counter top or vanity. Made of cast iron or china, they often have an extra overflow drain, and their piping is concealed by the counter top.
Use a framed vanity sink for an older-home feel. Also popular in apartment bathrooms, these sinks are trimmed with a metal frame and they fit into plastic vanity counter tops.
Choose a console bathroom sink if you like the ease of a wall mounted sink, but prefer the extra support of two legs at the front of the sink.
Consider an under mount sink if you have a solid surface, such as stone. These are installed beneath the counter top, and their basins are slightly wider than the counter top opening. These are modern and provide a sleek look to an upscale bathroom.

, Make sure the sink you choose will fit with your plumbing, the faucets and other hardware you have in your bathroom. If you are completely remodeling the bathroom, you can plan all of this ahead of time. If you are simply replacing your sink, you will need to be sure it is compatible with what is already in place.

, Most sinks are made from cast iron, porcelain, vitreous china, fire clay, stone, glass, metal, concrete, or even bamboo and wood. Ask about cleaning instructions and what to do in case of damage.

, Check local hardware stores, home improvement centers and design showrooms. Most places will provide delivery and installation.

, You may be able to find a larger selection and lower prices online. Conduct an Internet search for bathroom sinks, and thousands of online retailers will come up, including well-known sites such as Amazon and eBay.

Adopt a minimalist style.,
Use white.,
Use wood.,
Purchase antiques.",How to Create a Farmhouse Style Bathroom2," The farmhouse style bathroom conforms to minimalist principles of design. Use a limited palette consisting of just a few colors. For instance, you might have light flooring of wood or tile, a green plant or two, and dark wicker furniture. When placing shelves and furniture, line everything up at right angles. Don’t include more lighting, shelving, or storage elements than are necessary., When choosing sink and bathtub colors, choose white. Other bathroom elements like tiles, furniture, or towels should be white, too. White bathroom elements give your farmhouse style bathroom a clean look.If you dislike white, you could choose tile or paint in pastel hues – light blue, gray, or yellow – or a rustic-style wallpaper with simple designs.

, Wooden flooring is the obvious place to incorporate wood into your farmhouse style bathroom. However, you could also choose to frame your mirror with a rustic, unvarnished wood frame. Wooden picture frames and furniture would also look perfect in your farmhouse style bathroom.Choose wooden furniture or wooden flooring, but not both. Contrasting materials will make your farmhouse style bathroom more stylish.

, Antiques are perfect for a farmhouse style bathroom, especially for things that are used minimally or are merely ornamental. For instance, an antique wooden picture frame, towel ring, light fixture, or mirror will give your farmhouse style bathroom that timeworn look that makes the farmhouse style bathroom so attractive.You can get antiques at your local antique shop or flea market, or online.

Fill them with bars of soap, cotton swabs, or other bathroom essentials.You don’t have to use Mason jars. Any sort of large glass jar will do. But Mason jars are closely associated with the sort of simple rustic charm you should be aiming for when creating a farmhouse style bathroom.

, Wire baskets and bins are a standard component in farmhouse style bathrooms. You can use them to store bottles of shampoo, soap, toilet paper, or towels. Store the wire baskets and bins beneath the sink, on the back of the toilet, or on shelves located throughout the bathroom., Wicker can bring a bit of rustic charm to your farmhouse style bathroom. For instance, wicker baskets can be used to store towels, toilet paper, and other bathroom essentials. Use wicker tables and chairs as makeshift shelves. And wicker baskets are perfect for storing fresh or soiled towels., Wooden toolboxes or small wooden containers add a homespun charm to your farmhouse style bathroom. Place a longer wooden toolbox on a shelf or at the end of your bathroom counter. Stuff smaller wooden boxes with bathroom essentials and hand towels."

Let the caulk cure before using the shower.",How to Caulk a Shower," While there are different methods you can use to remove caulk. Get ride of old caulk by slicing it off with a razor scraper, utility knife, or five-in-one painter's tool.









Using quick, sharp strokes, slice through the length of the old caulk and peel off the majority of the loosened caulk using your fingers.
Note that metal blades and chemical caulk removers can damage plastic tubs. Use a plastic razor if your tub or shower is made of plastic, not ceramic.;
, Scrub the sides of the shower with a dry, nonabrasive pad or sponge to wipe away all residue left behind by the old caulk.









When done, wipe the area down with a damp, soft rag to remove any caulk dust. Dry thoroughly with a dry rag, hair dryer, or paper towels.
If your old caulk was made of silicone, you will need to use a pad soaked in mineral spirits. Use a soft rag, however, and not an abrasive one.

, Place two strips of tape equidistant from either side of each joint being caulked. The lines of tape should run parallel to each other and be spaced roughly 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) apart from each other.









The tape is used to help keep the bead of caulk straight and uniform.

, When selecting a caulk for your shower, use one labeled ""Tub and Tile"" or ""Kitchen and Bath,"" as these are usually chemically formulated to resist mildew and stick the smooth surfaces like your shower.








In particular, there are two types of caulk usually used for showers: silicone and acrylic latex.
Silicone is very flexible, tough, and waterproof. On the downside, it can also be difficult to smooth and may require the use of mineral spirits to clean up. The color range can also be fairly limited.
Acrylic latex is easier to apply, clean up, and smooth. It also comes in a wider range of colors. On the downside, it dries harder and shrinks more than silicone caulk does, so acrylic latex caulk will probably have a shorter lifespan.

, Trim the nozzle of the caulk tube near the tip, cutting it off at a 45 degree angle.


The hole should only be big enough to fill the joint. As a general rule, the hole of the tube should actually be about 2/3 the size of the actual joint needing to be filled. The measurement for most showers should be about 3/16 inch (4.8 mm).
Use a utility knife with a fresh blade or a 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide, razor-sharp chisel to cut the tip off the nozzle.
Note that some nozzles actually need to be punched in order to begin the caulking flow. If a nail does not prove long enough, use thin, stiff wire like electrical wire or a coat hanger.
Some tubes of caulk will even have a line on the nozzle to indicate the point at which you should cut.
If your initial cut produces a bead that is too small, you can cut a little more off the tip.
If a piece of plastic remains hanging on the nozzle after being cut, pare it down with your utility knife to remove it completely before starting. Otherwise, this little burr can prevent the caulk from being smooth.
To improve the process even further, use 100-grit sandpaper to smooth and right the tip a bit.

, Cheaper guns tend to be less predictable and may lead to sloppier application, but a professional gun applies more consistent pressure.









A professional level gun does not need to cost a lot, either. Power caulk guns can be very pricey, but all you need is a professional hand-powered caulk gun, which might fit into your budget better.
A cradle caulking gun will produce the best, most even pressure and is a better long-term investment than a frame caulking gun. If using the latter, though, at least make sure to look for one labeled as being ""dripless.""

, Release the pressure off the handle once you see the caulk at the tip and clean off any excess with a moist rag.









This precaution brings the caulk right up to the tip of the caulk tube, so it will be ready for use once you bring it up to the shower joint.

, The nozzle should be positioned at a 45 degree angle out from the joint.









The tube tip should directly meet the surface of the joint.

, Press the trigger gently to release the caulk bead into the joint. As you move the caulk gun along the length of the joint, continue applying even pressure to create an even line.









You can either push or pull the gun. It is entirely a matter of preference, so do whichever option feels most comfortable to you.
If you are right-handed, you might find it best to brace the nozzle with your left hand and squeeze the handle with your right. For left-handed individuals, try the opposite.
After squeezing your nozzle the first time, do not squeeze it again until there is a good size drop coming out of the nozzle.

, If the rate at which the caulk is flowing differs too much from the rate at which you move the caulk gun, you could end up with a messy situation.









If you move the caulk gun too fast, the bead will become too thin and will break too quickly.
If you move the caulk gun too slow, you will end up wasting caulk and creating more mess.

, Caulk should only be used to temporarily patch up small patches of missing grout in between tiles. If a large amount of grout is missing, caulk is not a good substitution.









Ultimately, patching up missing grout with more grout is a better alternative, but it can be difficult to do without the exact shade of grout used.
For larger patches of missing grout, you will need to scrape the old grout out with an oscillating tool equipped with a tile blade before re-grouting.
Even if you do use caulk to temporarily repair a few small gaps in your tile grouting, you should not treat this as a permanent solution. If the grout is getting old, you will need to replace it sooner or later.

,









Look for areas where holes have already developed. Chip away the grout surrounding the hole to get rid of the weakened grout around that hole.
Work carefully so that you do not crack the tile by accident.

, Quickly swipe a small bead or line of caulk over the hole to fill it in. Hold the tip of the nozzle at a 45 degree angle from the hole itself.









Use even pressure as you drag the caulk gun over the hole, and work at a pace that roughly matches the pace of the caulk gun to avoid making excess messes.
As with shower joints, it is not necessarily a bad idea to apply painter's tape around the crack in the grout to prevent caulk from getting on the surrounding tile.

, You should either use dampened fingers or a moist, lint-free cloth rag to smooth out the bead of caulk immediately after applying it.









If using a rag, press it into and along the caulk with your finger to apply the appropriate amount of pressure.
Work in a continuous motion to avoid inconsistencies and to create a smooth, concave line.
If you can do both at once, you can save yourself time by placing the tip of your index finger over the joint as you caulk. By applying a small amount of even and consistent downward pressure, you can apply and smooth the caulk at once
If using your fingertip, clean your finger off periodically with a damp rang to prevent the caulk from smearing everywhere.
Smoothing is essential for both aesthetic and practical purposes. During the smoothing process, the caulk is forced to adhere more securely to the surface it fills.

, For many silicone caulks, you will need to wipe down the excess caulk with a soft cloth rag soaked in mineral spirits.









Wear a disposable nitrile, latex, or vinyl glove to protect your finger from wear and tear. It also makes the process much easier to clean up afterward since the glove can simply be removed and thrown away.

, Peel the tape off slowly and do not let it touch any of the fresh caulk.









If the tape left ""ridges"" of caulk behind, you should clean these up by smoothing the area out again with a damp rag or damp finger.
Pull the tape off at a downward, outward angle.

, You should wait for at least 24 hours before running the water or using the shower.









If you run the water over the caulk before it finishes curing, you might rinse some of it away or cause it to smear and run, creating a big mess.

Focus on prevention.,

Extend the rain gutter downspouts well out and away from your home.,
Walk around outside in your yard during a heavy rainstorm.,
Provide emergency power.,
Install a sump pump.,
Install a backup sump pump.,
Make an emergency family plan.,
Have flood insurance.",How to Protect a Basement from Flooding1," Long before you're in a flooding situation, look around your property for ways to divert rainwater away from your home. Important considerations are extending rain gutter down spouts away from your home and making sure the grade of your yard surfaces slope away from your home.

, Blocked gutters will cause all of the roof water to dump directly against your foundation, increasing the likelihood of basement flooding.

, Do not connect the downspouts to your foundation footer drain tiles or to underground dry wells. This will only cause the roof water to further saturate the ground and cause flooding in your basement.

, Watch to see if water is ponding next to your home and if surface water is being directed toward your home. If this is the case, seek a local landscaper or excavation contractor for advice on ways to regrade your yard so the surface water is directed away from your home., Install an automatic emergency generator to provide electric service for essential circuits like your furnace or electric heat, well pump, refrigerator, septic tank pump and sump pump in the case when power is lost. Without emergency backup power, you may return home to unnecessary basement flooding, frozen water pipes and a flooded septic tank.

, An automatic sump pump should help keep water leakage normal amounts of rainfall from building up in the basement. As long as the sump pump tank has an opening in the lid, the sump pump will act like a huge floor drain and keep the water from getting deep.

, The sump pump is your first line of defense against basement flooding. However, the most reliable sump pump available in the industry is still a mechanic device and can fail. A backup sump pump system, preferably with at least a battery-operated pump, configured with a switch device to begin working if the main is out of commission, greatly reduces the chance of flood. Some systems come with additional security features such as an alarm that goes off whenever the battery operated is started.

, Plan ahead with your family so that everyone has each other cell phone and other contact numbers. If you live in an area that is prone to historic flooding, plan ahead of time where you'll be able to stay until flood waters subside. Keep in mind that all your neighbors will probably need housing too. As local hotels are usually inundated during flooding events, try to arrange ahead of time with some local family members away from the flooding area to have temporary housing if ever needed.

, Add flood insurance onto your existing homeowner's policy. Flood insurance is provided by the government and is fairly inexpensive. In the USA, if your home insurance agent does not provide flood insurance, contact FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) for local agencies that do."

Open the door to your basement at least once a month and run an oscillating fan in the basement for between 1 and 2 hours to promote air circulation.

,
Place materials such as clothing, furniture, books, and paperwork in areas away from the basement walls or remove them from the basement completely to prevent increased humidity levels and mold growth.

Get a propane or natural gas generator.,
Make sure you have a sump pump.,
Check to see if your sump pump has backup power or if the battery in the backup sump pump is fully charged.",How to Protect a Basement from Flooding2," Do not waste your time buying a gasoline powered generator. You will have to be at home at the time of the power outage to start it. You'll also have to keep returning to your home to add gasoline.


There is a wide variety of propane or natural gas generators that run automatically when your power goes out. They set up to run once a week automatically to keep the battery charged.
You can be at work or on vacation when an emergency occurs. Your automatic emergency generator will assure that all your important electrical circuits have power for heat, sump pumps and refrigerators.;
, It is more important than your plasma TV or a refrigerator. Without it, it's just like the Titanic in an iceberg field: bad.

, A simple 30-minute thunderstorm can quickly destroy weekends worth of sweat equity – unless your sump pump has backup power.


Emergency power comes in three basic forms. Backup battery systems come in different configurations. Some will work for a few hours but some state-of-the-art battery backup sump pump systems will have enough power to keep a basement from flooding under most circumstances. Some systems allow you to add more than one battery to double the duration of the power. A standby generator offers automatic AND long-term protection. It also protects your whole house, but it is more expensive. Since standby generators are also used to keep your beer cold and your TV tuned into the big game keeping your family safe and warm during a disaster you might want to add the protection of a battery backup with the sole purpose of keeping your basement dry.

, With the lid on, pick up the primer container and shake it vigorously to mix the contents.

,, Generously coat the entire wall surface with the primer.


Use a wide polyester/nylon brush or roller to apply the primer. The brush should be between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm). Choose a 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch (1.3-cm to 1.9-cm) roller cover.
Cut in a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.6-cm) border around the top, bottom and sides of the walls. Start by applying primer in 1 corner and continue along the edge of the basement wall.
Paint the primer onto the walls in 4-foot by 2-foot (1.2-m by .6-m) sections. As you apply the paint, overlap into the previously applied areas, including the cut in areas, for consistent coverage.

Identify the source of the smell.,
Remove all mildew- and mold-infected objects.,
Give the entire basement a thorough cleaning.,
Deodorize and ventilate your basement.,
Make sure you fix the initial cause of mildew.",How to Make a Basement Smell Better," Most basements suffer from a musty, earthy kind of smell caused by mildew, which is a type of fungus that thrives in warm, humid areas that don't have much lighting. Humidity can be caused by leaky pipes, or even hot and cold pipes that cause condensation under the right temperature conditions. Check behind your basement walls, in your basement's crawl spaces, along the ceiling tiles, and in the tiny nooks and crannies.;
, When you've discovered the source of the musty smell, you have 2 choices: to try to clean out the mildew and mold smell from everything infected by it, or simply to throw away whatever has the smell embedded within. However, whichever choice you make, you'll have to clean out the basement by taking the infected objects outside, allowing the basement to breathe and be cleaned of that moldy basement smell.


If you had items in storage that are affected by the smell, you'll need to make a decision between keeping them and throwing them away. Cleaning out the musty smell from books and papers can be very difficult. If you keep them, the smell will permeate the basement again, undoing much of your work in cleaning it. If you don't want to throw them away, you'll need to keep them in an airtight container or find a new location to store them in.
If you had clothes in the basement, they will need to be laundered in order to get the smell out. In some extreme cases, the musty and moldy smell will be extremely difficult or even impossible to remove, in which case you might consider throwing them away.
If the musty smell is embedded into objects like furniture and carpets, you'll need to take them outside when the weather is dry; ideally, when the sun is out and humidity is low. Allow them to be aired out and sun-dried for a few hours and, if possible, give them a few good hits with a broom to free dust and other particles that might carry the smell as well.
Sometimes, even sun-drying and airing out will not kill the smell. In this case, it might be easier and more convenient to just start over by purchasing new carpeting and furniture for your basement.

, Once the basement has been evacuated of all objects, you'll need to spend some time cleaning the walls and fixtures in order to get rid of all the mold and mildew and particles carrying the smell. Wear protective gloves, a face mask, and scrub everything with a heavy-duty brush and cleaning solution.


If you'd like to use a homemade solution for cleaning, consider the following combination: 2 parts hydrogen peroxide, 2 parts white vinegar, 1 part boric acid, and 4 parts water. Avoid using too much of the solution when cleaning, however, as you may build up excess moisture in your basement.

, After the results of scrubbing have been mopped and wiped away, bring in some fresh air to aid in the drying process. If you have windows, open them up. If you don't have windows, open your basement door and place a fan downstairs to help with air circulation. This step is important and will go a long way towards preventing your basement from musty smells in the future.

, If you have a leaky pipe, make sure you get that fixed. If your pipes are causing condensation, wrap them in insulation. If your basement is naturally humid, consider installing a dehumidifier. For a more permanent solution, consider connecting your basement to your home ventilation system.

Make sure conditions are right before starting the project.,
Clean your basement floor thoroughly.,
Protect baseboards and fixtures with masking tape.,
Choose the paint for the project.",How to Paint Your Basement Floor," Concrete can be difficult to paint. It must be treated so paint will stick to it, and painting should only be done within a specified temperature range and dry conditions.


Test the humidity in your basement by taping a piece of plastic onto the floor and letting it sit for 24 hours. If condensation appears on the plastic, moisture is seeping through the floor.
Moisture appearing on the outside of the plastic means the room is too humid. Use a dehumidifier to make conditions right for painting.
Water on the underside of the plastic means the moisture is making its way through the concrete. Clean out your gutters and downspouts to help alleviate this problem.
Don't paint your basement floor if room temperature exceeds 90 degrees F (32.2 degrees C) or is 40 degrees F (4.44 degrees C) or colder.;
, A concrete floor must be properly readied to ensure that the paint will adhere to it.


Move all furniture out of the area that will be painted. The heavy-duty paint you'll use to paint your basement floor contains a chemical component that requires timely application. You'll have to paint the entire room at once, so furniture must be stored elsewhere.
Sweep the floor, including baseboards. Make sure no dirt of debris will ruin your paint job.
Use a degreasing agent as needed to remove oil and other substances from the surface.
Scrub the floor with a detergent and water mixture, using a heavy brush. Your floor must be free of grime for the paint to stick.
Mop the entire floor with clean water and let the surface dry.
Repair cracks or other imperfections in the floor using a concrete patch kit and trowel. Kits are available at home-improvement stores.

, By taping off the perimeter of the floor, you can complete the job faster.

, Epoxy floor paints are ideal for concrete floors. They're scuff-resistant, adhere well to concrete, and are easy to use.


Mix your epoxy floor paint with a catalyst. The catalyst makes the paint harden quickly, so once you mix the paint, you'll want to get started on the job.
Cut along baseboards and fixtures with a brush.
Use a roller to paint the rest of the surface area. Paint from the far corner back.
Allow the surface to dry thoroughly before laying down a second coat. Remember to mix your epoxy with a catalyst each time you paint a concrete floor.

Paint the remaining stairs with 2 coats of porch and floor paint.",How to Paint Basement Stairs," Remove staples left from the carpet installation with pliers. Look over all areas of the stairs to find holes and deep scratches.;
, If you have a cement staircase, you will want to fill holes with epoxy. Before buying, ensure that it is specially formulated for filling small holes in concrete.

, You can simply paint your stairs in a single color, or you can paint the riser a different color than the top of the step. The following are new styles of stair painting:


Paint the front of the stair and the top in a single color. Stencil a number onto the front of the stair, so that you can see all the numbers when you stand at the bottom. This is a great idea for houses with small children, because they have a reminder every time they use the stairs.
Paint the stair tops. Then, use paint samples to paint each stair front a different color. You can also alternate between 2 or 3 colors that match your basement décor.
Paint the top of the step. Put up colorful, patterned wallpaper on the risers. This part of the stair will have less wear and tear than the top of the step, so the wallpaper will last a long time with some strong glue. Save extra sections of wallpaper to do repairs in the future.
Paint a runner into the stairs. Use a different color for the outside edges of the stair top and riser than the inside portion. Use painter's tape to keep these sections separate.
Paint the top of the stair. Use bead board on the riser. Bead board is a classic style that adds a professional touch if your basement stairs connect to a well-used section of your house.
Allow your kids to paint the risers. Give them acrylic paints and allow them to come up with their own designs. Protect the risers as you paint the tops of the steps.

, Visit a home improvement store and bring home paint chips. Once you have decided on the color scheme you would like to use, you can ask the store to prepare the paint.

, Mix your colors in this formula because it will be more durable. It comes in satin and high gloss, some of which are oil-based paints.


If you are painting the walls around your stairs, buy wall paint instead of using the porch and floor paint. Your hardware store should be able to match colors and finishes.

, If you have concrete stairs, you will want to wash them with a detergent, like TSP. If you have wooden stairs, sweep them, sand them, if necessary, and run a tack cloth over the surfaces.

, They can mix this well with their paint mixer. You can also mix it using a stir stick at home. However, it may not be as uniform.

, Use painter's tape so you don't rip away any of the paint.

, You may choose to use a large bristle brush with wood stairs, so that you can follow the grain. You can use a roller or a foam brush on cement stairs.


Painting every other stair allows you to sit on 1 stair while you paint others. It also allows you to exit the area in either direction during your project.

, Apply a second coat for increased durability. Allow it to dry well before returning to paint the remaining stairs.

, Wear socks or clean shoes to step on your newly painted stairs while they cure.

Begin by distinguishing between what you want to keep and what you can eliminate.,
Determine what to do with the items you choose to eliminate.,
Organize the remaining items in your basement.",How to Organize a Basement," You have to be honest with yourself during this process. Many people opt to keep things with the intention of using them, even though they have not used them in years. If you really want to keep something, make a solid plan as to when you will use it. If you cannot come up with one, let it go.;
,


Decide what can be thrown away from the pile of items you don't want to keep. These include trash and items that are broken, without any chance of being repaired. These are the worn out and destroyed items. Get rid of them immediately so that you can evaluate what you have left.
Determine what can be sold when organizing the basement. If you have the time and the desire, then consider selling some of your items to make some cash. If you only have a few things, register on eBay and sell them online. If you have a lot, then have a yard sale. Whichever option you decide, act on it immediately. Set a date to have your yard sale or sign up on eBay. If you make the decision to sell with the promise to do it someday, then you are risking building upon the items and never getting rid of them. Make a plan, and act upon it immediately.
Donate the remaining items to a local charity or your church. Make sure the items are applicable to the cause. The library, Goodwill and the Salvation Army are popular options.

, These are the items that you cannot live without, but have no room for in the main house. If they belong in the basement, then make a place for them so that they are protected. If you want to use them regularly, then make them accessible.


Remove items from cardboard boxes, and organize them into plastic totes. This will give you an opportunity to view what's actually in the boxes and decide if you really want them. Additionally, totes will keep your items dry and protected in an organized basement. If there is a flood, cardboard boxes will get wet and damage the items inside. Opt for clear stackable bins so you can conserve space and see though them when searching for specific items.
Set up strong, durable shelving for easy access. You can store your totes on shelving. If you store food, place them on shelving in date order so you can rotate them. Include off-season shoes, winter boots and whatever else you think can be appropriately stored on shelves. Label and categorize everything.
Purchase plastic drawers for organizing small knickknacks or tools. Place these on the shelves too if they fit.
Utilize hanging racks for clothing and coats as part of your basement organization. If you rotate your coats according to the season, then hang the off season coats on convenient racks.
Recycle old kitchen cabinets for convenient storage space. If you have left over paint in cans, painting equipment or other DIY tools, store them in cabinets. You can buy these inexpensively. Search online or in local papers.

Remove clutter.,
Update the wall color.,
Evaluate the flooring.,
Look at the ceiling.,
Vary the light sources.,
Reorganize the furniture.,
Make the most of windows.,
Put up mirrors.,
Use prints sparingly.",How to Make a Basement Look Bigger," Unorganized items can make a room look smaller.


Devise storage solutions. Consider installing corner shelving units to maximize the available space. Choose closed front storage units for a sleeker look.
Bring accessories up off of the floor. Magazine racks, baskets, boxes and even floor lamps or televisions on the floor can make a room feel messy and cramped. For example, mount a television on the wall or place it on a stand. Switch out floor lamps with large bases for table lamps or wall sconces.;
, Light, airy shades will reflect more light, which can make a basement look bigger. Cool toned colors can make walls appear to be receding, which can also help create the illusion of spaciousness.


Gather paint swatches.
Look at the swatches in the basement. Tape them up to each wall to see how the colors appear in different areas of the room. Paint colors can look dramatically different depending on the lighting conditions of a room.
Consider a monochromatic color scheme if you want to use a bold color. A monochromatic palette can give your basement a streamlined, modern look. Keep furniture and accessories in the same color family as the paint color or colors you choose for the basement walls.

, The floor surface and any carpeting or rugs you have can greatly affect how large or small a space feels.


Choose reflective surfaces like shiny wood or laminate. The reflective properties will help open up the room.
Go with lighter colored carpeting and use area rugs with light colors.
Use flooring or rugs with no pattern or small scale patterns. Large scale patterns can feel oversized in a cramped space and emphasize the smallness of the basement.

, Paint in the wrong color or finish or exposed duct work may give your basement a cave-like atmosphere.


Make sure the ceiling paint has a flat finish. A glossy finish will emphasize any flaws on the ceiling and make the ceiling feel lower.
Paint any exposed pipes the same color as the ceiling. This will allow them to blend in with the ceiling.
Consider colors other than white. Sometimes using a complementary shade, lighter hue, or even the same paint color as the walls on a ceiling can make a room feel larger.

, Some basements do receive natural light from small windows or even sliding glass doors. Others have no or almost no natural light. You can mimic the feel of natural light by using light sources at different heights and angles throughout the basement.


Install track or recessed lighting in the ceiling.
Use a variety of lamps at different heights. Make sure you place them in strategic spots throughout the basement to avoid the appearance of dark corners.
Consider installing wall sconces or picture lighting to highlight decorative pieces.

, Changing the arrangement of the furniture in a basement can bring new life to the space.


Move large pieces of furniture away from the walls. Many people think placing furniture against the walls and leaving open space in the middle of a room will make a room look larger, but it can have the opposite effect.
Consider removing or adding furniture. Large scale pieces may be out of place in a small basement. Small to medium sized furniture can be a better fit for small spaces.
Use stackable or foldable seating. If you want to have extra seating, consider purchasing stackable chairs that you can easily store when not in use. The chairs will be available if you have company.

, If your small basement has any windows, you can use shutters, blinds or curtains to make the windows appear larger and taller.


Put up shutters around and below the basement window. This creates the illusion of a taller window.
Hang a short, decorative blind starting from the ceiling that can cover the window if needed. You can use this blind as a valance. Hang a second blind just above the bottom of the window. The second blind will cover blank wall, again creating the feel of a larger window.
Combine the shutter or blind window treatment with curtains if you wish. Hang curtains wider than the window frame to make the window area appear bigger.

, Mirrors reflect light, creating the illusion of a roomier space.


Hang mirrors where they will bounce back light. For example, you may want to place a mirror on the wall opposite a window, or where it will reflect the light from a particular light fixture.
Choose mirrored or shiny furniture and accessories to intensify the effect.

, Prints can make a space feel cluttered, and prints in the wrong scale can easily overpower a room. Choose small prints and don't use a print on more than 1 major element. For example, if you put up wallpaper, don't use a highly patterned area rug.

Plot out and mark the path of the French drain.,
Dig out the floor of your basement along the path of the drain.,
Grade the bottom of the trench.,Place the French drain piping into the trench with the perforations facing down.,Connect the piping to the water collection basin.,
Fill the trench around the piping with drainage gravel.,
Seal the trench with cement.",How to Make a Basement French Drain,"

The drain should run about 1 foot (or 30 cm) away from the basement's exterior wall. Place it in the area with the greatest moisture. It should run to a collection basin in the basement (ideally placed in a corner), from which a sump pump will expel the water to the outside.;
,

The trench in which you place the drain should be about 8 inches (or 20 cm) wide and 18 inches (or 45 cm) deep. Use a pickaxe or a jackhammer to break through the floor of the basement. Remove the soil beneath with a shovel.

,

Your drain needs to slope downwards in order to effectively carry water to the basin. Tamp down the soil at the bottom of the trench with your shovel, and make the trench 1 inch (or 2.5 cm) deeper for every 8 feet (or 2.4 meters) of length. For example, if you have a trench that is 24 feet (or 7.2 meters) long, the end of the trench should be 3 inches (or 7.5 cm) deeper than the beginning.

,,,

The drainage gravel allows water to seep down to the bottom of the trench, where it goes into the perforated holes into the piping and flows into the basin. Make sure the trench is filled with gravel all around the piping, including on top, but do not pack the gravel down tight. Cover the gravel with tyvek and tuck under the outside edges (this is to try and keep the cement from seeping into the gravel)

,

Quick-setting or quick-dry cement is the easiest option for sealing the trench. If water is coming in from below the floor (high water level) then seal over the entire trench. If water is coming in from leaks in the wall then leave a 2 inch (or 5 cm) gap so as to allow water to run down the wall and into the drain. Easiest to take the edge of the tyvek and pull it back, put a 2x6or 8 tall ways in the trench between the tyvek and the floor edge toward the wall (make sure its above the floor level so it can be removed after the cement dries), then let the tyvek drape over the wood. Mix the cement mix with water and pour it over the gravel that lies on top of and to the side of the piping. Tamp down with a trowel. Let dry for 24 hours. Remove the wood to leave a 1 1/2"" weep trench.

Ensure your house has a cellar.,
Completely empty your cellar out, so it is totally empty.,
Consider getting further insulation in your cellar.,
Install bunks onto the walls of your cellar.,
Keep a large store of food and water.,
If you have a gun license or if legal in your area, keep a gun and ammunition in your cellar.,
Make a good first aid kit in case you ever need to treat an injury, minor or major.,
Collect some gas masks that are clean, safe and useable.,
Put a few home comforts down there - the likelihood is that they will be all that survive if there is a nuclear war.",How to Make a Bunker in Preparation for a Nuclear War," A cellar is probably the best option as it is below ground and is likely largely made out of concrete, so it has a certain amount of protection against soil poisoning and gasses.;
, This will provide you with more working space and give you a better idea of what you are working with.

, Or even just having the walls and floor covered in a fresh layer of concrete or boarding put on. This will provide a thicker layer of protection against gasses and poisoned dirt, as well as making it warmer in the cellar in case of a freeze.

, Put in enough for every member of your household plus an additional 3 for anyone who happens to be visiting when the nuclear attack warning is issued or anyone who is immediately nearby when the warning is issued.


Make up the beds with sheets and duvets rather than blankets - blankets are more likely to be eaten by moths and other such creatures.






Put a space blanket (foil blanket that folds up compactly) on each bed - that way if any sheets or blankets to get eaten or rot, or if there is an extreme in temperatures that means that a few sheets and a duvet would not be enough to keep each person warm.







, Large bottles of water that are advised for camping and blow up squares filled with water are good because they can be used for other things once they are empty - as temporary toilets, to store future found liquids etc. Some good foods to keep are:


Dried fruit






Cans of vegetables, fruit and meat






Preserves such as jam, chutney and marmalade






Bags of flour, sugar, salt, baking powder etc






Bottles of oil






Powdered milk






Bags of pasta, rice, couscous and spelt, or other foods that can be stores for extended periods of time






Boiled sweets and chocolate - these are high sugar and can give energy when other food supplies run low






Dried chick peas, lentils and other supplies that simply have to be boiled in water to provide a good nutritional content






Herbs and spices to add flavour to plain meals







, You can use this if ever necessary to defend yourself against people trying to steal supplies.

, It should contain AT LEAST:


Two packets of strong paracetamol or other strong pain killers






Two packets of ibuprofen or other strong anti-inflammatory drug






Plasters






Bandages






Anti-septic cream






A sterilised needle and clean, strong thread






A sling or a triangular bandage to make one






Cough medicine






Cough/throat sweets






Cotton wool






Micropore tape






A bottle of water






A roll of string (you could use this to tie around an arm and numb it if you had to amputate it/inject something into it/put clean dressings on it without causing too much pain)






Iodine







, Keep them in a specific place, so that all people in the cellar are aware of where they are. They just might save your life.

, Putting an old armchair that's been a family favourite for a while can provide comfort and a sense of familiarity should the bunker ever be used. Good things to keep down there in an airtight, waterproof box are:


Family photo albums






Birth certificates






Your children's school certificates or awards






Old books

Select a primer created specifically for masonry.,
Mix the masonry primer.,
Pour the masonry primer into a bucket or paint tray.

,
Apply the primer to the stone walls.,
Allow the primer to dry.",How to Paint a Stone Basement2," Masonry primers will adhere to the stone walls better and provide more durability than general primers. Masonry primers also protect the stone from water damage.

, With the lid on, vigorously shake the primer container to mix the contents.

,, Follow the instructions for your specific masonry primer. If no directions were supplied, follow these general guidelines for applying masonry primer to stone walls.


Use a wide nylon/polyester brush to apply the primer. The brush should be between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm). Avoid rollers when painting stone basement walls because the roller won't get the paint into the small uneven surfaces of the stone. The rugged stone surface also could tear a roller cover.
Cut in a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.6-cm) border around the top, bottom and sides of the stone walls. Start by applying masonry primer in 1 corner and continue along the edge of the wall.
Paint the masonry primer onto the stone walls in 4-foot by 2-foot (1.2-m by .6-m) sections. As you apply the primer, overlap into the previously applied and cut in areas for consistent coverage.

, For best results, let the masonry primer dry for a minimum of 8 hours.

Make sure that the basement apartment has a dedicated exit.,
Ensure that the basement has enough light.,
Improve the sound and fire insulation between dwellings.",How to Make a Basement Apartment1," Regulations regarding basement apartment requirements vary between jurisdictions, but it is very common that a separate entrance is required. This ensures ease of access but also serves as a method of emergency egress in case of a fire. If your basement already has a door to the outside, this requirement is likely fulfilled.;
, Many building codes require separate dwellings to have a certain amount of natural light. Whether or not your unit has adequate sunlight can be tested by a local building inspector using special equipment. If you can't pass this requirement, you will have to have additional windows installed along an exterior wall in order to create a legal basement apartment.

, Another major requirement concerns the amount of insulation between your main dwelling and the basement unit. You will almost certainly have to replace the door to the stairway separating the units with a fire door; these doors are usually made from steel and can withstand a burn for 2 hours or more before giving way. Additional insulation for soundproofing and fire resistance may also be required in the floor between the units. If your basement is currently unfinished, adding this insulation will be easy.

Consider installing a sump.,
Try a French drain (or perimeter drain) for serious water issues.,
Have an installer inject Hydroclay around of your foundation.",How to Waterproof Your Basement," You must ensure that the ground next to your foundation slopes away from the foundation, not towards it. Backfilled dirt around the foundation will typically settle lower than the surrounding dirt causing the ground to sink in and slope towards your house. If necessary, add dirt up against the foundation to create at least a 2"" per foot (that is, a drop of 2"" for each foot you move away) slope against the foundation. Make sure that the top of the dirt is at least six inches below the sill plate so that there is no ground contact which may cause certain building materials to rot in the future.
;
, Make sure your gutters are clean, and make sure your downspouts are discharging their water at least 5 feet (1.5 m) away from your foundation.

, Rotted roots can create a path for surface water to flow down to your foundation. You should keep plantings at least 12"" away from the foundation, and on a slight slope to direct water away from your foundation.

, Drylok is a waterproofer not a water sealer. It expands as it dries to become part of the wall. Xypex is more like applying a waterproof concrete on the surface that will bond with it. Because Xypex relies on the presence of moisture to form its waterproof crystalline structure, if a Xypex application does have small areas of water leakage they will seal themselves as they cycle through moisture. Xypex is also 2-4 times as expensive as Drylok. The problem with these solutions is that groundwater which is underneath your basement floor or at the bottom of the walls is under significant pressure, due to the weight of groundwater above it pressing down.

, If you see a crack in a concrete wall it goes all the way through the wall to the outside and is a potential source of water. For cracks that will not experience any thermal or structural movement, DRYLOK Fast Plug is very effective in sealing cracks in the masonry. Another reliable way to repair a wall crack is with an injection of construction-grade epoxy that penetrates the crack all the way from inside to outside, bottom to top. Generally, an experienced crack repair technician is the best choice for this. Do-it-yourself kits of epoxy and polyurethane systems are available, but are less reliable.

, This is essentially a hole in your basement floor which contains a pump. When the water level in the sump rises too high, a pump kicks on and draws the water out of the sump, discharging it outside the house, 10 or more feet from the foundation. Installing a sump requires a moderate degree of skill and experience, since you will be jack hammering or otherwise creating a hole in the concrete floor of your basement, excavating a hole, placing a liner in the hole, wiring the sump pump itself, and plumbing an outlet from the pump to the outdoors.


, A French drain consists of a continuous system of piping, running beneath the floor of the basement and along the entire perimeter of the basement. Installing a French drain is similar to installing a sump, but requires cutting and removing an approximately 12"" wide strip of basement floor along the entire perimeter of the basement, digging a 12"" deep trench, filling it with coarse gravel surrounding the drain pipe, then re-pouring a concrete floor to cover it all up. A French drain will always include a sump and pump for removing any water which gets into the drain system.

, Hydroclay is a waterproofing version of Bentonite Clay, known for its ability to absorb large amounts of water. Usually pumped from the outside, the clay fills in voids and follows the pathways water uses to get inside your foundation permanently sealing the basement. This is the same product used to waterproof tunnels, manholes, dumps, backyard ponds, elevator pits, etc.

Plan a bathroom and kitchen for the basement apartment.,
Add or remove any walls to optimize the floor plan.,
Update the finishes and fixtures as necessary.",How to Make a Basement Apartment2," If your basement does not already have a bathroom and kitchen, you'll want to plan on adding them. A bathroom is a necessary requirement, and building codes should be kept in mind regarding aspects like head space over the toilet and GFCI electrical outlets. In a very small unit, you could consider adding a kitchenette rather than a full kitchen. To install a kitchen from scratch, you will need to run new plumbing lines, as well as gas lines for a gas stove and ductwork if you want to install a ducted range hood.

, A basement that was not designed as a separate dwelling may not have a layout that will be attractive to tenants. When planning changes to the layout, consider whether the apartment will be a studio, a 1-bedroom, or a 2-bedroom. Remember that even in a small unit, partitioning off a separate space as a bedroom will usually allow you to command a higher rent.

, The final step is to consider all the aspects that will make the unit more attractive to tenants than other rental properties. Unless you are trying to command a very high rent, finishes do not have to be top-quality, but they should not be worn and damaged. Painting the walls and installing inexpensive carpet are 2 economical methods for quickly freshening a basement space.

Maximize the amount of natural lighting in the basement.,
Make sure that the overall basement lighting is sufficient.,
Add accent lighting.,
Add task lighting.,
Consider the advantages and disadvantages of the different types of light bulbs.",How to Choose the Proper Lighting for a Basement," Natural lighting refers to the ambient light that comes from the sun. If you have windows or transparent doors in your basement, do not cover them up with opaque materials, such as curtains and drapes. If you do cover them up, make sure that you have the options to draw them to the sides to allow natural light to enter the room. Natural basement lighting is a great way to fill the room with a lot of gentle, bright light.

If parts of your basement are above ground, consider adding more windows. More windows will allow more light to filter into the basement, resulting in a brighter and more lively ambiance.



 


To amplify the effect of natural lighting, the furniture and carpeting in the basement should be light in color. Lighter and neutral colors--such as white, sky blue and beige--reflect more of the natural light, creating a brighter atmosphere.





;
, Overall lighting typically comes from ceiling fixtures and wall sconces which are often connected to wall switches. Overall basement lighting is useful because it fills the entire basement with light. Make sure that your basement has enough light so that it can be fully lit during the night. However, overall lighting has a tendency to be strong and harsh, so if your eyes feel strained due to excess lighting or if your basement simply feels too bright for you, feel free to reduce the amount of overall lighting.

, A basement with nothing more than overall lighting can feel very artificial and empty due to the harshness of the lights. Lamps can improve a harshly lit environment by introducing soft, ambient lighting. This type of lighting works by accenting certain zones of the room. For example, a lamp on a table by a couch can make the area around the couch feel more lively. Where to place accent lighting is up to your personal preference, but in most cases you would want to place them in areas that you want to emphasize, such as a desk or a media corner.

, You may require a specific type of light in certain areas of the room for certain tasks. You'll need task lighting for under cabinets or in storage closets. If you have a workstation in a corner of the basement, you'll need a desk lamp. A drawing board may need a strong overhead light. If an area isn't getting enough light, add more task lighting until you can see clearly without straining your eyes.

, When it comes to lighting, there are 4 bulb types that are most used in the basement setting: incandescent, fluorescent, light-emitting diodes and halogen.


Incandescent bulbs are very popular because they produce a bright, warm light that helps with creating a comfortable, cozy atmosphere. However, in recent years, they've been proven to be energy inefficient and often short-lived. These types of bulbs work best in areas where the lights will be turned on and off frequently, or in areas that have lights with dimmers. If you have concerns about long-term cost or environmental friendliness, forego the incandescent bulbs for more energy-efficient alternatives. Incandescent light bulbs are also being phased out across the world for more efficient alternatives.
Fluorescent bulbs are quickly becoming the standard in energy efficiency, particularly because they last almost 10 times longer than the popular incandescent bulbs while requiring a third less energy. The main drawback to using fluorescent bulbs is that they give off a harsh white light reminiscent of warehouses and office buildings.
Light-emitting diodes, or LED lights, are clusters of tiny bulbs with each bulb emitting a strong, beam-type light. LED lights can last over 10 times longer than fluorescent bulbs, but the initial investment is much higher, far more than both fluorescent and incandescent bulbs. This is offset by the high efficiency and low operating cost of LED bulbs.
Halogen lights are more efficient than incandescent bulbs but not as efficient as fluorescent bulbs. However, halogen lighting produces some of the warmest and most radiant light out of the 4 bulb types. The disadvantage of halogen lighting is that it is limited in application; it works best for track lights and task lighting. If you are going to use halogen lights, it is recommended that you complement them with other types of bulbs.

"
Choose an R-value.,
Evaluate your insulation options.,
Consider additional treatments for your insulation.",How to Insulate Basement Walls1," R-value is a measure of how well an insulation does its job of reducing hot or cold airflow. A higher R-value, per inch of thickness, indicates better insulation. The R-value you will need depends on the climate where your home is located and on how well insulated you’d like your home to be.


For example, if you live in a warm climate, you would want a minimum value of R-30.
Cold climates would require a minimum value closer to R-60.;
, R-value will help you choose the level of insulation that you’ll need. There are many basement insulation types. Three of the most popular types of insulation are batt-and-roll (blanket), loose-fill, and sprayed-foam.


For blanket or batt-and-roll insulation, simply nail or staple the insulation into your wood frame. Blanket insulation is usually available in standard wall-frame sizes.
For loose-fill insulation, install drywall over the studs before adding the loose-fill insulation.
Sprayed-foam insulation is the most energy-efficient option for insulating a basement. It may be necessary to rent equipment to insulate your basement with wet-sprayed cellulose. This equipment is available at most major hardware stores. Sprayed foam can be open-cell or closed-cell.

Open cell simply means there is air between the many bubbles made by the sprayed foam.
Closed-cell, though slightly more expensive, is filled with non-air chemicals that are more efficient at insulation., Additional treatments can help protect against moisture and can be more fire retardant.


Faced insulation uses vapor barriers that control moisture movement between walls.
Unfaced insulation does not have vapor barriers, but you might not need a vapor barrier if, for example, you’re applying over existing installation or if moisture control is unnecessary.Fire-rated coverings are often necessary, since many types of insulation release toxic gases when ignited. Consult your local building code to see if this is necessary."
"
Frame the wall with wood.,
Choose an insulation board.,
Cut the board and position it in place.,
Seal the board's seams.,
Install fiberglass.,
Add a vapor barrier.,
Cover the insulation with a wall surface.",How to Insulate Basement Walls2," (If you plan on installing a vapor barrier, consult that section now, as certain vapor barriers go between the wooden frame and the concrete wall.) Consider using composite decking on the floor of the basement for extra moisture protection, or you could use a pressure-treated 2x4 bottom board.Otherwise, use standard wall-framing techniques to build the wall studs. Use a level to plumb the framed wall, and leave about a one-inch gap between the stud wall and your cinder blocks to provide plenty of space for insulation., Boards can include molded expanded polystyrene (MEPS), extruded expanded polystyrene (XEPS), or urethanes such as polyurethane. For a basement wall, XEPS is usually recommended since it’s firmer and has a higher R-value than MEPS, which is the least expensive option but not as strong. The urethanes, another option, are solid and often used with plywood.A minimum of 1.5 inches of board thickness is usually recommended., Cut the board to fit between the studs from side to side and against the concrete wall.Use constructive adhesive to attach the board to the wall and use caulk or expanding foam around the edges of the board and against the studs.Remember to install from the bottom all the way up to the top of the wall.

, This is an important part of securing the vapor barrier. Examples of sealants include tapes, such as Tyvek Tape and Dow Construction Tape or canned foam like Great Stuff.Cover the seams or cracks between the boards and between the boards and studs or concrete.

, The fiberglass will be placed in the wall cavities created between your frame and the foam insulation board. Nail or staple the rolls or sheets to the wooden frame. A nail gun can be an efficient way of nailing in the rolls or sheets. Remember to take safety precautions here, and to wear protective goggles and gloves.

, This is an optional step, but some people like to add a vapor barrier between the fiberglass and the drywall. This is particularly recommended if the foam insulation board you initially installed is less than 1.5 inches thick. Concrete or block walls absorb moisture like a sponge, and will periodically release moisture toward your drywall, studs, and joists.The vapor barrier helps prevent moisture from causing mold to develop in your insulation, which can be very expensive to fix.

, Whether you use batt-and-roll insulation, loose-fill insulation, or sprayed-foam insulation, you do not want to leave the insulation exposed. You have many options for wall surfaces. Drywall is commonly used to cover the basement insulation, but if aesthetics are not a concern, you can also cover the insulation with plywood.


Cover your insulation with drywall. Drywall usually comes in 4’x8’ sheets that you will need to measure and cut to fit your walls. When hanging drywall, start at a corner. Prepare the studs, joists, or strapping by applying glue to the surface immediately before you plan to hang the drywall. Then, use screws or a nail gun to nail the drywall. After all the drywall is hung, mix your mud and apply it with a putty knife along the seams between the drywall panels and in the corners. Cover these areas with drywall tape as well. After the mud dries, sand down and smooth over each mudded area.
Alternatively, use plywood over your insulation. Plywood might require bending to cover up all of your insulation. This might involve laminating multiple pieces of plywood; steaming or soaking the plywood; or cutting kerfs (i.e. grooves) and reinforcing them with wood glue. Also, try to find plywood without knots, particularly in areas that are to be bent.

"
"
Choose your preferred spray foam insulation.,
Use safety equipment.,
Leave space between the frame and the wall.,
Spray closed-cell foam.,
Remember to spray sparingly.,
Alternatively, use open-cell foam or a combination.,
Spray open-cell foam.",How to Insulate Basement Walls3," Spray foam insulation is more expensive than foam board and fiberglass insulation, but it can be preferable since it yields a higher R-value. Remember, you can use either open-cell, closed-cell, or a combination.

, At a minimum, you should wear a disposable coverall suit with hand and foot coverings as well as a respirator. (While a simple mask might work for fiberglass installation, you’ll need a respirator when dealing with foam.) You’ll also want a hood and goggles that fit securely around your eyes and temples., Make sure your frame is set off of the wall about 4 inches. This will allow you to spray a continuous foam barrier behind the 2x4s that is uniform throughout the basement.As the foam expands and as you continue to spray, you’ll want to examine the walls to ensure this uniformity.

, Spraying foam insulation is usually a job for professionals, but if you do it yourself, you will need closed-cell insulation’s two main ingredients, often called components A and B. Use a heated hose to send the components through a mixture gun (a chemical reaction will begin immediately upon mixture), and spray onto the surfaces that need to be insulated.Spray about 2 inches (5 cm) on walls. Consult your energy codes, if any, but 2 inches (5.1 cm) on walls and 3 inches on rooflines is customary.Spot check in various areas to see ensure that the foam thickness is uniform throughout.

, Closed-cell foam will expand to about 25 times its liquid size and form a moisture barrier. Since it also has a higher R-value than open-cell foam, you’ll get more insulating power for a smaller amount.

, If you plan on spraying with open-cell foam, which also expands considerably, you’ll want to insulate your band board and basement joists first.Here, you can save money by applying closed-cell foam just to the band boards and joists. Before spraying the open-cell foam, spray small amounts of closed-cell foam onto these areas. You’re just trying to seal up the cracks to reinforce the insulation. Then, spray the open-cell foam upon the insulation areas.
Alternatively, you could use caulk or Great Stuff, a polyurethane-based insulating foam, on the band boards and joists.Again, you’re just trying to form a seal to prevent air and moisture from seeping through the cracks.

, After your band boards and joints are insulated, you’re ready to spray. Apply open-cell foam in the same way that you apply closed-cell foam: with a heated hose and mixing gun. However, you’ll likely use a thicker layer of open-cell foam since open-cell’s R-value is lower.Use about a 3 to 5.5-inch-thick layer of open-cell foam.Fortunately, open-cell foam expands and fills framing cavities better than closed-cell foam. So, it will be easier to track your spraying progress."

,
Calculate the number of tiles you need by dividing the square footage of the room by 4 then multiply by 1.1 Clean the concrete floor and repair cracks and irregularities.

,
Acclimatize the tiles in the basement for 48 hours so that the tiles adjust to the relative humidity of the basement.

,
Once you are ready to install the subfloor, pick an open accessible corner of the basement foundation wall the farthest from where the tiles are stored as your starting point.

,
Cut the ""tongue"" off the sides of the first starting tile and place the cut edges in the starting corner against temporary 1/2"" spacers placed between the tile and the foundation wall.

,
For the second tile in the first row cut the tongue edge off the side going against the 1/2"" spacers against the foundation wall.,
If the finished floor on top of the subfloor is a floating floor of some kind, such as a laminate floor, the subfloor can float in place meaning there is no need to glue the edges together or to fasten the tiles down to the concrete floor.

,
If a wall-to-wall carpet will be installed on top of the subfloor then it is important to fasten all of the perimeter tiles and a row in the middle of the subfloor with 2"" Tapcon concrete screws.,
If a nail-down wood floor is installed on top of the subfloor then it is important to glue all the tongue and groove edges together as well as to fasten all of the perimeter tiles and a row in the middle with 2"" Tapcon concrete screws.,
Install the first row of the subfloor installation until you get to the last tile.,
Start the second row with a 12"" x 24"" half tile making sure to use the 1/2"" spacers against the foundation wall.,
Complete the subfloor installation by completing one row at a time checking to make sure the subfloor is level as you go.,
Leave a 1/2"" gap around obstacles in the basement such as support posts, stairs and load-bearing walls.,
For the last row of the subfloor, cut the tiles to allow for a 1/2"" gap.,
Now that the subfloor has been installed it is time to install the wall panels.

,
Start at the same starting point on the wall as the subfloor.

,
Make sure the foundation wall is clear of obstructions that would prevent the installation of the panels.

,
Calculate where electrical wall outlets and cable boxes will be in the room so that the wall panels can be prepared for the wiring.

,
Place the first wall panel flat against the foundation wall right into the corner on top of the new subfloor.,
Using 2"" Tapcon concrete screws fasten the panel in six locations: two at the top of the panel, two in the middle and two at the bottom, 2"" in from the edge of the panel.

,
Fit the second panel into the ship lap joint of the first panel and install the six Tapcons.

,
Continue installing the panels this way around the perimeter of the foundation wall fitting around basement windows and other wall obstacles and irregularities.

,
Install the specially prepared wall panels for electrical outlets and cable as you have designated them at the outset.

,
Once you have completed the wall panel installation around the perimeter of the foundation wall, you are ready to install the partition walls on top of the subfloor required for your basement layout.

,
The installation of the wall panels eliminates the need for a stud wall around the foundation wall.

,
Either wood or steel stud non-load bearing partition walls can be installed on top of the subfloor.",How to Install an Insulated Barricade Modular Panel System in Basements," The insulated Barricade modular panel system for unfinished basements includes natural OSB 2'x 2' R3.2 subfloor tiles and 2'x8' R12 wall panels. These subfloor tiles interlock together with tongue and groove edges and the wall panels have a ship lap joint. The rigid extruded polystyrene (XPS) insulation on the bottom of the tiles and panels have channels scored into them to allow for air flow ventilation.;
,,,,,, Tap the tongue on the top of the second tile into the groove of the first tile using a tapping block and rubber mallet.

,, This will allow for carpet to be stretched without causing the tiles to move.

, This will provide a stable rigid subfloor for nail-down hardwood floors. Use 1-1/2"" floor cleats to install the hardwood floor.

, Cut the last tile to allow for the 1/2"" spacer. Use a pull bar to pull the last tile into place.

, This will stagger the tile seams to give the subfloor more structure.

, Most tiles will conform to irregularities in the concrete floor but if leveling is required us flat pieces of polystyrene insulation placed loosely under the tiles.

, Leave a gap of at least 24"" around the furnace, water heater or fireplace. This space can be finished with ceramic tile.

, Use a pull bar or the Barricade installation tool to pull these panels in place.

,,,,, Cutting the panel may be required to fit the panel around obstacles or irregularities on the wall.

,,,,,,, Fasten the base plate of the stud wall with fasteners right to the subfloor. At either end of the 8' base plate use 2"" Tapcons to fasten the base plate to the concrete floor.

Get your mold and moisture problems under control.,
Budget for your renovations.,
Plan your renovations.,
Get any necessary permits and inspections.",How to Finish Your Basement1," Before you can start finishing your basement, you’ll need to make sure that you don’t have uncontrollable mold and moisture problems. Work to stop all mold in your basement and ensure that you can stop water from getting in. If you can’t, then you may need to consider that it would be unwise to continue.;
, Once you know that it’s possible to finish your basement, you’ll need to create a budget to find out how much money you really have to work with. Don’t forget to take into account things like building supplies, extras, labor you’ll need to hire, and the items you’ll need to put in the basement like toilets and showers.


Hiring a contractor or a designer may be a good idea, as they can help you figure out how much money you need and where you can save a few bucks.

, You’ll need drawn out plans, especially if you’re going to be doing the work yourself. You’ll need to know the lengths of all the walls you’ll put in, how much square footage of flooring material you’ll need, how much wall space you need to drywall, etc. Draw out plans for your basement and the changes you plan on making and remember: measure twice, cut once!

, Before you continue, it is very important to get all of the necessary permits and inspections from your local building department. You wouldn’t want to go to all that work and then have someone tell you you need to take it down or worse: hit a surprise water main!

Research your options.,
Install a roof-mounted fan if desired.,
Install a wall-mounted fan if it suits you better.",How to Keep Your Attic Cool in Summer1," While there are many different brands available,there are two basic options for an attic fan.Either variation can be completed by DIYers and has the added option of programming the fan to only come on if the attic reaches certain temperatures.


Roof-mounted fans are set into the roof of your house and will require you to cut into the roof during installation. You’ll then need to feel comfortable shingling around the fan area, though the installation process itself is relatively easy.
Wall-mounted fans are meant to fit into a gable wall and for extra ease can be installed in place of an existing gable vent, which means you won’t have to remove any shingles or make significant changes to your attic.;
, If you're not sure about installation, don't hesitate to contact a professional. Otherwise:


Start by removing the shingles of the roof somewhere near the peak where you’re planning to install the fan.
Cut an opening and install the fan over the opening.
Re-shingle around the base of the fan.
Contact an electrician to finish wiring the fan to a thermostat and make sure the electrical work meets code for your house.

, If you're not sure about installation, don't hesitate to contact a professional. Otherwise:


Decide which gable to replace with a fan and make sure the fan you’re buying is approximately the same size or larger.
Use a piece of plywood to mount the fan by selecting a piece of plywood of the right size, cutting an opening in the plywood, centering the fan over the opening and mounting the fan brackets to the plywood. Be sure to center the opening you cut in the plywood for the fan over the opening in the attic wall.
Mount the plywood and fan to the attic wall.
Contact an electrician to finish wiring the fan to a thermostat and make sure the electrical work meets code for your house.

Determine your desired R-rating.,
Choose your insulation material.,
Prepare your attic.,
Collect your equipment.,
Be aware of irregularities.,
Install the vapor barrier.",How to Insulate an Attic1," The R-rating of insulation shows how effective it is; a higher R-rating is more effective. There are two R-rating scales, one US customary and one metric; the US scale is 5.68 times the metric scale so it should be obvious which one is being used. It's usually recommended that existing homes have their attics insulated to a rating of R-38 (US), which will typically require a layer of insulation 10–14 inches (25.4–35.6 cm) thick, depending on what type of insulation you use.


If you're adding on to existing insulation, use this rule of thumb to guide your work: Once joists are level with, or slightly below, your level of insulation, the total should be adequate for an R-38 rating. Less than that, and you'll probably need to add more.

Past a certain thickness, it may not be cost-effective to add more insulation even if you aren't sure your attic is at the R-38 level. If your existing insulation is more than about 10 inches (25.4 cm) thick, it might not be worth the extra money.

;
, There are a few different kinds of insulation available for your attic project. Choose whichever option works best for you in terms of cost, ease of installation, and effectiveness.


Batting insulation comes in low, medium, and high-density batts. The higher a bat's density, the less is required to reach your target R-rating. Batting is convenient and can be rolled out easily into rectangular spaces.

Most batting is made of mineral wool or fiberglass, which requires protective gear to work with safely. Safer batting made from recycled foam is also available, though.


Loose fill insulation comes in bags and is used to insulate odd corners or angles where batting insulation won't fit as well. It can be hand-packed, but blowing it into place with a special machine makes it more even and complete.

, Attic insulation is installed in the floor of the attic, so you'll need to do a few things to make the process straightforward. Start by installing temporary lighting, such as clip lights, and laying a few sturdy boards along the joists to create a walkway.


If you're installing new insulation and there's no old insulation, check the drywall of the ceiling below the joists for a silver backing, called a vapor barrier. If it doesn't have one, you'll need to purchase material for one yourself. Polyethylene vapor barrier rolls are available at any home improvement store.
If you need to work during very hot weather, be sure to have water close at hand, and stay hydrated to avoid overheating. Heat collects in attics; the temperature inside can be many degrees hotter than the temperature outside, in some cases. Try to work in the early morning if you can.

, You'll need standard safety equipment, plus materials, and all the tools required to install those materials. At the very least, be sure you have the following:


Safety goggles and gloves
A dust mask
A flashlight
A tape measure
A staple gun

, Be sure you know where chimneys, recessed lighting elements, and any other possible heat sources are ahead of time. If you suspect your attic has air leaks, try to find and seal them with caulk, spray foam, or weather stripping before you begin.

, If you need to, now is the time to install your polyethylene vapor barrier. Cut it into sections that fit snugly into the spaces between the joists, and staple it to the drywall below with your staple gun.


Leave a few inches around every heat source. Polyethylene can melt and burn. Be sure to cut away a 3-inch space around any chimneys or other heat sources.

Clean out all items from the basement.,
Clean the floors completely.,
Wire your basement.,
Insert any necessary plumbing.,
Insulate and install a ceiling.,
Insulate the walls.",How to Finish Your Basement2," Take out all items that you are storing in your basement. This includes washers and dryers, cabinets, and basically anything else that can move or that takes up floor space. You will need to have total access to all walls and floors while you are working on finishing your basement.

, If you have a concrete floor, you’re going to want it to be as clean as possible before you start. Clean up all dirt and debris from the floor. Mold problems and leakage should be double-checked, just to be sure they won’t cause issues later on.

, This is one part you should really get a pro to do. At best, bad wiring just won’t work. At worst, it starts fires or electrocutes you (and not in a Wile E Coyote kind of way). Unless you want to try your hand at some DIY firefighting, just get a pro to come in and wire your new basement. If you’ve got some experience, however, you can do the bare necessities wiring yourself. Just make sure you carefully plan everything out.

, This is another thing that is good to have a professional do. While it’s less dangerous than bad wiring, it still can lead to costly repairs being necessary later if something leaks. Make sure that you carefully plan ahead so that everything that needs water will be accounted for.

, Insulating is important mostly for soundproofing a finished basement. If you’re going to put a media room down there, you don’t want that sound traveling up and disturbing anyone. Use soundproofing materials to insulate the ceiling and everyone will be happy. Otherwise, building a simple drop ceiling should be enough.

, It will be very important to insulate the basement walls. This will keep your basement warm and cosy, making the space much more livable. There are many types of insulation available but spray-foam insulation is becoming popular for basements.

Place the studs.,
Finish your walls and add drywall.,
Finish your ceiling.,
Consider keeping your concrete floors.,
Install carpet onto the concrete or build a subfloor.,
Add doors.",How to Finish Your Basement3," These are the beams which make up the skeleton of your walls. You’ll need to plan ahead to know where you want all of your walls to go, which should have been done in your building phase. There are two main materials from which you can make your studs: steel or wood. Each has their benefits and you should choose what is best for you.


As a general rule, wood is cheaper but steel is stronger.
You can add further insulation at this point by putting traditional insulation in the framing area.

, Once your walls have a skeleton they’ll need a skin! Install drywall or use whatever wall finishing method you prefer to get nice walls which you can paint when your project is complete.

, If you did not already, you’ll need to add drywall or other finishing materials to your ceiling. This will give you a nice surface to paint or finish in your preferred method.

, You can save a few bucks by keeping your concrete floors and having them bare. This may be cold, however so consider carefully. Concrete floors can be stained to achieve really cool finishes, giving you a modern look.

, You’ll need to figure out what flooring method is best for you. Installing a subfloor will make for a warmer floor than just installing carpet but it may take away badly needed inches in terms of wall height, as well as adding to the overall project cost.

, If you’re adding rooms to your new space, you’ll also want to add doors. This will be especially important for bathrooms and bedrooms. Make sure you account for doors being able to open and close when you place items like sinks, tubs, and toilets into rooms.

Paint the finished room.,
Make your ceilings look higher.,
Turn your basement into a man-cave.,
Add a bar.",How to Finish Your Basement4," Crown molding will be especially important if you’re trying to finish a basement in an older style home. This can help the two levels look more alike, if there is molding elsewhere in the home.

, Baseboards and trim will go a long ways towards helping your basement to look like a real room and installing is a breeze, if you can measure and cut (which you totally can!).

, If you want to make your basement rooms look bigger, stick to a very light-colored paint scheme. White walls, carpet, and large furniture pieces, mixed in with a few pale blue accents, will make a room look much larger.

, If you want your basement to look less cramped and cave-like, try to make the ceiling look higher by employing a few visual tricks. The easiest of these is to avoid low-hanging light fixtures and ceiling fans, and to paint the ceiling white.

, Get Mr. the space he’s always needed and out of Mrs.’ hair. A man-cave can be a great way to add entertaining space to a home. Pair with a craft room for Mrs. and everyone will be happy!

, Bars go well in basements, as you’ll have less to worry about in terms of annoying the neighbors when you get friends together to drink. You can buy one or build your own, with a little carpentry work!

Measure your net free ventilating area (NFVA): Attics need a certain amount of ventilation based on their square footage.,
Install the ridge vent: The ridge vent will create a space for heat to escape the attic, which is why these vents are at the peak of the roof.,
Install the soffit vents: Soffit vents are located lower in the eaves of the house and draw in cooler air (forcing the hotter air out through the ridge vent).",How to Keep Your Attic Cool in Summer2," Divide the area of your attic by 150 to find your NVFA and determine how many of each type of vent you’ll need to install (compare the area you need to cover with the area each vent covers, as stated on their packaging).

, To install the vent,


Remove all cap shingles.
Starting 6 inches from the end of the roof, cut through any shingles about 1.5 inches from the ridge, and use a power saw with a blade depth of about .75 inches to cut through the wood sheathing and create an opening.
Install the ridge vent according to the type of vent you’ve purchased: for a shingle-over ridge vent, pre fasten the first section and add others until you’ve covered the entire opening, and for metal ridge vents align the vent over the opening and fasten with 2 inch roof nails.
Metal ridge vents will require straps over the joints that will also need to be fastened with roofing nails.
Shingle-over ridge vents get a layer of shingles so the look of the roof is less interrupted. Cut the cap shingle to size and reattach.

, Without both sets of vents, air will not circulate through the attic and you’ll need another method of keeping it cool. However, for an easy, energy-efficient method, install soffit vents:


Determine the placement of soffit vents that will be free of objects and other obstructions. Remove the insulation that creates a barrier between you and the site of installation.
Use a power saw to cut an opening for each of the soffit vents. The opening should be just slightly smaller than the vents themselves. Discard the removed pieces of wall.
Place the vents and use screws to attach them to the eaves, and caulk the edges to ensure a tight fit with no air leakage.
Reapply the insulation, though if the insulation prevents airflow in through the soffit vents and out through the ridge vent, insert baffles.

"
"
Determine your cooling needs: Is the attic a space you use for storage, or is it an extra living space that you or members of your family will be spending a lot of time in?,
Determine what A/C services you use for the rest of your home: If you’re using central air, contact whomever performs your a.c. installation and services to discuss extending cool air to the attic, and work with a professional to incorporate that space in your home.,
Insulate your attic: If your attic is not or is poorly insulated, using an a.c. unit will simply waste money by allowing cool air to escape outside.",How to Keep Your Attic Cool in Summer3," If the space is being used often, it may warrant adding another air conditioning unit or extending your central air system to include the attic.

, If you use window air conditioners, consider whether you want to add another unit or if you want to make the switch to central air. Either contact a professional or find a window unit that fits in your space.

, Reevaluate your insulation and upgrade if needed.

"
"
Open the batting.,
Lay the first layer.,
Check depth and repeat if necessary.",How to Insulate an Attic2," Be sure you're wearing your safety equipment, as the itchy fibers of the batting can cause respiratory problems and eye irritation without a barrier in place. Only unroll your batting once you're in the attic, to avoid letting fibers contaminate the rest of your house.

, Unroll the batting blanket into the space between two joists. If the blanket isn't wide enough to match the width of the space between joists, unroll it from joist to joist instead, and lay more short lengths next to each other until the full length between the two joists is packed.


Press and tuck the edges of each part of the blanket, to make sure they fit snugly and that there are no gaps between them.
Cut a hole in the insulation wherever there is electrical wiring. Pull the wiring up through the hole and rest it on top of the insulation, so that the heat it generates will dissipate upward rather than being trapped under the insulation.

, If you're fairly sure that one layer of insulation isn't enough to reach an R-38 rating, you can add another layer. Lay this layer at right angles to the first layer, to reduce leaks and gaps.


Be sure to cut holes for electrical wiring and pull it through the second layer, as well.
Remember, the rule of thumb is that if your insulation is at about the same level as the tops of your joists, the insulation should be adequate. However, if you want to be sure, you can compare the R-ratings per level of insulation to the R-rating you're trying to achieve, and make a more educated guess based on that.

"
"
Estimate the amount of fill you'll need.,
Rent a blowing machine.,
Baffle your vents.,
Set up and use the blowing machine.",How to Insulate an Attic3," Generally speaking, without any preexisting insulation in place, it takes 10–12 inches (25.4–30.5 cm) of loose fill to achieve an R-rating of about 38-40. Find the rough surface area of the base of your attic and ask the seller how many pounds of fill will be required to fill that area to 11 inches (27.9 cm) deep.

, Many home improvement stores offer blowing machine rentals for the DIY-minded. Remember, machine-blown fill insulation will be more effective than hand-filled, so unless you want inferior insulation from your material, rent a blowing machine when you buy your insulation.

, Soffit vents will need to be baffled (protected from getting clogged with fill insulation) before you work. Add one rafter vent baffle to each soffit vent.

, Carefully follow the instructions that come with your machine to set it up and begin blowing insulation with it. Blow your insulation in evenly and smoothly. Stop every few minutes to check the depth of the insulation and be sure it's more or less even. Keep going until the proper depth of insulation has been reached.

Check the ceiling height.,
Make sure the attic has a full-size staircase.,
Make certain the attic has two exits.,
Install a dormer if your attic isn't up to code.,
Get the proper home building permit in your area.,
Remove any existing loose or blown insulation in the attic.,
Lay a sub-floor, if necessary.,
Wire the attic for electricity.,
Install new rolled insulation between the wall studs.,
Hang drywall over the wall insulation.,
Prime and paint the walls.,
Spend extra on the ceiling.,
Install the flooring.,
Trim the room and decorate.",How to Finish an Attic," For a finished attic to be to code, it must satisfy the same living requirements of other rooms, sometimes called the ""rule of sevens."" Any living space in a home needs to have at least 7 feet (2.1 m) of clearance from the floor to the ceiling, and there needs to be at least 70 square feet of space available, at least 7 feet (2.1 m) in each direction. At least 50 percent of the attic space must have 7 foot (2.1 m) clearance.Measure the clearance and estimate the square footage of your attic. If it satisfies this and the following criteria in this section, you're good go get started in finishing the project.;
, Building code also requires that the prospective attic living space be accessible by a full-size staircase with at least 6-foot 8-inch clearance above it. Attics only accessible by trapdoor style staircases or ladders aren't technically ""finishable.""

, To satisfy fire codes, the attic must have an alternative exist in the event of an emergency. An easily accessible window counts, or some other variety of exit from the attic.

, If you're committed to finishing your attic, but the measurements just don't add up, you can consult an architect to design an expansion if you're willing to get into a much bigger project., To make sure your project will be legal and up to code, you'll need to schedule an inspection at some point when the project is finished and obtain the necessary building permits from the city. Generally, these will be available from the Housing Commission or the City Planning department.


While it may seem like an easy-to-skip step, there's the possibility of legal trouble if you try to sell your house later and you've remodeled without obtaining the legal permits necessary to complete the task. Play it safe and get the right paperwork.

, Use a builder's vacuum to get all of the small pieces cleaned out of the area. You might consider renting a commercial air purifier for the duration of the project to minimize the possibility of inhaling the tiny insulation strands, which can be hazardous.

, Most attics will need a sub-floor to be laid that you can build on top of. Cut sub-floor panels to the appropriate size and install them over the joist beams. Screw down into joists at 3 foot (0.91 m) (91.44 cm) intervals using wood screws.


Depending on your plan, you may want to also add room dividers or supplementary knee walls to your attic space. If there are any internal walls going up, frame them after installing the sub-floor, now that you've got a surface to build upon. If you want flat walls as opposed to the sloped walls you'll get in most attics, it would be appropriate to install a few knee walls., Install the electrical wiring across the ceiling to the designated spots where the light fixtures will be hung, leaving an 8 inch (20.32 cm) wire hanging (called a lighting pigtail) to connect the light fixtures. Run the electrical wire to the electrical outlets. As a rule of thumb there should be at least 1 electrical outlet every 10 feet (3.05 m).


Unless you have electrical experience, it is a good idea to hire a professional to do the electrical work to ensure that it meets or exceeds current code requirements.

, Cut each strip, or batt, to the exact length of the cavity. Press them in place and staple through the paper to the studs. Install the rolled insulation in the floor by cutting to size, pressing into the space between joists and attaching with wire fasteners. If you need to use 2 or more batts to fill in a cavity, be certain that they butt up against each other firmly.

, Hang drywall in sheet-sized sections of 4 feet (1.2 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) (121.92 cm by 243.84 cm) with drywall screws at 8 inch (20.32 cm) intervals. Cut smaller drywall pieces with a razor knife to fill in the remaining areas.


Apply drywall tape over all the seams, then apply drywall mud over the tape, using a mud blade. Slather it on thick and then scrape the excess off with the edge of the blade. Allow to dry before proceeding.

, It may take 2 to 3 coats to cover the new drywall. Before you put up wallpaper or decorate the walls in any other way, it's important to put down a primer coat to create an even surface amenable to your project.


Painting the attic room white is a popular choice to create the sense of space in what can seem somewhat cramped of an area. If you're happy giving the walls a frequent scrubbing, consider a nice white shade and color scheme for the room.

, Instinctively, eyes will be drawn to the sloped ceiling in most attics, so it's a good idea to plan accordingly and finish it with an attractive texture. Wood panels are popular, as well as bead board. Use varying lengths of wood to produce an interesting an asymmetrical effect to play with the space.

, In attics, carpeting is popular to cut down on the noise of upstairs traffic. If you want to lay hardwood floors, consider putting down some substantial rugs both to cut the noise component and to keep the room feeling comfortable., Install base boards, light fixtures, electrical outlets and switch plate covers. Decorate the room to your taste. Attic space makes for a popular:

Look for tracking in the ceilings to hold drapes, panels or other materials that can create space partitions.,
Place furniture appropriately to create different areas in your loft.,
Contain each space.",How to Decorate a Loft Apartment1,"


Check for exposed pipes in the ceilings. Lofts that once served as warehouses or industrial spaces often have this type of suspension possibilities.
Purchase tracking if it is not already in your ceiling. You can buy ripplefold tracking, which brings a curve to your partitions at upholstery or furniture stores. You can find less expensive tracking options, such as canvas stretchers at art supply or hardware stores.
Set up the partitions so they are functional and attractive. You may need to experiment with spacing to get the look and feel you want in your loft.;
, For example, create a living room area by placing two sofas or loveseats in an ""L"" shape.


Use large furniture pieces, such as armoires and sectionals to separate living space from sleeping space.
Float your furniture instead of backing it up against walls. This will allow all sides of the furniture to be seen, and it makes a loft space seem less wide open and more organized and contained.

, Pay attention to what belongs. In order to break off a kitchen space, for example, do not keep the dishes near the bed.

"
"
Evaluate your walls.,
Paint with bold colors.,
Look for carpets and rugs that add color as well as shape.,
Choose curtains and shades that offer color.",How to Decorate a Loft Apartment2," Many loft apartments include exposed brick and other natural elements from their factory or industrial days. Look for spaces where paint is a possibility.

, The wall space that is available in a loft apartment should be maximized with color that grabs attention.


Use paint to either complement or separate your walls from other surfaces. For example, a slate gray will match modern stainless appliances. If you would rather set the walls apart, try a bright green or a deep orange.

, Rugs should offer a burst of color to make the loft look interesting and bright.


Try rugs that are round or shapes other than rectangles. If your loft apartment is rectangular in shape, a brown rectangular rug will not do much for the space. Try a round rug in red or an oval rug with stripes or patterns.

, Loft apartments might have long windows, small windows or no windows at all.


Stay away from vinyl blinds. Use different colors and textures on your windows and keep the window coverings accessible. Your loft apartment might get too much light at certain times of the day, so you will want to cover the windows occasionally.

"
"
Create boundaries for clutter and personal items.,
Shop for storage solutions at discount retailers such as IKEA and The Container Store.,
Buy or build shelving to display decorative items.

",How to Decorate a Loft Apartment3," Most loft apartments do not have closets, so you will need to be creative and use whatever you do have.


Use bookcases to hold more than just books. Stack magazines, baskets of pictures, even items such as shoes and folded sweaters.
Take advantage of furniture pieces that can be used for storage and divide up your space. Armoires and trunks are good for this purpose. You can also find bench-type ottomans that open up and hold blankets, sheets, towels and anything else you need.

, You can also take advantage of Craigslist sales, garage sales and thrift stores.


Look for budget-friendly items that will fit in your loft space and provide storage. Large bins, bookcases in different sizes and tables, benches or trunks will usually work.

Paint only one or two walls black.,
Select an off-black paint.,
Get a high quality paint.,
Don’t try to match black paint to other black decor.",How to Use Black Decor in a Bathroom1," If you want all of the walls in the bathroom to be black, it’s likely better to go with black tile, as the reflection offered by the tile will prevent the room from being too dark. You can add depth and class to a bathroom by painting one or two of the walls black, however.More specifically, opt to paint the wall furthest from the door black. This will make the bathroom feel larger. It can also be striking to paint small, oddly-shaped walls black as well.
Avoid painting any sloped walls, especially walls that rise to the ceiling, with an especially dark paint.;
, Straight “jet” black should be avoided, especially flat black. Extremely dark, matte black walls will actually make your bathroom seem smaller, if not a bit depressing. Fortunately, black paint blended with another color can often add a sophisticated look to certain sections of your bathroom.For instance, select a black with a bit of gray or brown in it. As a rule of thumb, if the rest of your home features cool tones, go with a grayish black. If most of your home features warm tones, opt for a brownish black instead.
Another great option is a black paint with a bit of blue or purple undertone. These are especially good in bathrooms that include wood accents., Some paints are designed to be used in bathrooms specifically - but this is mostly a marketing gimmick. More to the point, a high quality, self-priming paint will have many of the qualities you need in a bathroom paint, including mildew-resistance and a tough, tight finish to keep moisture out.In terms of finish, lean towards semi-gloss, as this tends to be the most resilient, and the easiest to wash.
Aside from quality paint, good painting technique is also vital. This will include washing, and potentially sanding, beforehand.

, If you’ll be decorating with other shades of black in the bathroom - for instance, on cabinetry or fixtures - do not try to match the color of your wall paint exactly. If you use multiple shades of black that are similar, but not identical, to one another, the results will look better."

Contrast black with white.,
Incorporate texture.,
Opt for black flooring.,
Outfit the bathroom with black items.",How to Use Black Decor in a Bathroom2," The drama that a black bathroom can offer is most prevalent when there is a healthy amount of white to provide some striking contrast. The brighter the white the better.Further, classic white fixtures, such as the sink and tub, will not only provide great contrast to black, but will reflect light well.
Another good way to add contrast to dark walls is by painting the ceiling white. This will also help the bathroom feel cleaner and more open.

, If material costs are not a factor, consider going with black marble walls. The variously-colored veins that run through marble will add subtle and appealing contrast. Another way to add texture along with a touch of black is by staining any wood features with an ebony stain.Dark, textured materials create shadows within a 2-D surface, which imbues a room with character in class. Grant Davis Thompson, INC

, A great alternative to black walls is black flooring. This is likely the best option in bathrooms do not have windows. The classic example would be black, reflective tiles, perhaps held in place with a bright white grout.Checkered white and black tiles is also popular, and for good reason - it adds both class and enjoyment to a bathroom.

, There are plenty of specific ways to add an extra splash of black to the bathroom. For instance, a dark black floor mat will look especially good on a light colored floor surrounded by black walls. If only some of your walls or your cabinets will be black, consider hanging photos in black frames.


Whatever you choose, try to feature black accessories in locations that will stand out. For instance, store folded black towels on metal or glass shelves, as opposed to hanging them in front of a black wall.

Use reflective material for black walls.,
Avoid using too much black.,
Use shiny fixtures and accents.,
Feature mirrors prominently.",How to Use Black Decor in a Bathroom3," If you’re envisioning a bathroom with black walls, it’s important to use a material that will reflect light and create an inviting, comfortable atmosphere. For instance, walls of black tile will be far more enlivening than walls that are simply painted black.Either porcelain or ceramic tiles will work. For an even cleaner, sleeker look, consider using sheets of black glass to wall your bathroom.

, Imagine a room in which everything is black. It would simply not be a comfortable room. Psychologically, in fact, too much black can cause occupants to feel claustrophobic. Further, black absorbs light, so too much black can make a room dark and unwelcoming., White bathroom fixtures aren’t the only way to add light and shimmer to a darkly-colored bathroom. Incorporate plenty of glass and metal as well.The more reflective the material, the better. Chrome faucets and glass handles, for instance, can add a vibrant feel to bathroom with a lot of black.
A variety of materials can also help fight the tendency for darker rooms to feel a bit dreary at times.

, One of the best ways to maximize light, especially in a dark room, with with a large mirror. A wide sink mirror, especially with built-in lighting, is ideal. Another option is adding a floor-length mirror to the bathroom, or replacing cabinet doors with swing-out mirrors."

Design your kitchen for maximum storage at minimum cost.,
Modernize your bathroom.",How to Redesign a Home," Do so because of the latent assets of the neighborhood, specific lot, community and region, and the price of the residence.The shape, mass or bulk of your home is almost irrelevant.;
, An architect can be consulted on an hourly basis. They provide an overview of your efforts.

, A kitchen designer is cheap and effective and has a breadth of experience and knowledge.

, Obtain his suggestions and preliminary pricing so that there is no sticker shock later when you desire work to commence.

, This will allow you to determine your qualifications for mortgage financing. Avoid refinancing complexities, and have legal counsel available.

, Most older housing offers poor insulation in the walls, attic and foundation. Confirm the International Building Code standards for your area by contacting Building Code or Inspection Department of local government. Superior windows with improved infiltration resistance, insulated glass and Solar Heat Gain Coefficients are mandatory. Older wooden or steel windows may appear charming but are costly to retain in the house envelope. Hi-efficiency heat pumps or furnaces are absolutely essential to any purposeful transformation; air conditioning may not be as essential everywhere as previously assumed. Intelligent shade tree placement, new overhangs and improved insulation will not lower the humidity discomfort but may make high humidity somewhat tolerable; air movement certainly should be encouraged with improved ceiling heights, transom windows(above the shoulder height) and proportioned openings. There are many subtle, design techniques to make homes livable and comfortable and you may need the diagnostic-design service of a professional Architect. A builder may not possess the arsenal to undertake a technological transformation of this modest but desirable older home.

, Older homes rarely had common rooms or gathering places. They were expensive, and most families tolerated intrusions of each on the other because that is what families did; there simply wasn't any other option. Probably your older house needs this common space addition.

, Get a sharp kitchen designer to work with you; stay within the envelope of the original Kitchen and avoid the cabinet disease by creating 1 or several storage closets and buy, use, pay for, fewer cabinets. Old appliances you may use temporarily but plan for new ones and avoid Euro-slick Willie stuff. Great food depends not on the mechanical perfection of the range ,microwave or refrigerator but on the cook's knowledge and command of the tools and ingredients at his/her disposal. Adequate counter area is essential; the materials available offer wide choices all of which are excellent. Laminated plastic tops are colorful, varied and inexpensive; quartz, limestones and granites superb and your wallet shall determine what they shall be.

, Probably you will opt to install a Master Bath, especially if you are undertaking an addition. Be aware a Master Bath requires a Master Closet-both large spaces.Master Closets are rather simple and inexpensive. Use double rod hanging wherever possible and plan a bank of sweater drawers. A well planned closet will enable you to reduce dresser type furniture to some extent and by all means have the carpenter install a vertical shoe rack; keeps stuff off the floor. Think about a laundry near the Bedrooms. This is locus of most dirty linen on a daily basis. If space is not available, then plan for the laundry chute to a 1st floor or Basement location. Toilet fixtures are inexpensive; plan for new fixtures and brass or faucets,showers, traps, shutoffs and vents. There is simply no easy way to preserve old plumbing but if accessible during the transformation, insulate hot and cold water lines. A new water heater is also a must--examine the cost of new flash or instant water heaters. Although expensive (upward of USD $2000) they shall save fuel costs every year of use.

Revisions.",How to Read Architect's Drawings," This will contain the project name, the architect's name, address, and contact information, the project location, and the date. This page is very similar to the cover of a book. Many cover sheets will also include a drawing of the finished product, showing you what the house will look like after it is constructed and landscaped., These pages will include an index of plan sheets, and sometimes their contents. It also will include an abbreviation key, a scale bar with the plan scale indicated, and occasionally design notes.

, This will have an area map, with an enlarged location map, usually giving enough information to locate the project site from nearby towns or highways. This sheet is not found in all sets of plans.

, These pages usually are numbered starting with a ""C"", such as Sheet ""C 001"", ""C 002,"" and so on. The site plans will contain several sheets which show the following information:


Topographical information. This will provide the builder with information regarding the topography, or the slopes or flatness, of the site.
The demolition plan. This sheet (or sheets) will show the structures or features which will be demolished on the site prior to grading for construction. The items which will not be demolished, such as trees, will be noted in the keynotes.
The site utility plans. These sheets will indicate the location of existing underground utilities, so that they can be protected during excavation and construction.

, If you cannot locate anything on the drawing with the dimensions given, get more dimensions from the Architect.

, These sheets will usually be numbered ""A"", such as ""A 001"", or A1-X, A2-X, A3-X and so forth. These sheets will describe and give measurements for the floor plans, elevations, building sections, wall sections and other oriented views of the building design. These sheets are broken up into many parts that make up the construction document that you will need to understand. The parts you'll need to know are described in the steps below.

, These sheets will show the location of the walls of the building, and identify components like doors, windows, bathrooms, and other elements. There will be dimensions noted as distances between, or from center to center of walls, width of openings for windows and doors, and changes in floor elevations, if the floor is multilevel.


Floor plans consist of various levels of detail depending on the stage of the project. At stage D (planning) drawings may show only the major features of the space.
At a tender stage, drawings will be more detailed, illustrating all features of the space at a larger scale to allow a contractor to price the job.

, Here, the architect will show the types, heights, and other feature of ceilings in different locations in the building. Ceiling plans may or may not be depicted for residential design projects.

, These pages will indicate the layout for joists, rafters, trusses, bar joists, or other roof framing members, as well as decking and roofing details.

, This is usually a table listing the different finishes in each individual room. It should list paint colors for each wall, flooring type and color, ceiling height, type, and color, wall base, and other notes and details for constructing the finish in areas listed.

, This table will have a list of doors, describing the opening, ""hand"" of doors, window information (often keyed off of the floor plan, example, window or door type ""A"", ""B"", etc.). It may also include installation details (cuts) for flashings, attachment methods, and hardware specifications. There may also be a separate schedule for window and door finishes (although not all projects do). A window example would be ""Mill finish, aluminum"", a door might be ""Oak, natural finish"".

, This may include bathroom fixture layouts, casework (cabinets), closet accessories, and other elements not specifically noted on other sheets. Such as, but not limited to: concrete details, door and window details, roofing & flashing details, wall details, door details, deck to wall details and others. Every project is different and may or may not include what other projects have. The Level Of Detail (LOD) is determined by each Architect for each project. The growing trend is for Architects to have more, rather than less detail, because the Contractors then have less guesswork and can more easily understand what to include and what to price. Some builders may or may not have comments about the LOD, but that has no relevance to what the licensed Architect who is designing the project feels is necessary to properly explain the design.

, These are views from the exterior, indicating the material used in exterior walls, (brick, stucco, vinyl, etc), the location of windows and doors from a side view, the roof slopes, and other elements visible from the exterior.

, The structural plans usually are numbered beginning with ""S"", as in ""S 001"" These plans include reinforcement, foundations, slab thicknesses, and framing materials (lumber, concrete pilasters, structural steel, concrete block, etc). Here are the different aspects of the structural plans that you will need to read:


The foundation plan. This sheet will show the size, thickness, and elevation of footings (footers), with notes regarding the placement of reinforcing bars (rebar). It will note locations for anchor bolts or weld plate embeds for structural steel, and other elements.

A footing schedule is often shown on the first sheet of structural notes, as well as notes regarding the reinforcing requirements, concrete break strength requirements, and other written statements for structural strengths, and testing requirements.


The framing plan. This will indicate the material used for framing the building. This may include wood or metal studs, concrete masonry units, or structural steel.
The intermediate structural framing plans. These are used for multistory construction, where each level may require support columns, beams, joists, decking, and other elements.

, Plumbing drawing pages are numbered beginning with ""P"". These sheets will show the location and type of plumbing incorporated in the building. Note: often, home design documents do not include plumbing plans. Here are the parts of the plumbing plan that you will need to read:


The plumbing rough-in. This sheet will show the location of pipes which are to be ""stubbed up"" to connect the plumbing fixtures to water supply, drain/waste, and vent systems. This is rarely incorporated into a residential set of documents, such as for a single family residence.
The plumbing floor plan. This sheet will show the location and type of plumbing fixtures, as well as the route pipes will be run (overhead or through walls) for potable water and drain, waste, and vents. These plans are included although most architects (for single family homes) already indicate the location of the plumbing fixtures on their floor plans.

, Mechanical pages are numbered beginning with ""M"". This sheet or sheets will show the location of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) equipment, duct work, and refrigerant piping, as well as control wiring. This is rarely indicated for single family homes.

, The electrical drawings are numbered beginning with ""E"". This sheet (sheets) shows the location of the electrical circuits, panel boxes, and fixtures throughout the building, as well as switchgears, subpanels, and transformers, if incorporated in the building.


Special pages found in the electrical plan pages may be ""riser"" details, showing the configuration of power supply wiring, panel schedules, identifying specific breaker amperages and circuits, and notes regarding types and gauges of wires and conduit sizes.
Some of this information may or may not be included in single family home documents.

, These are also known as BMP (Best Management Practices) drawings. This sheet will indicate protected areas of the site, erosion control plans, and methods for preventing environmental damage during construction. There may be details in the BMP drawings showing tree protection techniques, silt fence installation requirements, and temporary storm water drainage measures.


The requirement for a BMP plan originates under the environmental protection department of your local, state, or national governing authority. This may not be required, depending on the Authority Having Jurisdiction for single family homes.

, Dimensions are rarely given and it is the responsibility of the builder to coordinate the placement of the utility so as to conform with the building code and the Architectural drawings. Be sure plumbing is located so that it matches up with the desired location of plumbing fixtures. Same goes for electrical wiring for power outlets and light fixtures.

, To do this, you will have to locate the element of construction you are reviewing to implement a portion of your work. If you are laying out the location of the building, you will first look at the site plan for location of existing buildings, structures, or property lines so you have a reference point to begin measuring to your building footprint. Some plans simply give a coordinate grid position using northings and eastings, and you will need a ""total station"" surveyor's transit to locate these points. Here is what you'll need to do to lay out a building footprint from the plans:


Lay out your building on the site by either the above referenced plan or the measurements given on the site plan. Measure to locations, preferably corners, on one side of the building, and check for any ""checkpoints"" to verify the accuracy of your layout. If you cannot absolutely establish an exact building line, you may have to suppose the location is correct and continue. This is widely accepted in cases where the site is very large, allowing for tolerance, but on a crowded lot or site, the location must be exact.
Establish the elevation you will work from. This may be a height relative to a nearby roadway, or an elevation determined from sea level. Your site plan or architectural floor plan should have a bench mark(a bench mark refers to some item, such as a manhole lid or survey waypoint with a known elevation) elevation or a ""height above existing grade"" as a starting point.
Use your plan to measure the location of each corner of the building, including offsets. Remember what exact element of construction you are using for your layout. You may mark an outside wall line, a foundation line, or a column line, depending on the type of construction and the most practical element for making subsequent measurements.

For instance, if you are building a structural steel building with I-beam columns which require setting anchor bolts to secure them, you may begin your building layout with the centerline of these columns, where if you are building a wood-framed residential structure with a monolithic slab floor, the edge of the slab would be your best choice for the initial layout.



, Plumbers use the Architect's floor plan to locate walls so the pipes they stub up will be concealed inside the wall cavity when the building is constructed, then use their plumbing floor plan to find out what types and sizes of pipes are required to service a particular fixture.

, As a rule, architectural plans are drawn to a ""scale"". An example would be, 1 inch (2.5 cm) equals 10 feet (1""=10'), so measuring between to walls on the plan sheet means for each inch, the distance is 10 feet (3.0 m). A scale rule will make this much easier, but be careful to match the rule scale to the plan's scale. Architects often use a scale of fractions, such as a 1/32 scale, engineers usually use an inch per foot scale. Some plans or details are not to scale, and should be marked ""(NTS)"".

, Often a particular element has special considerations which are more easily described verbally than drawn, and notes are a tool the architect will use to illustrate them. You may see a table of notes on the side of a sheet, with numbers identifying the note location on the plan (a number with a circle, square, or triangle around it) and a corresponding numbered statement describing the situation on the side of the sheet.


Sometimes there may be a single sheet or several sheets of Numbered Drawing Notes that consolidate all or most of the drawing notes for an entire set of drawings. Many Architects organize these numbered notes into a CSI (Construction Specifications Institute) method utilizing 1-16 or even more Divisions that categorize the drawing notes into subsections.
For instance: a note ""4-127"" may refer to a type of Masonry, as Division 4 represents Masonry. A note 8-2243 may refer to a window or door component, because Division 8 is Doors & Windows.

, You should have a specific keynote table for section of plans, and this will provide information on the abbreviations, symbols, and specific lines used in each section of the plans.


An example would be that the electrical plans, a circuit may have the ""home run"" ""leg"" (the wire going from the first junction box in a circuit to the panel box (the power source) highlighted or in darker ink than other circuits, and exposed conduits may be indicated by a solid line, and concealed conduits by a dotted or broken line.
Because there are many different line usages indicating different type walls, piping, wiring, and other features, you will have to see individual plan page ""key notes"" to understand them.

, These are calculators which add feet and inches, fractions, or metric measurements. Often, an architect will not give a measurement to a specific plan item, from a baseline such as the ""'OBL"" (outside building line), so you will need to be able to add the distances each feature which has a measurement provided, to get the total distance.


An example would be finding the center line of a bathroom wall to locate the potable water pipe stub up. You may have to add the distance given from the OBL to the living room wall, then the distance to a hallway wall, then across a bedroom, to the bathroom wall in question. This might look like this: (11' 5) + (5' 2"") + (12' 4"")= 28' 11.


, If you have a set of architectural plans in an electronic form, as on a CD, you will need a version of the original ""cad"" program which created it to open the files. ""AutoCAD"" is a popular, but very expensive, professional design program, and the designer will usually include a ""Viewer"" on the disc which you can install on your computer to view files, so that actual plan pages appear on your screen, but without the full program, you cannot manipulate design components or change the drawings. However, most Architectural firms know how to save their CAD and other computerized files as a PDF, which they will normally e-mail to you and you will be able to open and view (although not alter, as the Architects are responsible for the integrity of their work).

, These sets of documents are often very large sheets, about 24"" X 36"", and full construction sets may include dozens, or hundreds of pages. They are either bound or stapled on the left edge, and allowing them to be torn from the bindings, ripped apart by mishandling, laid out in the sun to fade the ink, or left in the rain can make them difficult to use.


These documents can cost hundreds of dollars (US) to replace, so try to protect them, and have a flat, wide, protected work surface to unroll and read them on.

, Specifications are usually printed and kept in a binder, and they list descriptions of methods and materials used in the project, as well as testing methods, quality control information, geotechnical data, and other information useful in building the project. However, some Architects do include the specifications on the drawing sheets (to insure that the specs will not be misplaced).


Specifications are the architect's way of indicating the quality standards, materials, model numbers, and other characteristics of projects. Even single family homes often have specifications. Specifications are traditionally arranged in numbered sections, typically Division 1-16, although these numbers have expanded considerably during the last decade.
Many Architects number their paragraphs so that they can cross-reference actual verbiage from the specifications onto their drawings using the paragraph numbers, which improves the coordination of the various trades.

, These may indicate portions of work which are incorporated in the Architect's drawings, but not necessarily in the builder's contract to construct, supply, or install. ""NIC"" is an abbreviation for Not In Contract, which means a certain item will be put in a certain place by the owner after the project is finished.


""OFCI"" or ""GFCI"" (Owner Furnished, Contractor Installed, or Government Furnished, Contractor Installed) indicate the item is supplied by the customer, but installed by the contractor. Read and understand all abbreviations used in your plans.

,
Architects may issue addenda, which are changes made to the documents after they have been released for bidding. Many Architects locate a blank section, often in the lower right corner of their sheets, just above the sheet number, reserved for a list of Revisions. Revisions are often numbered and enclosed within a triangle, octagon, circle or other consistent symbol. To the right of each revision number will be the date of the revision, then to the right of that, a brief description of the revision. Then on the drawing area of the sheet, that numbered symbol will appear in the area where the revision was made, often along with a ""revision cloud"", which is usually depicted with a lumpy series of arcs resembled a cartoon cloud, encircling the area in which the revisions where made. This allows everyone to understand exactly what has changed. Also, the Architect will normally issue an e-mail summarizing the revisions contained in each addendum, sent simultaneously to the Owner and registered bidders. It is then up to the various bidders to convey this information change to their subcontractors and material providers.

If you are struggling to find storage space, make sure that the things in your kitchen are necessary. Clear off flat surfaces to give yourself more space to work and move non-kitchen items out of the room.Some things that may be cluttering your kitchen include a plastic wrap or tin foil containers, magazines, books, Tupperware, trash bags, and pot lids.;
, Look for spaces between appliances and cabinets, like the space between your refrigerator and cabinets or the space under the island. Locate places in your kitchen where you can add additional storage.Another unused space may be the place above your refrigerator.

, Instead of storing your pots and pans inside of a cabinet or pantry, you can store them on the wall if you install hooks.You can also hang hooks on the inside of your pantry doors to hang more items., If you have no storage space for things like cooking trays, pots, or pans, you can use your oven to store the items while you don't use them. Just make sure that you take everything out of the oven when you decide to use it., A rolling cart will give you additional storage space for kitchenware. Typically these carts will come with shelves and can act like a mobile storage space. You can purchase a rolling cart at furniture and department stores., Rather than taking up space in your limited drawer or shelf space, larger utensils like wooden spoons, ladles, and spatulas can be kept in mason jars. Use this cheap and easy solution to reduce the clutter in your kitchen., A magnetic knife holder can be mounted on the wall and will free up space in your drawers because you won't have to store knives in them anymore. You can purchase magnetic knife holders online or at kitchen stores., An island in your kitchen will allow you to use extra unused floor space for storage. Also, you can use the surface as an eating space, saving space needed for a table. When choosing an island, consider the storage possibilities through drawers, shelves or hooks that can be incorporated into the design.When installing a new island, make sure to leave at least 36” (91.44 cm) of space in between the island and appliances.

, Smaller appliances like a smaller range, oven, refrigerator or dishwasher will help you save space in your small kitchen. When shopping for new appliances, look at the smaller models and consider getting them instead of the full sized models."

Start working on the Yard.,
Use the black sharpie for labeling.",How to Draw Blueprints for a House," Before starting on paper, it's going to help to get a basic idea of what the house is going to look like. It is important to know how many rooms are needed and how many floors are going to be put in the house.;
, Try to take up the whole grid paper to get a larger scale.


Once you make the perimeter, draw a second perimeter one grid away. It doesn't matter if this is a grid closer or farther away. This adds thickness to the drawing and will make the end result look better. If the house has a second floor, then grab another sheet of paper and place it on top of the first floor paper. This will make the paper see-through so one can trace the walls for the second floor.

, *Don't forget to include all rooms needed for a house. A room many people forget is a utility room where you keep your heater, washer, dryer, water filter, etc.

, With the walls complete the next step is to add doors and windows. Window size and door sizes can vary. For example the front door will probably be a bit bigger than the door to the closet.


To make a window erase the part of the wall that the window goes to. Draw a line in the middle between the walls. To give the windows thickness, add another line, a grid to the outside. A ruler might be needed to help draw a straight line because these lines will be in the middle between a grids. Most of the time, rooms connected to the perimeter will have at least one window but it's up to the creator how many windows are needed per room.
The doors are a bit simpler to draw. Simply just erase the wall where you want the door to go and then draw a line in between the walls. It is just like the window but without the thickness.

, This is where you get into detail. The house needs sinks, toilets, bathtub, cabinets, stove and a fridge. There are templates that can help draw these. Without a template, just draw the basic shape of a sky view of these utilities. There does not need to be much detail, just enough to tell what each utility is.

, This step is optional but it is nice to get an idea of what the house will look like. Some examples of furniture one could use is beds, televisions, couches, chairs and tables. There is a template for this also and you draw these like with the utilities. Keep it simple and try to make everything square or rectangle to stay with the grid paper., There is not much to add to the yard until the next step. What can be added is a porch or draw out lines for a driveway. The porch is not like the walls because you only need one line. The porch doesn't have thickness like the walls do.

, In each room write what each room is. One might need to abbreviate rooms like a closet where only CL can fit in the room. Also write everything in capital letters to make it easier to read. To finish up with the black sharpie, go over all of your pencil marks. Using a colored marker, color in the furniture and utilities but make cabinets a brown color. The porch can be brown or gray depending on if the porch is made of wood or cement. Green can be added around the house for grass. Blue is a good color to shade in for the windows and the walls can be black or gray.

The basic difference in a ""blueline machine"" from a ""large format copy machine"" is that blueline machines will only make a copy of a reproducible document, such as vellum (sometimes known a ""trans-bond"" or any material that will allow light to pass through it). This is not the only difference, but it's the most notable difference between the two types of machines.
Blueline machines all rely on the ability to pass light through the document that you want to copy, therefore the document you are making a copy of must have enough transparency for light to pass through it. Although this can be considered a ""negative"" for blueline machines, blueline machines make BLUE prints, not the black and white copies one would get with a large format copier.
Blueline prints are very impressive, since they are blue and show off your work nicely. Many old-timers and small architectural shops don't like to use the large format copiers since they only do black and white. Yet, many shops have both machines, a blueline, and a large format copier and use either depending on the desired results.
Blueline machines use a diazo process and diazo paper that comes wrapped in a thick black plastic bag sealed to keep the light from exposing the paper. Most diazo paper is yellow in color when it comes out of the sealed bag, then turns blue when it has been run through a blueline machine. The process that works to expose the paper is done with black lights and ammonia.

, Once you have your original documents ready to copy, plenty of diazo fresh unexposed paper on hand, and your diazo machine ready to go, you can begin to make your blueprints:


Remember, your originals must be of some type of transparent medium, such as vellum, or trans-bond.
Start with one original drawing and hold it up, and then place one sheet of diazo paper on top of it and match all edges, so that the two sheets appear as one.
Start feeding these two sheets into the machine into the lower roller section; the two will become exposed to ammonia and a black light and they will both come back out of the machine as the machine's powered rollers slowly take the paper in and back out of the machine itself.
When the two come out of the machine, peel away your original and lay it aside.
Take the diazo paper and run it back through the machine on the top roller section. Please note that most diazo blueprint machines have a bottom roller and a top roller. You can continue to run the diazo paper through the top roller process over and over, several times, depending on how new your ammonia is, the speed at which you exposed the first run when both sheets were held together, and how blue you want your print to become. It's an easy process and one you will perfect quickly, only after making a couple of blueprints.
Do this same process for each sheet in your drawing set, if you have multiple drawings to copy.

, Once all of your copies are made, if you want to you can run a single sheet of diazo paper through the machine without any original drawing in front of it. This exposes the entire sheet and makes it a very dark blue. This sheet is cut into slivers of paper the same height as your drawings, but only wide enough to make three folds in it in order to make a nice binder that you can staple on one end of your drawing set. Usually three to four staples with a heavy duty staple gun is all that is needed to secure the binder and hold your drawing set together.

, The diazo process is inherently simple; the copiers have relatively few complicated parts and their maintenance is inexpensive. Most diazo copiers remain in use for well over 20 years with a high degree of reliability and little down time.
There is a low cost per copy. Diazo copiers use readily available and so are diazo-coated papers, vellums, and films, which are priced competitively with so-called ""plain papers"". The aqueous ammonia developer used by most diazo copier systems is low in cost and environmentally-safe. Aqueous ammonia is nothing more than a stronger solution of clear household ammonia.
The machine has low maintenance. Since the ""brains"" of the system is built into the paper or other media, the equipment itself requires little maintenance. There are no per-copy or click charges with most diazo copiers. They are very reliable pieces of equipment that provide years of useful life with little down time.
The diazo process is environmentally-friendly. The ammonia is a completely natural substance. It is a basic building-block substance, which is crucial to life on our planet. It is composed of only two elements - nitrogen and hydrogen. Ammonia is produced by all animals, including humans, as a natural product of the metabolic process. Each person generates about 550 grams per year. According to one source, 500 families release more ammonia each year than 20,000 diazo copying machines. For more on ammonia, see 'Tips' below.
The diazo process doesn't contribute ozone or create health concerns. The diazo process relies entirely on natural substances to create high quality copies. There is no ozone, (a highly irritating poisonous gas) associated with diazo equipment. So-called ""Sick-Building Syndrome"" symptoms do not occur with diazo copiers, and all employees are safe from long-term health concerns. Dry diazo copying has reached a highly refined state of functionality. Diazo systems, by definition, require only natural substances for operations. The development process involves the release of only ammonia, moisture and heat energy. The diazo industry has integrated the exacting standards for ammonia handling, containment, and removal of nearly all ammonia odors. In addition, ammonia supply containers are safe and meet industry standard specifications.

, Now you have learned more about how blueprints are made, the process, and the equipment that is necessary. Well known brand names of diazo type copiers include Rotolite, Diazit, and ReproTechnology.

Get a copy of the International Building Code.,
Find local codes.,
Get contact information for building officials.,
Read the code thoroughly.,
Give the code to relevant employees.,
Call government officials with questions.,
Meet with a lawyer.,
File an administrative appeal.,
Attend your hearing.,
Explain why you deserve an exemption.",How to Meet Building Code Requirements," This is a model business code which many cities and states have adopted. You can find a copy on the Internet. Even states which have adopted the model code might have tweaked it, so you need to find your specific local code.


Nevertheless, the model code can give you a good overview of building code requirements.
You can buy a copy of the code from the International Code Council website.Older versions may be available for free on the Internet.;
, Your city or county might have adopted different codes or supplemental codes. You should stop into your local town or county office and ask if you can get a copy of their code.


Also check online. Some cities post their building codes, policies, and guides online. You can download a copy.Some websites also gather links to state and municipal building codes. Construction Market Data is one site.You can visit their website and click on your state.

, At the same time that you are gathering building code materials, you should gather the names of relevant officials. You may have questions during the planning and building phases. You will want the relevant government official’s opinion before proceeding. Accordingly, find the names and contact information for the following offices:Building Inspector
Fire Marshal
Electrical
Boiler Inspections
Elevator Inspections
Health and Human Services
Historic Preservation

, Before beginning construction or applying for your permit, you should have a thorough understanding of the building code. Codes typically have a wide scope and cover a lot of areas:Structural design
Accessibility
Means of entering and exiting the building
Fire and smoke protection
Electrical requirements
Plumbing requirements

, You need to understand the code, but you also need to ensure that the building is actually built according to code. This means giving copies of the building code to relevant people. Make sure the following also know the building code requirements:


Your architect. The building must be designed to code or you will not get approval for construction. Accordingly, your architect needs a copy of the relevant code.
Your contractor. The building must be built according to code as well. Sometimes buildings need to deviate from the architect’s plan. Nevertheless, the building must always follow the building code requirements. Whoever is overseeing the construction of the building should have a copy of the code as well.

, You might discover that you don’t understand some provision of the code. You should call up the relevant government office and ask a question before proceeding. For example, if you have a plumbing question, then call the office that oversees plumbing compliance.

, Your permit might have been declined. Alternately, a building inspector might have found that your building doesn’t follow the code. You will want to appeal these decisions. In order to do so, you will need the help of an experienced attorney.


You can find a construction attorney by visiting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral. Make sure to get a referral to someone who specializes in construction law.
You can also get a referral from anyone in your business who has had a construction issue in the past. For example, a competitor might have just built an office building. You should call them up and ask if they would recommend their lawyer.Once you have a referral, you can schedule a consultation and talk about your issue with the attorney.

, Each county or city should have an administrative appeal process. You should stop into your municipal office to ask about the precise process. Generally, you will not have a lot of time to bring an appeal. For this reason, you should stop in and ask about the appeal process soon after receiving the rejection of your permit or being cited by an inspector.


There may be form available to fill out. Alternately, you may have to write a letter in which you provide personal contact information and explain whose decision you are appealing, as well as the reason for your appeal.You will probably have to provide the Board of Appeals with multiple copies of your application.There will also probably be a fee for filing an appeal, which will vary depending on the Board. You will have to pay the fee before your appeal will be heard.

, Most boards will hold public hearings. You will be able to testify and present any witnesses that help your case. Your lawyer will help you determine what evidence you should submit to the Board.


Members of the public may also testify as well., The Board can grant you an exemption from some aspect of the building code. You will need to present a compelling case as to why you need the exemption and also how you intend to satisfy the spirit of the law.For example, you should argue that your plan provides an equivalent level of life or fire safety.

Limit the cooks in the kitchen.,
Clean as you cook.,
Use one-pan recipes.,
Do prep work in advance.",How to Work With a Small Kitchen2," The more people cooking at once will make it harder to move around and work. Try to limit the number of people who are cooking to one person so that you can maximize your space., If you have a smaller kitchen, dirty dishes and plates can pile up and take up a lot of space. Avoid cluttering your kitchen by cleaning things as you go along instead of stacking them up in the sink., One pot or one pan recipes will reduce the amount of pans and pots that you need for a dish. This will eliminate the cleanup you'd have to do if you used multiple pieces of kitchenware, reduce the overall clutter in your kitchen, and make it easier to cook in a small space. Search online for one pot or one pan recipes., Doing prep work before you cook will make cooking easier and will reduce your overall cleanup. Think of things that you can do before you cook, like cutting vegetables or cooking pasta.Other prep work includes marinating and cutting meat, making sauces, measuring spices."

Use glass cabinet doors.,
Install a mirror over your sink.,
Paint the kitchen white.,
Light up your kitchen.",How to Work With a Small Kitchen3," Glass cabinet doors will make the walls appear as if they are further away from you and can open up a room. A small kitchen with solid wood cabinet doors can make the room feel even smaller and claustrophobic., A mirror will give the illusion of a larger room. Hang one over your sink or somewhere else in your kitchen to open the room up and give the illusion of more space., White paint will reflect light and will enhance the sense of space in your kitchen. Avoid a sterile feeling kitchen by mixing up the textures in the different portions of your kitchen., When thinking about lights, consider the height of your ceilings and make sure that lighting fixtures don't hang too low or it will make your kitchen appear even smaller. The more lit your kitchen appears, the larger it will look.Popular lights in a kitchen include chandeliers, recessed lighting, or hanging light bulbs.
You can also get lights to fit under your cabinets."

Keep things light.,
Make the slanted ceiling a lighter color than the rest of the room.,
Paint the room one solid color to keep it as open as possible.,
Add texture.,
Create an accent wall.,
Paint a pattern or picture.,
Use paneling.,
Accentuate exposed ceiling beams with paint.",How to Decorate an Attic Bedroom1," Many attics are relatively small and offer very little natural light. Dark colors tend to make spaces look smaller, but light colors can make a room appear larger and brighter. White and light yellow are especially effective at creating the appearance of additional light.;
, A dark slanted ceiling can seem oppressive and may give the ceiling a “caving in” effect. Even if you put a medium or bright color on the wall, keep the slanted ceiling a light color to accentuate the room’s height instead of shortening it.

, If you are primarily concerned with opening the space up, sticking with one solid color is a good way to accomplish your goal. When the eye does not detect divisions, it perceives a larger space. If you keep the walls and ceiling the same color, the room itself will often look more expansive. This effect is heightened if you select flooring that closely matches the color of the walls and ceiling, as well.


Only try this tactic if using a light color. Painting all the walls and ceiling a bold or dark shade will actually make the room look smaller.

, Texture can alter the ambiance of an attic bedroom and act as a subtle decoration in a room with limited space. Stonework and brick from an exposed chimney can create a rustic ambiance. Similarly, textured paints and finishes can also add visual interest.

, Select a vertical wall, preferably one of the two tallest ones where the slanted ceiling panels meet. Paint it with a bold color or use a metallic finish to reflect light and draw the eye. Painting all the walls with a bright color or finish can make the space seem ""loud"" and crowded, but an accent wall is a good way to introduce a splash of bright color without overwhelming a tiny space.

, Instead of worrying about how to hang decorations on your walls, decorate the walls directly with paint. Create a mural or a pattern on your wall. Simple stripes can heighten or elongate a room, depending on how you position them, and floral prints can create a whimsical, sophisticated getaway. This is another good way to balance openness and bright color in a small attic room.

, Paneling placed vertically will heighten the room, making it appear taller. When placed horizontally, paneling can elongate or widen a room, which can be especially useful if the bedroom is located in a narrow attic space.

, Leave the ceiling painted white or another light color and paint the ceiling beams dark brown or black. Doing so draws the eye to the beams. Since the beams slant upward, the eye looks upward, as well, causing the eye to perceive a taller space.

Measure the length of the longest wall.,
Scale this measurement down so that it will fit onto a sheet of graph paper.,
Measure the length of the other walls and convert these measurements to your scale.,
Measure the length of each door and window opening (without frames) and convert these measurements to your scale.

,
Incorporate all walls, windows, and doors on your floor plan.,
Measure the length and widths of all built-in fixtures (such as counters), convert the scale, and add them to your plan.

,
If desired, you can add movable furniture to the floor plan.",How to Draw a Floor Plan to Scale," If you’re making a floor plan of an actual physical space (as opposed to something you’re designing or imagining), measure it with a tape measure.;
, First, count the number of squares on the longest side of the graph paper (ex. 39 squares); this is the side that will accommodate the longest part of the plan. Then, scale down the length of the wall by reducing it down to a smaller number. Dividing it evenly is preferable, as it’s much easier to remember that one square equals 1 meter as opposed to, say, 1.27 meters, but if the length of the wall isn’t cleanly divisible, you may have to have an imperfect scale.If you need additional guidance, see examples in both feet and meters below.



If the wall measures an even number of units (ex. 90 feet), try dividing it by 2, 3, 4, etc. and seeing if the resulting number is smaller than the number of squares. (90 feet divided by 2 is 45 – too large to fit across 39 squares. 90 feet divided by 3, on the other hand, is 30, which will fit nicely across 39 squares with room to spare.)

If the wall measures an odd number of units (ex. 81) try dividing by 3, 5, etc. and seeing if the resulting number is smaller than the number of squares. (81 feet divided by 3 is 27, which will fit across 39 squares with room to spare.)

If the wall measures a number of units that is smaller than the number of squares (ex. 27 meters), you can scale it to 1 unit per square. (1 meter = 1 square, making that wall 27 squares long).


If the number of units is very small and would result in a tiny drawing (ex. 15 meters across 15 squares, leaving most of the page blank), try doubling or otherwise increasing the number of squares used to depict each unit. (1 meter over 2 squares would make that wall 30 squares long).



If you aren’t happy with the size your simplified scale produces or the number simply won’t divide evenly (ex. 89 feet), try dividing the larger number by the smaller one. However, unless you want the wall to take up the entire length of the graph paper, don’t include the full number of squares in your calculation; leave at least one square on either side so that your floor plan doesn’t get messy (i.e. subtract 2 squares). (89 feet divided by 37 squares is 2.4 feet – or nearly 2’5” – per square, making that length of wall 37 squares long and leaving one empty square on either side of the drawing.)

, If, for example, you determined that each square equals 3 feet, a wall measuring 40 feet would be 13 1/3 squares long (because 40 divided by 3 = 13 1/3); if you determined that each square equals 1 meter, a wall measuring 18 meters would be 18 squares long.

,, Draw each window as double lines and each doors as a line (i.e. the fully-opened door) with an arc (i.e. the actual swing path of the door; useful when trying to place furniture).

,,

Pull the sink out of the countertop.,
Clean up surfaces and spills.",How to Remove a Kitchen Sink," Kitchen sinks come in 2 basic designs: under-mounted, which are attached to the countertop from underneath, or drop-ins, which simply drop into the sink opening in a countertop. There are only slight differences in how you remove each kind of sink and they will be explained as you go through the steps.;
, Most of your work will be done here so clean out everything you can from this space. It will give you more room to move around and more space to place a bucket or your tools., The under sink area is small and confined, with lots of pipes and other hazards to your eyes. This job can also be messy and hard on your hands, so wearing gloves is a good idea. Remember that wearing personal protective equipment can seem like headache at times but it could save you from pain and injury in the long run.

, Electricity and water don't mix, so unplugging your disposal as soon as possible is a very good idea. You may even want to turn off the circuit that the disposal was plugged in to. Go to your home's fuse box and turn off the circuit breaker controlling the garbage disposal plug.

, You should have two separate valves located below the sink, one for the hot water and one for the cold water. In some cases, the hot water shut off knob will be red and the cold water shut off knob will be blue, but this is often not the case. Either way, turn both of the handles clockwise until they are all the way off. Double check that they are closed by turning on the water in the sink. A few drips at first are fine but the flow of water should be gone.


If you still have water coming out, you may need to consult a plumber to change out your shut off valves or you could do it yourself by following these steps: https://www.wikihow.com/Replace-Shut-off-Valves

If are no water shut off valves under your sink, you will need to locate them further down your water pipes. Trace the water supply lines as far as you can, looking for valves where you could shut off the flow of water. If all else fails, there should be a main water shut off, either where water comes into your house or at the curb in a meter vault. , Water supply lines that connect to kitchen sinks are most often flexible plastic tubing that connect on both ends, at the sink and the water shut off valve, with metal nuts. Because the connection to the sink is found on the backside of the bottom of the sink, it may be a bit awkward to get to. Use an adjustable wrench, channel-locks, or an open-ended wrench to loosen the nut on the water line, whichever you can most easily get into the space. Hold the line in place with one hand while you loosen the nut with the other, so that when it becomes disconnected you can keep the line upright. A bit of water will still be in the line, so have a bucket handy to pour out the water trapped in the line.


It's a good idea to spread towels across the bottom of the under-sink cabinet in order to catch small spills and reduce clean-up time later.
If the connection between your water lines and the sink are totally inaccessible, you can usually disconnect that lines at the water shut off valves. Remember, though, that you need to be gentle with the connections at these valves, as breaking them would send water streaming into your kitchen.

, The drain pipe is connected at the bottom of your sink strainer with a slip nut or a coupling nut, that connects plastic drain piping to a metal sink strainer. First loosen the nut that attaches the strainer to the drain pipe with channel locks or an adjustable wrench. This is usually a plastic nut that can be loosened by hand, with a bit of strength of course. When this nut is loose don't pull the connection apart yet! You will also need to loosen the slip nut at the far side of the P-trap, which is a distinctive J- or U-shaped span of pipe in the drain line under the sink. Loosening this nut as well should allow you to take off the whole piece of piping between the strainer and the far side of the P-trap without damaging the piping. Remember to keep your bucket handy to capture spills.


If you have a sink that is mounted underneath the counter you may need to remove more drain piping in order to have space for the sink to come out. Remove your drain pipe further past the P-trap, giving space for the sink to be angled out. Whatever you take out can easily be replaced, as long as you leave at least an inch of pipe sticking out from the where it enters the under sink area.
A slip nut connection is designed for removal by hand but if you can't get it off by hand, you may want to wrap a rag around the nut and gently turn the nut with your channel locks, so that the slip nut doesn't get damaged.

, First you will need to disconnect the drain pipe from your disposal. Unscrew the main connection between the garbage disposal and the drainpipe with a screwdriver.


You may also need to remove the drain line for the dishwasher, if you have one connected to the drain through your garbage disposal. This is a simple connection that should be easy to detach with either a screwdriver or wrench, depending on the fixture.

, Some garbage disposals have a special Allen wrench that unlocks the assembly from its connection (this should come with your disposal when you buy it). Use one hand to turn the special wrench counterclockwise and keep your other hand under the disposal. Other types of garbage disposal units use snap rings to connect the disposal to the bottom of the sink. With this connection, one ring is attached to the bottom of the sink and one ring is attached to the disposal. Then the two rings have several screws that sandwich them together, which can simply be loosened and removed when detaching the disposal. Either way, the unit will come off quickly and you'll need to have a good grip on it so that you're ready to catch it.


In many cases, a sink with two bowls will have one bowl connected directly to the drain and one connected directly to a garbage disposal. If this is the case you will need to remove both connections.

, Use a utility knife to carefully slice through the sealant along the edges of the fixture. Be sure not to cut into the countertop if you are going to continue using it.

, If you have an under-mounted sink you will first need to have someone hold the sink up while you detach it, otherwise it could fall down onto you. For top-mounted sinks, this step can be done by yourself. Unscrew the metal clips that connect the sink to the countertop. Use a screwdriver to carefully take off the tiny clips. These screws may be difficult to access or be a bit rusty, so just take your time and be patient getting them off.


In order for your helper to hold up an under-mounted sink, remove the strainer from the sink, allowing them to hold onto the sink through the strainer hole. The strainer is connected to the sink with a locknut that is located below the sink. You will need to use large channel locks to loosen the locknut, turning the locknut clockwise until it is detached. Then simply tap the bottom of the strainer up and it should pop up and be easily removed from the sink.

, If it doesn't move easily, move from side to side of the sink, pushing up until the fixture is loosened on all sides. If you are having trouble getting the sink to detach, and you are worried it may pull off pieced of your laminate countertop, have a helper gradually cut along the caulking as you push up on one side of the sink. This should allow you to remove the sink without accidentally pulling off some of your counter's finish.

, Stainless steel drop-in units are light enough to remove by yourself but older porcelain sinks can be heavy, so get someone to help you take that type out. Getting under-mounted sinks out is just a bit trickier. You will need to angle it out of the cupboard doors, being careful not to damage any cabinet surfaces or remaining piping.

, Scrape off any old caulk or plumber's putty from the countertop with a paint scraper or a razor blade. Make sure the surface is clean before you begin installing a new kitchen sink. Also remember to sop up any water that may have come out of the sink during removal.

Maximize storage space with cabinet organizers and shelves.,
Hang pots and pans from the wall or ceiling.,
Mount under-cabinet lights for increased visibility.,
Extend counter space with an adaptable chopping board or cart.,
Update your sink and faucet.,
Change up your backsplash.",How to Upgrade a Rental Kitchen1," Even if you have rows and rows of cabinets, you're probably not making the most out of these spaces. By installing some in-cabinet wire shelves that compartmentalize cabinet space, you can organize your canned goods, spices, and dishes more efficiently while removing unsightly clutter.Drawer space can be maximized with plastic or metal drawer organizer inserts.


You can also slip an over-the-door pantry rack on the inside of the pantry door, or use a rolling cart to store items when you're not using them.
If you’re screwing or nailing any shelving into place, you might want to ask your landlord ahead of time. They might not mind if you leave the shelving behind when you move out, or they might want you to uninstall them before leaving.;
, Even the most storage-conscious kitchen probably under-utilizes ceiling and wall space. You can free up tons of cabinet space while making your pots and pans more accessible and organized by installing a pegboard on the wall or a hanging pot rack on the ceiling.You can find a hanging pot rack for 50-100 dollars (46-93 euros) online or at a home improvement store, while a pegboard can cost you as little as 30 dollars (about 28 euros).

, Dim lighting makes chopping, measuring, mixing, and baking—in short, everything you might possibly be doing in the kitchen—more difficult. Brighten up your countertops by installing some LED under-cabinet lights that you can switch on when cooking.Look for lamps that you can mount with heavy-duty adhesive strips for optimally easy dismantling when moving out of your rental.

, No matter how good of a cook you are, limited counter space can seriously cramp your style. Fortunately, you’re not stuck with the measly counters you were given. Buy an elevated chopping board that covers the stovetop so that you can utilize more flat space, install a folding shelf on the wall, or use a rolling cart as a portable kitchen island.Also think about how you’re possibly under-utilizing the countertops you already have. Appliances like toasters, slow cookers, and coffee makers can take up a lot of room, so consider storing them in a cabinet when you’re not using them.

, A short or low-hanging faucet head can cause major pains in the kitchen, making everyday tasks, such as washing dishes, drying, cooking, and cleaning, consistently awkward. With the addition of a new sink or faucet, you can make a world of difference in your day-to-day drudgery. Just be sure to ask your landlord before purchasing or installing anything.


Installing a new faucet is relatively easy, but you might not want to take it on if you’re not handy around the house. Hire a handyman instead to make sure your plumbing alterations don’t create any more problems than you had before.

, The backsplash can be one of the more eye-catching aspects of the kitchen, but it also keeps oil splatter, drips, and cooking messes from staining the wall. Give your rental kitchen an easy upgrade by mounting a new, removable backsplash on the wall between your cabinets and counters.You can use temporary wallpaper or fabric and cover it with clear plastic sealant to make it easily cleanable, or you can use ceiling tiles and mount them on adhesive panels."

Light up the room with a chandelier.,
Add seating to turn the room into a cozy getaway spot.,
Place a trunk at the foot of the bed.,
Try out a canopy bed.",How to Decorate an Attic Bedroom2," Since many attics are such small spaces, the last thing you want to do is clutter the room up with unnecessary furnishings. Opt for smaller pieces, such as a full-sized bed instead of a king, and only include what you need to make the space comfortable.

, This works especially well if you have white walls and opt for white or beige furniture. Some may find this style a little bland, but it can look chic and sophisticated as long as you choose high-quality pieces and fabrics.

, If your attic only has one or two windows and you cannot remodel the room to add another one, place your furniture so that the natural light will rest where you spend the most time. Usually, this means placing the bed beneath the window, but you can also place a desk or chair in front of the window instead.

, Attic bedrooms have a naturally quaint appeal, which makes cottage-style decorations fairly appropriate for the space. Door-style shutters also add noticeable horizontal lines to the space, contrasting nicely against the high angular lines of the ceiling.

, Sheer drapes block out most of the light but not all of it, so your attic bedroom never gets too dark, even when the drapes are closed. Moreover, since the room is so high up, the privacy offered by thicker drapes and blinds is not as important.

, Look for patterned bedspreads, armchairs, and drapes. These patterns add visual interest to the room in a subtle, enchanting manner, but louder patterns, like polka dots or brightly colored plaid, can overwhelm the bedroom if it is located in a smaller attic.

, Install a window bench that doubles as drawer space, or look for a bed frame with drawer space built underneath.

, Chandeliers and other hanging lights take advantage of the high vaulted ceiling and keep the floor looking less cluttered. If placed in the middle of the room, a hanging light can also disperse light more evenly than a floor lamp.

, Attic bedrooms can already seem removed from the rest of the house. This “out of the way” sense makes an attic bedroom the perfect place to escape to for solace. If you have enough room, a comfortable armchair can make the room feel like its own complete space.

, Attics are typically used to store boxes and trunks of extra belongings. Play to this idea by placing a large trunk at the foot of the bed. Trunks can act as both storage and seating.

, If your attic has a high enough ceiling, you can draw attention to this height with a canopy bed. The vertical poles pull the eye up and down, causing it to fixate on the height of the room, and the soft, draping fabric promotes a calm, relaxing ambiance.

Pop a cactus or fern on the windowsill where it can get plenty of sun, or hang a potted plant from an empty patch of ceiling space.If you have pets, be careful about which plants you put in your house. Aloe vera, American holly, and tulips, for example, are all toxic to cats and dogs., Unless your rental kitchen sports unusually lovely floor tiles, chances are that your floor isn’t the prettiest part of the room. Fortunately, it’s easy and affordable to cover up this eyesore with cotton rugs or outdoor mats.International household goods stores, such as IKEA, offer a wide variety of kitchen-ready rugs and mats.

, No matter what your kitchen looks like, chances are that cabinets take up a lot of the physical and visual space. This means that you can make a big, refreshing change to your kitchen’s aesthetics by covering your cabinets in shiny or matte contact paper or temporary wallpaper. Unlike paint, it’s easily undone and won’t make your landlord unhappy.For an alternative look, unscrew and remove all the doors from your cabinet so that all the contents are visible. Just be sure to keep all the detached parts safe and sound so that you can reattach when moving out., Decorating your kitchen doesn’t require a costly or permanent renovation. Instead, take some pretty wine glasses, platters, or vases from your cabinets and put them out on display, or buy some brightly colored mason jars and line them up in an eye-catching arrangement on a shelf or cabinet top.Clear or colored mason jars can be particularly striking if you showcase them against under- or over-cabinet lights.

, Colored or patterned washi tape is endlessly versatile for sprucing up any room in your house, and it’s easily removable for ensured landlord approval. Simply make patterns on your walls with washi tape, or take some metallic or bright duct tape to create stripes or patterns on your refrigerator.If you think colorful washi tape and patterns are too flashy, use some stainless steel contact paper to cover your appliances instead. It will make your appliances look new and shiny while also protecting them from further stains and damage., Personal accents can be a great way to add flair and interest to your kitchen without altering it in a permanent or costly manner. Put a twist on the classic fridge magnet décor by spreading temporary, adhesive wallpaper over the refrigerator door or covering it in old photos.If you don’t have any Polaroids or photo prints handy, use a website service, such as Sticky 9, to make square print magnets out of your favorite Instagram pics.

, Many rental kitchens sport less-than-lovely laminate countertops instead of more expensive materials, like granite or marble. If these surfaces create an eyesore in your kitchen, cover them up with some chunky, statement chopping boards that you can take with you when you move out.Just be sure to properly sanitize your cutting boards after use. Plastic cutting boards are dishwasher-safe, but wooden ones will need to be hand-washed. If possible, color code your cutting boards so that you use one color for raw meats, and another color for fruits and veggies."

Decide how much you can spend on your kitchen renovation.,
Include all of the elements of a kitchen renovation when estimating your budget.,
Plan for labor, and think about the level of expertise you expect in your kitchen renovation.,
Commit to your budget.",How to Plan a Kitchen Renovation1," The amount of your budget will often dictate the rest of the planning process.


Establish a range instead of a fixed budget number. For example, budgeting $7,500 to $8,500 is more reasonable than deciding to spend exactly $8,000.;
, You will potentially need to pay for new appliances, flooring, countertops, hardware, paint, ventilation, cabinets and installation costs.


Set aside money in your budget for unexpected problems, delays, expenses and contingencies. The National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA) advises you add 20 percent of your budget to your estimate for surprises and contingencies.

, You will need a general contractor as well as plumbers, electricians and other specialists.

, You will need to decide where you want to save and where you want to spend. For example, if stainless steel appliances are a priority, you might need to settle for laminate flooring.

Please, read all the steps and tips before beginning.,
Remove existing caulk.,
Clean the surface(s).,
Inspect for de-lamination.,
Allow the area(s) to completely dry.,
Repair de-laminated areas.,
Remove weights, wedges, etc.,
Mask off area to keep caulk over seam.,
Ready the caulk.,
Apply caulk.,
Fill seams between laminate sections, such as where the counter top or backsplash required more than one piece of laminate.,
Remove tape.,
Allow the caulk to fully cure as per manufacturer's directions before cleaning, etc.

",How to Recaulk Kitchen Counter Where It Meets the Backsplash,";
, Remove as much as possible by pulling loose ends by hand. Remove remaining caulk with a narrow blade putty knife / scraper. A plastic putty knife / scraper will minimize scratching of finished surfaces. Only apply as much pressure as needed to remove caulk without damaging the surface.

, Use a cleaning agent that can cut through soap, yet not damage the surface finish. Try using a small amount of thinner or other cleaner that dries with little or no residue in an inconspicuous place to test for possible damage to the finish. If no damage results, use only as much as needed to remove dirt, etc.

, Laminates are sheets of material that is bonded to a base - in the case of counter tops and back splashes this is wood or some type of particle or fiberboard. If water has been allowed to seep under the laminate for longer than a brief time, there is a good chance that the laminate is no longer bonded to the wood base underneath. Look for up or down-turned edges and feel for bubbles or air pockets under the laminate. Slightly lift the laminate away from the wood beneath. Do not pry. Lift it only far enough to allow circulation of air. Do not extend the de-lamination by lifting too high as this can risk breaking any existing bond and the even the laminate itself. Vacuum as best you can to remove any debris caught between the laminate and wood.

, This is a very important step, and the more time allowed to dry, the better the repair will be. If this area is near a sink, it would be best to not use the sink if possible. Shutting off the water can help prevent accidental usage in extreme cases.

, After being allowed to completely dry (overnight is minimum, but 24 - 48 hours is better), check for signs of dampness. A paper towel pressed into the areas and inspected after being removed should prove if water had been kept away during the drying time. If still damp, allow additional drying time or add a fan to speed drying; otherwise apply contact cement as per instructions on the container. It will be impossible to get the contact cement all the way to to the point where a factory bond exists. For this reason, apply the cement as far as practical and add extra at the furthest point you can reach. When ready to join, start from the edges and work to the center so that the extra cement will be forced further still to the factory bonded point. Work back towards the edges. Inspect for bubbles or air pockets under the laminate. When satisfied, apply even pressure to the laminate against the wood backing with weights, wedges, etc. overnight.

, and clean any contact cement that may have leeched out from between the laminate and backing by hand or with the plastic putty knife / scraper.

, When two surfaces join at an angle such as a backsplash and counter, allow for about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or less width of caulking area on either side of the seam, how much is a personal preference. Painters tape, masking tape or any tape that doesn't leave residue will work fine. Apply the tape evenly so that the desired amount of exposure of both horizontal and vertical surfaces from the seam is visible.

, Cut the tip of the caulking tube (at any angle that works best for you as determined by your ""practice runs"") to make an opening about equal to the mask width. Pierce the seal of the tube by inserting a nail or other thin object into the tip until the seal is punctured. While relieving the ""catch"" mechanism (locking tab around the rod at the handle end of the caulking gun or providing a 1/4 turn of the rod or which ever way your gun operates) pull the rod as far out of the gun as it will travel. Load the caulk tube into the caulking gun by inserting bottom end into the handle end of the gun. Press the nozzle end into the other end of the gun. Squeeze the trigger repeatedly until pressure is felt at the trigger. Slowly squeeze the trigger while watching for caulk to become visible at the end of the nozzle. Stop squeezing as soon as it appears. Have a paper towel or rag ready for any excess caulk that will continue to slowly ooze out. Instantly stopping this slow oozing can be accomplished by relieving the pressure on the rod by the gun - release the ""catch"" of the rod as described above.

, Run a bead of caulk directly over the seam. By providing steady pressure to the caulk gun trigger and moving along the seam at a steady speed at the same time, acceptable results should be obtained. Work on areas no greater than 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) at a time. ""Tool"" the bead with the wedge tool included with some brands of caulk, a popsicle stick or vinyl gloved finger will also work. A bare finger however, wet with saliva seems to work best and is the way it is done most often in the field. Tooling is done for two reasons: it forces the bead into the seam void and it provides a smooth bead surface that makes cleaning easier. Starting at one end, press the tool or finger into the bead and wipe evenly towards the opposite end. Wipe built-up excess caulk from your finger or tool as needed with paper towels or rags, and re-wet finger before repeating. When ""tooling"" the caulk, work the edge of the caulk near the tape edges nearest to the seam to be as thin as possible, leaving the bulk of the caulk directly over the seam. Tool the caulk until satisfied with appearance. Repeat for each additional 3–4 foot (0.9–1.2 m) lengths until complete. Do not work too large an area or waste too much time as after the caulk begins to ""skin over"" tooling will be difficult and result in wrinkling the surface.

, Apply thin bead directly over seams and press firmly in as you wipe into seam with wet finger. Do this several times to ensure caulk has permeated the space between sections to prevent water from entering. Wipe away any excess caulk on the surface of the laminate with a damp paper towel or rag.

, Check the caulk on surface of the tape to ensure it is no longer wet. Caulk on the surface of the tape should be of minimal thickness - practically transparent at the edge tape's edge. Carefully and slowly lift the tape from the laminate. It should come up in one piece and there should be no wet caulk bridging the gap between the tape and the laminate as it is lifted away. If there is, allow more drying time before reattempting. The thinner the caulk is at the tapes edge, the better the results will be.

Think about how you will use the kitchen.,
Look for inspiration.,
Pick a style.,
Consider energy efficiency.",How to Plan a Kitchen Renovation2," You might use it only occasionally because you eat out a lot, or perhaps you have a large family who gathers there for 3 meals every day.


Figure out what works well and what needs improvement. For example, if you cannot reach half of your cabinets, make sure they are lower when you remodel.
Optimize your efficiency. When you plan the layout of your kitchen, think about how you move when you are in there cooking, cleaning and eating. For example, you do not want your sink to be too far from your dishwasher.

, Check out kitchen magazines, read blogs on the Internet and examine sample kitchen in design showrooms and stores.


Pay attention to colors, textures, fabrics and surfaces. Get inspiration in large things, such as floors or countertops as well as small details such as knobs on drawers and storage.

, Planning your kitchen renovation will depend on whether you prefer a modern kitchen, a classic and traditional style or something that resembles a beach cottage.

, Many kitchens are going green by using energy efficient appliances and lighting, as well as sustainable materials for floors and windows.

Figure out how much professional help you need.,
Ask for estimates from at least 3 contractors.,
Talk about timeframes.",How to Plan a Kitchen Renovation3," You might want everything; an architect, designer, builder and contractor as well as a team of sub-contractors. Or, you might want to do it yourself and call in help when you get stuck.


Talk to contractors, at the very least. Unless you are experienced with building and renovations, you will need someone to help you get necessary permits and manage the overall project.

, You should do the same thing if you are working with designers and other professionals. Getting at least 3 quotes or estimates will help you determine who fits into your budget.

, Once you hire a contractor, discuss how long the work will take. This will help you plan your renovation and how you will function without the use of your kitchen.

"
"
Consult with the contractor or person in charge of the renovation project for an exact timeline regarding dates and times the renovation will take place.,
Reserve the freight elevator during renovation hours if you live in a high-rise building so contractors can move equipment and building supplies to and from your kitchen.

,
Remove all pictures, mirrors, curtains, wall hangings, or any other types of furnishings from your kitchen walls and any walls shared with your kitchen to prevent them from falling, breaking, or becoming damaged.

,
Prepare and cook all meals in advance since you may not have access to your stove-top or oven.

,
Freeze or refrigerate your foods to prolong their life and freshness during the renovation period.

,
Pack kitchen gadgets, appliances, and any other kitchen belongings you won't need throughout the renovation period into labeled boxes.,
Store boxes and items you won't need during the renovation in a garage or shed, or rent a storage space for your belongings throughout the construction phase.

,
Set aside essential items that you will need access to on a daily basis, such as coffee makers, can openers, utensils, or any other kitchenware or appliances.

,
Purchase disposable cups, plates, and eating utensils to use during the renovation process if you do not want to wash dishes or use valuable dinnerware.

,
Move the refrigerator to another location within your home or to your garage, or purchase a mini-refrigerator to use during the renovation.

,

Move all your furniture or cover it with a protective plastic sheet if it resides in the kitchen or nearby areas to prevent any potential damages.

,
Cover any floors or walkways with protective plastic sheets to prevent the contractors from damaging your carpets or floors during the renovation.

,
Relocate your pet's food and water bowls to another section of your house at least 10 days prior to the renovation to prevent them from becoming stressed or confused during the renovation.

,
Determine if the contractors working on your kitchen will be utilizing a portable bathroom or a bathroom in your home during the renovation process.",How to Prepare for a Kitchen Renovation,"

Paint the walls.,
Add new floors.,
Add a backsplash to your walls.",How to Update Your Kitchen on a Budget1," Paint is one of the simplest, cheapest ways to update your kitchen. If you have a bold retro color, you will probably need to prime the walls before you can apply a new color. If you are only trying to update faded white or off-white walls—including walls stained with tobacco smoke—primer may not be necessary. You can go with pure white to give your kitchen a fresh, modern feeling, or you can opt for a light blue to add a calm, refreshing dose of tranquility. Beige is also an acceptable color, especially if you have wood cabinets or countertops.


Use satin or semigloss latex paint for your walls. These two types of paint are easier to scrub, which is important in a greasy room like the kitchen.;
, Old kitchens tend to have old, dated tile flooring. A relatively inexpensive way to update the look of your kitchen is by ripping up the tiles and installing linoleum or laminate floors. These floors are durable, easy to clean, and can be installed without professional help. They also present a fresh, clean look.

, Mosaic tiles are chic and fit nicely behind a stove or sink. Small square mirrors are a good way to open a tiny, cramped kitchen up. Framed photographs or prints, hung closely together, are another good way to add visual interest to an otherwise boring kitchen.

"
Use ornamental grasses.,
Go for bright florals.,
Include perennials.,
Use shrubs and mosses.,
Include herbs.,
Select a color palette for the garden.,
Lay tall grass down first.,
Include florals in sunny spots.,
Add ground cover plants.,
Put in walking stones or a pathway.,
Add in decorative stones and ornaments.,
Water the garden when needed.,
Trim grasses and shrubs.,
Move pots indoors during the winter months.",How to Design a Waterfront Garden," One of the hardiest plants that do well in waterfront gardens are ornamental grasses, as they can withstand strong wind and salt. Grasses like sea oat and feather reed are both great for waterfront gardens. They add vibrant color and texture to the garden.Other grasses like Anemanthele lessoniana and “Walker’s Low” nepeta are also good for waterfront gardens.;
, Bright florals are another great option for waterfront gardens, as they like direct sunlight and can add color to the space. Daylily, lantana, yarrow, hydrangea, and gaillardia do well in salty soil. They come in a variety of shades, from yellows and reds to pinks and purples.If you are designing a waterfront garden by fresh water, try florals like angelica, basket of gold, bleeding heart, or calendula.
Many of these florals also attract butterflies, an added bonus to any garden.

, Perennials can add color and variety to a waterfront garden. Gazania, flowering tobacco, African lily, and red hot poker are popular perennials in coastal areas. They tend to thrive well on their own in moist conditions.Plant perennials in pots so you can move them indoors during the winter months, especially if temperatures tend to drop by the water where you live.

, Shrubs are hardy and easy to maintain, making them ideal for waterfront gardens. Try a shrub like juniper, as well as mosses like sea moss, also called portulaca. Vines like wintercreeper are also good options for ground cover or for trellises in the garden., Herbs like lavender, sage, and rosemary can withstand wind and salt. They also add color and texture to the garden, not to mention a lovely aroma. For waterfront gardens by fresh water areas, herbs like mint, basil, dill, and thyme are all good options., Determine which colors you would like to showcase in the garden. You may opt for a colder color palette, with blues, purples, and greens. Or you may try a warmer color palette, with yellows, reds, and oranges.Try to go for a softer palette for the garden so you do not overwhelm the calm, blue color of the water.
A base palette of greens and yellows is popular in waterfront gardens. You can then add in colors like red, orange, purple, and pink to the palette to compliment the greens and yellows.

, Tall grass can serve as a good base for the waterfront garden. Lay tall grass down as a border in the flower beds or by the edge of the water to protect the other plants. Putting tall grass by the water as a buffer will also prevent erosion.You can also put tall grass next to ground cover plants to add dimension and height to the garden.

, Florals should be planted in areas that get a lot of sun in the garden. Follow your color palette and plant flowers in colors that will compliment each other. Put them by tall grasses and ground cover plants like moss.


Plant perennials in large decorative pots so you can place them in the garden by walkways or on a deck during the warmer months.

, Ground cover plants like shrubs, moss, and vines can be added by pathways, decks, or walking stones. They also look good placed next to tall grass and florals. Often, the green tones of moss and vines are a good compliment to the yellow and browns of tall grasses.Be sure to include herbs like lavender or rosemary in the garden next to ground cover plants.
If you plan to have a trellis in the waterfront garden, plant vines so they grow over the trellis.

, A waterfront garden can be kicked up a notch with walking stones or a pathway. Use sandstone for walking stones, as it is a hardy material that can withstand salt and water. Gravel is also a good option for a pathway. Make the pathway so it leads to a spot by the water or around your home.You can also add a bench by the pathway or the walking stones. Get a bench made out of sandstone if it will be in the spot permanently. You can use a bench made of wood or metal if you plan to take it indoors during the cold months or during any storms by the water.

, Personalize the waterfront garden with decorative stones and garden ornaments. Large decorative stones can add texture and dimension to the garden. Place them among tall grasses and ground cover plants. You can find decorative stones at your local hardware store or find your own on the beach.Garden ornaments like driftwood, stone statues, and stone carvings can all add a personal touch to the waterfront garden. Scatter them among the plants for a detail oriented look.

, Maintain the garden by following a regular watering schedule. Water the garden in the early morning using a soaker hose. Only water the roots of the plants, not the leaves, as this can lead to garden pests.Florals require regular watering and should be given water six inches into the soil once the soil becomes dry. Perennials and shrubs should be given water 12 inches into the soil once the soil becomes dry.
Ornamental grasses do not require regular watering. They should be well watered when they are first planted and then only during periods of drought.Mosses also require little to no watering once they have been established in the garden.

, If you include tall grasses and shrubs in your waterfront garden, they will need to be trimmed periodically. Use garden shears to trim the shrubs and grasses when they start to become overgrown or crowd up the pathways.


Waterfront gardens do look their best when they appear wild and carefree, so do not over trim or shape the grasses or shrubs. A simple trim every now and then will suffice.

, If you include perennials in pots in your waterfront garden, be sure to move them indoors during the winter months. This will allow them to survive indoors until the weather warms up again.If you live in a warm climate by the water year round with lots of sun, you may be fine to leave them outdoors in pots. Try to move them to spots with direct sunlight and avoid leaving them in shady areas.

Think about your lifestyle.,
Assess your need for privacy.,
Take home furnishings into consideration.,
Evaluate the building lot.",How to Choose the Right House Plans," Your house needs to serve all aspects of your daily routine and fit in with your mode of living.


The size of your immediate family (or those who will be living with you in the house) can be the main determinant of the square footage and/or number of rooms in your home building plans.
Determine how often you like to entertain guests, and if you prefer to have room(s) for them to stay over extended periods of time.
Identify the areas that you and your home-mates generally congregate. For example, some families find that they often spend most of their free time gathered in the kitchen area, whereas other families may spend a majority of their time in the game room.
The work spaces in your house plans of choice should be congruent with your lifestyle. For example, if you do a lot of yard work or have outdoor hobbies, then you will want a washroom that can be accessed from outside the home; moreover, if you have an interest that is noisy (music, woodworking, etc.), then you may need a work space that is far removed from the home's living areas.;
, You may prefer to have a master bedroom that is separate from the living areas, or you may work from home and require home designs that incorporate a private home office area.


House plans that are segmented and/or angular (L-shaped or U-shaped) generally offer more privacy than square or rectangular homes.
Consider the placement of windows, and how they relate to the property and/or surrounding homes.
If outdoor privacy is a concern for you, then home designs with enclosed patios, porches and deck areas are a good fit for you.

,


Envision the layout of each room on the floor plans you are considering in order to determine what type of furniture, and how much of it, you will need.
Unless you plan on buying new furniture, your house plans should accommodate the furnishings you have. Remember that you need at least 3 feet (0.9 m) of walking space around each item of furniture.
Keep in mind both the traffic flow from room to room, as well as the flow of natural light (i.e. where you will place the furniture in regards to windows, doors and views), when creating a home furnishing plan.

, The lot you choose to build on will play a large part in determining the type of house plans you may consider.


The lot should accommodate the size of the house you want to build; not only the structure itself, but also the driveway and easements (storm drains, sidewalks, sewer access, etc.).
A narrow and/or sloped lot is good for multilevel buildings, but may not work for a single level home.
Your house plans should take advantage of the aesthetic strengths of the lot. For example, if your lot has a long, panoramic view, then your house plans should include features that capitalize on that view.
The orientation of your home must provide for practical access to connecting roadways. Additionally, you should be conscious of the placement and orientation of surrounding homes when choosing house plans that suit your orientation requirements.
Depending on your lifestyle and the size of your property, you may want to consider floor plans that open up to the lot at multiple access points, and/or that incorporate large decks for outdoor entertaining.
Consider the direction of the rising/setting sun, as well as the blowing wind, when choosing where in your house plans you prefer to have windows, doors and deck areas.

Paint your cabinets.,
Replace cabinet doors.,
Paint the inside of your cabinets.,
Install new hardware.",How to Update Your Kitchen on a Budget2," If your cabinets are looking a little drab, update them with a nice color. If you have plain white walls, a little pop of blue or red can be exactly what your space needs. If you have a color on your walls, consider going for white or beige cabinets. Prime the cabinets with a de-glossing primer to help the paint stick better before you apply the final paint color.Similarly, if you have hardwood cabinets, you can spruce them up with a fresh coat of wood finishing.

, Instead of painting the cabinets, you could update the doors with a new design. If you have recessed-panel doors, you can even remove the center panel and insert glass to open the cabinets up, giving your kitchen a more modern look.

, If you have glass cabinet doors, or if you decide to replace the interior panels of your doors with glass, add both depth and color to your kitchen by painting the interior of your cabinets with a bold color. Raspberry red, bold blue, and sunshine yellow are just a few examples of colors you can choose from., If you are already satisfied with the finish on your cabinet doors, you can still update them slightly by installing new handles.

Use concrete.,
Try butcher block countertops.,
Try laminate countertops.",How to Update Your Kitchen on a Budget3," Countertop kits make the job easy to do on your own and are relatively inexpensive. You can use acrylic craft paints and high gloss sealers to make the counters look as close to granite as possible for a fraction of the cost of real granite.

, Concrete can be a little difficult if you are new to working with it and you may not want to use it for your countertops if it is your first time working with concrete. If you feel confident in your DIY abilities, however, concrete is a versatile and affordable option.

, Butcher block countertops are made of thick slabs of wood. You can buy the wood at a hardware store, or you can also find inexpensive butcher block countertops from various home furnishing stores. The countertops can also be installed without the use of professional help.

, Laminate might be a bit more expensive than paint or concrete, but thanks to the numerous patterns and styles available, it makes a fantastic way to update your kitchen. Laminate is also easy to clean and install, and it is much cheaper than marble or granite.

, An armoire can be changed into a pantry and an old table or dresser can be used for an island. You may need to refinish the pieces before they will be suitable for use in your kitchen, but a fresh coat of paint and a glossy sealant can transform them quickly and cheaply.

, A dull, tarnished faucet can make a kitchen look grungy and out of date. Extravagant faucet models can be expensive, but even an inexpensive, simple model is a good way to give your kitchen a fresh facelift.

, If you have chairs with cushions on them or towels hanging off the refrigerator door, change them out. Towels being looking grungy fairly quickly, but thankfully, kitchen towels can also be fairly cheap. You can also buy new chair pads to replace any old pads with dated patterns or rips and tears.

, Like other elements, extravagant lighting fixtures can be costly, but you can get relatively inexpensive ones that will be just as effective at lighting your kitchen and will be a huge improvement on an outdated design."

Make sure you have the necessary tools, including a notched trowel, tape measure, sponge, level, utility knife, and a tile cutter. You may need spacers for tiles that are not attached together in sections.
You may want to use something to cover your countertops during this process to keep them clean.;
, In order for the tile adhesive to stick the walls, they must be free of any dust or grease. Wipe them down with a damp rag, and give enough time for them to completely dry.

, It is important to make sure you get a good measurement so you know exactly what size you should cut your tiles.


Choose a stopping point, either directly below your cabinets or at an arbitrary point on the wall.
Make sure that you have enough tiles to fill the measured space, as well as a few extras for precaution.
Use a level and straight edge to mark your stopping point along the wall.

, Use your trowel to smooth the tile adhesive across the wall, working in small sections. If you apply too much at once, it will begin to dry before you get a chance to attach the tiles.


Always start applying your tiles from the bottom center, and working outwards from there.
Don’t apply the tile adhesive to the backs of the tiles, as it will be more difficult to attach them to the wall.

, Press them into the tile adhesive on the wall, using a level to make sure they are even. Push them a few times to make sure they are secured to the wall.


If your tiles are not attached together in sections, use spacers to make sure they are all evenly spaced.
Wiggle the tile a little bit against the wall to ensure suction with the adhesive., Attach all remaining tiles to your wall using this method, until you reach the edges. Before you stick your tiles to the edges of the wall, cut off any excess or oddly shaped corners to make sure the fit is perfect.


Always cut out holes for outlets or odd edges prior to attaching the tile to the wall.
Any empty spaces can be filled with pieces of spare tile you cut to size with your tile cutter or utility knife.

, Use your (cleaned) trowel to spread grout evenly across the tiles. Don’t worry about covering the tiles, as that is what is supposed to happen. You will remove the unnecessary grout later.


Spread the grout at a 45 degree angle in a sweeping pattern.
Allow a few minutes for the grout to set, and then use a damp sponge to clean off excess grout. All of the cracks between the tiles should be filled, while the remaining tiles should be cleaned of all unnecessary grout.

, After the grout has completely dried, clean it off again with a dry cloth.

, If you want, you can apply a grout sealant to help protect your tiles. Add a small line of silicone caulk to the bottom edge of your tile to seal out water and prevent mildew growth.

, Once you have completed all the installation steps, managing your new backsplash is easy. Wipe it down occasionally with a generic kitchen or glass cleaner to keep your backsplash looking its best."

Measure the length of the backsplash for each section of countertop.
Add the lengths together.
Multiply the total length the backsplash by 4 inches (the height of the backsplash).
Divide the product by 140 to calculate the total square footage of your backsplash.
Add this number to the total square footage of your countertops., Often countertops run along two perpendicular walls, forming an L-shape.


When measuring this layout, you must first verify that your corner is a 90° angle. Measure and mark 3 feet from the corner along one wall. Measure and mark 4 feet from the corner along the other wall. Measure the diagonal distance between the two points. If the distance is 5 feet, then your corner is square.#*Divide the counter into two sections.

Gather your supplies.,
Clean your walls.,
Measure your space.,
Stick your tiles to the wall.,
Finish attaching tiles.,
Enjoy your new tile backsplash.",How to Install a Kitchen Backsplash2," You will need to have your peel-and-stick tiles prepared, a tile cutter or utility knife, and level. Pretty basic, huh? If you tiles are not stuck together on sheets, you may also need spacers to make sure they are all evenly spread.

, The sticky backings of your tiles can’t adhere to walls if they are dusty or greasy. Use a damp rag to completely wipe down walls, and then let them dry completely.

, It is important to make sure you get a good measurement so you know exactly what size you should cut your tiles.


Choose a stopping point, either directly below your cabinets or at an arbitrary point on the wall.
Make sure that you have enough tiles to fill the measured space, as well as a few extras for precaution.
Use a level and straight edge to mark your stopping point along the wall.

, Peel the backing off the tiles, and stick them to your desired location. Always start from the bottom center of the wall and work your way out.


Firmly press the tiles each time you stick them to the wall, to make sure they are firmly adhered.
Hold a straight edge or level to the sides of your tile as your press, to make sure that they don’t shift out of alignment.

, Work your way across the wall, until the entirety of your desired space is filled up. Cut any pieces to fit outlet holes or edges and corners before you attach them to the wall., To keep it looking its best, wipe the backsplash clean with water or a generic kitchen cleaner occasionally.

Get rid of stuff you don’t use.,
Store the special-event stuff.,
Stock surplus in another room.,
Keep your counters clear.,
Downsize your appliances.",How to Maximize Space in a Small Kitchen1," Face it: you don’t need those snowman shaped salad servers. In fact, there’s a good chance you could fill a box with kitchen stuff you haven’t used in months. Go through everything in your kitchen and ask yourself, “Do I actually need this?” You may be surprised by your answers.If you’re hesitant, conduct an experiment. Place all but your most used kitchen items - especially the as-seen-on-TV equipment, in a box, and place it in a closet near the kitchen or in the garage.
As you need items from the box, find somewhere to store them more permanently in the kitchen. After a month or two, assess the items still in the box. Are they still worth holding onto?;
, You’re thinking to yourself, “But I’ll definitely use those bachelorette party cookie cutters again.” Well, maybe you will. That said, they don’t need to be clogging up your cutlery drawer and offending your more sensible utensils in the meantime. Relegate party-specific and holiday-only items to somewhere they won’t be in your way during your day-to-day life.Use the space above your cabinets for long-term storage too. If your cabinets don’t go all the way to the ceiling, you can still use the space above them to store seldom-used kitchen equipment., There’s simply no need to two dozen cans of corn to be in your kitchen at all times. If you tend to stock up heavily on certain items, designate a space in another room for kitchen storage. For instance, keep a box of canned goods in your washing room., This is especially important if you have limited counter surface area. If you have a toaster on the counter currently, consider relegating it to a cupboard, unless you use it at least a couple times a week. Not only will you literally wind up with more space by clearing your counters - your kitchen will also feel much more useable., In especially small spaces, appliances can take up way too much of your kitchen. For instance, if you have a full size-blender, opt for an immersion blender instead. These are also easier wash - which is especially advantageous if your kitchen lacks a dishwasher.Consider getting an all-in-one kitchen machine. Some, for instance, even come with attachments that will allow you to make pasta and ice cream, and juice whatever fruits and veggies you can cram into it. While these attachment are only necessary if you intend to use them, they’ll take up much less space than a handful of separate appliances.

Remove food from its packaging.,
Use risers to double your cabinet surface area.,
Take advantage of the space behind doors.,
Use full dish sets.",How to Maximize Space in a Small Kitchen2," Food that comes in bags or boxes often doesn’t fill its packaging. Accordingly, you’re using valuable storage space on this extra space. Especially once you open something, like a box of cereal or crackers, remove the cardboard and recycle it. Roll the bag up tightly and fasten with a rubber band.Consider purchasing jars or tubs with tight, resealable lids to store foods once they are open. Clear jars with airtight seals are best, as they’ll keep your food fresh and allow you to quickly find whatever you’re looking for.

, Get metal or plastic risers - think miniature tables, just for holding dishes or food - that fit within your cabinets. These will effectively serve as another shelf in your cabinet. While they will shorten the distance between surfaces, the extra surface area is ideal for storing and organizing shorter items, like mugs or canned goods., You may find you have plenty of additional space on the back of cabinet, cupboard, and pantry doors. There are all sorts of hanging organizers that will hang from the top of the door and fit within the storage area when closed.If you want to avoid seeing hooks hanging over the doors, simply attached organizers or small shelves directly to the inside of whichever doors have a bit of clearance hidden behind them.

, Dishes that fit into one another will help your kitchen stay organized, and will save plenty of space in the dishware cabinet. Plus, there’s nothing that looks as satisfactorily well-organized as a stack of perfectly nested mixing bowls.Modernity has brought with it some incredible inventions, one of which is the bowl-plate. These are exactly what the sound like - about the size of a dinner plate, but with a deeper well and edges similar to a bowl. Having a few of these nearly makes classic bowls and plates obsolete.

"
"
Hang pots and pans.,
Acquire a floating island.,
Mount a magnetic strip on your wall.,
Install a pull-out pantry.",How to Maximize Space in a Small Kitchen3," Pots and pans are one of the largest space-fillers in your kitchen. Keep them from filling up storage areas by installing a pot rack or individual hooks on an open wall. Another good option is hanging up a piece of pegboard, which will allow you adjust the location of hooks and other hanging apparatus., One way to make an island work in a small kitchen is to make it mobile. This is definitely worth working into your kitchen, as it will add both surface area and storage space, and can be moved out of the way when not in use. You may simply be able to add wheels to a freestanding island you already have, or adapt a cart into a kitchenette.You can also use a build-your-own shelving unit and attach a wood cutting surface, or any surface of your choosing, to the top level with a bit of DIYing. Building your own allows you to customize it with the features that will be most helpful for you.
Whatever sort of island you purchase or put together, make sure the wheels have locks so you can securely fix the island when using it.

, Want to get rid of that knife block once and for all? Easy: install a magnetic strip designed to hold knives on the wall, ideally near where you like to do your prep work. Make sure the strip is elevated, and ideally above a counter or other feature that will keep any children or pets away.Install a paper towel roll nearby too. After washing a knife, simply wipe it on the towel roll and put it on the magnet strip.

, If you’re short on dry food storage area, or struggle with a deep pantry that’s hard to see or reach into, consider making better use of the space by installing a slide out shelving unit. Slim, tall spice racks or can shelves can slide in and out of surprisingly small spaces that you may not currently be using."

Get two identical bookshelves.,
Figure out the dimensions of your countertop.,
Purchase or make a countertop.,
Attach the counter to the shelves.,
Add any desired finishing touches.,
For an alternative method, add a cabinet.",How to Make a Kitchen Island1," These should be roughly counter-height or just above. They should be sturdy and preferably deeper than the standard bookshelf. You can paint them beforehand if you want them to be a different color. Measure their depth and width.;
, Decide how long you want the countertop to be. It should be at least as long as the depth of both shelves plus a little extra to create the lip of the counter but can include up to four or five feet between the bookshelves. Next, determine the width by taking the width of the bookshelves and adding a little extra to create a lip.

, Once you know the dimensions you need, you can purchase or make your own countertop. Make your own by purchasing medium density fiberboard (MDF) or you can go to your local hardware store and purchase any number of materials cut to the exact size that you need.


Butcher’s block is a popular option as it is cheap, easy to clean, and great for use in kitchens.
Granite may also be an option but since slabs are so heavy, you will need less space between the bookshelves in order to be sure it is properly supported.
If making your own from MDF, you can paint it to create a more table-like appearance or you can laminate or tile the surface to use the island for food preparation.

, With the shelves at the ends facing outward, place the counter on top and attach it to the shelves with brackets. These brackets will need to be screwed into bookshelves at the edges where the wood is thickest and then into the countertop, being careful not to use screws that are too long and protrude through the surface.


Special considerations will need to be taken if using a granite countertop, as you cannot simply screw into the stone. Consult with your local hardware store before attempting this type of counter.

, If using MDF you can paint, tile, or laminate the countertop based on your needs and preference. Hooks can be bracketed or glued to the outside of the book shelves to hang kitchen towels. Depending on the type of bracket you chose to use, it may be possible to suspend a bar and hooks between the brackets in order to hang pots and pans. Keep in mind, however, that this can quickly become too heavy for the brackets, so don’t hang too much.

, A standard kitchen cabinet can be used between the bookshelves if you would rather have storage than legroom. This will also serve to give the island a more solid look and can be used to hide dishwashers and other appliances from the main view of your kitchen.


You will need your cabinet and bookshelves to be the same height so that the countertop will go evenly across all three pieces. The easiest way to do this is to have shelves which are slightly shorter than the cabinet and add legs. You will also need the cabinet to be no deeper than the width of the bookshelves.
The countertop will then need to be the length of the depth of both bookshelves, plus the width of the cabinet, plus a little extra to create the lip of the counter. The width of the countertop will be determined again by the width of the bookshelves.
Attach the countertop to the cabinet and bookshelves by first screwing through the inside of the cabinet into the backside of the bookshelf (preferably at the sides as before, but possibly through the lower and upper horizontal sections if they can be reached). Then screw through the inside of the cabinet into the countertop above, again being careful of the length of your screw.

Pick a color scheme.,
Clean the pipe.,
Protect the area.,
Apply metal primer.,
Paint a first coat.,
Apply additional coats as needed.",How to Hide Pipes in the Kitchen1," If you want to hide your pipes, the best option is to use a paint color that matches the hue of your kitchen walls or ceiling.In essence, you'll be hiding the pipes in plain sight. Even though the pipes will be out in the open, they will be fade into the background and become much less noticeable.
Alternatively, you can make your pipes look like part of the décor by painting them in a fresh color that stands out. For instance, you could paint the pipes a bright color that coordinates with the rest of your kitchen décor, turning them into statement pieces instead of eyesores.;
, Use a steel wool brush to scrub away as much dirt, rust, and old paint as possible. Follow up by cleaning away any oil or grime with a wet rag.


Use a mild detergent and warm water. After wiping the pipe with a soapy rag, wipe it down again with a second rag soaked in clean water to rinse away any detergent residue.
Thoroughly dry the pipe with a dry rag before continuing. Leaving moisture on the pipe could cause it to rust and may prevent the paint from properly adhering to the surface.

, Clear the area of furniture. Cover the floor, counter, and all fixed appliances with plastic sheets to protect them from stray paint.


Make sure that all removable furniture is as far away as it needs to be to protect it. This may mean moving it to another room while you work on your pipes.
It's also a good idea to protect yourself, too. Wear clothes that you do not mind getting paint on. Consider wearing goggles if you have to paint a pipe on the ceiling since dripping paint could theoretically get into your eyes without protection.

, Select a rust-proof metal primer. Paint a smooth layer of primer over the pipe with a standard paintbrush.


Make sure that you select the right primer. Different primers are designed for use with different types of metal, so you'll need to know what your pipes are made from before you can purchase the right primer.
Wait for the primer to dry before continuing to the next step. Read the primer label to determine how long you'll need to wait.

, Using a clean paintbrush, apply an even, smooth layer of your chosen paint over the dry primer.


Make sure that the paint is formulated for use with the type of metal you'll be applying it over. It's also a good idea to use paint made by the same manufacturer that produced the primer, since doing so will ensure that the primer and paint will be compatible with one another.
Read the paint label to determine how much time needs to pass in between coats.

, Once the pipe is ready for another coat, paint another smooth coat over the first. Let it dry.


Usually, you will only need to apply two coats. If you decide to apply more, make sure that the proper amount of time passes in between each consecutive coat.
Once all of the coats are on, you'll need to let the paint dry for a longer period of time before touching the pipe or moving furniture back into the kitchen. In most cases, the paint should dry within 24 hours, but you should check the manufacturer's label for a more exact measurement of time.
After the final coat of paint dries, the project is complete.

Find or make the right type of desk or table.,
Find cabinets and organizers.,
Attach the cabinets to the desk.,
Add details and finishing touches.",How to Make a Kitchen Island2," For this style of kitchen island, you will need a desk or table which has two flat sides which act as the “legs”, similar to Ikea’s Malm desk. You can purchase a table like this from furniture stores or you can make one from two rectangles of sturdy wood, or thick plywood. They should be at least 2” thick.


The first rectangle will serve as the countertop and should be cut to the desired size. The second rectangle will be cut in half and used to form the legs of the table, shortened if they make the counter higher than desired.Join these together by cutting a 45° angle at the edge of both sides of the top and at one end of each of the two legs. You will then need to press these angles together, lining the inside of the joint with wood glue and screwing from the top of the legs into the center of the countertop at at least four points.
Once completed, you can paint or laminate the main section of the island as desired.

, Next, you will attach cabinets or organizers to the underside of the table in order to create interesting and usable space in your design. These will be chosen partially by the space (as the width of the island will determine the depth of any cabinets) and partially by your organizational needs.


You will need to be sure that they equal the length and width of the underside of the island. They also should be no taller than the underside.
Use a pair of upper cabinets with organizational shelves sandwiched between them to maximize usability with your island. It will be best if the cabinets are double-sided, so that some items can be accessed regardless of where you are in your kitchen.

, Attach these by screwing from the inside of the cabinets or shelves into whatever part of the main island they are touching, as well as each other if there is any wood thick enough.


Be sure to use only screws which go no further than halfway through the wood panel, as any further may split, warp, or puncture the outer surface.

, You can paint the under-counter storage if you want, either the same color as the main island or a contrasting color. You can also add different countertops if you wish, by tiling the wood, adding butcher’s block or a granite slab.

Find a dresser.,
Add legs or wheels.,
Replace the back, if necessary.,
Replace or cover the top.",How to Make a Kitchen Island3," Find a dresser that is suitable to make into a kitchen island. Overly long or very heavy dressers will make poor kitchen islands. Instead, look for something which is roughly the length and width of the area you want to occupy in your kitchen.


If you want the island to be a different color when it’s done, paint the dresser now as it will be more difficult to do once the top has been replaced.

, If the top of the dresser is too low, you can raise it to proper height by adding legs (if you want it stationary), wheels (if you want it mobile), or both (if you need more height than just wheels can provide). Be sure to factor in any changes you will be making to the countertop, as adding a thicker countertop will also add height.


How these legs and wheels are added will vary widely depending on the style of the dresser. Consult with a local expert for advice and be sure to follow any additional instructions included with the packaging of wheels or legs.

, If the back of the dresser is unsightly or damaged, replace it by cutting or having cut a custom sized piece of MDF or particleboard. Carefully remove the old one and then nail the new one into place.


You can add usability to the back by painting it with chalkboard paint to create a blackboard for writing grocery lists or as doodle space for the kids.
Another way to use the space would be to screw hooks or bars into and solid, stationary sections on the other side of the backing. These can be used to hang kitchen towels, paper towels, oven mitts, or kitchen tools.

, If you want to have a more food-prep friendly countertop, you can carefully remove the existing dresser top and replace it with a custom sized countertop of your preferred material. If the existing top is fairly rectangular with clean, straight edges, you should be able to tile it easily. What you do will largely depend on your skill, needs, and preferences.

Buy kitchen cabinets.,
Arrange cabinets.,
Add a countertop.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Kitchen Island4," Purchase any combination of kitchen cabinets which do not have a countertop already attached (as this will allow you to combine them into a single unit in your preferred arrangement by adding a single countertop). You can buy cabinets which resemble or are the same as your existing cabinets, or you can get cabinets which are different but match.


Pay attention to the back and sides of the cabinets. If they are unfinished, you will need to finish them yourself. Cover them with plywood or MDF, which can then be painted.

, Arrange the cabinets in the place and order that you would like them to go. You will likely want to join multiple pieces together, if using more than one unit. Do this by screwing from the inside of one cabinet and into the other. Try to do this in areas where the wood is thickest, such as at the frame.


You can have both cabinets facing the same direction, have them face in opposite directions, or (if the dimensions allow it) with one cabinet facing to the side. It will depend on the look you are going for and the way you intend to use the space.

, Once the cabinets are placed, make or purchase a countertop to cover all pieces. You can use a variety of materials, from butcher’s block to granite. Even a poured slab of concrete (stained, textured, or left alone) can make an excellent countertop. It will need to be sized according to the dimensions of the cabinet combinations you’ve chosen; just be sure to leave an extra two inches in both length and width, in order to create the lip of the counter.

, Add any finishing touches and detail you desire to personalize your new kitchen island. You can alter it to more visually match with your style, you kitchen or your home. You can also add storage solutions in order to maximize your counter space, making room for more appliances or more workspace to prepare amazing meals for your family.


You can paint the lower sections of your new island to contrast with the rest of your cabinets, or you can leave them as they are. Try experimenting with bright colors to add interest and pop to your kitchen. Try to mimic the existing bright colors in your kitchen, such as the colors on fruit or a prominently displayed vase.
Add organization elements to the sides or backs of the cabinets. You can mount a paper towel rack or hooks for dishtowels. You can place a magazine rack to store printed recipes and cooking magazines. You can even mount a caddy to store important cooking tools. Most of these will need to be screwed into the wood. Just be sure that when you mount these elements, you attach them to areas thick enough to support the screw. Examples would be the support for shelves or any part of the frame. You can also use strong glues, such as commercial products designed for hanging objects.

Assess the area.,
Measure the area.,
Measure and cut three battens.,
Secure the first two battens to the wall.,
Measure and cut the plywood.,
Attach one box side to the first batten.,
Place the third batten.,
Add the second box side.,
Paint as desired.,
Seal the seams.",How to Hide Pipes in the Kitchen2," This project works best for pipes lying in or near a corner. It also works well for pipes running along one wall seam.


You will need to box in the pipe from two sides, so there needs to be two nearby walls. Even if the pipe does not lie directly in a corner or along a wall seam, it should be relatively close.

, Use a combination square to determine the depth, width, and length of the pipe space you'll need to hide.Place the square portion of the measuring tool against one of the walls. Measure out from the wall to the exterior side of the pipe to determine the necessary depth. Repeat this procedure by measuring from exterior of the pipe to the other wall. This should give you the necessary width.
Make sure that you are measuring at the widest point of the pipe.
Measure the length of the pipe, as well, so you'll know how long your boxing will need to be.

, Cut three battens so that the length of each one matches the length of the pipe from wall to wall (or ceiling to floor).Note that if one or two of the battens will be placed over a wall with skirting on either end, you will need to make these battens a little shorter than the full length one. Measure the wall length again, this time working from skirt to skirt, to find the altered length.
These battens will be used to support the box sides. Use plywood roughly 2 inches (5 cm) wide by 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep to create each one.

, Screw the battens to the wall so that they surround either side of the pipe.


Measure out from the corner seam of the wall when placing these battens. The placement of one should match your previously measured pipe depth, and the placement of the other should match your previously measured pipe width.
Use screws and wall plugs that will work on the type of wall or ceiling you're dealing with. If you're fixing the battens onto masonry, you'll need to use 5.5 to 6 mm drill bits, 2 inch (5 cm) number 8 screws, and red wall plugs set to fit holes and screws of this size.
Space the screws apart by approximately 15.7 inches (40 cm). Drill a pilot hole into the wall, hammer in the wall plug, then gently twist the screw into the plug.

, Measure and cut two plywood boards. These will become the sides of your pipe boxing.


The length of each board needs to match the length of the pipe space and the length of the battens.
The width of one board must match the distance between the wall and the outside edge of one batten. The width of the other board must match the distance between the other wall and the outside edge of the other batten.

Note that these distances should also match your pipe width and depth dimensions from earlier, but it can be a good idea to measure the space again before cutting the plywood boards to size.



, Attach the edge of one box side to its corresponding wall batten using sturdy wood glue.


The plywood side should rest on the outside of the batten with the width side of the board sticking straight out from the wall. Make sure that the length of the board covers the length of the batten and the pipe.
After gluing the plywood side in place, further enforce the bond by inserting heavy-duty construction staples or nails into both the board and batten. Space the staples 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart.

, Use wood glue to attach the remaining third batten to the other end of the plywood box side.


Position this third batten so that it runs parallel to the first. It should be to the inside of the plywood box side and on the opposite side of the wall.
Reinforce the bond with wood staples or nails placed 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart.

, Place the second measured and cut plywood side so that it covers the remaining exposed side of the pipe.


One side of this piece of plywood should lie to the outside of the open batten. The other side of this piece should form a corner with the opposite piece of plywood (the one previously attached to the wall).
Attach the plywood to both connecting battens using both wood glue and nails or staples.

, If desired, you can minimize the appearance of the boxing by painting or staining it to match the color of the wall.


Before painting, remove furniture from the room and cover the floor and all fixed appliances with plastic sheets. Doing so should prevent paint from splattering onto other surfaces.

, After the paint dries, seal the seams with decorator's caulk or silicone. Squeeze a small, steady bead of caulk across each seam and let dry.


Sealing the seams will prevent unwanted moisture from getting into the pipe boxing. If moisture does get into the boxing, it could create mold or cause the wood to rot.
Once you seal the seams, the project is complete.

, Some discount sites will work with you. They'll pull things and send out samples.

Don't buy without seeing the tile in your home. Buy a few tiles in the big box stores to take home. Keep the receipt to return them.
Choose easy clean and easy to install.

, Here is where big mistakes happen. If you've chosen the wrong color tile, you are out of luck. Ditto for a pattern that makes you dizzy.

Key your color tile to what already exists in the kitchen. This is not the place to introduce a brand new big color into the mix. Take either photos or samples of cabinets and countertops to the store (or upload on a website to the consultant).
Stay in either warm or cool tones. If you don't know what that is, talk to the professionals.
Tile colors ends up being affected by the room's lighting and the other colors in the room. Yet another reason to take some samples home. Let's say you have white crown molding as trim, warm brown cabinets, warm oak floors, a warm but light beige in your counter. That's your palette. Stick with it. A tile should pick up at least one of those colors.
Some people think white looks clean; others dislike white as it shows dirt. Some people like ""neutrals"" (beiges); others like pure colors. Don't let the salesperson substitute his or her preferences onto you!

, Backsplashes are usually under cabinets. If your kitchen is already dark, don't put dark tiles in the backsplash. Use lighter colors. Look at the tile choices under your under-cabinet lighting. Old fluorescent lighting tends to be weird. If you are installing LED fixtures, look at the samples under LED lights., The finished color is a function of the colors in the tile and the grout. Don't forget to choose that color at the beginning!

Mastic holds the tiles to the wall; grout is the stuff between the tiles; its color is important. Grout comes is all sort of neutral colors but get the shade correct.
If you want grout to contrast, fine. But figure out whether your contrast color is right or wrong.It should pick out some existing color.
It's relatively easy to change grout colors with grout paint -- especially if you do it when the tile is still new. Otherwise, it becomes a hassle.

, You will need to determine how much tile you need for the backsplash, and so first you will need to calculate the wall space you have before purchasing the tile.

For a single section, multiply the width and height of the wall. This will provide you with the square footage. You will want to mark a centerline between your upper cabinets to center the tiles.
The square footage represents the amount of tile you will need. Calculate an additional 10 percent of tile so you can cover small gaps or replace any pieces that are damaged during installation.
If you have a section that doesn’t have equal proportions on the wall, you should multiply the width and height of each section and then add those totals together to get the total square footage. Again, remember to add 10 percent to the amount., Many people pick glazed ceramic tiles when making a backsplash, but there are a wide variety of options. You could hire a professional, but they often charge about $20 per square foot to install tile.These tiles usually cost on average about $5 to $10 per square foot, unless you choose designer tiles instead, which cost more. The cost for a do-it-yourself tile backsplash can run as little as $200.
You will need to decide whether to use border tiles as well as what are called decorative field tiles. Some tiles come with adhesive backs and some don’t. Slate tiles are less expensive. You can get these materials at home centers. Mosaic tile sheets are popular. You may want to seek professional help if you are using unique materials.The backsplash tiles can mirror your own artistic sensibilities. People make backsplashes out of marble tiles, metal, subway tiles, glass, pearl shell, and ceramic.Tile is the most popular with natural stone second.Some people use wallpaper as a backsplash., You will also need tile spacers, adhesive, grout, grout sealant, and tools such as a grout float and a trowel.

Tile spacers are necessary for laying tile. Place the tile spacers in between the tiles at each corner point.People generally use one of two kinds of mortar when making a backsplash: thinset, and mastic. For glass tiles, it's best to use a white, latex-additive thinset mortar.
Stone tiles usually require white thinset mortar. Use mastic for ceramic and some porcelain tiles. Thinset mortar can be used for most other tiles.
Buy a notched trowel that matches the size of your tiles. You will usually want a trowel with 1/4- or 3/8-inch notches. You will apply the mortar by using the trowel's flat side to spread it onto the wall.

, Before you can add the tile, you will need to clear the area in your kitchen to get ready for the project.

Remove all appliances and cookware from the countertop, as well as any decorations. If the stove is in the area, you should move it away from the wall a little bit, and disconnect it. Use tape to protect the edges of the backsplash area, and shut off any power in the area before you remove cover plates that might be in the backsplash area.
To turn off power to the kitchen, find the residential service panel, which is usually in the basement or garage. It might be in a closet or laundry area in an apartment or outside in warmer regions of the country. It's usually a gray box. Find the switch marked as kitchen, and switch it to the off position.
Now, put a piece of cardboard or craft paper on the countertop to protect it from any damage during the course of the project., The wall needs to be smooth and clean before you apply the tiles to the backsplash area.

Take some time to inspect the wall where you will be applying the tiles to spot any damages that exist. You should patch holes in the wall with spackling compound or joint compound and then sand the surface if you spot damaged areas.
Take mild detergent and water, and clean the walls. You could use dish detergent. Remember that some adhesives won’t adhere to grease.You can also clean walls with trisodium phosphate and water. Look for this cleaner in home project stores.
If you spot any oil or grease stains, clean those too. You can do so with a degreaser or a primer if a soft cloth with detergent doesn’t do the job.
Let the surface dry before you continue with installation.

, Figure out where the tile is going to go before you actually apply it to the kitchen wall. Sometimes, it works best to center your tile around a focal point like a faucet.

Mark the start and the end point for the tile so you know how much you are going to need and where you plan to put it. Lay out the tile on the floor or on a large table to make sure the layout works, then measure it to be sure it fits the dimensions on the wall. Use tile spacers to account for grout.
Put tile spacers in the corners of the tiles as you lay them to create even grout lines. Some smaller tiles have small protrusions called lugs that fit into the tiles next to them to create space for the grout. Grout is a mortar or paste used to fill the spaces between the tiles, giving it a finished look.
Start with the spot on the wall that you can most easily see. Then, move outward and upward from that point. Use a level or straight edge to make sure the tile isn’t crooked.
You might need to cut tiles if they won’t fit. A tile cutter will work for ceramic or porcelain tiles. Natural stone may require a wet saw. Be very careful when using any cutting instruments.

, Purchase powdered thin-set mortar for natural stone mosaic tile. You will want to get this ready next. If you have ceramic or porcelain tiles, you may purchase mastic adhesive instead.

The mortar package will instruct you on how much water to put in the bucket, in addition to the mortar powder. Mix it. Mastic adhesive is often already mixed by the manufacturer.
Let the mortar stand for about 5 to 10 more minutes, and then mix it again. Usually, you will only have a few hours to use the mortar after mixing it. Again, check the directions on the package.
There are some mortars that you use right away after mixing. Again check the package for instructions as it can vary by brand!

, Many people suggest mastic adhesive glue for ceramic or porcelain tiles, and mortar for natural stone or other tile backsplashes.Start spreading the mortar or mastic on the wall where you will place the tiles. You will want to begin with a 2-foot section. Spread the mortar in a thin layer by using a trowel. Press it at a 45 degree angle. This method will make the mortar fully adhere to the wall.
Now, use a notched edge of the trowel to add more mortar on it, and comb even ridges in one direction. Working in small sections helps prevent the mortar from drying as you apply the tile. Use the trowel to apply mastic in similar fashion.You will want to use the right trowel size. If you are using natural stone tile, you will want a notch trowel that is ¼ by ¼ inch in size. You may choose thinset/adhesive for glass tile instead or tile with adhesive on the backs.

, Place the tile along the wall. Follow the lines that you made before you put the mortar on the wall.

Rock the tile up and down slightly to help it move into place along the mortar. You may need to use a grout float to flatten the tile. You can purchase this simple tool in many home centers.
You are going to have to cut extra tile pieces if there is space left between the top tile row and kitchen cabinets. You don’t want the tiles to sit directly on the countertop. Leave a small gap that you will caulk later. Use plastic tile spacers to create even grout lines by placing them in the corners of the tiles..
If you are left with a gap that is less than an inch, you might want to use moulding to hide it rather than trying to cut tile to fit.

, You will want to make sure the mortar or mastic and the tile are completely dry before doing anything further to the wall.

It can take as long as 24 hours for backsplash tile to dry, depending on the type of mortar or mastic you use and the temperature inside your home.
You could use pre-sealer on natural stone. This will help the stone avoid staining.
Once dry, wipe the tiles clean with water. Use a soft cloth to do so. You want to clean the tiles in this manner before you move onto applying the grout.

, It’s time to complete the backsplash by applying grout to the tiles. Many people use poly-blend sanded grout for kitchen backsplashes.

You can use caulk or silicone sealant to fill any expansion gaps between the tiles and counter or cabinets. Use a grout float to fill the joints. Push the grout at a 45-degree angle with the grout float. Scrape away extra grout when the joints are filled. Hold the gloat a a nearly 90-degree angle to scrape it off.
Shape and firm up the grout by dragging in instrument across every joint. Use the edge of the grout float, a toothbrush handle end, or even a finger. Use a damp sponge to wipe away excess grout.
Fill a bucket with the amount of water recommended on the grout packaging. Add the grout powder and mix together. Use unsanded grout if the gaps are less than 1/8 of an inch.
Let the mixture stand for 5-10 minutes and then mix again. Apply the grout with a grout float tool at a 45-degree angle, working diagonally and wiping off any excess grout. Work in sections. The grout goes in between the tile.

, This is the final step in creating a tile backsplash. You will want to seal the tile so that it doesn’t easily stain.

Wait until the grout dries completely. This can take over a day and sometimes as much as three days.
Apply grout sealant. After the grout has dried, put sealant on the lines and joints. Some sealant comes in a spray-on bottle, and other sealant is applied with a sponge or brush.
Start at an end tile, and spread a uniform coating of sealant over all of the grout, including in the corners. Wipe away any excess sealant with a rag. Let the sealant dry for about an hour, and apply a second coat. Let that dry.
Put your appliances and cookware back on the counter. Turn the power in the kitchen back on.

You should also note whether people or pets often bump into a kitchen cabinet, before you choose that space.


If you don't have any kitchen cabinets that meet these specifications, consider installing an island in your kitchen. Half of the island can be used for food prep or cook book storage, while the other half can be dedicated to a wine rack.;
, People who drink chilled white wines regularly may want to choose a chilled wine rack. You must choose a model that is specified for under-counter use, because it will vent in the front, rather than in the back.

, These 2 shelf wine racks are metal. They can be ordered on several sites on the Internet and then installed easily under a wall cabinet or at the top inside a large floor cabinet.

, Measure the area so you can start to shop for wine racks.

, Websites like idealwinecoolers.com have many styles of wine coolers that match specific cabinetry. Compare your measurements to the appliances to find a good fit.

, If you want a wooden wine rack that matches your cabinets or counter, then hiring a professional to create a rack to your specifications is the best option. Call several woodworkers with information about the wood you would like, the measurements and the number of wine bottles you would like it to hold, and then compare quotes.


Cabinet makers are trained in doing semi-custom cabinetry. If you have purchased a rack or cooler and you want to incorporate it into the look of your kitchen, they may be able to make and install panels that match your kitchen counter or shelving.

, Look for models that can be mounted, so that you can fill in the entire cabinet space with racks. These racks are often made of wood or particle board, and you can buy as many racks as you need to fill the space.

, You can find wire wine racks that rest on the floor of your cabinet or are mounted from the top. Search for ""wine storage"" online, and take into account the weight of the bottles and sturdiness of your counter before installing a rack.

, If you are redoing your kitchen, you can choose stock or semi-custom kitchen cabinets from home improvement stores or cabinet makers that feature pre-made wine racks, vertical shelving and more. You can customize your kitchen with very little added cost by installing it as part of a new kitchen cabinet set.

Hire a professional excavator or buy professional equipment.,
Find someone willing to help you.,
Find a suitable location.",How to Build an Underground House1," You can call your state to check the zoning laws of your property to see if you are allowed to put a new building on your property. You don’t want the state to ruin the fun by fining you for your newly created underground house. Even if you’re underground you're not safe from the law.;
, More official business. You need to pre-mark the area on your property that you want to excavate with stakes and white paint. Then you call your state’s Dig Safe branch and describe the area that you plan to dig in. Hopefully they will grant you permission. You definitely have to do this to ensure that you’re not going to dig into a sewage system or something like that. , Hiring a professional to do it for you wouldn’t be the worst idea. Depending on the size of your house you probably are going to need to use heavy machinery, and if you have no experience with that hiring a professional is probably the way to go. Search for professional excavators on the internet or contact a local construction company. They should be able to quote you a cost and at the very least offer you some helpful tips. You may be able to negotiate a price to use their equipment if you can prove that you are trained to use it. , This isn’t a solo job even if you really want it to be. When you’re excavating or dealing with heavy materials you need someone to make sure that you are safe. You are going to be dealing with a lot of heavy materials and working in the earth and something could happen at any time. Make sure you have a partner.

, Look for a spot that is outside of your area’s 100-year flood plain and isn't near any steep slopes that might trigger a landslide. A large open space is probably best suited for an underground house, because tree roots can also cause issues during excavation. The odds are that you will be trying to build this house on your own property, so you probably don't have to worry too much but just be aware.


Generally you want to stay away from any large objects like trees, boulders, or multi-story buildings.
You also shouldn't place your house near any concentrations of fuel or any hazardous materials. "

Develop detailed structural plans.,
Design your house.,
Include an entrance and exit in your design.",How to Build an Underground House2," Work with an architect to design a scaled design and floor plan for your underground house. This plan should be complete with dimensions, details on the potential materials that will be used,

, As you design your house you should consider air and water filtration systems, potential light sources, and food storage space. Draw a model of your house to scale using the structural plans that you already created. Now draw in where all the installed appliances will go first, then the furniture, then anything else you would like to include in your plan. Be aware of the following constraints as well:


If you are going to be underground for very long periods of time you will need to have your water set up to some sort of renewing water source and you will also need a ton of space to keep the food you have fresh. This means many refrigerators and a reliable power generator.
A reliable air circulation and filtration system is also crucial to avoid getting carbon dioxide poisoning or other airborne illnesses.

, This can be as simple as a ladder with a hatch on the top or even a tunnel leading up and to the outside. The easiest option is buying a staircase. You can buy a staircase online and have it delivered to your house, so it doesn’t even need to be part of the construction if you don’t want. If you decide to use a ladder you may need to secure the ladder to the wall with metal supports. Buy U-shaped metal supports at a home improvement store and secure these into your wall over the steps of your ladder. This will keep it stable while you are climbing up and down. You can also buy airtight hatches to secure the top of your entrance. Once again it is important to make sure that your hatch is significantly wider and longer than the hole you wish to cover.

Develop a strategy to dig your hole.,
Investigate the conditions of your soil.,
Consider a cut and cover strategy.,
Save the excess soil.",How to Build an Underground House3," Remember to dig based on the excavation area that you received permission to dig in. If you dig outside of that you risk digging into something like a sewer line or a fiber optic cable. Also know what kind of soil you'll be excavating. If you're digging into bedrock you won't get very far.


You also should check your soil records at the town office before you start digging to see what you are going to be digging into and what kind of equipment you will need. Ask the clerk at the town office about your property and they will have the records available for you to see most of the time. If they don't, you might have to have someone come and survey your land.

, It’s incredibly important to know what kind of soil you are working with, and this will also inform your digging strategy. Have a professional come and survey your soil.

, Cut and cover works if you are digging in relatively soft soil. The idea is that you dig out an area, build a concrete structure inside of it, and then cover the hole thing up with dirt again. Obviously you want to keep your hatch or staircase exposed so that you can enter into your structure. However, if your soil will allow for it this is a good way to build a large framework for your home. , This is especially important if you plan to create a berm house. A berm house is a house that is covered by soil but still has windows and doorways to the outside. Your house will sit in a deep foundation and once you have completed the construction of the building you can push the dirt up the sides and on top of the house to create the berm look. This will require a reinforced roof.

The boards should be built according to the specifications of your foundation in your designed plan. , Remember to seal the footings to protect them from moisture. Use a high quality sealer. You can pour concrete either directly into trenches or into wood forms. , Start with the corners of the foundation and then build a plum and level wall connecting the two corners. Having something to connect the wall to on either side makes the process easier. It’s much easier to spot if the wall is out of alignment. Remove the flaws using hand trowels.

, You will want to use it on the ceiling too if you plan to cover your roof heavily with dirt and soil. Living underground will keep the temperatures relatively moderate, but the earth also puts a huge amount of pressure on the walls and ceiling of your house. . It’s also essential to hire a structural engineer to design earthquake resistant elements if you live in an earthquake prone area. , You can choose a material as simple as wood boards or something more complex, but sturdier, like brick or concrete. If you choose brick or concrete ensure that you building has strong structural supports.

, You will have to lay the brick yourself by buying brick and mortar and building a thick pillar up to the ceiling. A six brick base should provide a decent support. If your room is very large you will want to build a few supports. Scaffolding is something that you can buy at a home improvement store, but is more likely to bend and break. Take this step very seriously or you risk potential cave-ins.

, Set up these rooms in accordance with your design plans. Make sure that you leave space in the walls for any potential wiring that you’ll need to do.

, Even though you’re living underground you may need insulation. This will keep your heating and cooling costs down and make your energy use much more efficient. Wait until after you have completed the wiring before you install the insulation.

You'll be able to find a number of companies on the internet that can sell you pre-made houses in a variety of different styles. You can go pretty crazy here if you’re willing to spend a lot of money. Try to consider your price range and the amount of people that you plan to have living with you in this shelter.

, In most of these situations you have to buy the shelter outright, because generally the idea is that you’ll be holed up in the shelter once you have it. However, some of these companies offer financing. .

, You first need to pre -mark your excavation area with white paint or stakes. Then call your state excavation number to describe the exact area where you plane to excavate. You will not be allowed to dig outside of this area. In Massachusetts this number is 8-1-1, but it varies state by state. This is important to ensure that you don't dig into a buried sewage system or fiber optic cable.

, This is included in the price. Make sure there is a path for their truck to deliver your new house. You can’t have your dig site all the way out in the middle of the woods if there is no road to get there.The installation may take several days, so be aware of that.

,, This will help you to calculate the cost of a new outdoor kitchen.

,,, Patio pavers work very well as they are durable, gorgeous, and come in a variety of colors and textures.

, This is essential for designing an outdoor kitchen that is functional. Your island should include storage, a sink, and a built in refrigerator to keep things cold. You can have one built of wood but pavers will last longer with less maintenance.

, No outdoor kitchen is complete without an BBQ or grilling station. Use the same pavers as your kitchen island for a high-end, customized look.

, Make sure you can cook outdoors, regardless of the time of day. Have lighting installed so you can move around comfortably. Consider lighting in the flooring, overhead lights hung from a pergola, or wall sconces built into a privacy wall made of pavers.

, Make sure that your guests can join you in the kitchen space by providing seating. This can be at the kitchen island or in an outdoor dining room.

, You can have a gorgeous outdoor fireplace made of pavers. This can match the kitchen island and BBQ area for a cohesive design that is stunning and practical. A fireplace will add warmth and make it easier to enjoy your kitchen year round.

If you intend to move a lot, then a trailer-based home is probably a good choice.
If you think you'll maybe move once or twice, then you can use a bigger trailer base for your house a rent a truck to move it for you when the time comes.
Build onto the tiny house. You also have the option of building extensions to the main house, such as a deck or rooftop patio.
If you have a spot to build on, then you can do normal construction on a spot of land (this tends to be more expensive and permanent).;
, Sit down and make a list of all the things you want in your home. Of course, this is a tiny house, so you need to focus on the necessities, as there isn't any room for a lot of stuff. Examples of important basics for the house include:

One or more beds
Appliances such as the oven, fridge, stovetop, microwave, etc., remembering that all of these will likely be much smaller than those you'd have in a standard size house.
Washer-dryer combo instead of two different machines.

, Choose a location with accessibility to water and electricity. If this is not possible find a way to come up with alternatives. For example, many people prefer to use solar power and collect rain as part of the tiny house philosophy., As you do so, keep in mind the exact amount of space you have to work with. It will always be less than you expect, so don't be surprised if you have to let go of some dream ideas but see this as an opportunity to be inventive rather than giving up on everything.

Include plenty of storage space and clever ideas such as stairs that include storage underneath.
This step works best by making an electronic floor plan of the house, or you can also make a actual model by hand so that you get a good sense of how it will look in your hands.

, A key aspect of this step is to build the house around the appliances you want. Go online and find the appliances that you will buy and go to the specs of the product. There will be dimensions for you to include in your floor plan/model., These are appliances, labour, building materials and tools. Usually to build the house with all the desirable (kitchen, trailer, siding, etc.), an average cost is about $35,000 for a 24 ft trailer house. Keep in mind that the smaller the trailer, the cheaper the build. And, if you want fancier things and bigger size, the tiny house can cost up to $100,000., With the appliances that you have selected in your floor plans as a base, include how much you can spend immediately. Then work out how much you can spend over time (that is, how much you can deduct from your paycheck towards the build)., Then include the amount of labour that you can put in for things you can do yourself., plumber, electrician, builders)., Renting the tools when necessary is one way to go so you don't have to put too much money into tools that you will not use again. For some basic tools it might be a better idea to just buy and own them if you don't already have them.This list provides a rundown of the tools you'll likely need:Air compressor – Drives air powered tools like framing nailers and paint sprayers.
Caulking gun – Used to apply caulking and building adhesive.
Chalk line – Helps mark strait lines so that paneling, siding, and roofing stay in line.
Chisel – Used to finish cutting notches in wood.
Circular Saw – Handheld saw for cutting wood. Very versatile.
Clamps – Very useful when you need a second set of hands and none are available.
Crowbar – Good for amplifying elbow grease, and pulling nails.
Drill – Used for drilling holes and driving screws.
Dust Masks – Essential for protecting your lungs during dusty work.
Eye Protection – Essential for protecting your eyes during most cutting and other debris flinging work.
Framing nailer – Makes driving nails much easier.
Gloves – Essential for protecting your hands from splinters and abrasions.
Hacksaw – Used for cutting metal like pipes, nails, etc.
Hammer – Used for persuading lots of things on the job site, most commonly nails.
Impact driver – Like a drill, but drives screws better when the job is tough.
Level – Used to keep everything strait and level.
Miter saw – Used as a chop saw when many identical angered or strait cuts are needed.
Pliers – Used for pulling nails and most anything when your fingers aren’t tough enough.
Reciprocating Saw – Commonly used for demolition but also very handy for cutting nails and rough cuts on wood.
Rubber mallet – Ideal wen gentile persuasion is needed.
Socket wrench – Good for turning nuts in tight places, like when bolting your tiny house floor framing to the trailer.
Screwdrivers – Needed for turning screws and useful for opening paint cans.
Staple gun – Good for hanging vapor barriers, roofing felt, and can be used on house wrap.
Table saw – Ideal for making long strait cuts.
Tape measure – Used constantly for keeping everything accurate.
Tin snips – Used for cutting thin metal, like the aluminum flashing you’d use between your floor and trailer.
Toolbox – Helpful for keeping everything organized and transportable.
Utility knife – Used to cut thin material like roofing felt, house wrap, and vapor barrier.
Wire cutter – Used when wiring your tiny house.
Wrench – Necessary for turning nuts on bolts, like when connecting your tiny house to the trailer.

, A typical list of materials that you will need in your tiny house. The amount of each that you will need depends on your build, and the cost will therefore reflect what type of tiny house you're building. Here are standard materials needed:

Trailer (varies in the size and length
wood for floors, walls, ceiling, and interior structures
Installation for the walls, floor and ceiling (recommend Roxul - fire and water resistant)
Class D tires for the trailer
Typical house siding
Typical shingles for roof
Drywall
Doors and windows
Cabinets and storage closets (many can be built from reclaimed wood if feasible)
Toilet (composting, RV toilet, or a actual functioning toilet)
Shower (typically small standing shower is used, a small tub can be added with creativity)
Sinks (kitchen, and bathroom)
Counter-tops
Plenty of screws, braces, and nails
Pipes for plumbing and propane lines for heating and water lines
Electrical circuit wiring, outlets, switches, and breakers
Tyvek wrapping for protection (or similar suited to your area)
Heating system
Regular appliances as selected by you
Metal sheeting for flashing the trailer base (galvanized for durability).

, If solar panels are going to be added, then you'll need the following as well: A charge controller, deep cycle batteries, and inverter to store charge and convert from DC to AC power., This step is important to do properly or your house will be tilted., Anchor the frame to the trailer so that your house does not slide off the trailer during transport keep in mind the weight distribution so that your house does not tip over., This helps protect the home from rodents, water, and other elements from the bottom., Add the insulation (Roxul) for more protection.,, Leave room for the windows and doors, as well as putting in the studs, and weight barring headers.

The headers are one of the aspects that are against building code, but are necessary for a tiny house, as every wall is a weight bearing wall.
You must ensure that everything is perfectly squared.

, Do this before you put the walls up.

At this point you might want to move anything inside the house that will not fit through the door depending on the design.

, Then raise the walls (with help, for safety reasons). Make sure that the walls are perfectly squared with the floor and other walls.,, Apply a spring brace to secure the walls and make them perfectly straight while installing the rafter

Double check the distance between the walls at the top for a good cut.

, Ensure that the height is under 13.5 ft to stay street legal (this may vary between countries, so check with the road authorities first)., Cut out the boards and glue the truss edges. Use clips to secure the sheets of wood into place and secure with nail/screws,,,,, Begin applying flash tape to the window sills to prevent water and heat from entering., Then test the functionality., Leave the bottom unsealed for water drainage, just in case.

For the doors, do the same thing as windows and flash the doorway then start installing the door frame.

, This can be made or purchased.,, Paint both sides of the siding before putting up, to prevent rusting.,,, This is a common practice in a tiny house. It will also need a ladder or staircase to reach the loft area., Do not do this yourself unless you are a professional in these fields.

Make sure you instruct the professional on where you want your outlets, lights and sockets for your tiny house to accommodate the floor plan, such as gas lines for the propane to the stove/oven or water lines to the water heater and shower.
Put in the smoke and CO alarms at the same time.
Consider the power usage or your appliances and adjust accordingly.

, Make sure to put foam in the edges so that it is completely sealed.

Make sure that all materials are not affected by the foam, as some do react and that is not a good outcome.

, This includes the heater, shower, toilet, sink, and water heater (preferably tankless). The heater weight should be considered in conjunction with the weight of the tiny house as a whole, and a safety zone and materials placed around it., For example, you could use hardwood in the living area and light tiles in the kitchen and bathroom areas. Splashbacks can also be used.,, It is great if you can use recycled wood for these purposes. Include hookups and openings for the oven, fridge, and sink, etc., Install vents and the toilet., You may also realize other possible storage options, so remain flexible and open to relevant changes.,, Your tiny house is complete. Now you can move in and enjoy your own space."

Research cabinetry that matches your kitchen cabinets.,
Choose a desk that fits into your space and matches your décor.,
Consider modifying your space with special storage options.,
Buy a file cabinet and other desk accessories to compartmentalize your supplies.,
Choose a small chair with wheels.,
Partition your kitchen office.",How to Make an Office in your Kitchen2," One of the best ways to get a uniform look is to choose the same cabinets for your space. If you cannot find the same model, choose the same type of wood or color, so that it matches your décor.


Cabinetry comes in 3 types, stock, semi-custom and custom. Stock cabinets are those available to order in standard sizes, materials and colors. Semi-custom cabinets can be modified and personalized. Custom cabinets are designed and built by a carpenter according to your preferences. This is the most expensive type of cabinetry.

, Choose a desk that matches your kitchen counters or table. An excellent option is a modular desk, available from Ikea, the Container Store and a number of online outlets.


Modular desks are often sold in ""systems."" They can be adjusted to the size and shape of your space. You may or may not use all the pieces in the system, but you can connect drawers to the main desk shape and choose elements that extend out from the wall if you have the space.
Another great option is a roll-up desk. Unlike normal models, this traditional style of desk comes with a door that allows you to close it when not in use. It often contains cubbies in the center, and it reduces the amount of clutter associated with a home office.

, A kitchen office will not have as much space as a dedicated room; however, you can be creative with the kitchen area. Consider the following ideas:


Keep printers, scanners and other electronics in a closet. If you have extra space in a closet system, clear some room. Place the electronics inside and print your documents wirelessly.
Install pull-out shelves. Shelves that have runners give you easier access to the materials in the back. These can be installed in modular desk cabinets or in wall cabinets.
Use a kitchen island as extra storage. If you need more room to chop up ingredients for meals, buy a hollow island and use the interior space for books, files or other storage. Place something inside that you don't need to access regularly.

, It is more important to keep things tidy in a small office space, so create drawer and desk spaces where everything has a chosen space.

, Make sure the chair fits inside the empty center space of the desk. Picking a mobile chair allows you to move it when you need more space for company.

, If you place the office inside an empty closet, you can choose a chair that fits inside so that you can close the doors. If you have the office in an open space, then consider buying a screen or other partition to get some privacy for your work.

Make a plan.,
Decide what type of base you will use to support the floor of the first story.,
Prepare the foundation footings to be below the frost line in cold climates, and floor to be level, on an attractive slope or level ground (easier).,
Build a frame of timber or metal.,
Stay dry during construction by putting the roof on before going any further.,
Make straw bale walls, not using hay, but using straw.,
Plaster the walls.,
Put in the windows and doors.,
Apply breathable paints.",How to Build a Straw Bale House," How big? How many rooms? What services do you want? Where are the windows and doors going to go?


Draw up the floor plan. On your diagram, you should roughly sketch the room layouts and locate the drain lines precisely (for concrete slab) where the shower, bathtub and toilet drain connections will be (wood floors with a crawl space allows easier changes of such locations).






Each section of the exterior wall should be a multiple of the standard bale length you plan to use. This will allow you to minimize the number of bales that you cut and will also minimize waste.





;
, Typical choices are a concrete pad or a timber base consisting of a double outside band with center beam(s) supported by columns and connected by floor joists on 16"" centers. If you opt for the traditional wood frame, check your local building code for the dimensions of each frame element.

, Check your local building codes for the size and composition of exterior wall foundation. Fresh water plumbing, electrical wiring and natural gas pipes will be added above the slab, under timber floors, in walls or above ceilings.

, The frame transfers the load of the roof down on to the foundation and should be strong enough for this purpose. You can cut in 1X4 inch bracing ""straps"" (set in the thickness of the 1X4) into timber outer stud-walls (posts or pillars) diagonally from the corners near the floor into the top plate -- or 2X4 inch diagonal braces nailed or bolted between vertical elements -- to prevent lateral movement within the frame, and the base of each upright timber should be anchored well to the foundation. Cables may be stretched through the bales of the structure, if desired for stability, to share stresses of possible bulging or shifting of bales.

, Put the roof on before adding the wall bales because you don't want your bales to get soaked with rain, snow or ice.

, Straw is from harvested grain stalks (never use bales of grass). These need to remain dry, less than 20% moisture content, and tightly bound to prevent moist air (including fog) getting in before plastering. Both factors are important to prevent the rotting of the bales after construction. To build the wall, you start by sharpening some staves (inch thick willow stems) and then securing them vertically in the wood or concrete base (you will need to drill a hole, or perhaps poke them in when the concrete is still wet). Bales should then be further reinforced with ""U"" shaped willow stems that must be bent while the stems are green (or use another kind of straight staves, and bendable pipe for U shape ones).


Make U shaped staves: Select a one meter willow stave and mark the stave at 33 centimeter (13 in) from each end, take a big hammer and bash the green stave on these marks until the fibers of the wood are mashed, split and softened. These bashed areas are then bendable; bend the stave into U shape and then get to work. Each layer (or course) of bales are stacked up and pinning them until you have reached your desired height, during this process staves of willow should be driven down through alternate bails to fix it to the bail below. The U staves are use to attach between lined up blocks. This is especially important on the top course. When the desired height has been reached some kind of strap can be placed around the entire wall (top to bottom) to add further stability and strength, but not stressed extremely tightly.







, There are many types of soft plaster that can be used, some based on formulations of locally available materials. Choose the best one by balancing availability, cost and effectiveness for your climate. Apply with traditional plastering tools for a smooth finish or with your hands for a rustic finish. Make sure, though to cover every last bit of exposed straw: None should be showing, unplastered. Otherwise fire is more easily started, and dampness or vermin can get in.

, You should have left holes for these, bridged with lintels (horizontal headers which support the weight above each opening for a window or door). Install the window and door casings, securing them to framing posts or to plastered walls outfitted with staves.

, Look for mineral silicate paint that is free of artificial resins, petroleum solvents and biocides (poisons) but is weather and UV resistant. Applying breathable paints is no different than applying conventional paints, although you need to follow manufacturer guidance as products do vary somewhat. To prepare for painting, make sure that the walls are sound, clean, dry, and free of oils.


The exterior should be painted with breathable paint so that moisture can escape the walls. Paints are rated in Sd values: Paints with high Sd values have are detrimental to the underlying surface, as they do not allow it to breathe and dry out. Most non breathable paints will not disclose an Sd value as they can be much higher than 3. Paints with an Sd value less than 0.1 offer adequate breathability for most straw bale/plaster applications.

Climate. Special considerations must be made for building in flood, hurricane, intense heat, frigid cold, and other extreme weather and climatic conditions.

Ground stability. Houses built on shifting sand, mucky soil, or other unstable earth will likely fail over a short period of time unless they are built on special foundations or pilings.

Availability of utilities. If you intend to have electric power, potable water, telephone, and other conveniences, make sure these utility providers offer them at your location.

Community infrastructure. If you plan to raise children or have kids, make sure good quality schools are available. Check to see if you are in a police jurisdiction to protect you from crime, look at the distance you will have to travel to acquire basic commodities, and whether medical help is nearby.;
, This may be a hurdle, depending on the cost, and your available funds. Building a house is an expensive process, but purchasing suitable property is also a major investment just as important as homebuilding. Decide how you're going to pay for your building project going forward and start that process with the land.


Some home builders will elect to get a construction loan to purchase the land and secure funding for the building project. This requires that you enter into a contract with a builder or a contractor, and the loan must reference that builder's resume and serve as a contract between you and the builder, as well as a source of funding for the project. To do this, you'll need to wait until you've hired and vetted a builder before purchasing the land., This is not absolutely necessary, especially if you are building on a large parcel of land, but if there is any doubt about the property lines, have this done to assure you are not encroaching on a neighbor's property, or the city's. This will be useful as you move forward with the building process.

, On large parcels, especially, you will need to ascertain the route for a usable driveway if you depend on a car for transportation. Look at any low area that would become impassable in winter mud or heavy summer rain, how installing driveway will affect the landscape, and whether a driveway will be in conflict with underground utilities.


Pay particular attention to the way surface water will drain off the property. Every effort should be made so that water drains off and away from the driveway. This may require the placement of culverts or pipes under the driveway to avoid puddling along its sides.

, Architects and engineers have special training and years of experience in designing houses, and are necessary for most building and zoning jurisdiction code requirements. Regardless of whether you contract their services or elect to design your own, the house you build will be built for you, so you should be involved closely in the design process.


Before you hire or consult an architect, find out what management services the firm may or may not provide. Some architecture firms will help hire contractors they know and trust, as well as consult and inspect the contractor's work as it progresses, making necessary revisions and additions as the work progresses. This can be a significant headache relief in the process.Before building, you'll need to submit plans to the city or county building commission for approval. Unless you're an experienced architect, it'll be very difficult to produce the necessary to-scale production drawings and engineering specs necessary for approval. To save time, energy, and money, it's recommended that you consult a professional and work alongside them to design the home you want.

, The fun part of designing a home is imagining your new life in your new space. Spend some time researching pre-drawn floor plans for inspiration and consider using them as a guide for your own space. Home building guides are commonly available for free online.Give lots of thought to what kind of rooms you want, the number of bedrooms that will be necessary for your family, and what sort of a style you want in the rooms you'll be spending the most time in.



Bedrooms: For a family house where the possibility of additions exists, remember it is simpler to add a room during initial construction than to remodel or build an addition later. If you only need 2 bedrooms at present, an extra room might be used for an office, storage, or even left unfinished and unfurnished until such time as it is needed.

Bathrooms: In practical terms, one bathroom can suffice in almost any circumstances, but if the house is for multiple people, two makes life much easier. Having two or more bathrooms will also increase the resale value in the convenience minded home buyer's mind.

Special function rooms: Consider if your lifestyle requires rooms suitable for special functions, such as formal dining, office space, a den, or a play room.

, For family life, having a laundry room, and possibly even a garage can be a real help in managing day to day chores. Planning out the necessary house-running spaces is a critical part of the design process. It's also important to design them to be as easy-to-wire and outfit with plumbing as possible, making it important to consult an architectural engineer when designing the home. Carefully design your:


Kitchen
Garage
Laundry room
Storage areas

, Part aesthetics and part energy-efficiency, designing your home with an eye toward sunlight will ensure that your home stays full of warm radiant light when it needs it the most. If you are building a home with large windows in a living room, consider facing these toward the most appealing view and at an angle that maximizes the natural lighting when you'll want it most.Kitchens may benefit the most from exterior light, so think about what time a ray of sunshine in the kitchen will offer the best results. Late afternoon may be cooking and dish washing time, so it may be best to orient the kitchen towards the west to take advantage. Larger windows on the north/south face of your house will also help heat the house through solar gain in colder climates.
If you live on the northern hemisphere, build your windows facing the south. If you live on the southern hemisphere, build your windows facing the north.

, Be aware of how surface water (rain, snow melt, drainage from seasonal springs) moves across the building site. It is critical to keep water away from your home, especially in colder climates. Freezing pipes and foundation damage can result from a failure to plan at this stage. You want to keep your basement dry and lessen the chance that you will have damp wood, which invites termites in any climate. Simple swales or grassy ditches will go a long way in controlling surface water drainage.

, If you haven't already started this process when securing the land, you'll need to figure out a way to fund the project and a construction loan is the most recommended method of doing so. Apply for a construction loan by filling out a loan application, called a 1003, and submitting it to a loan officer along with a credit report.The completed loan application will need to include information like:


The type of loan requested
The amount of money requested
Your current living situation
Your social security number
W-2 info

, To engage in a homebuilding project, you'll need three types of construction-related insurance, some of which may be provided by the builder, some of which won't, depending on the state you live in and the nature of the contract you've signed. Typically, it's required that you provide:



Course of Construction Insurance to cover against unforeseen loss including damages from fire, accident, vandalism and malicious mischief.

General Liability Insurance is sometimes provided by the builder and sometimes not. It is a comprehensive liability coverage against accident on the workplace. You should only hire builders who provide this insurance themselves, as it can be quite expensive and could be indicative of shoddy workmanship if a builder doesn't provide it.

Workman's Compensation Insurance is necessary if your builder hires their own workers. If the work is subcontracted (a common practice) you'll need to provide workman's comp and the builder must write a letter acknowledging that they do not have employees and will not provide compensation.

, A building permit is a basic requirement in many areas, particularly for permanent construction. To obtain this, you'll need to provide detailed architectural diagrams, engineering load specs, and other materials to your state's Department of Housing. It's likely you'll also need the following to comply with local codes and zoning requirements by obtaining:


A septic tank permit
An electrical permit
A plumbing permit
A mechanical (HVAC, or air conditioning) permit
You may also find you are required to apply for and receive an environmental and/or impact permit. Having the house location marked prior to obtaining your permits will help to work details out in the environmental permitting process.

, This is the breakdown of each particular cost of construction of the home. The foundation, lumber, framing, plumbing, heating, electrical, painting, and builder's profit, etc. When you hire a builder, they will usually complete this form to show you exactly what it will cost to build your new home.


Price building materials in the area. How much is the cost of wood in the prospective area? Labor? Vinyl? It's helpful to give some though to how much the process will end up costing, aside from the land purchase itself. Try to get a rough estimate of how much it'll cost to build the kind of house you want to build at the location you're considering.

, Building a house involves several specific trades to ensure quality work, so it is usually better to have trained craftsmen perform things you're unable to do at an expert-level. You can probably paint the house and put up drywall yourself, but maybe you want to hire those jobs out. Try to find an economic and practical balance between doing projects yourself to save money and hiring out more intricate and difficult work. Consider hiring out:



Site workers to clear and grade the land, prepping it for building

Bricklayers to lay the foundation

Framers to perform rough carpentry, frame up the walls, and install the trusses or stick-framed rafters

Roofers to install the roof and insulate the house

Electricians, plumbers, and HVAC workers to do the difficult interior work of outfitting the home for living

Trim and finish carpenters for interior design work

Flooring installers to lay the carpet, hardwood, or tile

, Everything will be made easier if you hire an experienced builder to oversee the project. You won't need to worry about doing everything yourself, hiring out particular tasks, and securing the permits yourself. It's also much easier to secure a construction loan if you're working with an experienced builder who can include a statement, resume, banking and experience references, a line item cost breakdown of expected costs (an ECB), a materials list, and a construction contract.The contract should include:


The individual responsibilities of each party
The expected date of the beginning and ending of the project
The payment expected by the builder
A completed Estimated Cost Breakdown (ECB), signed and dated
Provisions for changes

, After a site crew excavates the plot, you'll begin the work of laying the foundation. The type and design of the foundation will depend upon the size of your house, the ground in which its laid, local building codes, and whether or not your home will have a basement. The most recommended and strongest type of foundation is concrete block.


The excavation crew should first survey and stake the dimensions of the foundation and excavate it to the desired depth, then smooth it out to a workable surface, sometimes overlaying dirt or gravel to build upon., These are used to distribute the weight evenly and should be somewhat wider than the foundation walls, forming the perimeter of the home.


Build the form work and fill in with concrete. The form work is basically a mold for concrete, used to pour into and remove after the concrete has set. Alternatively, a block foundation can be laid which won't be removed, in which case you'll inlay rebar into the block and fill in the gaps in the block with concrete.
The thickness of the foundation should be determined carefully by a structural engineer, taking into consideration the height of the wall and the load it will be required to bear, both in terms of the building itself as well as the forces of gravity, wind, and earth that affect the structure.

, This means putting either batter boards or corner stakes at each corner of the house foundation to level and square up the foundation. Use a transit or building level to make sure the building lines are level and square, and check by measuring corner to corner, diagonally, to make sure the walls and corners are square.

, There are two common floor types, called ""slab on grade"" or ""pier and beam/joist"" floors. Before pouring the slab floor, you need to make sure you've installed rough plumbing lines so that they are accurately placed. After the slab is poured, it'll be too late to adjust.


For a slab-on-grade floor, form up the footing to the proper specs and lay rebar. Generally, these floors are made on concrete block foundations. After installing your plumbing rough-ins, backfill around the foundation with dirt and gravel, compacting it appropriately. At this point, you may also want to pre-treat for termites and install moisture barrier.
For off-grade or above-grade floors, lay out and install wooden flooring piers and install your floor joist framing system to the proper specifications. Install subfloor/finish floor decking.

, You will need to lay out the wall lines on the floor, beginning at one corner, marking your bottom plate (called the rat sill) to attach to anchor bolts.


As you work, mark the location of doors, windows, and interior wall corners on the sill. Be sure to use special metal connectors/straps at the floor and tops of walls as required by code for storm and earthquake proofing.Use tees at wall intersections, substantial headers for openings in load bearing walls, and allow space at each rough opening for the feature to be installed.

, Install sheathing if required. Otherwise, use sheet metal straps to diagonally brace all exterior wall corners. Make sure all studs (vertical framing members, usually 2 inch by 4 inch (5 cm by 10 cm) nominal lumber, graded standard or better) are securely nailed in place, straight and square to the wall line.

, You may want to stick frame your roof, cutting and installing rafters and ceiling joists yourself (especially if you want a usable attic space). Prefab trusses, however, are engineered with lighter, smaller lumber for maximum strength. There are some trusses for attics with high-pitched roofs and dormers, as well as more traditional roofs. Research your options and choose something that works well for your home.

, Generally, this means 24 inches (61.0 cm) apart from one another, sometimes 16 inches (40.6 cm) for stick-bracing structures. Attach hurricane clips or other connectors to secure them, plumb the center of each truss, and temporarily support them with a rat run bracing near the peak.


Install diagonal gable bracing for a roof with gable ends to prevent the roof frame from leaning when you install the roof decking. For a hip roof, install king rafters and hip rafters, being careful to keep the adjacent plane of the roof consistent and straight., Build outlookers to support the gable overhang and gable facia boards, if used. Deck the trusses or rafters with plywood, oriented strand lumber, or nominal lumber such as 1 x 6 inch (2.5 cm x 15 cm) tongue and groove boards.


In areas where high winds or snow-loading (accumulation) is possible, make sure the roof decking is secured and structurally able to withstand these severe forces and conditions. Use appropriate bracing and fasteners for this scope of work.

, To make sure the elements don't set you back as you're working, it's important to install a moisture barrier on your roof even before it's completed. Use 15 or 30 pound (6.8 or 13.8 kg) roofing felt tar paper and simplex nails, roofing tacks, or plastic capped felting tacks to secure it. Begin felting the decking at the lower edge, allowing it to hang over slightly, and overlap subsequent layers to keep water from getting under this moisture barrier.

, Many locations require some type of metal flashing to prevent water from penetrating the edges and the gables, but you may be able to seal them sufficiently with caulking if it is permitted and you are able.

, You may choose painted sheet metal panels, rolled steel formed to lengths needed on site, or shingles, terra cotta tiles, or other materials, depending on your preference, costs, and products available at your location. Consider ridge vents, attic exhaust fans, vented dormers, and other architectural details which can increase the comfort of your house while decreasing cooling costs in hot climates.

, These can be capped off to trim out after the walls are finished, especially if the local codes require pressure testing before finishing may be done.

, Stub out your ductwork for return air and supply air registers. Insulate the ductwork if it is not pre-insulated, and seal all joints. Fasten ductwork as needed to prevent movement and ensure the your conduits are flush.

, Most likely, there will be electrical outlets, light fixtures, and special wiring required for large appliances like water heaters, stoves, and air conditioning that will be necessary to do as soon as possible. Install the main electrical panel box, and any sub-panels your design requires, and install wiring from these to each device.


Commonly, #12 Romex cable is used for ordinary lighting and outlet circuits, and nail-in electrical boxes are attached to the wall studs, with the front edge protruding to allow for the finished wall material to be flush.

, Insulate walls where it is required. Depending on the climate, you will want to get location-specific guidelines for this area of work, as warmer climates will use substantially less insulation in the walls than warmer areas. Insulate the spaces between ceiling joists and walls.Walls are usually insulated with a minimum R-value of 13, and ceilings with a minimum of 19, but as much as 30, or even more for lowering fuel and utility usage.

, Gypsum wallboard made of drywall or sheetrock is a common material used for this application, but there are other products including acoustical ceiling tiles, beaded plywood paneling (to simulate planking), and even natural wood lumber that are commonly used for creating solid ceilings.

, Install the bathtub, shower enclosure, and any other large plumbing fixtures which will interface with finished walls. Make sure plumbing rough-ins are correctly located, and pipes are protected and securely anchored.

, Traditionally, builders will use gypsum wallboard, wood, or masonite paneling for this purpose. Panels are generally jacked 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) above the floor to avoid moisture from floor spills and regular mopping when you clean the house. There are many interior wall products available, so the installation process will depend on the material used. Apply finish to gypsum wallboard, taping and skimming/floating all joints to an acceptable level of finish. Finish/texture any ceilings during this step if applicable.

, Put up any trim you are using for baseboards, crown mouldings, and corners, and install your interior doors and jambs. If you are using natural wood trim and mouldings, you will want to paint the walls prior to this step. Pre-finishing the trim before installing will make the final finish easier, but any nail-holes will probably still need attention after installation.

, Most likely, you will want to prime wallboard, then apply a finish coat. Use a paint roller where possible, cutting-in with brushes around appurtenances and in corners.


Be sure to trim out the electrical devices, install lights and other fixtures, and install breakers in panel boxes if they were not pre-installed.

, You will probably need at least basic kitchen storage cabinets and a bathroom vanity cabinet for a sink, other cabinets may include a bar, upper storage cabinets, and lower units with drawers for kitchen utensils and supplies.

, Note that for carpet floors, base boards are installed prior to flooring, leaving 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) for the carpet to tuck underneath it. For hardwood or composite floors, this trim is installed after the floor is finished.

, To start checking to make sure everything is working appropriately, activate the water and electricity to start experimenting with your handiwork. Adjust the jobs as necessary and work on finishing the house to a state at which you'll want to move in and start enjoying your new home.

Verify the construction date.,
Check the home's floor plan, footprint (exterior dimensions) and room size, using a field guide to Sears Homes, such as ""Finding The Houses That Sears Built"" (2004, Gentle Beam Publications) or ""Houses By Mail"" (1986).,
Make note of characteristic column arrangement on front porch and five-piece eave brackets.,
Check for a square block on molding joints at staircase landings, where moldings meet at odd angles.,
Look for stamped lumber on the exposed beams/joists/rafters in the basement, crawl space or attic.,
Look for shipping labels.,
Visit the courthouse and inspect old building permits and grantor records.,
Inspect plumbing fixtures for marks, such as ""R"" or ""SR"".,
Look for markings on back of sheetrock.",How to Identify a Sears Kit Home," If the home was built between 1908 - 1940, it could be a Sears Home.;
, Pay special attention to the placement of windows and doors, chimneys, bathroom and kitchen vents, etc. The home's footprint should be a perfect match to the Sears Home. Even a few inches off is a deal killer. Individual rooms should also be a spot-on match to the floorplan shown in the field guide. This is a very important point. However, ""reversed floor plans"" were an option that Sears offered their homebuyers, so the home may be a mirror image of the floorplan shown in the field guide.

, About two dozen of Sears most popular house designs had a unique column arrangement on the front porch (see photo). Five-piece eave brackets (the diagonal support brace between the roof line and the exterior wall) might also be a sign that you have a Sears Home.

, While framing members were pre-cut, some of the moldings and baseboard trim were not pre-cut (due to variances in plaster thickness). To simplify construction, Sears homes often have a block at the point where complex joints meet. This probably made construction much easier for the novice home builder.

, The lumber was marked on the tall side of the lumber and can be found two - ten inches from the end of the framing member. If you can't access attics or basements, you might be able to see marked lumber by opening up the bathtub's plumbing access door. However, not all Sears Homes had marked lumber!

, Shipping labels can be found on the back of millwork and mouldings; these labels can also be found in various places in the basement, such as under a staircase. On the shipping label, you might see an address, such as ""925 Homan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois."" This was Sears headquarters in the early 1900s. Or, it might read, ""Sears Roebuck, Chicago, Illinois."" Also look for stamps or marks, showing that the millwork was shipped from Norwood Sash and Door (Ohio), which was a supplier of Sears millwork.

, From 1911 to 1933, Sears offered home mortgages. Check grantor records from 1915 - 1940. Sears stopped offering mortgages in 1933, but when a mortgage was paid in full, the mortgage was released, so you're going to look for that document, too. Another thing to look for is original building permits. Some locales retain these aged documents. On the building permit, one line should state, ""architect's name."" This is where the name ""Sears Roebuck"" may appear.

, Plumbing, electrical and heating equipment was not included in the basic kit home but could be purchased separately. This enabled customers to choose ""good, better or best"" quality. From the late 1920s to 1940, Sears plumbing fixtures sometimes were stamped with an ""R"" or ""SR."" On pedestal sinks (bathroom) and kitchen sinks, the mark is on the underside, near the front. On bathtubs, it can be found in the lower corner, on the side furthest from the tub spout.

, Another clue suggesting that you may have a Sears Home is the presence of Goodwall Sheet Plaster (sheetrock). Each 4' by 4' sheet bore the stamp ""Goodwall"" on the backside.

, Compare their reliability, time-management, work ethics and anything else that your referrers mention when suggesting a contractor.

, Allow them all to quote an estimated cost for the job and time frame, and have them include a list of materials that they would use. Review all the responses.

, Determine what you feel is appropriate for your project, and remember that plumbing projects should be constructed with quality materials. Anything less could result in more expensive repairs in the near future.

, Note that the least expensive quote is not always the best. Consider the pricing next to the materials that the plumber needs and determine which plumber is offering the best deal. Confirm that the quote that is presented to you includes clean-up.

, Those who have been established for many years are possibly more trustworthy. The length of their existence is usually an indication that they are established and will likely be around for years to come.

, Make sure that they also hold both liability insurance and workers' compensation.

Obtain a building permit.,
Create a timeline.,
Determine whether or not to hire professionals.",How to Build a Log House1," Building a log cabin can be costly. The cost of the land, the cost of supplies and the cost of labor are all factors you will need to consider when estimating the cost of your new home. You have a number of options when it comes to financing your home, including savings, mortgage loans and construction loans. Talk to a mortgage broker to discuss which option works best for you.



Mortgage loans. The most common type of loan is the closed-end, fixed-rate mortgage. These loans come on a variety of terms, but the most common is a 30-year term.

Construction loans. This is a good option when it comes to building a log cabin. A construction loan acts like a credit line. You draw as you need and pay interest only on what you draw. You don’t have to use it at all and can roll over or convert to a typical mortgage loan when the house is completed if you like.

Savings. If you prefer not to take out a loan, you can pay your whole project with cash, provided you have enough. You will give up significant tax benefits and tie up your money at a reasonably poor return, but it can be done.

How much should you borrow? The answer is plenty. Running out of money is the worst thing that can happen during construction. Despite your best budget estimates, it is impossible to know the exact cost of your log home until it has been built.

What will the banks look for? Banks are essentially looking for two things. First, they want to know that the home will be sufficient collateral to secure the money they are loaning. This means they want to make sure the house will be built within the budget and will be a marketable house when it is finished. The second thing banks want to know is your ability to repay the loan. When the banks evaluate you, they look at three basic areas: credit, liquidity and income.;
, It's important to do your homework before deciding what land to build your cabin on. Real estate agents and developers can help you to find a suitable lot. If you own land already, the first thing you need to do is make sure that it's suitable for building. Factors such as slope, soil conditions, accessibility, zoning and use of surrounding properties all play a part in determining whether a lot is suitable for building.You will need to contact local soil engineers and have them do a soil analysis. This will indicate whether water is readily available and if it's of good quality.Your potential building site will also need to pass a percolation test - which determines whether the land will soak up waste water from a septic system., Some people have a clear idea of what they want their log cabin to look like. Other may have a list of priorities but are flexible when it comes to a floor plan. You can choose an existing plan from a producer's list of designs, or you can work an independent designer or architect to come up with an individual blueprint.Keep in mind that the design and dimensions of your home will depend on the amount of money you are willing to spend and the quality of the materials you intend to use. A larger home will raise the cost of labor, supplies and building permits.
Your chosen log style will also help to narrow down the design options. Certain log styles are only suitable for use in specific building designs.

, Submit your plans to the local permit office for approval. This is necessary to obtain the building permit required before you can start construction. You will also be need to find out what building codes you log home needs to adhere to. These can vary from state to state.

, How long it takes to build your log home will depend entirely on what type of house you are building. If you are building a custom, traditionally built log home, you are likely looking at 1-2 years from beginning to end. If you are building a modular or prefab kit home from a stock plan, the project can be completed in as little as six months.


Factors such as whether you are planning on building the cabin yourself or hiring a team of professionals, will also significantly influence building time.
Log homes are just as susceptible to delays, such as those caused by adverse weather conditions or poor workmanship, as any other building projects. Try to allocate some time to unforeseen delays in your schedule.Avoid deviating from your blueprints. Be aware that if you make any last minute changes, even small ones, you can create a domino effect of delays which can throw your building project completely off target., Deciding whether to build your log home yourself or to have it built professionally is a big decision. Hiring a professional to build your log house is the quickest, most hassle-free option, since he will have the skills, contacts and equipment to complete the job in half the time it would take someone with little to no experience.However, if you're not afraid of some hard work and a longer timeline, nothing beats the sense of pride and satisfaction gained from building your own home. At the end of the day it just comes down to personal preference.

Get inspired.,
Visit your favorite neighborhoods.,
Attend open houses.,
Take photographs.,
Get organized.,
Paint the big picture.,
Find a location.",How to Design Your Own Home1," Before you draw a single line, consult an architect, or buy that cool new software application that will do it all, consider your dreams. At the very beginning of this process, it's not about board feet or setbacks or even floor plans. It's about how you define your desires. Much of this you will already know—it's your dream, after all!;
, There is a reason they are your favorites, and it's most likely because you love the homes there. Don't consider price or practicality—yet. What you are looking for is what inspires you.

, Look for homes for sale in the neighborhoods you love, and make weekend open houses a regular outing during this phase. Each of those will have features that inspire you, and features that will leave you unmoved. Make note of each of those: it's just as important to know what you either don't care about, or actively dislike.

, Shoot every angle of a building you like, inside and out. You'll find more detail in the photos than you saw in person, and after visiting dozens of houses, they'll be a great way to recall that thing you loved right at the beginning.

, Dreaming is good, and it's vital to have a vision for what you want to achieve, but achieving it will be much more difficult if you are constantly looking for that scrap of paper you thought you left over there.


Get a sturdy, cloth-bound graph-ruled notebook (often called a ""computation book""), and keep it with you until your home is finished. Its numbered, graph-ruled pages will help you keep your thoughts organized and your sketches neat. You can use it to tape or paste in photos, list quotes, contractors, numbers, and anything else associated with the project.
Dedicate a couple of pages right up front to things that your house must have—whether it be 3 bathrooms or bamboo flooring, these are the things you require in your home.
Dedicate another page or two to list of every feature and desire you've culled from your various resources, and call this your ""Wish List."" This could be anything from a particular shape of molding to an Italian tile bathroom.

, Now that you are getting specific about what you love and what you desire, it's time to focus.


Will you prefer urban or rural living?
Do your needs put you in expansive home with room for the kids to play and the dogs to run, or a cozy bungalow for two?
Do you favor clean, modern lines or detailed, hand-built craftsmanship?
Are you happy with standard construction techniques, or are you considering sustainable, LEED-certified design?
Perhaps the most important of all considerations, what is your budget?
These questions will help guide you as you begin to focus your vision into actionable steps.
The more information that you can provide to your architect or builder about the details of your vision, the more likely you will not only get the design of your dreams, you'll stay on budget as well.

, This is where the rubber hits the road...or perhaps more appropriately, where the shovel hits the dirt. Before you can really dig into designing your dream home, you'll need to know what you're building on.


The landscape matters. building on a hill has a different set of requirements and design challenges than building on flat ground.
A heavily-wooded area may makes a big difference when it comes to windows and lighting, not to mention solar panels or other energy considerations.
Lots nearer freeways or other noise-producing areas will need more attention to acoustics than isolated rural locations.
Access to utilities and services vary by location. Make sure your chosen location includes those things we generally take for granted.
Zoning can make the difference between a dream home realized, or a house full of compromises.
Enlist the help of a real estate professional who can help you assess your property choices from an objective point of view.

Research and choose a producer.,
Research and choose a builder.,
Sign a contract.",How to Build a Log House2," The producer supplies the necessary materials for building your log home. You can source a producer by looking at different company's plan books, which will give you an idea of the type of log homes that they have produced previously. Otherwise, you can stop in at a model log home, and if you're impressed with the style and layout, you can hire the same company to produce yours. Make sure that you have an open line of communication with your chosen producers - they should listen to your ideas and always keep you in the loop.


You can do a background check on possible producers by researching previous log homes they've built and getting references from their customers.You can also check with the Better Business Bureau, the state attorney general's office or the Log Homes Council., Carefully consider your options when it comes to choosing a builder. There are many on the market, and their quality and service vary considerably.


Besides finding a builder you can communicate well with and painstakingly checking references with past customers, you also should visit finished homes to personally inspect the builder’s work.
Keep in mind that it usually takes several years for a log home to completely settle and expose any construction defects. A 3- to 5-year-old home probably is the best example of a builder’s art.Before selecting your builder, you also should check with the local contractor’s board or similar state or regional authority, including your state’s attorney general’s office, to see if the builder has been involved with litigation in the past.It’s wise to choose a builder who is familiar with your local building codes and the environment of your site.
Make sure your builder is licensed and bonded, otherwise if you run into problems you could have little legal recourse.

, You will need to negotiate with your builder or building company about items such as the price of their services, the design of your home, and the estimated time frame for completing the project. Once both parties have come to an agreement, the terms will be laid out in a contract which you will both be required to sign.

Determine what you need.,
Source the lumber.,
Prep the logs.",How to Build a Log House3," Aside from lumber, there are a significant number of tools and materials you will need to build your log house. You will need specialized tools for handling wood, such as a chainsaw, chisel, planer, beam saw, drill and tenon cutter. You will need concrete, stones and mortar for the foundations, along with insulation materials and, of course, windows, doors and roof materials.

, A log cabin can be made from virtually any group of tall trees. However, a log cabin that lasts must be made from a narrow selection of wood types that have the characteristics needed to craft a sound, visually appealing structure that will retain its strength, value and appearance for decades and beyond. Common examples of trees types used in building log cabins include cypress, Douglas fir, white pine and yellow pine.


If you are gathering the lumber yourself, choose trees that are of the length and diameter that will suit your needs. Think in terms of cutting a matched set of logs with the same mid-point diameter.
House logs are best cut in winter, when the sap is down and the logs can be skidded over the snow with minimum damage to the logs and the environment.
Choose your logs selectively, not cutting too many trees in the same space, the trees left behind will benefit from having more light and space to grow in.
Alternatively, you can purchase lumber from a log home producer. It is possible to buy lumber precut, which minimizes and often eliminates the work you will have to do to prepare the logs.

, Logs will need to be debarked and treated with a preservative treatment to prevent deterioration by insects, molds, mildew and fungus attacks. Consider whether you want to build your home with green logs (logs with a high moisture content) or dried logs.


If you choose to use dried logs you will need to stack your freshly cut lumber to season.
If you are happy to use green logs you will need to account for the lumber ""settling"" over the first few years.

Lay the foundation.,
Build the walls.,
Install your doors and windows.,
Put the roof on.",How to Build a Log House4," The foundation types for a log house are pretty much the the same as foundations for any structure of comparable size and weight. The difference comes in the weight of the walls, and the means of attaching the first round of logs to the foundation. Some of your options include:



The pier or stilt method. This is a popular and relatively inexpensive option, however the sub-floor will require extra insulation to keep your feet toasty in the winter. This type of foundation is also not as stable as some other options, which can be a downside if the log house is located in an area prone to storms or tornadoes.

The pre-cast panel system. This is a newer type of foundation which is becoming increasingly popular due to its fast installation and the fact that it does not require a footing.

The hollow foam block. This type of foundation consists of stacked, interlocking Styrofoam blocks. It can be built very quickly and is quite stable due to reinforcement bars which are placed between the blocks.

, Raising the cabin walls can be tricky. You must carefully align the logs so that they stack straight upwards. Since you are working with a natural material, some of the logs will be curved. The overall objective is to have the average center of all the logs bear down on the center line of the wall, which in turn bears on the centerline of the foundation.

, Windows and doors in a log home should be located with consideration for solar aspect, prevailing winter winds, roof avalanche potential, and the structural elements of log construction. Face the majority of windows south for natural light and passive solar heat.

, There are many ways to put a roof on your log creation to shelter it from the elements. The classic log house had a low-pitched roof with generous eave and gable end overhangs.

Consult a professional architect.,
Sketch out a rough floor plan.,
Create a floor plan.,
Delegate.",How to Design Your Own Home2," Designing a home should be a project that will give you years of fulfillment when your dream is realized. The best way to make sure this happens most successfully (and most cost effectively) is to bring an architect into the actual design process. Your part of the design is knowing what you want. The architect's part is helping you make your design goals work, and steering you around design traps.

, This will help you take your ideas from concept to concrete. For (very simple) example, let's say you want 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, an open kitchen and a ""great room,"" for both dining and entertainment.


Start by blocking out basic areas—for example, on the right side of the house, 2 bedrooms on one side of a hallway, with an adjoining bath, and the 3rd bedroom on the other side, with a master bath. In the middle, the entry way opening onto the great room. And on the left side, the kitchen, laundry room, and access to the garage. You might find this process more fun and flexible if you make cutouts of the various rooms, and then move them around till you find a layout that works for you.
Armed with this basic layout idea, consider the box that will surround it. Craftsman-style houses have certain conventions, as do split-levels, colonials, and geodesic domes. A floor plan that works in a craftsman home will probably not feel so cozy in a dome.

, For this, there is software available that will let you place rooms, walls, windows, etc. to create a professional-looking design. Do realize that software and vision will only take you so far.


To create a truly workable design that takes in not just splendid design ideas, but considers such practical considerations as structural integrity, flood planes, drainage, slope, and all the other little details, it's important to work with an architect.
Mistakes made in the vision phase cost nothing. Mistakes made in the design phase cost you time. But carry those mistakes through to the building phase, and they could cost you more than your budget can even consider.

, Knowing when to hire the pros is what will take designing your own home from a dream to a reality. Let the steady hand of an experienced designer take over the process of finalizing your plans. He'll work with the architect and your general contractor to turn your dreams into reality.


You've created the concept, you've driven the dream. You've done all the legwork, found the property, focused your design goals, and know exactly what you want. Now, you have more important duties involved in managing the construction of your dream home.

Use a tape measure to determine how much of the countertop you need to remove.[[Image:Cut Countertops Step 1Bullet1.png|center
Use a pencil to mark the points on the countertop and backsplash where you want to cut the countertop. Ensure that you make the marks on the back sides of the countertop and backsplash.



 

;
, The backsplash is the section of the countertop that stands upright against the kitchen or bathroom wall.

Place the countertop on a sawhorse. The backsplash should be on top of the sawhorse. The actual countertop should be positioned perpendicular to the floor. The back side of the backsplash should be facing up.






Ensure that the sawhorse is high enough so that the countertop does not touch the ground.






Place a jig along the line that you want to cut. A jig is a straight piece of wood or metal that helps you cut straight when sawing. You can use an old piece of wood as a jig. The jig should lie on the portion of the backsplash that you will keep.






Hold the jig with one hand against the portion of the backsplash that you will keep.






Use a circular saw with the other hand to cut along the marked line. A circular saw is a round, electric-powered saw that may either be hand-held or mounted on a table.

Use a circular saw with the other hand to cut along the marked line.







, Go over the cut edges with sandpaper. Smooth away any splinters or uneven areas along the edges.

Make a budget.,
Decide who will carry out the design.,
Figure out what kind of time constraints you have.",How to Design a Kitchen1," Before you go crazy with designing, consider how much money you have to spend first. Kitchen design can be very expensive. Figure out how much money you have, whether you have to buy new appliances or make other large purchases, and then determine what options are open to you.;
, Will you be doing all of the work after designing this kitchen or will you be hiring a contractor? This is important to consider, as it takes some level of skill to enact certain design features. If you plan on making these changes yourself, you will need to be sure that you are capable of making the things you design.

, It may be that you need this kitchen done in time for a family reunion or you want to get it done before your first baby is born in a few months. Maybe you’re not designing it for yourself at all and the time constraints are set by a client. All of this will greatly affect how extensive your design will be, as well as playing a part in determining who will carry out the design.

"
"
Determine the overall style.,
Pick your colors.,
Consider your appliance material.,
Choose your flooring.",How to Design a Kitchen2," The first thing to decide will be the style. You will want the style to fit seamlessly with the rest of your house, otherwise it will look very strange. Choose something that you like but also something that makes sense and is functional.


Example styles would be Craftsman, Modern, European, Mission, French Country, Cottage, Farmhouse, Bistro, Diner, or any number of other inspirational designs.

, Once you’ve got a style picked out, determine a color theme which matches with the style, the rest of your home, and is in keeping with your personal tastes. The color theme will determine cabinet, countertop, and sink color and material, as well as wall and backsplash color.

, You will want your appliances to match each other as much as possible, as well as the overall design of the kitchen. Choose between shiny or brushed metal, plain black or white, as well as a number of colored or alternative options.

, The type of flooring you will be using will also play a part in determining what style and color schemes you use. If you are limited to tile or hardwood, or any particular color, you will need to take this into account.

Decide which large appliances are best for you.,
Decide which small appliance you need.,
Decide how much counter space you’ll need.,
Decide how much storage space you’ll need.",How to Design a Kitchen3," First consider if you are limited by gas or electric. Then think about if you would prefer an induction cooktop over more traditional ranges. For your refrigerator, think about what size is best for you and the type of layout you prefer. Do you want your freezer at the top or bottom? You will need to decide what appliances meet your needs and preferences.


Consider how you’d like them arranged. Do you want your oven under the stove or as a single unit, or would you rather have a wall-mounted oven?

, You may love that juicer that you got for Christmas three years ago, but have you ever used it? Appliances like these can take up a lot of valuable counter space and should be carefully considered before making allocations for them in your kitchen design. This about what appliances you use often and which you can store away or leave out altogether.

, Once you know how many appliances you’ll need counter space for, begin thinking about the total amount of counter space you’ll need. You may find that your kitchen is not that big! Think about ways in which you can minimize the number of items on a counter and ways in which you can create extra counter space.


Pull out counters, which nest under your main countertop, are very handy.

, Think about how much canned or boxed food you keep at a given time, as well as how many other items you have to store, such as pots and pans, utensils, and cookbooks. It may be wise, if you keep a large amount of food items in storage, to create a pantry either attached to your kitchen or in another place, such as a basement.

"
"
Begin by placing large appliances and sinks.,
Place cabinets.,
Consider flow and usability.,
Look for ways to save space.,
Use tools to help you plan.",How to Design a Kitchen4," To a certain degree, you may be limited by where you can place larger appliances. Make these considerations first and use what flexibility you may have to get a placement that works for you.


For example, stoves and ovens may need to be hooked up to gas or electric power, refrigerators will need electricity and sinks will need to be near the existing plumbing.
However, you can of course spend money to have a contractor move existing electrical, gas lines, and plumbing. This is, however, often very expensive.

, Once you know where large appliances must go, you can begin to consider where you would like your cabinetry placed. Keep windows in mind when placing upper cabinets and storage solutions in mind when designing your lower cabinets.


Certain types of storage should go next to certain types of appliances. For example, pots and pans should go next to the oven and stove and cleaning supplies should go near a sink.

, You will need to consider how you will use the kitchen when placing appliances and counters. You will want to easily get from one area to another while cooking, and avoid as much as possible being backed up against another counter while trying to work. A kitchen should make it as easy as possible for more than one person to be cooking at a time. There should be ample work space and ability to move around each other.


For example, try not to have the sink very far away from the stove. You will want to be able to easily fill pots or dump hot water from cooking noodles.

, It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a person in possession of a kitchen must be in want of more storage space. No matter how big your kitchen is, you will undoubtedly find yourself wanting more storage space. Small appliances and kitchen gadgets accrue faster than we can understand. Before you know it, you’ll have 40 frozen burritos and nowhere to put them. Plan ahead and find ways to save as much space as you can.


Use metal storage tins on the side of your fridge to store spices. Place corkboard on the inside of your upper cabinets to pin seasoning and sauce mix packets. Use vertical storage for cutting boards, cookie sheets, and cutlery.

, You can use a number of methods to draw out your designs before executing them, as well as figuring out the best way to use the space you have. Using either traditional tools (like paper and pencil) or design software, you can determine the best layout and get a good feel for how everything will work together.


Many software programs are available for free online or for purchase (if you want something a little more powerful). Make sure that if you download software it is from a reputable source. With these programs you can not only find the best arrangement of your kitchen, you can also make color schemes and see 3d renderings of what your kitchen will look like.
If you aren’t comfortable with computers, you can draw the layout blueprint-style on graph paper. Have one sheet with the layout of the room (drawn proportionally) and draw all of the objects onto another sheet (also proportionally) and cut them out. Rearrange them until you find a layout that you like.

Transforming a kitchen can mean anything from a few new decorations and accessories to a full remodel. Pick the right middle ground for you and your kitchen, and do only the steps here that best suit you and your room.;
, There's not much inviting about a cluttered mess or a sink full of overdue dishes. This is the simplest, least expensive way to get your kitchen looking better quickly. It will also give you a good idea what you're starting with as far as structure and layout.

, Your kitchen is a workspace, and you'll enjoy using it most if you have plenty of light. Get as much natural light as you can, then add task lighting or room lighting as appropriate. You might want a more moderate, muted light in your dining area, if that is part of the kitchen.

, Sketch up a plan or simply stand in the kitchen and look at what you have. Changing the layout could be as simple as turning the table at a bit of an angle. Other easy, modest options for adjusting the layout for your kitchen include bringing in a cart or portable island, adding shelves or a hutch, or bringing in just the right chair.

, If you're going for warmth, try for warm colors. This can mean reds, oranges, and yellows, but it can also mean natural colors, such as tan, brown, taupe, peach, etc. Warm can be gentle or bold, or some of both. Most importantly, choose colors that get along with each other, get along with any colors you're not changing, and seem comfortable and inviting to you.

, It will unify your room. Perhaps you want country casual or a Mediterranean look.


You don't have to have a picture perfect kitchen to draw your inspiration from a home decorating magazine or book. Visit your library, browse through a few of these volumes, and see what catches your attention--and what doesn't.
Do your own thing. This is your kitchen, so choose a style that suits you.

, It's amazing how much a fresh coat of paint can transform a room. A suitable contrasting trim color around the windows and doors can give it a special pop.


Paint your kitchen with a semi-gloss paint so that the walls will be washable when the inevitable splatters and splashes happen.

, These hard surfaces don't come in quite the variety of colors that paints and textiles do, so make sure they are a part of your plan.

, If the layout is basically working and the cabinets are in good shape, there should be no need to replace the whole structure. Instead, you can paint or refinish the cabinets or replace just the fronts (reface).


If you have natural wood cabinets, see if you can refinish them rather than painting. It will wear better and the natural wood will help create warmth. Remember that you may be able to stain them a different color or remove the old stain, leaving a natural wood color.

, There's quite a variety out there, ranging from classic to whimsical.


Consider how they'll feel in your hand, how they'll wear over time, and how they'll look in the grand scheme of things.
Remember to multiply out the full cost. A $5 handle can add up fast if you need twenty or thirty of them.

, These include throw rugs and curtains, but don't forget the smaller stuff like tablecloths, towels, and pot holders. Hang a brightly colored apron as decoration, if you like. Add coordinating chair cushions, place mats, or fabric napkins.

, These can be anything you like that go with your theme.


Keep decorations generally off your counter. Your counter is your workspace.
Try tins or antiques for a traditional or country look.
Try hanging plates or tiles on your walls. There are a lot of artistic ones in a huge variety of colors and patterns. They can add a lot of color and visual interest and they're easy to clean if they get dusty or greasy.
Show off a collection hanging on the wall or on small shelves.

, Make sure to have saucers under them so the water doesn't run out and damage any surfaces. Keep them trimmed of ratty, older foliage. Choose sturdy house plants if you're not a great gardener.


Sunny window but not a plant person? If you're a terrible brown thumb, try glass bottles instead. They'll catch the sun and add color and shape with no extra effort.

, It will keep them in easy reach.


Hang your pots or utensils, especially if they are good tools.
Keep a fruit basket or bowl around. It can add plenty of color and (just maybe) entice you and family members to eat more fruit.

, There is almost nothing that makes a kitchen homier than the smell of fresh bread, cookies, or simply dinner.

, Nothing makes a kitchen homier faster than a group of friends talking, laughing, and having fun.

"
Assess your budget.,
Consider your aesthetic preferences.,
Choose a material for your countertops.,
Purchase the countertops.",How to Buy a Kitchen Countertop," Your budget represents the chief constraint when choosing a countertop. High-end materials like granite, quartz, and copper can cost over 3 times as much as inexpensive laminate tops. Contractors will often price your job by square foot (or square meter) of counter surface area, so measure your countertops to determine how much you should budget.;
, All countertops will fulfill their function by providing you with a work surface; where they primarily differ, however, are their aesthetic impact. Both synthetic and natural countertops are available in a wide range of finishes. Laminate and solid surface tops can be purchased in nearly any color or pattern. Natural tops like wood and granite can also differ widely in appearance.


If you are unsure of what finish you want, consider your kitchen's other finishes. Coordinating the countertop with the cabinets, wall, and backsplash will yield a more cohesive kitchen aesthetic.
If you will be selling your home soon, opt for a more subdued countertop finish. Loud, bright, or unusual finishes may turn off potential buyers.

, This is perhaps the biggest decision when buying a countertop. Price, durability, and appearance will vary between materials.


Laminate countertops consist of a decorative veneer affixed to an engineered wood core. These tops are typically the most inexpensive and lightweight of all materials. They are also easier to install than other materials, because they are easy to maneuver and cut, and won't warp or splinter like some natural materials. Laminate countertops are available in an array of colors and faux finishes.
Solid surface countertops are made from a blend of polyester and acrylic. Unlike laminate tops, they can be sanded if stained or damaged. They also fit together more seamlessly than laminate countertops.
Granite countertops are some of the most durable on the market. They can withstand high heat and scratches, and have the natural beauty of stone. Because granite is porous, these tops have to be sealed periodically.
Wood countertops can be stained, oiled, or waxed for a distinct natural finish. Like granite, they must be sealed periodically. Wood countertops can be more easily cut and sanded than stone tops, which makes installation and upkeep easier.

, Countertops can be purchased from home improvement stores, interior finish dealers, and sometimes directly from the supplier. When purchasing, you will need to choose whether to buy pre-finished pieces or have the countertops custom-made.


Pre-finished pieces and blanks are the least expensive option. These pieces come in standard sizes, which can be cut to length on site if necessary. If you are uncomfortable with cutting the countertops yourself, or if your kitchen has oddly shaped tops, pre-finished pieces are not the best option.
A more expensive option is to have your countertop order sent to a fabricator. You can purchase the tops from a dealer of your choice, have a professional take measurements of your kitchen, and then have the countertops custom-made to your measurements. Dealers will often be able to put you in touch with an installer as well.

Be prepared to wait.",How to Apply for Planning Permission," In general, you will need planning permission if you are going to build a new structure, make changes to an existing structure, or change the use of a current building. If your plans fall into one of these three major categories, then you will probably need to obtain planning permission before you continue.For most projects throughout the United Kingdom, you can find the information you need at PlanningPortal.co.uk., The Planning Portal provides a comprehensive list of types of building projects. This list includes such topics as Basements, Change of Use, Demolition, Doors and Windows, Solar Panels, and many more. By selecting the topic from that list that most closely matches that work that you are planning to do, you can find guidance about whether or not you need planning permission. If you do, the link will provide further information about where to reach out for more specific guidance.For example, the link to “External Walls” tells you that you do not need permission just to paint your walls or for most general maintenance projects. However, you do need permission for certain projects if you live in a Conservation Area, National Park, or other special locations.
You can also view other planning applications online. All planning applications are made available online through the Planning Portal. You should take advantage of this information and view some of the other applications. Reviewing other applications will give you a sense of the level of detail that is required and the type of information that you need to prepare in order to seek planning permission.

, For any sizable project that requires government permission, it is a good idea to consult with an attorney. An attorney can help you understand the application process and help you prepare your application to maximize your chance of approval., Before you submit your application, you should meet with a planning official to discuss your project. The planning officer can help identify points of concern that you will need to address and can let you know which local authorities you will need to speak with to get additional permissions. The planning officer can help you understand the application and review process.For your meeting with the planning officer, be prepared with the following materials and information:


plans and drawings of your project
an explanation of the reason for your project and its overall purpose
information about the location of your project, in proximity to any roads, highways, landmarks, telephone or sewer lines

, Part of the permission process involves public notice and comment. You can help this go smoothly by talking with your neighbors early on. Describe what you are doing and explain the impact on them. If you can get their support early, then the public notice portion of your application is likely to be much simpler and more productive.By talking with your neighbors, you may be able to get their support before you submit your application. If they object to your work, they may be able to let you know what their objections are, and you could modify your project to satisfy them.

, Part of the review of your project will include the effect that it will have on local wildlife. Anything you can do to minimize impact will increase your chances of approval. Natural England, the governmental agency on wildlife preservation, can help answer any questions you may have before you begin., If your project could cause any kind of air or water pollution or affect safe housing in the area, you may be required to submit an Environmental Impact statement. Officials at the local environmental health department can help you review your project and determine, ahead of time, whether your project is likely to fall into this category., If you are planning anything that could infringe on any roads or highways, you will need the approval of the local highway authority. You should contact your local office early in your planning, to see what you may need to do.Highway authority officials could help you revise your project in a way that will ensure approval.

, If your proposal is likely to involve the use of any dangerous chemicals, you will need approval of the office of the Health and Safety Executive. From its website, www.hse.gov.uk, you can find information about particular substances, registration requirements, concerns for manufacturers, and concern for downstream users., Although this is not a requirement for getting planning permission, it is an important consideration for any work project. The Planning Portal website provides useful tips and burglary prevention advice., If your project is in one of the five designated areas of archaeological importance in England, you will need to provide at least six weeks’ advance notice to your local authority before you begin work, whether or not your project needs planning permission. The authority will then inspect your site and let you know if you can proceed., From the home page, www.planningportal.co.uk, you will find all the information necessary about the approval process. From the home page, after completing all your preliminary research and conferences, select the link to “Start or View your Planning Applications.”You will be prompted to answer only the questions that will apply to your particular type of project. At a minimum, you will need some introductory identifying information about yourself and the property. You will then need to provide information about the project itself., You will need to know, from your preliminary research, which additional consents you need. If you have questions, the web site can help guide you. You should also contact your local planning authority if you need further guidance.The following is a list of the consent types that you can apply for online:


Householder planning consent
Full planning consent
Outline planning consent
Reserved Matters
Listed building consent
Advertisement consent
Lawful Development Certificate (LDC)
Prior notification 
Removal/variation of conditions
Approval of conditions
Consent under Tree Preservation Orders 
Notification of proposed works to trees in conservation areas
Application for non-material amendments

, There is a much longer list of additional consent types that are not available online. For these other consents, you must download the application and submit it by mail or in person to the appropriate authority. The forms are available for download from the Planning Portal site. Some of these consent types, but not a complete list, are as follows:Prior approval for onshore extraction of oil and gas
Prior approval for a registered nursery
Prior approval for certain agricultural uses
Prior approval for betting shops
Prior approval for installation of photovoltaic cells

, All projects, anywhere in the country, will require a certain minimum set of documents. Without these required items, your application will not be considered. These mandatory documents include the following items:the completed application form
a location plan, showing the site area and its surrounding context. You can get this plan from one of the Planning Portal’s registered suppliers, listed on the website.
a site plan, specific to your project. This must show the details of your project.
an ownership certificate certifying ownership of the property
agricultural holdings certificate, whether or not the site includes an agricultural holding
design and access statement, outlining the design principals for the project
the required filing fee. The fee is calculated as a percentage of the size of the project. The Planning Portal includes a “fee calculator” to help you determine the amount of your particular fee., Your local planning authority may require one or more additional documents with your application. To find out what is required locally, contact your local authority directly. You can also connect to the local office’s list of requirements through the national Planning Portal., With the exception of basic identifying information that is needed to open your application, all applicants are cautioned not to provide personal information with the application. You need to be aware that all application materials may be made public through the website. Do not include anything that you do not want available to everyone., After your application is submitted, you should soon receive an email from the Planning Portal. This email is not approval of your project. It is confirmation that your application has been received.As part of the confirmation, you will receive a unique reference number. Make note of this number and continue to use it on all future correspondence with the authority.

, Once your application is complete, you may be contacted by the planning authority for more information. Be prepared to provide additional information, answer questions, or even participate in a public hearing, if necessary, depending on the size and scope of the project., Within eight weeks, you should receive a decision from the planning authority. The decision is likely to be one of four different options, and based on each option, you will respond in a different fashion, as follows:Permission refused. If this is the response, you may change your proposal and submit a new application, or you may appeal to the Secretary of State.
No decision. If eight weeks go by without a decision, you have the right to appeal to the Secretary of State for a decision.
Permission granted, with conditions. If this is the response, you may appeal to the Secretary of State to have the conditions waived, or you may choose to proceed with your project in accordance with the conditions that have been set.
Permission granted. In this case, you may simply proceed with your project.

, If the planning authority denies your application or sets conditions that you do not wish to follow, your first step should be a conversation with the planning authority. You can get an explanation on the decision and ask for guidance about revising your project to get approval., This is a link that is available from the original Planning Portal. You will follow the links online to open an account, provide information about your project, and submit the formal request to have your project reviewed.The deadline for filing an appeal is six months from the date of your decision letter. In the case of a non-determination, the deadline is six months from the date that a decision was expected, which was eight weeks after the submission of your initial application.

, The appeal process lasts approximately six months at least from the date of filing. You are warned that only about one in every three appeals is successful."

Choose suitable door material.,
Select materials for the kitchen counter top.,
Determine the final price.,
Consider the need for kitchen appliances.,
Consider the need for accessories.",How to Buy a Modular Kitchen," An effective, well-planned modular kitchen has the following benefits:


It is able to offer a lot of storage space, even in the smallest of kitchen areas.
Repairs are easily done.
Individual components can be replaced if required, without affecting other kitchen components
Installing it does not take much time or effort.
Cleaning it requires less effort.
It can be highly durable, when made with high quality materials.;
, The shape of the kitchen plays a crucial role in space utilization. The most common kitchen shapes are L-shaped kitchen, U-shaped-kitchen, straight/galley kitchen and parallel kitchen. Moreover, if your kitchen is very large or you wish to go for an open kitchen, you could also opt for an island design. However, this design has a shortcoming if it includes the hob in the island and your house lacks underground pipelines, so bear that in mind when designing.


For example, Indian houses don't generally have underground pipes, so an island design with a hob would not work.

, Consider the heights of cabinets and the depths of counter tops. Kitchens must be designed ergonomically to avoid back pains. Ask your kitchen designer if they can customize according to your height and also check if the design suggested is ergonomic.

, Base units are the main storage spaces for your kitchen utensils. Some options include: cutlery and utensil units, plain shelves units, multi-utility shelves, sink unit, spice rack, cooking unit, oven unit, corner units, L-shaped and corner units.

, Kitchen wall units are used to store groceries and kitchen equipment. Remember to leave space for the chimney/vent while you’re designing wall units of the kitchen. Some of the most commonly used wall units include: Horizontal unit, corner shelves unit, chimney/vent unit, crockery unit, spice unit and containers unit.

, Colour reflects the state of mind. Choosing a kitchen colour is important as a lot of time is spent there cooking for loved ones. Choose your favorite colours or shades that match your walls.

, Look and feel matter a lot and this comes down to the quality of the material used. Things to bear in mind include:


Check to see whether the material used is waterproof.
Do not only consider how the kitchen looks from outside. Bright, flashy and decorative finishes can be given by any brand.
Test things in the showroom. Open shutters, pull out the units and look at the insides.
Know what is used for modular kitchens: Generally, pre-laminated MDF, pre-laminated particleboard or boiling waterproof (BWP) plywood with lamination are used. Of these, boiling water proof (BWP) plywood with lamination is the best body material available in the market because it stays unaffected, even in the worst moisture-ridden conditions.

, When designing your kitchen, consider what type of cabinet doors to use. Boiling water proof (BWR) plywood with lamination, pre-laminated particleboard, MDF with acrylic finish, MDF membrane and pre-laminated MDF are the best available options in the market. Of these, MDF with acrylic finish is the best door type if a high glossy look is required. However, for a simple look, boiling waterproof (BWR) plywood with lamination and MDF membranes are the best options.

, These days most homes come with an in-built granite kitchen counter top. However, if you're looking to customize the kitchen counter top, the best available options are solid surface top, granite-LITE, granite-premium quality and boiling waterproof ( BWP) plywood with lamination. Premium quality granite is the best option as it resists heat, scratches and stains and protects against mold and mildew. It also offers an endless variety of different patterns of veins, specks and swirls.

, Price matters a lot to everyone. Check if you’re getting the best price in the market. If the company has a kitchen price estimator to check prices, make use of it. Some companies may offer lowered prices for taking factory-direct supplies. Decide what you need in your kitchen, and customize the component and material type depending up on your budget.

, Standard appliances in a kitchen include the sink and the faucet. Sinks must have good width and depth so that all your cookware can fit in straight without having to be angled. Faucets must be tall and long-handled for ease of use.

, You can add many accessories to the kitchen for your convenience. A few useful accessories to have include: Waste disposal unit, kitchen D carousel, detergent holder unit, bottle pull-out unit, double corner pull unit and kitchen carousel unit.

Look into traditional neutral shades.,
Try going with shades of white.,
Opt for complex neutrals.,
Look at warmer neutrals.,
Think about your overall household color scheme.,
Opt for stone if you're going for gray or brown shades.,
Go for boards.,
Look for a wallpaper in a neutral shade.,
Try stainless steel.,
Select the right colors for a kitchen without windows.,
Go for contrasting colors in a smaller kitchen.,
Pay attention to other walls in an open kitchen.,
Choose the right color scheme if there's a lot of wood in your kitchen.",How to Create a Neutral Backsplash in Your Kitchen," If you tend to veer towards the traditional, and have a color scheme that doesn't go with many colors, traditional neutrals can work. These include shades like grays, whites, browns, and beiges. If you don't want an overwhelming backsplash, go with traditional neutral colors., White does not have to be boring. There are a variety of shades of white to choose from. A white backsplash may brighten a darker kitchen, making it a great choice for you. You can go for off-whites, cream colors, and ivories.White tends to work best with smaller rooms with poor lighting.
White also works best when your kitchen is primarily made up of other neutral colors. If your drawers and counters are in a shade of gray, for example, a white backsplash can be an excellent touch.

, While neutrals are traditionally thought of as plainer, simpler colors, a new trend uses what are called complex neutrals. Complex neutrals are made by mixing neutral colors with more complicated shades. A complex neutral may end up being a light olive shade with warm undertones.You have to create complex neutrals yourself by mixing a lot of colors, so you may have to talk to an interior designer to get the shade you want.
Complex neutrals work best if you want your home to have a more modern feel.

, Lighter neutrals do not work for everyone. You may want warmer neutrals that come in shades like brown and tan. Many warmer neutrals have orange undertones.A warmer neutral backsplash can create a calming feel in your kitchen.
Warmer neutrals tend to pair well with white trims.

, If you're unsure what shade to go for, there are a few things that can help you make a decision. Look at the color scheme in your kitchen and home and try to find something that matches.Consider other items in your kitchen. Look at things like rugs, artwork, appliances, counters, and stoves. One particular color, or type of color, may already dominate the kitchen. Try to select a backsplash that matches.
Think about how color flows from room to room, especially if you have an open kitchen. You may want to choose a backsplash color that doesn't have too dramatic of a transition between, say, the kitchen and living room.

, If you're going for a gray or brown backsplash, there are many attractive stone options. Stone naturally comes in shades of gray and brown, so a stone backsplash can be great for getting the color you desire.Stone backsplashes are relatively affordable and tend to pair well with most kitchens.
On the downside, stone does require yearly maintenance and it may collect more dirt and grime than other options.

, You can simply use horizontal boards for a unique backsplash. You can find boards in traditionally neutral shades, like tan, and adhere them to the walls yourself. This is a simple and economical way to achieve a neutral backsplash.Another benefit of boards is that they can be painted a variety of colors, so you can go for any backsplash shade you want.
One downside of boards is that they produce a bit of a busy pattern. If you already have heavily patterned wallpaper, appliances, or countertops, you may want to choose another option besides boards.

, Wallpaper is easy to clean, so it can be used a simple backsplash. Waterproof wallpaper is best, as it will easily guard against splashes. Wallpaper is fairly easy to install on your own, so it will cut back on the cost of labor.Wallpaper comes in a variety of colors, so it should be easy to find a neutral shade.

, If you have your heart set on a gray backsplash already, stainless steel holds up well and is resistant to gathering dirt and grime. You may have to put in some cost for installation, but it is a durable longterm option. It can also bring extra light to a darker room.Stainless steel does tend to dent easily. While it will not stain, it does require more frequent cleaning as grease marks and fingerprints show up easily.

, If your kitchen is low on natural light, make sure to keep this in mind when selecting colors. Selecting the wrong color for a poorly lit kitchen can leave your kitchen looking dark and dreary.If you're using fluorescent lights to light up a darker kitchen, a neutral blue shade will pair well with them.
In general, darker neutrals will make a dark kitchen look dimmer.

, Having a lot of color contrast can make a tiny room look more spacious. Therefore, try to choose a neutral in a different shade than things like your countertop and trimmings. If you, for example, have a white countertop, go for a darker neutral like a deep gray. This will make your kitchen feel bigger., You don't want a dramatic room to room transition if your home has an open layout. Make sure the neutral color you select does not contrast greatly with, say, the paint or wallpaper in the nearby living room.Gray neutrals tend to match with most color schemes. This may be a good option for an open floor layout.

, If you have a lot of wood, this affects your choice of colors. If you want to show the wood off, pick a neutral shade that's lighter than the wood. If you want to compliment it, try to find a neutral shade similar to the shade of the wood."

Declutter.,
Use color to make it cozy.,
Add fresh flowers.,
Jazz up your fridge magnets.,
Use texture to your advantage.,
Add unexpected pieces of furniture.,
Change the linens.,
Switch décor seasonally.",How to Decorate a Kitchen1," If you are like many people, you may be guilty of too many details. Take an honest look at your kitchen. Is it too cluttered? You can easily sidestep this problem by taking a few things away or simply rearranging your storage system to keep the extras from view. A new kitchen may emerge just from this one step.


If you have no choice but to display all of your appliances and dishware for a lack of storage, you're going to have to get some! Buy a cart, bring an extra piece in, or invest in some attractive bins and containers.;
, If you stick to whites like a piece of rice, you risk ending with a kitchen that seems hospital-like and cold. Add a few accent colors that are bright and cheery to make it seem warm, lived in, and loved.


Choose certain spots for your color. The seating? The lighting? An area of the countertop? In addition, do not feel pressure to stick to just one -- different hues of the same color work well together -- and remove the pressure to find the exact right tone.

, Plants and flowers add lively decoration to any room and are good for the environment. Add a functional decoration to your kitchen by creating a window box with fresh herbs, or replace fresh-cut flowers in a kitchen table vase every few days to keep it looking new.


Make sure they match your theme! A simplistic, neutral kitchen would benefit nicely from a simple Easter Lily or two while a kitchen with more pizzazz might look better with a bunch of carnations or daisies. What flower fits your kitchen's personality?
Herbs are not grown in factories, you know. To kill two birds with one stone, grow them yourself in your kitchen window! What a cute little way to spruce up your kitchen and jazz up your meals.

, For those of us that don't have a massive budget to install gold-flecked countertops lined with rubies, a fun way to spruce up your kitchen's ambiance is to spice up your fridge! There are loads of fun choices available that you can cater specifically to your personality.


Sometimes it's the little things in life. Buy a whole bunch of magnetic letters and leave your roommate a nice message about how you drank the last diet Coke, or even put magnets on the back of photos from favorite vacations. If it sticks, it's a possibility.

, When you have one look going on in your kitchen (probably smooth and flat), it can look one-dimensional and blah. To add an extra zing to your cooking space, work in texture, too.Go for textured containers, textured linens, and textured wall hangings or curtains. A little bit here and there will go a long away against the smoothness of the countertops, the table, and the cabinets.

, Long gone are the days when the kitchen was just the kitchen. Now, the living room is the dining room, the kitchen is the common area, and the dining room could even be for show. While you don't have to embrace the lifestyle, consider jazzing up your kitchen with no-exactly-meant-for-the-kitchen pieces.


A china cabinet, armoire, or credenza is a good way to start expanding the look of your kitchen.If you have a great piece, make it the focal point. Voila, instant theme! Add bookshelves, a bench, or other multi-purpose pieces to seal the deal. After all, this is your kitchen.

, One way to give the whole room a cohesive theme is to choose one pattern for your curtains, tablecloth, and hand towels and create a matching set of linens. The only hard part of this is committing to just one!

, Give your kitchen a celebratory feel by changing out linens, curtains, or dishes for special holidays. Rotate these items, which all complement the personality of your kitchen, with the changing seasons to add seasonal colors and elements.


This has one extra (albeit teeny) benefit: with the seasons, you can give it a good cleaning. Kitchens are the rooms that get dirtiest, and if you schedule four annual overhauls, your appliances, dishware, and linens will stay good as new.

Adjust the backsplash by hand as necessary.,
Brush off remaining adhesive, if necessary.,
Mix and apply grout to the backsplash, if necessary.,
Clean any remaining cloudiness from the backsplash.",How to Create a Metal Backsplash," It's important to do this before anything else. Knowing the area you need your backsplash to cover will allow you to calculate the cost of materials, which could influence the kind of metal you use. To calculate the dimensions for your backsplash:


Divide the wall where you plan on installing the backsplash evenly into rectangles to account for cabinets, windows, large appliances and so on. Measure the height and the width of each rectangle. Multiply these numbers together to find the area of each.
If you have a diagonal angle to account for, extend the base of the diagonal horizontally until it is even with the top of the diagonal. Connect the horizontal extension and the top of the diagonal to make a right triangle.

Calculate the area of triangles by multiplying the base and height of the triangle, then divide that number by 2 (triangle area = (base x height) / 2 ).


Add together the area calculations to get the total area in units squared (for example, in², ft², cm², m²). Multiply this number by 1.1 so you have extra backsplash material to fill in gaps or replace materials damaged during installation.;
, Now that you know the total area needed for your backsplash, you can begin shopping around. You can get quotes for backsplash material at your local big box hardware store (like Lowes, Home Depot, and Home Hardware) or online.An online backsplash provider may be the easiest option for getting a quote. In many cases, once you choose a backsplash material, you only need to input the total area on the site to determine the cost.
Before ordering your backsplash online, verify the seller's return policy. If tile is damaged during shipping, you may end up with an expensive and unusable backsplash.Common backsplash metals include:


Copper, which is lightweight. This makes it easier to install. Copper works well with rustic and retro designs.

Stainless steel, which comes in many shades. It is durable and is easy to maintain. It works well with modern decor.

Brass, which requires higher maintenance to prevent rust and keep clean.However, this metal has a unique, classical appearance., Most of the supplies you'll need can be found at your local hardware store or home center. But before you make any purchases, check the specifications for your backsplash to determine:


Whether or not you need adhesive, grout, and the tools associated with these components. Some varieties of backsplash already come with adhesive backing and will not need additional adhesive, grout, and their related tools.
What kind of backsplash cutting device you will need, if any. You'll only need to cut the backsplash to account for irregular angles, like you would along a diagonal., Clear out all appliances and countertop items from the backsplash installation area. If your stove is in this area, move it slightly away from the wall and disconnect it. Use tape to clearly define the edges of the backsplash installation area, including walls and countertops. Also:


Use a cover for your countertops, like a drop cloth, cardboard, or butcher paper, to prevent damage to it.
Remove fixtures that could get damaged or get in the way. Some fixtures you might have to remove include light/disposal switches, cover plates for outlets, and so on.
Turn off all electricity to your kitchen before installation. Metal backsplash has a greater risk transmitting electrical shocks. Prevent this by switching your kitchen electricity in your fuse box or electrical service panel to ""OFF."", If your walls have slight bumps, depressions, or other imperfections, these will likely be visible in your installed backsplash. Take a metal straightedge and hold it to the wall to determine if it is level.


If your wall has imperfections, you should fix these before installation. Use a layer of joint compound or use other methods to fill in imperfections., Sometimes a design won't look as good as you initially thought it might. Especially if you can return your backsplash, use tape to hang a section of it to get a rough idea of how it will look.


In some cases, there may be plastic or a protective cover on the surface of your backsplash. Even so, a trial run will better help you visualize the next phase of this process: installation., Always follow your backsplash installation instructions, but in many cases, this will be a kind of mortar. However, it's becoming more and more common to produce backsplashes with their own adhesive, in which case you won't need a separate adhesive, mortar, or the tools associated with these components.


If using mortar, mix it in one of your two buckets according to its preparation instructions., This step can be skipped if your backsplash has its own adhesive backing.If not, use an adhesive applicator to apply adhesive to the wall where you will attach the backsplash. Do so according to the adhesive's directions. If using mortar:


Use the flat side of your V-notch trowel to apply a layer of mortar to the wall where you will install the backsplash.
Use the other side of your trowel, which should have V-shaped notches, to smooth the mortar so it is of uniform thickness throughout., Take your backsplash and press it into the adhesive or mortar using light, even pressure. Depending on your adhesive and backsplash, the time you should hold this pressure may vary. Follow the product instructions for best results.


Continue applying your backsplash, section by section. Pay close attention to the joints between tiles if your backsplash has any. These should line up evenly.
After you finish attaching backsplash to a section, apply your adhesive to a new section in the same fashion previously described, then attach more backsplash.
Take great care when attaching your backsplash to keep it level, otherwise it might turn out uneven or lopsided. A laser level can be helpful in this instance, but a traditional level can work just as well., After finishing a section, but before applying more mortar for your next section, take your wooden board and hold it flat across two backsplash segments already attached. Use your hammer to lightly tap the wood block where the backsplash is attached.


This is an optional step. However, by using this simple technique, you can correct unevenness in your backsplash before the adhesive hardens and cures. After hardening and curing, uneven depth will be hard to correct., In most cases, after 10 to 15 minutes has passed, you can remove the protective paper or plastic from the surface of your backsplash. Plastic can usually be peeled off easily. You may have to dampen your sponge and moisten protective paper before it pulls free.


When removing the protective covering on your backsplash, use firm but gentle force. You should keep the covering on the backsplash until this point to prevent damage., At this point, the adhesive/mortar will likely still be somewhat movable. Use your hands to make adjustments to the backsplash. For example, you might need to adjust the joints separating metal mosaic tile backsplashes., After peeling off the protective covering on your backsplash, there may be some adhesive or paper still on it. Gently scrub this with a non-abrasive nylon brush, then wipe the surface with a clean, damp sponge., This will likely be necessary for metal mosaic tiles, though backsplash that came with adhesive might not require grouting. Follow the label directions to mix your grout in your second bucket. Only use non-sanded grout to preserve the finish of your metal. Follow the grout instructions for best results, but generally, to apply the grout:


Use a rubber grout float to spread the grout onto your backsplash. Using firm pressure, force the grout into the joints between backsplash materials.
Wait between 15 minutes and one hour (depending on the kind of grout you used) before using a dampened sponge to remove extra grout from the surface of the backsplash. Use light pressure; too much pressure can remove grout from the joints., Only do this after the grout has cured. The information on the time this takes will be on the package or in the instructions. Use a clean, dampened sponge to wipe off any remaining grout on the surface of your tile that's making it hazy.


In some cases, you may need to use a cleaning agent, like an industrial alcohol based cleaner, to remove glue or stubborn grout."

Purchase a kit.,
Gather your supplies.,
Clean the counter.,
Add primer.,
Dab on the paint.,
Add a topcoat.",How to Create the Look of Granite for Less1," You can buy a kit made to create the look of granite on laminate countertops. These kits contain special types of paint and primer that you use to make a fake granite countertop. You can buy a kit online or at a local hardware store. Prices vary, but kits generally sell for around $70., Prior to creating your own granite countertop, there are certain supplies you need. You will need paint in granite colors as well as painting supplies.Get things to protect your countertop, such as tape paint and a tarp.
Get a paint roller and paint brushes, as well as a sponge.
You will need cleaning supplies, as it's important to have a clean counter to work on. Get a scouring pad to clean your counter thoroughly ahead of time.

, Do not just give your counter a regular rub down. You will need to clean your counter thoroughly to make sure to scrub off any grease with your scouring pad. You should rinse the counter completely with water afterwards. Wait until the counter is completely dry to proceed., It's important to use black primer rather than white primer, as this will show through when you dab on the paint. This creates the granite-like appearance. Using your paint roller, and a paint brush for areas like corners, paint the whole counter in black primer.Afterwards, you need to let the primer dry completely before proceeding to the next steps. This can take as long as 8 hours.

, Take your sponge and your white and gray paint. You will dab on white and gray paint over the primer, creating the effect of a granite countertop. You should practice first using black construction paper. This will give you a sense of how to create the proper effect.Before finishing off with your topcoat, let this layer dry completely. This takes around four hours.

, A clear topcoat will protect your paint from damage over time. Add a topcoat as soon as your paint job dries. You add this the same way you added the primer, using your paint roller and a paint brush for hard-to-reach places like corners."

Use the bin primer and start painting from the top of the kitchen and working your way down.,When the bin primer has dried use the sanding sponges to rub the paint smooth, then dust down the whole kitchen with your dust brush and finally wipe it down with spirits on a rag

,
Use the tinted 1-2-3 primer and paint the kitchen again from top to bottom.

,
When the paint has dried use the 2 pack filler to fill up any little holes or dents.,
Give the kitchen 2 finish coats, for best results.,
When the finish coat has dried, give it a really good rub down with the 240 grade sandpaper, then dust off and rub down with a damp rag.,
Use the caulk to fill any gaps you might find.,
Apply the finish coat!",How to Create Your Own Hand Painted Kitchen2," Bin primer dries very fast so likewise you will need to move as quickly as you can with it.


When painting the cabinet doors start with the outside first before painting the inside. Make sure to lay off the paint with brush strokes going from top to bottom, not left to right. If there are panels on the doors, then paint these before painting the surrounding door.







,,, Don’t overfill because it dries very hard and can be difficult to sand back. Once it has gone hard, less than half an hour, sand the filler, dust it back then touch it up again with the 1-2-3 primer.

, You know the drill now, starting at the top of the kitchen and working your way down..

, No need for spirits on your rag, just use water.

, Using a wet finger run the caulk into the gaps then wipe away any excess with a damp cloth. The caulk will need at least an hour to dry before you can paint over it again (if you are using oil based paint you’d have to leave the caulk to dry for 24 hours).

, Once more from the top down.

Create shelving.,
Stick with an accent color.,
Consider losing all your doors.,
Use mirrors.,
Paint the walls or cabinets.,
Add a backsplash.,
Play around with lighting.,
Focus on one element at a time.",How to Decorate a Kitchen2," Since your cabinets are probably stocked to the brim, you'll probably need other methods to house what's left over (the decorative doodads and the like). For this, you have two options:


Floating shelves. If you have walls (and you probably do), you can install floating shelves with ease. They will also draw the eye upward, so if your kitchen is small, it will distract from the cramped-ness of the rest of the room.
Cubed shelving. This is turning a wall into a series of boxes. They are artistic and utilitarian. For an added touch, decorate each box (or some of the boxes) with different types of shelf paper.Tada, kitchen innovation.

, A kitchen does not need too much going on, so sticking to black and white and other neutral tones are your best bet. Nevertheless, take that monochrome look and spice it up with a specific accent color. Maybe bright yellow or bright blue? Suddenly, the eyes aren't concerned with the size and immediately focus on your great pieces.


Think of accents in your art, towels, and dishware. But remember: it's an accent color. Too much of an accent color makes it an accent color no more. If you overdo it, you'll lose the effect. Stick to 4 or 5 pieces.
Three words: Paint. The. Ceiling.


, Whether it's cabinets or drawers, think about removing the doors. Sure, this means everything on the inside will need to be organized, but that can easily be overcome with cute storage containers and pretty glass and textured bins. And more opportunities to show off your decorating side!


The idea here is that you're opening everything up -- literally. The more open it is, the more room the eye will see. The more room the eye sees, the larger the room will seem., Just because you're in a kitchen doesn't mean you can't do whatever the heck you want. And since you probably know that mirrors open rooms, why not put one in your kitchen?! It doesn't have to scream ""I'm a mirror!"" either -- simply place it underneath your cabinetry for a is-it-there-is-it-not-there look.


Mirrors (with frames) also make for good trays. Slap some felt on the back and boom -- automatic DIY success.

, A room's color helps it feel warm or relaxing, so decorate your kitchen by adding a fresh coat of paint to the walls or cabinets. White is a popular choice, but you can opt for a light shade of blue or yellow if an all-white room isn't appealing.


Use a variety of neutral tones. While using white, cream, and gray may seem drab, when you mix up various neutral tones, it adds depth and sophistication, while staying classic and simple. Turn boring into brilliant by just using a few shades.
Add a focus. Paint three walls one color, and the fourth wall a color that pops. The eye will move to it without even realizing it. If you have a great window or area of the room that's eye-catching, amp it up with a focus color.

, If you are committed to white walls (either against your will or not), you may feel like your kitchen is a little lacking. Get around this by adding a backsplash -- that is a panel behind the sink or stove that protects the wall from splashes. And the panel can be any style you like!


It's easiest to stick to a solid color to add an accent, but consider tiles and patterns, too. Tiles can add extra texture to an otherwise smooth wall.

If you already have tile, think about buying tile stickers. A super (couldn't be easier) easy way to jazz up that backsplash in seconds., You have more options here than you probably realize. Depending on your electrical system, lighting can take on several different sources. Each one can vamp up your kitchen, rejuvenating it with life.


Play around with table lamps. Those work on counters, too! It adds a homey, unexpected feel to any area. If you are feeling extra creative, make a ""lamp"" out of a string of Christmas lights in a clear, glass jar.
Put lights in (and under) your cabinets. Not only will your pieces be lit up (and they'll look fantastic), it can serve as dim lighting when the full guns aren't necessary. In other words, romantic and functional.
Get a great hanging lamp. Even if you don't have much space, a great hanging lamp with an eccentric drum shade can be so much fun you won't notice anything else. Or get several small ones for more lighting options.
Go for sconces. If you don't have room for a big hanging shade or lamps on your countertops, a sconce is an easy way to go. Some are incredibly easy to attach and can provide much more light than their size would allow.

, Decorating a kitchen can become overwhelming if you try to change everything at once. Give yourself one decorating project, like painting or buying new dishes, and stay with that project until it's completed. You can move on to others later if you feel your kitchen needs more decorating.


This well help you know when to stop and when (and how) to keep going. Sometimes adding a focal point or changing your dishware can put a new twist on your kitchen that may be the small tweak that it needed. Create a priority list of things you want to add/change and slowly move down it as necessary.

Pick a style for your entire kitchen.,
Go ultra-modern.,
Do a sea theme.,
Opt for an earthy theme.,
Go for a colored theme.",How to Decorate a Kitchen3," The main way most people go wrong with their kitchens is in not choosing a theme. They have a vision here and a vision there (or they pick up knickknacks as they find them) and conflate them together into one hodgepodge of a kitchen. Pick a theme and you've tackled 80% of the battle.


It's important that your kitchen decorating be cohesive and make the room look pulled together. Accomplish this by deciding on one theme for your kitchen and choosing decorations that match it. Some home improvement stores have entire sets of kitchen decorations based on themes like country living, French or art deco styles.

, If you love sleek, shiny things, a super modern kitchen may be your style. Think in harsh angles and blacks, whites, and popping, bright colors. Most metallic, stainless steel, and geometric art pieces would adorn this kitchen. Glass, too!

, A common (but still classy) theme to choose is a sea theme. Whether you live on the ocean or want to bring the ocean to you, this theme is cozy and inviting.


Line your shelves with seashells, sailor's gear, and scenes from the beach. Work in elements of tan, cream, and blues. What a great excuse to make a DIY project with rope, netting, and items from the beach!

, If you are fond of dark, warm colors, an earthy, natural, woodsy theme may be more up your alley. Think of dark cabinets, wooden dishware, bowls of potpourri, cherry reds, rich mahoganies, and dark oranges.

, If an outright themed design is too much for your sensibilities, just go for a color. Hues can line up a kitchen, too! Blue stools, blue dishes, blue cabinet pulls -- everything will be brought together regardless of your items' designs. Just make sure you don't get sick of it!


This theme is a bit dangerous. Too much of one tone can be overkill. However, if you do not have the authority to revamp your kitchen (if renting), incorporating color as your theme may be the best way to go.

Do any repairs prior to painting.,
Use painters tape.,
Make sure to give the paint adequate time to dry.",How to Create the Look of Granite for Less2," If your counter has any damage, you want to replace this prior to painting. You don't want to paint over any rough parts of the counter, as this will not look as professional and finished.If you notice any holes in your counter, fill them with wood patch or auto body filler. You can find these supplies at a local hardware store. Once applied, you will have to sand over the holes you filled so the counter looks smooth.
If you have silicone caulking on your counter, you may not be able to paint on it. It's a good idea to remove silicone caulking and replace it with caulking you can paint on.

, You don't want to end up getting paint everywhere when creating a faux-marble counter. Use painters tape on the corners of your counter so you don't end up painting on walls, sinks, or cabinets.You should also lay a tarp down on your floor to avoid getting paint on the floor.

, Do not use your counter again until your paint is dry. Using the counter too soon can smear your paint job. It will take about one to three days for the counter to dry completely. Keep appliances off the counter until then.You should also make sure that the paint is dry in between coats.

Try quartz.,
Look into marble.,
Opt for recycled glass.,
Use granite only in key areas.,
Try laminate countertops with a granite design.",How to Create the Look of Granite for Less3," Quartz countertops look very similar to granite countertops. They're less prone to damage and may be cheaper and easier to install. If a granite countertop is out of your budget, look into the cost of installing a quartz countertop., Marble is a lot softer than granite, so it's less prone to scratches. This can allow you to save on costs of repairs longterm. Marble, however, does not look as similar to granite as some other options., Recycled glass is a cheaper option, and has a somewhat similar pattern to granite. If you have your heart set on a granite countertop, you can try recycled glass instead. Talk to a local contractor, or make a stop at your local hardware store, and see how much a recycled glass countertop would cost., If you love the look of granite, but a full granite installation is out of your budget, think about installing granite in key areas. You could, for example, have a granite kitchen island with laminate kitchen counters. This could save you some money while allowing you to have some attractive granite in your kitchen.

, If a granite countertop is not in your budget, go for a laminate countertop with a granite design. You can choose from among many laminate countertops with patterns similar to granite, allowing you to create the look of granite for less. This will also save you the effort of painting a laminate countertop yourself."

Get the machine into position.,
Erect tunnel supports as the machine bores through.,
Spray concrete on the excavated walls between the support rings.",How to Build a Tunnel," The proposed tunnel’s location will determine what tools and techniques are necessary to construct it and prepare it for its intended use. Tunnels can be divided into 3 types:


Soft-ground tunnels. These tunnels require support at the openings to keep the tunnel from collapsing. These tunnels are usually shallow and used for subways, water delivery, and wastewater removal systems.
Rock tunnels. Because they are excavated from solid rock, these tunnels require little added support or none at all. Train and car tunnels are usually of this variety.
Underwater tunnels. As the name indicates, these tunnels go under rivers, lakes, canals, and in the case of the “Chunnel,” straits such as the English Channel. These are the hardest tunnels to build, as water has to be kept away from the tunnel during and after construction.Building a tunnel under a city offers problems similar to an underwater tunnel, in that the ground around the tunnel tends to sag under the weight of the buildings above it. A knowledge of the area’s geology helps predict how much the ground will sag and suggests what methods can minimize the sagging.;
, A tunnel with a long, single, straight path is comparatively easy to bore with a tunnel boring machine. Tunnels that differ from this design offer problems that make constructing them more complex.


Short tunnels aren’t bored with tunnel boring machines because it isn’t cost-efficient to do so.
Tunnels that require different bore diameters at different parts of their routes also make the use of a tunnel boring machine impractical because of delays in adjusting the bore diameter.
Tunnels that turn sharp corners or have intersecting shafts also make use of a boring machine impractical.

, What the tunnel will be used for determines what additional work besides making the tunnel itself will be necessary before putting it into service.


Tunnels that carry passengers require some form of ventilation. For roadway tunnels, this usually means ventilation shafts to prevent buildup of carbon monoxide. For railway tunnels, this can mean forced-air ventilation to remove diesel engine exhaust. Both feature supplemental methods to deal with the smoke created should a fire break out in the tunnel.
Heavily-used tunnels, such as the Big Dig in Boston, may feature continuously manned operations centers with video equipment to monitor traffic within the tunnel and deal with emergencies.
Long roadway tunnels, such as the Eisenhower Tunnel in Colorado, may be lit with overhead lights for the convenience of drivers and passengers. Other roadway tunnels, such as those in Zion National Park in Utah, may feature scenic cutouts to allow natural light to enter the tunnel in places and provide passengers glimpses of the surrounding scenery.
Some tunnels, such as the Queensway Tunnel between Liverpool and Birkenhead, England and the Lion Rock Tunnel between Sha Tin and New Kowloon in Hong Kong, combine an upper passenger traffic deck with a lower service deck for water, pipes, or cables. Other tunnels, such as Malaysia’s SMART Tunnel can be used for either traffic or flood control., The area where the tunnel will be is dug out completely, with the tunnel roof to be created and covered over when the tunnel is completed. This type of tunnel is constructed in one of two ways:


Bottom-up: Ground support is created first, then the tunnel is built up around it.
Top-down: The tunnel’s sides and roof are constructed at ground level, and the tunnel trench is dug out under it.
Both methods are used primarily for shallower tunnels, although the top-down method allows for digging deeper tunnels than the bottom-up method. Deeper tunnels are often excavated with the assistance of a tunneling shield, a box-like structure with small shutters opened to dig through. Once the dirt in front of the shield is removed, the shield is moved forward to continue digging., The tunnel walls and roof can be built as the tunnel is being dug or may be pre-constructed and put into place as the tunnel is being dug. Materials today include the following:


Corrugated steel arches.
Precast concrete arches.
Precast concrete walls.
Poured or sprayed concrete. Often, this is used in conjunction with one of the formed-arch methods.

, How this is done depends on whether the bottom-up or top-down method was used.


Tunnels created with the bottom-up method must be back-filled to cover over the tunnel roof and any surface that is to exist above the tunnel roof is then built or rebuilt.
Tunnels created with the top-down method are dug out below where the tunnel walls and roof were erected, and then a base slab, which serves as the tunnel floor, is created., This method is similar to the cut-and-cover method, but is used for digging underwater tunnels. The trench needs to run the length the tunnel will run underwater.

, Each tube is sealed at either end with a bulkhead. If the tube is for a car tunnel, as in the case of the Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston, the tubes include pre-built road sections.

, For the Ted Williams Tunnel, this was a 5-foot-thick (1.5 m-thick) layer of rock.

, Any road or rail segments built into the tubes would be connected at this time as well., Tunnel boring machines, called TBMs for short or “moles,” feature circular plates on the front called shields. Disc-shaped cutters on the shield tear through rock and dirt, which passes through openings in the shield onto a conveyor belt inside the TBM that deposit it behind the machine.


The types of TBM shields vary according to whether the mole is to dig into soft, wet ground or hard rock. Shield diameters range from Aker Wirth’s 26.3-foot (8.03 m) shield on its TBM used for Switzerland’s Linth-Limmern power stations to Hitachi Zosen’s “Big Bertha,” with its diameter of 57.5 feet (17.5 m).Moles designed to dig tunnels below the water table also feature chambers at the front to pressurize the ground being dug through.
For large jobs, multiple TBMs may be called for. The Channel Tunnel required 11., For a surface level tunnel, this is no problem. If the tunnel is to be bored deep underground, an access shaft, usually circular, is drilled and lined with concrete. The TBM is lowered into it, and the tunnel is excavated from that point.


For long tunnels, multiple access shafts are drilled.
When the tunnel is finished, the access shafts may become ventilation shafts and/or emergency exits. If they are not so employed, they are left in place for the life of the tunnel. , Segments of pre-cast concrete are erected behind the TBM to form a ring at pre-determined intervals., The sprayed concrete, or shotcrete, coats and stabilizes the tunnel walls. The shotcrete may include steel or polypropylene fibers to strengthen it, much the way steel rebar is used to strengthen cast concrete. The shotcrete also contains an accelerant to help it stick to the tunnel walls and dry quickly."

Choose the type of foundation to build.,
Set your footings 2 feet (60.96 cm) across.,
Align the 2 inch wide by 10 inch long (5.08 cm wide by 25.4 cm long) boards to build the forms for your footings.,
Square and level the form.,
Make your concrete.,
Make your concrete foundation.,
Finish your concrete.",How to Build a Concrete Foundation," The type of foundation depends on the area of the foundation will be located on and the type of structure that will be placed on it.


Shallow foundations are built on level ground and hard surfaces. Shallow foundations are no more than 3 feet (91.44 cm) deep and are used primarily for smaller, simpler projects like holding patio furniture, a fountain, or an air conditioning unit.
Deep foundations are used for more complex projects. Deep foundations are also used when soil conditions are poor or when building a structure on a hill. Deep foundations are more than 3 feet (91.44 cm) deep and can have varying depths throughout. This type of foundation is suited for a shed or a detached garage.;
, Add 2 feet (60.96 cm) on either side. This properly spaces the form work and allows you the space you need to lay your foundation.

, Situate and lay down the boards in the planned foundation shape and size.

, Adjustments to the form can not be made after the concrete is poured. Because concrete is very heavy, be extra sure your formwork is strong and firmly in place.

,


Dump the dry cement into the wheelbarrow.
Add the water very slowly. Stir constantly.
Stir the mixture thoroughly. Mix in just enough water so your cement is chunky. Don't let the mixture get too soupy.

,


Pour your ready concrete into your form.
Use your trowel to level it off and smooth it over.
Make grooves with your trowel if you want a non-slippery surface.

,


Let the concrete dry.
Remove the forms after the concrete thoroughly dries. This will take at least 24 hours.
Keep the concrete wet for the next few days to avoid cracking. Soak it with a hose at least twice daily, three times if it is very hot outside.
Cover the pad if it looks like rain. Rain can cause depressions in the concrete and cause your foundation to be uneven.

Get a scope of the project.,
Explain the design process with clients and draw up a contract stating what will be done and this is the step where you establish a budget and how transactions can be made during the process of project development.,
Talk with clients to get the drift of their tastes and likes /dislikes.,
Sit down and design.,
Redesign if you have to.,
Ink the designs first be sure to make 3d designs.,
Scan your designs on the computer.

",How to Be a Good Interior Designer," What is the problem? What is the client trying to achieve? What is the size of the project? Have the client draw a plan of the house, apartment or design site. This can be all done through communications over the computer or by phone. Most clients requests for portfolios. There are ways a designer can have clients access their portfolio without the worry of people stealing them.;
, Some Designers charge by the hour and others charge a flat fee. Decide whether this is a pay per session method, pay before work or pay after. This can be done in the form of a credit card so that the Designer can use it to pay for materials and furniture. (Find out how to do this on ready made contracts for interior designers, or from books). Once the accounting part is in tact you can move on to designing.

, Ask them to pick out designs and furniture pieces the find in magazines or go online with them to find things that they like.

, You keep designing until the slightest hint of doubt is removed from your mind. use your creativity. Go to libraries and sea different ceiling designs, different floor designs etc. doing this will expand your imagination. Make every single thing in immense detail so that it's perfect.

, Be sure to make the plan flawless.

, Ink it to the slightest detail.

Consider the size.,
Think about the windows and doors.,
Hire a licensed architect to design your home, preferably a structural engineer and ask to see some of his previous designs.,
Hire a general contractor to build your home.,
Set a time frame to completion.,
Do a final walk through at completion.,
Remember that it is just a home, how many times do we really entertain, have friends over or a home show.",How to Build Your New Home," How much time will you spend in your home. How many bedrooms, bathrooms, and so on. Consider how much you have to spend. The average home should cost around $100 per square foot. (for the average homeowner)excluding the land cost.;
, Windows and doors should be a first consideration, instead of showing off your kitchen to your guests, the windows and doors should be your top priority, Purchase a top quality manufacturer and check for the National Fenestration Rating Council rating. This is a nationally recognized American rating on most top quality window products, this in turn will reduce your energy bills.

, Do not be afraid to ask how much the print will cost, most all have a set price per square foot to design your home. Be sure to ask if this cost will cover the additional request from the city planning dept. who will ultimately review your plan prior to issuing a permit. The architect should have all these changes included as part of his initial cost.

, They have your best interest in mind from start to finish. The best source to find a quality builder is to ask the local building inspectors in your area. A general contractor will charge a small percentage to recruit all the other trades to complete your home. This fee is to get all the other trades in and out from start to finish, oversee the quality of work and already has negotiated the subs fees, in other words these sub contractors would charge you a higher rate since you would only use them once, while the general contractor is using them all the time.

, Preferably start your home in early spring, you want to get the concrete poured above 40 degrees. In addition to this, if you are going into winter, you will have to pay for additional heat while the construction process progresses.

, This is a time to look at the finish product prior to close on the home, compile a checklist of items that are either not done or function poorly due to craftsmanship, This is a tough one. 90 percent of walkthroughs are looking at paint and drywall. This is the only thing most of them customers aware of. Take a moment instead and look at your doors, windows and other things less cosmetic, For instance doors:


Do they shut properly? slowly close the door and look at where it hits the frame.
Does it look symmetrical from top to bottom?
Does it close or open by itself? If so, these are things that tell you that there could be something wrong.
It would be beneficial to hire a consultant to go with you on your walk that has a background in the field.

Budget per square metre.,
Allow 5 to 10 percent of the construction costs to cover design fees.,
Get in a quantity surveyor to provide an accurate budget estimate early on in the building project.,
Consider the costs required for building consents.,
Budget for living away from home costs.,
Budget for landscaping as well as building.",How to Budget for Building," Ask your architect for a breakdown of costs per square metre for:


A finished building (interior as well as exterior)
An incomplete interior (where you can save a lot of money if you do the internal work yourself);
, This amount will vary depending on whether your architect only draws up the plans for you or also project-manages the construction.

, It is wise to do this as early as possible, as a quantity surveyor will be best placed to give you an accurate overview of the costs involved in the entire building project. This independent advice will be important, as your architect will often have ideas that don't fit within budget.

, These can add up quickly, especially if you have earthworks to consider. Find out in advance what consents will be required and find out the costs charged for each consent. If your architect cannot help you, find out from the local municipality's building consent area.

, If you are building from scratch, you will need to keep renting or owning the place you are in currently as well as funding the new build. If you're only renovating, you may still need to leave for a way if major renovations prevent normal living from carrying on. Unless you can bunk down with family, this will cost you extra money in rental accommodation.

, If you plan on fixing up exterior spaces and the garden as part of the build, these costs will also need to be taken into account, although you might consider staging the project rather than trying to bite off more than you can chew.

Learn something about building foundation engineering.,
Build under the house.,
Decide on an entrance method.,
Study basement construction techniques, making sure to pay attention to drainage and water penetration issues, as well as construction materials.,
Obtain necessary materials slowly and inconspicuously, preferably from towns or cities 2 to 4 hours away.,
Make sure you have somewhere to put the excavated dirt.,
Shore up your dirt walls.,
Ensure structural support if you are tunneling to make a larger lab than your initial downward hole.,
Make sure your walls are structured enough to hold back the dirt, hold up the structure above, and keep each other from falling inwards.,
Pour your new lab foundation same as any basement, ensuring a drainage route for flooding.

,
Provide power to your lab.,
Consider plumbing.,
Light your lab.,
Do any finishing (non-structural) construction you want.",How to Build a Secret Laboratory2," This doesn't mean get a degree, but what good is a secret lab if it caves in on you, especially if it takes your house with it?

,
If the house doesn't have a basement, but has a foundation, you can cut through the foundation and dig out a new 'basement' for your lab. This is where the engineering knowledge comes in handy. Depending on local laws, this is also likely to be illegal without permits, and very very difficult to get approved for a permit. See How to Dig Out a Basement in an Existing House.






If the house is a stilt house, there is less hassle in legality, but just as much engineering knowledge required to ensure the house doesn't slump or crumble down around you. Digging out the crawlspace to a decent height for walking around in is the method here.







, Secret door, false closet back wall, 'trap' door in the floor, classic bookshelf-door, stairs or ladder? A ladder takes the least floorspace from your excavation, but makes it very hard to bring in equipment and furniture. Stairs can take up a lot of space, but under-stairs storage can be very handy. Consider putting in two exits.

, Keep in mind that a huge truck pumping large quantities of concrete can be replaced by slow-setting concrete and a lot of endurance mixing it and pouring it yourself. Procrastination is not an option when it comes to cement.


Also study older construction techniques that have held up over the ages. If you have the time and supplies (and strength) you could build a rebar-reinforced granite wall by drilling through large granite blocks and connecting them with rebar through the holes, then seal with concrete. This combination of old and new will yield a strong wall that has a classical dungeon look to it.







, Collect materials in a hidden area, possibly a storage unit rented in a near-neighboring town, under a pseudonym if you can.

, This isn't a video game; dug out dirt doesn't just disappear! Large mounds of dirt in the back yard are sure to raise questions, though if you start a parallel garden makeover and spend time landscaping with the dirt, the questions are answered. More work, but more secrecy. One idea is to build a terraced garden, with levels held back by retaining walls (see How to Build a Dry Stack Retaining Rock Wall).

, Dirt always wants to settle, so make sure it is braced to stay in place as you dig! This is especially important in areas and seasons with a lot of rain. You cannot over-shore!

, This is related to shoring, but even more important. Failure here can mean death. Tunneling is not recommended unless you are a skilled tunnel engineer used to designing permanent tunnels like subway systems.

, Integrated beams between the walls can help maintain outward structural pressure, sacrificing a little headroom for safety.

,, Pull multiple taps off of several existing bedroom circuits (if newer wiring) or tap off of the least used house circuit (if older wiring). Know your house wiring techniques before doing any wiring, there are many books on the subject. If your lab power needs are too great for this wiring, get a new circuit installed by a licensed electrician, claiming for a high-power requirement laser printer, electric tankless water heater, new dryer, or power tools, depending on where the circuit will go, then tap off of that.

, While building, you might find yourself face-to-face with the guts of your house's plumbing while digging. If so, you are in luck, as you can quite easily tap off of these lines for source water. If you've also found your sewage line, that's good, but if you are below the level of the sewage line, you'll need to store and pump wastewater up to it. The waste tank will take up some of your precious excavated floorspace, and the pump will take up power. If your experiments need no water, you might consider not plumbing.

, Consider getting 'daylight' or 'full spectrum' bulbs for to avoid the life-force-sucking effects of normal fluorescent (office) lights. These can be obtained and used with extension cords during the excavation steps, and permanently installed at this step. See How to Make a Windowless Room Appear Light.

, This is important, since this is supposed to be a SECRET laboratory. If you want to, you can also put a large pond around the area. This can take a while.

,, Make sure the area is well hidden by the plants/trees, or the pond if you made one. Building the lab underground is likely not an option, since there could be bodies of water underneath the surface.

, Make sure that this is allowed, though. If not, you must risk building it on the surface.

, If there was water within the depth, building on the ground is your only option, so make sure the plants hide it well.

Select a machine for your project.,
Compare the rental cost versus the labor cost before investing in a weekend rental.,
Check out the range of machines at your rental business, and ask if they do demonstrations and allow customers to become familiar with the machine on their premises.,
Look over the operator's manual to be sure to be familiar with the location and exact description of the controls.,
Look at warning labels and stickers posted around the machine for other specific warnings or instructions on the particular machine you are going to rent or use.,
Have the excavator delivered, or arrange to pick it up from the rental business if you have access to a truck with a heavy duty trailer.,
Find a level, clear area to try the machine out in.,
Take a look around the machine to see if there is any loose or damaged parts that will make operating it hazardous.,
Mount your machine.,
Sit in the operator's seat and look around to familiarize yourself with the controls, gauges, and operator's restraint system.,
Grip the joysticks, and move them around a bit, to get the feel of their motion.,
Look down between your legs, and you will see two long steel rods with handles attached on top.,
Look down on the floor boards, and you will see two more, less used controls.,
Look on the right side, in front of the instrument cluster and you will see two more levers or control sticks.,
Start up your engine.,

Find a suitable place in your practice area to try out the digging function of the machine.,
Lower the dozer blade pushing forward the control handle on the front of the console on your right until it is firmly on the ground.,
Move the left joystick forward, and the secondary (outboard) boom segment will swing up (away from you).,
Move the left joystick to your left (being sure the bucket is clear of the ground, and there are no obstacles on your left).,
Keep practicing with these controls until you have a good feel for what they do.",How to Operate a Mini Excavator," Minis come in a variety of sizes, from super compact weighing less than 4000 pounds, to heavyweights that almost squeeze into the standard excavator class. If you are simply digging a small ditch for a DIY irrigation project, or your space is limited, go for the smallest size available at your tool rental business. For large landscaping projects, a 3 or 3.5 ton machine like a Bobcat 336 maybe better suited for the job.;
, Typically, mini excavators rent for about 150 dollars (US) per day, plus delivery, pick up, fuel charges, and insurance, so for a weekend project you will be spending about 250-300 dollars(US).

, Many large equipment rental businesses have a maintenance area where they will allow you to get the feel of the machine with some experienced supervision.

, This guide references most standard minis, including Kobelco, Bobcat, IHI, Case, and Kubota, but there are slight differences, even between these manufacturers.

, You will also notice maintenance information, specification charts, and other pertinent information as well as a manufacturer's tag for reference when ordering parts with the machine's serial number and information regarding where it was made.

, One advantage of a mini excavator is that it can be towed on a trailer using a standard pickup truck, provided the gross weight of the machine and trailer do not exceed the truck's capacity.

, Minis are stable, with a very good balance and fairly wide footprint for their size, but they can be overturned, so start out on firm, level ground.

, Look for oil leaks, other fluids dripping, lose control cables and linkages, damaged tracks, or other potential problems. Find your fire extinguisher location and check the engine lubricant and coolant levels. These are standard operating procedures for using any piece of construction equipment, so make a habit of giving any machine you operate, from a lawnmower to a bulldozer a once over before cranking it.

, You will find the arm rest/control assembly on the left (from the operator's seat) side of the machine flips up and out of the way to access the seat. Pull the lever (or handle) on the front end (not the joystick on top) up, and the whole thing will swing up and back. Grab the handhold attached to the rollover frame, step on the track, and pull yourself up to the deck, then swing in and have a seat. After being seated, pull the left armrest back down, and push the release lever to lock it into place.

, You should see the ignition key (or keypad, for digital engine starting systems) on the console on the right side, or overhead on your right. Make a mental note to keep an eye on the engine temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level while operating the machine. The seatbelt is there to keep you safe inside the machine's roll cage if it tips over. Use it.

, These sticks control the bucket/boom assembly, also known as the hoe(hence the name trackhoe for any track carriaged excavator) and the machine rotating function, which swings the upper part (or cab) of the machine around when operated. These sticks will always return to a neutral position when they are released, stopping any movement which is caused by their use.

, These are the drive/steer controls. Each controls the rotation of the track on the side it is located on, and pushing them forward causes the machine to move forward. Push an individual stick forward will cause the machine to turn in the opposite direction, pulling a stick backward will turn the machine in the direction of the stick pulled, and counter rotating (pushing one stick while pulling the other) the tracks will cause the machine to spin in one place. The farther your push or pull these controls, the faster the machine will move, so when it is time to crank up and go, operate these controls slowly and smoothly. Make sure you are aware of what direction the tracks are pointed before you travel. The blade is on the front. Pushing the levers away from you (forward) will move the tracks forward but if you have rotated the cab it will feel like you are traveling backwards. This can cause an unexpected side effect. If you try to move forward and the machine moves back your inertia will tend to make you lean forward, pushing the controls harder. This can be similar to the way the you must change your steering when driving a car in reverse, you will learn with time.

, On the left, you will see either a small pedal or a button operated with your left foot, this is the high speed control, used to boost the drive pump and speed the machine's travel when moving it from one location to another. This feature should only be used on smooth, level terrain in a straight path. On the right side is a pedal covered with a hinged steel plate. When you flip up the cover, you will see a two way pedal. This pedal pivots the machine's hoe left or right, so the machine doesn't have to swing to reach the location you need the bucket in. This should be used sparing and only on stable, level ground because the load will not be lined up with the counterweight so the machine can tip over much easier.

, The rear one is the throttle, which increases in the engine's RPMs, usually the further back it is pulled, the faster the engine speed. The larger handle is the front blade (or dozer blade) control. Pulling this lever raises the blade, pushing the handle lowers it. The blade can be used for grading, pushing debris, or filling holes, just like a bulldozer on a very small scale, but is also used to stabilize the machine while digging with the hoe.

, With the engine running, you must be careful to avoid accidentally bumping any of the control sticks previously described, since any movement of any of these controls will cause an instant response from your machine.

, Make sure the front blade and the hoe boom are both raised, and push the steering control levers forward. If you are not planning to do any grading work with the machine, using the dozer blade while in motion, you can control one stick with each hand. The sticks are located very close together so they can both be gripped with one hand, which is then twisted to push or pull the sticks while in motion, allowing your right hand to be free to raise or lower the dozer blade, so that it can be kept at the right height for the work you are doing.

, Always watch for hazards as you move the machine, since the boom may be farther away than you think, and can cause serious damage if it hits something.

, The joysticks on the armrests control the boom, pivot, and bucket motion, and they can be operated in one of two modes, commonly called backhoe or trackhoe mode, which is selected with a switch behind or on the left side of the seat on the floor board. Usually, these settings are labelled A or F, and the descriptions of the stick operations in this article are in the A mode.

, Grip both joysticks, being careful not to move them until you are ready. You will want to start out by raising and lowering the main (inboard) boom section first. This is done by pulling the right joystick straight back to raise it, pushing it forward to lower it. Moving the same joystick right or left either pulls the bucket in (scooping)by moving the stick to the left, or throws the bucket out (dumping) by moving it to the right. Raise and lower the boom a few times, and roll the bucket in and out to see how they feel.

, Pulling the stick in will swing the outer boom back toward you. A normal combination for scooping dirt from a hole is to lower the bucket into the soil, then pull back the left boom to pull the bucket through the soil toward you, while pulling the right stick to the left to scoop earth into the bucket.

, This will cause the complete cab of the machine to rotate on top of the tracks to the left. Move the stick slowly, since the machine will rotate pretty suddenly, a motion that takes some getting used to. Push the left joystick back to the right, and the machine will pivot to the right.

, Ideally, with enough practice, you will move each control without consciously thinking about it, focusing on watching the bucket do its job. When you feel confident with your ability, maneuver the machine into position, and get to work.

Purchase the chemicals you need.",How to Make Colored Fire1," While you can change the flames’ color to a variety of shades, it’s important to identify which you are most interested in so you know the right chemicals to use. You can change the fire’s color to blue, turquoise, red, pink, green, orange, purple, yellow, or white., To color the flames in your desired shade(s), you must choose the appropriate chemical(s). You should use them in powdered form, and don't substitute chlorates, nitrates, or permanganates, which produce harmful byproducts when they’re burned.To create blue flames, use copper chloride or calcium chloride.
To create turquoise flames, use copper sulfate.
To create red flames, use strontium chloride
To create pink flames, use lithium chloride.
To create light green flames, use borax.
To create green flames, use alum.
To create orange flames, use sodium chloride.
To create purple flames, use potassium chloride.
To create yellow flames, use sodium carbonate.
To create white flames, use magnesium sulfate.

, Some of the fire-coloring chemicals are common ingredients in household products so you can find them in grocery, hardware, or garden supply stores. You can buy other chemicals at chemical supply stores, fireplace shops, fireworks suppliers, or from online.Copper sulfate is used as a tree root killer for plumbers, so you can find it at most hardware or home improvement stores.
Sodium chloride is table salt, so you can purchase it at any grocery store.
Potassium chloride is used as a water softener salt, so you can purchase it at many hardware stores.
Borax is often used to wash clothing, so you can find it in the laundry section of most grocery stores.
Magnesium sulfate is found in epsom salts, so you can purchase it at most drugstores and pharmacies.
Copper chloride, calcium chloride, strontium chloride, lithium chloride, sodium carbonate, and alum must be purchased from chemical supply stores, fireplace shops, fireworks suppliers, or online retailers.

Build a campfire.,
Sprinkle a small amount of the chemical on the embers.,
Continue adding the chemicals until the color changes.",How to Make Colored Fire2," Sprinkling the chemicals directly on the fire typically works best on campfires. Allow your fire to burn until there is a bed of red embers beneath it and the flames have died down a bit.For the best results, the flames should be approximately 1 foot (30 cm) high.

, Start with just a pinch to test the chemical and ensure that no adverse reactions occur. Be sure to stand back a bit as you add the powder to the fire to protect yourself.Wear safety glasses and fire-resistant gloves when you add the chemicals to the fire.

, The first sprinkle of the chemical will likely not change the flames’ color, so you should keep adding more until you notice a change. In many cases, it can take up to a minute for the color change to be visible."

Add a wax cake to a burning fire.",How to Make Colored Fire3," Place a heatproof bowl over a pot of water that’s simmering on medium on the stove. Add several pieces of paraffin wax and allow them to heat until they’re completely melted.You can use blocks of canning wax from the grocery store or stubs from old candles for the wax.
Don’t melt the wax over an open flame or you may start a fire.

, Once the wax is fully melted, remove it from the double boiler. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 g) of the chemical, and mix well until it is fully incorporated into the wax., After you’ve mixed the chemical into the wax, let it cool for 5 to 10 minutes. While it is still liquid, pour it into paper cupcake wrappers to form the cakes.You can also use small paper cups to form the wax cakes.

, Once the paraffin wax is in the paper cupcake wrappers, let them sit out until the wax solidifies again. It should only take about an hour for them to fully set., When the wax cakes are set, peel one out of its paper wrapper. Throw it onto the hottest part of a burning fire, and as the wax melts, the flames will change color.You can add more than one wax cake with different chemicals to the fire at a time, but toss them on different parts of the fire.
The wax cakes work well in a campfire or a fireplace.

You can also use rolled-up newspapers., Mix 1 pound (454 g) of your chosen chemical per every gallon (3.78 liter) of water in a plastic container. Stir well to help the powder dissolve more quickly. For the best results, use a single chemical per container of water.You can use a glass container, but avoid metal containers, which may react with the chemicals.
Be sure to wear safety glasses and rubber gloves when mixing the chemical solution.
It’s best to mix the chemical solution outdoors because some of the chemicals may stain your work area.

, Place the wood materials in a mesh bag before submerging them in the solution. Weigh the bag down with a brick or other heavy object, and allow the wood to soak for 24 hours., Lift the bag out of the chemical solution, allowing it to drain for a moment over the container. Next, dump the wood pieces onto a sheet of newspaper and allow them to dry for another 24 hours.Be sure to wear protective gloves when lifting the wood out of the chemical solution.
If you don’t allow the wood pieces to dry out, you’ll have a hard time getting them to burn in your fire.

, Build a campfire or ignite a fire in your fireplace. When the fire has burned down to a low flame, toss the treated materials onto the fire and allow them to burn for several minutes until the colored flames appear."

The garden container must be non-flammable and wide enough for containing the campfire and flames. A large terracotta pot is ideal, glazed or unglazed. Do not use anything plastic.;
, Before drilling, pour some water in the bottom of the container in the location you will be drilling. The water will provide lubrication when drilling.

Note: tap water is good enough, imported or bottled water is not necessary.

,

Note: Hold the drill with both hands when starting to drill, as the drill bit will have a tendency to move around until the hole has been started.

, To determine the height of the burner support, measure the depth of the garden container and subtract in inches (centimeters) the height of the portable propane campfire bowl. This will give you the height of the burner support needed.,

Note: A 2x4 is 3 1⁄2’’x 1 1⁄2’’. You can also use 1x4 for smaller height adjustments, which are also not 1’’x 4’’.

,, Divide this number by 2 that will give you the proper length for part (B)., You will require 2 part (B) pieces for every layer., Repeat as required to build the support up to the proper level.

An easy way to do this is to create a life-sized cardboard or plywood template of your tile surround, laying it on the floor, and using actual tiles to create your design.Measure your firebox, then on a large piece of cardboard or plywood, draw the firebox's shape. Measure out from your firebox to the edge of the area you plan to tile, and draw this space on the cardboard as well. Then, cut it down to size.
Hold the cardboard up to the actual fireplace to make sure your measurements are correct. You can then use these measurements to determine how much tile you need to buy.
The easiest way to calculate the area you need to cover will be the multiply the height of your cardboard or plywood by the width. Then, calculate the area of the firebox in the same way, and subtract it from to the total area of the cardboard or plywood.
Then, lay your template on the floor. Get some tiles and start trying different arrangements and patterns on top of it. This part of the project can be a lot of fun, and is a good way to make sure you have enough tile and will be happy with the design. It will also give you a sense of how many tiles you may need to cut, or maybe even allow you avoid cutting any tiles at all.If you do this near the fireplace, you'll be able to pick tiles up directly from your template and mortar them into their corresponding spots on the actual fireplace surround.;
, You will almost certainly drip some mortar on the ground during this process.


It's also a good idea to get any furniture in the immediate area out of the way, both to protect it and to make sure you have enough space to work.,


If the mantle cannot be removed, tape the edges of the mantle with painter's tape where it meets the existing surround.If you don't remove the mantle, do remove any items that may be on top of it. You will be doing some drilling into the fireplace, and you don't want items to come down on your head while you are working., Depending on what type of surface you are tiling, you will either use thinset mortar or 1/4 inch cement board.


If your existing surround is drywall, you'll want to use cement board.Likewise, if you plan to tile only part of a brick surround, you may find cement board easier to work with.If you are planning to tile a brick surround in its entirely, you'll want to use mortar., If you are using cement board as the canvas for your tile masterpiece, cut it into pieces that are the correct size and shape to apply your tiles to. Then, simply screw the cement board into the wall or bricks with heavy duty masonry screws. You will need a masonry bit for your drill to drill the holes.Cement board cuts easily. If you score it with an ordinary saw, it will usually break cleanly along the scored line.
To make your surface as smooth as possible, it is a good idea to tape over the joints between the pieces of cement board., If you are mortaring over bricks to create your smooth surface, you'll want to use a thinset mortar with latex additive. Use a plastic bucket to mix the mortar, following the manufacturer's instructions on the packaging.


Properly mixed thinset should have roughly the consistency of peanut butter.Do not use an organic mastic for a project such as this. The heat from the fire may cause it to fail, resulting in the tiles closest to the fire falling off., Use a trowel to apply a layer evenly across the area you plan to tile, filling all the spaces between the bricks. Run the flat face of a finishing trowel over the thinset to smooth the surface.Allow the thinset mixture to dry overnight before proceeding any further.

, Using a measuring tape, locate the center of the firebox. Then use a level and a marker to draw a straight line from the center of the top of the firebox to the top of the area you plan to tile., Your ledge should be made from a 1 inch by 3 inch (2.54 cm by 7.62 cm) piece of wood. The wood should be long enough to extend the entire width of the area you want to tile. This will be your temporary support ledge for your upper field tiles.

, Hold the piece of wood so that the top edge is just slightly below the top edge of the firebox. Check to see that the ledge is level.


If the wood is not level when it is even with the top edge of the firebox, place the wood slightly below the top of the firebox on one side, rather than having it ride high on the other. This way, all of the surround will be tiled, rather than having a small space where your thinset is visible., Use your drill and masonry screws to secure the shelf at each end. Double check to ensure your shelf is level, otherwise all your tiles will be crooked.

, Use the same thinset/additive mixture you used to create your smooth surface. The additive helps create a better bond with your tiles, and it's a good idea let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes so the chemicals can react to one another.Mix up only about as much mortar as you can work with in 45 minutes. You don't want your thinset to dry out before you can use it., Apply the thinset mixture across the area above your support shelf, just wide enough to install a row of tile. Then, score the thinset mixture.


Comb the notched edge of the trowel through the mixture at an angle such that the scored lines runs parallel to your support shelf.

, Line up the middle of the first tile with the center line, resting the bottom edge on the shelf. Gently tip the tile into the thinset from the bottom to the top. Then, wiggle the tile gently to set it in place., Set additional tiles on either side of the center tile. Use the same method for placing the first tile. Make sure the tiles are level and spaced evenly. Alternate placing tiles on the left and right side of your row until you reach the outside edges.

, As you did for the first row, apply mortar and tiles, working up the center line row by row. Follow the design you have laid out on the cardboard or plywood until the upper field is completed.


Use spacers between your rows to ensure they are all the same distance apart., Once you've finished the upper field, let it dry before you proceed any further. This will take several hours, so you may want to just let it set overnight.

, Unscrew the masonry screws and take the wood down.

, Most likely, you will need to cut the tile or tiles you'll be placing at the bottom of each leg to make them fit. Taking into account the height of the legs (the untiled areas to the sides of the firebox), the height of the tiles you are using, and the width of your grout lines, you'll need to make an estimate of how much you'll need to cut off the bottom tile.


For example, imagine your legs are 37 inches tall. If your tiles are four inches tall, and your grout lines are 1/4 of an inch, this means that each row will be four and 1/4 inches tall. Eight rows of tiles would be 34 inches tall, which is not enough to fill the space, but nine rows of tiles would be 38 and 1/4 inches, which is too tall. Based on this, you know you'll need 8 rows of tiles, with a 3 inch space to fill at the bottom with a cut down tile or tiles.

, Trim your 1X3 piece of wood down to the height of the estimated space (e.g. 3 inches in the example above) and place it across the front of your fireplace, at the bottom, up against both legs. Check to ensure that it is level, and secure it in place with masonry screws.If you plan to lay a row of tile insides of legs, you'll need to cut a small piece of wood of the same height to place inside the legs.

, Mix up some more thinset, and then, using the same method as you used for the upper field, apply tiles above the support ledge and work your way upward. If you did your math right, you should fine that the tiles line up perfectly with the upper field, with room for a grout line.


As before, use spacers to keep the distance between your rows even.
After you're done, allow a few hours for the tiles to set and then remove the support ledge.

, You'll need to calculate how much to cut off each tile you'll be applying to the bottom of the legs. You already know how much space is left, but you'll need to account for a two grout lines as well (top and bottom). Measure and cut your tiles with a wet-cut tile saw., Apply thinset mixture to the back of a cut tile using the edge of a trowel. Gently push the tile in place and adjust until evenly positioned.


Repeat this process along the bottom of the surround. Allow several hours for the tiles to set.

, Clean between the tiles using a putty knife to chip away any excess thinset and tape over any art tiles or tiles with uneven surfaces that might get grout stuck in them. , Following the instructions on the packaging, mix your grout in a clean plastic bucket

, Using a grout float held at a 45 degree angle, push the grout between your tiles. Then, immediately do a second pass with the float to remove excess.

, After the grout sits for 15-30 minutes, wipe up the remaining excess grout with warm water and a sponge, changing the water often to keep it clean. Afterward, wipe the tiles with a dry towel to remove any remaining mud."

, Be sure that the burner's lid (provided it's adjustable) is completely open to avoid spillage. Replace the cap on the fuel's bottle to preserve any remaining fuel and prevent spillage.

, Any fuel outside of the burner's reservoir may create an uncontained hazard and therefore uncontrollable flame. Once the excess fuel is cleaned, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly prior to ignition.

, Once you've deemed it to be clear, use a long lighter or fireplace match. Place the flame over the burner's opening and the fireplace will ignite. A small, rapid ignition should be expected as combustion occurs.

, If you need to refill the fireplace, you must wait at least 15 minutes prior to adding more fuel. A small, hard-to-see flame may still be present at the bottom which may cause an explosive flame.

, Start shoveling the leftover ash into a bucket. You can avoid a cloud of ash by spraying it down with a little bit of water first.

, Once you have cleaned out the fireplace, you can inspect the interior of the firebox for cracked bricks or missing mortar. You might have to clear soot stains with a simple soap and water mixture to really get a good look at it.


If you find your firebox needs repair, it is best to consult a professional for a fireplace and chimney inspection.

, The flue allows smoke to move through the chimney and the damper is the opening you can adjust to control the intact of air and temperature of your fire.

, It should move quite easily and should be free of ash and debris.

, Open it as widely as possible and get in there with a stiff bristle brush, focusing on the edges. It might be hard to see, so have someone hold a flashlight up for you and put a mirror on the bottom of the firebox to help you see the hard-to-reach places.

, If you use your wood burning fireplace often, it is recommended that you have it swept out at least once a year at the beginning of winter.


Hiring a chimney sweep is the easiest and safest way to remove soot and debris from inside the chimney that could potentially cause a fire. Sweeping the chimney should be left to a professional, as having the appropriate tools and knowledge is necessary.

, Go outside and give your chimney an exterior inspection. Make sure that the chimney cap is in good shape. Check the following:


There’s no bird nest or debris buildup on the cap.
There are no tree limbs above or near the chimney.
The mortar and bricks on the chimney aren’t crumbling or missing.
The chimney rises at least 2 feet above where it exits the roof.
The chimney crown — the sloping cement shoulders at the top of the chimney — is beveled, which helps air flow.
The flue liner is visible above the chimney crown.
The chimney is plumb and not leaning to one side or the other.

Attach the remaining two drawer faces vertically on either side of the opening.,
Paint your faux fireplace.,
Make a base for your fireplace (optional).",How to Make a Fake Fireplace1," The dresser should be roughly the size that you want your faux fireplace to be. Be sure to look curbside – and don’t worry about the color.;
, This includes the screws and runners for the drawers. Your dresser should now be an open shell.

, Be sure to save the three nicest drawer faces and remove their handles; if necessary, fill any screw holes with wood putty, plaster, glue, etc. and let dry.

, In other words, the face of the drawer should be in the same position that the top drawer once was. Attach it by nailing it on with small, inconspicuous finishing nails or, preferably, by screwing it on starting from the inside of the dresser and screwing outwards through the back of the drawer face.

, Be sure to measure from the bottom of the newly-applied drawer face down to the bottom of the opening (but not to the floor).

, Since you will continue to “board up” the wide opening of the dresser by attaching a drawer face (oriented vertically) on either side of the opening, you will most likely need to adjust the size of either the drawer faces or of the dresser itself.


If the opening you measured in Step 5 is taller than the drawer faces are long, you will need to cut the bottom of the dresser off.
If the opening you measured in Step 5 is shorter than the drawer faces are long, you will need to cut one end of each drawer face off.

, One drawer face should slightly overlap the right-hand side of the opening, one drawer face should slightly overlap the left-hand side of the opening, and the tops of both drawer faces should be against the bottom of the already-attached drawer face. If you cut the ends off your drawer faces, be sure to orient the cut ends downwards for a clean look.


Attach them to the left and right sides of the dresser by nailing them on with small, inconspicuous finishing nails or, preferably, by screwing them on starting from the inside of the dresser and screwing outwards through the back of the drawer face.
To attach the side drawers to the top drawer, you will need small pieces of scrap wood. Align each piece across the gap between the drawers (inside the dresser) and screw it to both drawer faces.

, Paint the exterior with a glossy, off-white paint for a modern look. Be sure to paint the interior black to disguise the wood.

, If you cut the bottom of your dresser off to accommodate the drawer faces, your dresser will look unfinished when placed on the floor. To create a base, simply find an appropriately-sized coffee table, cut off the legs, paint it to match, and place it beneath the fireplace.

Find the gas source.,
Open the gas line.",How to Light a Gas Fireplace1," Gas for your fireplace will come from either a line of natural gas, usually connected to a utility company, or from a liquid propane tank outside your home. Go outside and look for the gas source to get the process started.


Natural gas lines are piped in from the street with a gas meter outside. Look around your house and property.
Propane is stored in a tank that will be either aboveground or buried.;
, This lets the gas flow from the line or tank into your home, so you can light your gas log.


If you have a natural gas line, check out the meter. Most meters have a flat valve that can be turned to either align with the pipe or not. If the gas is already on, the valve will be positioned parallel to the pipe. If the valve is set perpendicular to the pipe, the gas is off, so you'll need to turn it.If you have a propane tank, there should be a round valve that you turn counterclockwise to turn on the gas. The gauge will indicate if gas is flowing.

, Just make sure the mantelpiece is slightly wider than the width of your wooden squares.

, You may want to paint the wood to match the pillars (which are usually white) or paint everything a different color.

, You may need to use screws, nails, glue, or some combination thereof. (Don’t worry about keeping the tops and bottom of the wooden squares looking nice; these will be hidden.) Your pillars should now have a finished look.

, Again, you can screw, glue, or nail these, but be careful to keep your attachments inconspicuous. For example, if the squares at the tops of the pillars have enough corner area sticking out, you might nail a few well-placed finishing nails from these overhanging corners upwards into your mantle.

, Either use a piece of wood similar in size and shape to your mantelpiece and paint it or find an appropriately-sized coffee table, cut off the legs, paint it to match, and place it beneath the fireplace.

, This can be done with a stencil or you can paint the gray grout lines and add in red bricks later on. This will look rough, but real bricks don't look perfect anyway.

, These will become your base and mantle, so size them accordingly.

, You may want to use some Styrofoam to give the mantle and base some thickness; if this is the case, paint these the same color.

, Aileen's Craft Glue is a great glue for this purpose. Take care that the tape and glue are only on the back side of the piece and do not show from the front.

, Paint black/gray bricks on this one to make it look as if it has been charred/smoked. A sponge is a great tool for the grungy look.

, Place an electric light source (like an electric candle or extension cord with a night light port) inside the cavity of the fireplace. You can also place small logs over the electric candles so only their flames can be seen. Any logs obtained from the woods look great, and work well to add to a realistic feel. (Store bought formed fireplace logs are not suggested as they look fake and tend to be made to be MORE flammable.) Of course, you can always paint the flames in as well.

, Place some kindling on the grate left to right with another layer on top front to back.

, Add a good layer of not too scrunched newspaper try to lay it level.Build a kindling pile on top.

, Add at least two shovelfuls; you can cheat and add a couple of blazers smokeless fuel compressed logs as well., When the fire is well established, you should be able to notice how the fire has a very hot center and the coals have begun to burn.

, Smokeless fuel burns mainly from the bottom up, therefore it needs air from underneath, so keep the air gaps between the grates clear, but beware any poking should be from underneath and only to gently clear the air gaps while disturbing the fuel as little as possible. Smokeless fuel, if stirred, will go out."

Move your candle to a good area.,
Pull out a match.,
Trim the wick.,
Light the match.,
Turn the candle sideways.,
Hold the flame to the wick.,
Stay with the candle.",How to Light a Candle1," You should put your candle on a surface that's heat resistant, such as stone. That way, you won't risk catching the surface on fire. In addition, make sure the candle is in an area without drafts, as drafts can push the flame out from the candle, causing a fire.It's also a good idea to remove anything flammable near the candle, such as papers, fabric, or dried floral decorations.
Make sure the candle is at least a foot from curtains.;
, You can use regular-sized matches if the candle isn't too deep. If it is, you may need a fireplace match. Hold the end of the match between your finger-tips, so it has plenty of room to burn.If the candle is too big, you can also use a piece of spaghetti or fettuccine.If you don't have matches, you can use a toothpick, as well, but you'll need to move more quickly as the flame can move faster.

, If the wick is too long, it presents a potential hazard. The wick should be about 1/8th of an inch long before burning. You can use scissors or a wick trimmer to cut it., Strike the match on the side of the box to light it. If you're using a piece of spaghetti, you can light it from the match.If you don't have a match or lighter, you can use a gas stove to light it from the flame. You can also light a toothpick this way.You also press the end of the spaghetti against the heating element in a toaster or even the oven to light it. Just be sure to be extra careful not to touch any of the hot parts yourself.

, Turning the candle sideways helps keep you from getting burned. Since flames burn upwards, if you try to put your hand down in the candle, the flame is coming up towards your hand.When the candle is sideways, you can stick the match in sideways, and the flame will go up towards the side of the candle instead of your hand.While you don't want to move too slowly, as a flame goes down a match quickly, you also don't want to jerk too quickly and drop the match. Move in at a steady pace.

, Once you've got the match or spaghetti in the candle, hold the flame up to the wick sticking out. Watch to see when the wick ignites. When it does, remove your hand, and blow out the spaghetti or match. Set the candle back upright. For extra safety, run some water on the match or spaghetti before throwing it in the trash., While the candle is lit, it's important to stay with it. If you leave it unattended, you run the risk of catching something on fire."

Position the mantel around the fireplace.,
Mark the territory.,
Mark the location of the mounting board.,
Prepare the mounting boards.,
Locate and mark the wall studs.,
Affix the mounting boards to the wall.,
Mount the fireplace mantel.,
Put on the finishing touches.",How to Install a Fireplace Mantel1," Carefully adjust the mantel so that the fireplace is framed evenly, with the mantel extended an equal distance on either side of the hearth. Use the measuring tape to make sure the position is ideal, and follow with the use of a level to make sure the mantelpiece is perfectly horizontal.


You want to make sure the mantel is level not only side to side, but also front to back. Use a torpedo level to check the level front to back.;
, Using a piece of chalk or a pencil, make an outline around the edges of the mantel, both along the top and the sides of the fireplace. Once the marking is complete, pull the mantel away from the fireplace and position it face down on a smooth surface.

, Make a second set of lines, which will serve as the outer edge of the mounting boards, also called cleats.


One way to measure the cleat is to fit it into the back of the mantel like it will be on the wall. Use a measuring tape to measure the length from the top edge of the mantel to the bottom edge of the cleat. Place the measuring tape along the line drawn in step 2, and then use the measurement and draw a new line below the first. For example, if the length from the top of the mantel to the bottom of the cleat is 3"", measure 3"" down from the line on the wall and draw a second line.
Another method to measure the cleat is to measure the size of the inside of the mantel from the top of the shelf to the edge just above where you will place your cleat. Then, measure the length of the side of the cleat you will affix to the wall. Add those totals together. For example, if the measurement from the mantel shelf to the edge is 2"" and the length of the cleat is 1-3/8"", then your measurement will be 3-3/8"". Draw a line under the line on the wall using your measurement.

, The mounting boards will be affixed to the actual wall surrounding the hearth at strategic points, creating a framework for the mantel. A minimum of 3 mounting boards is required, 1 for the top and one for each side, although additional cleats can be used.


Measure the size of the mounting boards against the new markings on the wall, and use the saw to cut the cleats to size. The top cleat should be one foot shorter than the shelf.
Dry-fit the mounting boards in the mantel. The top cleat should be fitted first, then the two legs. They should fit snugly together, but don't have to be fitted perfectly. Make any adjustments to the length of the cleats if you need to.

, If you are attaching the mantel to dry wall, you will need to attach the cleats to three studs behind the mantel. When you have located the studs, make a mark in the middle of the stud along the cleat line.


Wall studs are meant to support and hold up dry wall on interior walls.When you are hanging heavy objects, such as a mantel, you want to make sure that you hang the object on the studs. The easiest way to find a wall stud is to use a stud finder, which can be purchased from a local home improvement store.
Studs are evenly spaced behind walls. In most houses, studs are spaced 16"" apart. Studs are usually 1.5"" in width. When you attach an object to a stud, you need to attach it in the middle of the stud, which is 3/4"" from the edge.
Try finding an electrical outlet on the wall. One side of the electrical outlet will be nailed to the stud. To locate which side, you can do the knock test. Using the heel of your hand, gently knock the wall on each side of the outlet. The side without the stud will sound hollow, while the side with the stud won't. After you have determined the side with the stud, measure 3/4"" from the side of the electrical outlet. This will be the center of the stud. Using a tape measure, you can mark the studs along the wall every 16"".
Another way to locate the studs is to look at the baseboards. Baseboards are nailed to studs, so if you find holes or indentations that have been painted over or caulked over, you can measure 16-24"" inches from that point to locate additional studs.

, Hold the cleat against the wall and align the bottom with the second set of drawn lines. The bottom edge of each cleat should line up along the top of the second line. Use the level to make sure the cleats are completely horizontal from left to right across the top and perfectly vertical from top to bottom on the sides.


Drill holes through the cleats and into the wall. Make sure each hole is drilled into the center of the studs you marked earlier. You can also nail the mounting boards to the studs instead of drilling holes.
If your wall is brick, make sure that you drill into the brick, not the mortar. Mortar doesn't have structural strength, so you want to avoid attaching the shelf to the mortar.Use a hammer drill, concrete screws, and masonry drill bits. If you are drilling into softer brick, a carbide-tipped bit in a power drill can work.Drilling into brick takes a lot of force and power, so make sure you have the holes exactly where you want them.
When you have the holes, complete the task by screwing the cleats into position using the drilled holes. Be sure to turn your hammer drill to regular drill mode before doing this.

, Push the mantel against the wall, using the drawn lines. The mantel should fit around the cleats, which hold it in position. Then use the drill to insert screws through the mantel and into the cleats. These screws should be roughly 16 inches apart.Fasten the mantel to the cleats along the top shelf and along the two legs.


You can also nail the mantel to the mounting boards if you wish.

, Attach the scribe molding. There will be a gap between the wall and the mantel, so the molding will cover this. You can use nails to attach the molding.


Apply wood putty to cover the screw heads, taking care to smooth the putty evenly with the surface of the mantel. Allow the putty to dry, and then paint to hide the holes completely.

Work with the theme of your room.,
Note the design of the mantle.,
Play with colors.,
Add some personal pictures.,
Hang a mirror above the mantle to make a small room look larger.,
Add some personal trinkets, knickknacks, and souvenirs.,
Bring in some nature with flowers, plants, or pieces of driftwood.,
Add some candles.,
Add some cards or postcards.,
Take advantage of the holidays.",How to Decorate a Fireplace Mantel," This will help tie the mantle into your room, and make it look as though it is part of the overall decor. If you use too much contrast, the mantle will stand out too much. Take note of the materials the things in your room are made out of, as well as their shapes and designs.


If your room has a lot of antique items in it, you may want to place some antique items on your mantle as well.
If your room has a specific theme to it, such as nautical, consider adding some items that match — such as a piece of rope tied into a sailor's knot, a model of a boat, and a life saver.;
, Is it very ornate or is it simple? Does it look rustic? This can help you figure out what sorts of items you should put on your mantle. If you are going to put up pictures or mirrors, it can even help you figure out what sort of frame to pick.


If your mantle looks very modern, go with a minimalist theme. Use plain picture frames, or organic decorations, such as driftwood branches.
If your mantle is very ornate, try adding some ornate picture frames or an antique vase.

, Match the decor of your mantel to the rest of your room, or create a contrast. For example, if the mantle and the wall behind it are both white, decorate it with something colorful. Try to match the colors to the furniture or curtains in the room. If the mantle is very dark, then use light-colored objects when decorating it.

, They can be photographs or paintings. They can be family-related, or something you created yourself. Pictures of animals and landscapes also work. Just make sure that you choose a frame with a style that fits the mantle. For example, if your mantle is ornate and covered with gold leaf, you wouldn't want to use a rustic, wooden frame.

, Again, choose a frame that compliments the mantle. You will also want to use a larger, thicker frame for larger mirrors.

, It can be as simple as a pretty rock or shell you found at the beach, or as complex as an antique doll. These personal items can also be spiritual, such as a statue of an angel, the Virgin Mary, or Buddha. They can also be related to your interests. For example, if you like sailing, consider putting up a model of a sailboat.

, If possible, try to use real plants, as fake ones (unless they're very high-quality) will make your mantle look cheap. The flowers can be potted, or in vases. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Match flowers to the season. For example, you can use poinsettias in the winter and tulips in the spring.
Hang garlands from the mantle using hooks. These can be made from fake plants. Ivy works great year-round, while evergreen works for winter.
Use pieces of driftwood or pinecones if you don't like (or can't have) flowers. They will work great with a natural, rustic theme.

, Use both tall and short pillar candles to add some variety, but try to keep them the same color or shade. For example, you can use all ivory candles, or a mixture of pink and red candles.


Consider setting the candles in glass ""hurricane"" vases, or on pretty chargers to keep your mantle clean.

, They can be cards that you received for special occasions, such as birthdays, weddings, and baby showers. They can also be related to the current holiday, such as Christmas or Easter. Change the cards out every month or so. This will keep your mantle looking interesting throughout the year.


For a twist: pin a piece of string across the mantle, then hang the cards from the string.

, They offer a great excuse to change your mantel. Here are some ideas to get you started:


For Valentines day, place a glass vase filled with red roses in the middle of your mantle. Arrange white or ivory candles to either side of the vase.
For Halloween, decorate the mantle with pumpkins and fall leaves.
For Christmas, drape an evergreen garland across your mantle. Decorate it with red berries, holly leaves, and a few white or ivory pillar candles.

Make sure that the fireplace is clean, and free of ashes and soot when it is not in use.,
Add color and fragrance with flowers.,
Place a ceramic piece inside.,
Put a basket with magazines or craft items inside.,
Put candles inside the fireplace and light them in the evenings.",How to Decorate a Fireplace1," This will help keep any decorations you place inside of it nice and clean. It will also make your fireplace look neater.


This section will give some ideas for decorating the inside of your fireplace. You do not have to use all of them. Instead, chose just a few that appeal to you the most.;
, Place some colorful flowers into a large vase, and tuck the vase inside the fireplace. You can also use potted plants, just make sure that they don't require a lot of sunlight. Also, make sure that the flowers and vase/pot are large, and proportionate to the fireplace.

, This can be an antique vase, or a statue. If the ceramic piece is very slender, consider flanking it with smaller ceramic pieces, candles, or potted plants.

, It can work as additional storage as long as it doesn’t look messy. Colorful balls of yarn will look pretty against the dark backdrop.

, You can use LED candles if you are concerned about safety. They are a great substitute for log-based fires and can look quite romantic or magical.

Make sure your candle is in a good place.,
Cut the wick.,
Get out your barbecue lighter.,
Tilt the candle a bit.,
Flick the lighter on.,
Hold the lighter to the wick.",How to Light a Candle2," Put on something heat resistant, so it doesn't catch the area on fire. Also, remove anything flammable from the area, such as paper.In addition, make sure your candle isn't too near curtains or anything else that could blow into it.
Also, feel for drafts, as drafts can blow the flame to something flammable., Your wick should be about 1/8th of an inch long. Cut it back to this height, as a long wick can be a safety issue. If you don't have a wick trimmer, just use scissors., These lighters are not cigarette lighters. They have a long barrel, meant for lighting a barbecue grill. You can find these in the barbecue section, but you'll also find them with other lighters.You can use a cigarette lighter on a shallow candle, but it won't work well on a deeper candle, as you're likely to burn yourself.

, With a longer barrel, you probably won't need to turn it completely sideways, but tilting it can help you light it.Hold the candle in your non-dominant hand and the lighter in your dominant hand. If the candle is short enough to use a cigarette lighter, you won't need to tilt it much at all.

, Adjust the flame height by moving the button on the side or top. Turn it towards the ""-"" to make the flame smaller. Also, most lighters have a safety that you need to push before you squeeze the trigger. Hold it down while you squeeze the trigger.Squeeze the trigger slowly, as the trigger starts the fuel. If you go too quickly, it won't reach the spark when it should to create a flame, meaning it may seem like it's not working.You need to hold the trigger down to keep the flame going.
With a cigarette lighter, you usually need to turn the wheel before you can push the button. It's a move you do in one fell swoop with your thumb.

, Put the flame in the candle. Let the flame go against the tip of the wick. Watch to see when it ignites, then pull the lighter away. Let go of the trigger to put the flame out, and set the candle upright on the surface.


Always pay attention to your burning candle. Don't leave it alone, as it can easily be blown into something flammable. You could have a fire before you know it.

"
"
Don't trim the wick the first time.,
Let it burn enough the first time.,
Don't burn it for short stretches.,
Use the foil trick.",How to Light a Candle3," Some people say that trimming the wick the first time you use a candle causes it to burn unevenly. A larger flame can help start the wax melting properly.However, always supervise the burn carefully.

, Your candle should burn for an hour for every inch it is in diameter, at least for the first time. Therefore, if you measure four inches across the top of the candle, that means it needs to burn for four hours.The purpose is that you want to make sure the whole top layer of the candle melts.
If it doesn't, you'll get a tunneling effect as the candle burns down. In other words, it will just melt down the center of the candle, instead of melting the whole candle.
Doing it this way will help you burn your candle more evenly.

, To prevent tunneling after you burn it the first time, you should burn it for longer stretches at a time rather than shorter. Shorter stretches won't melt the wax all the way to the edges like you want., Take a piece of foil folded over several times, and wrap it around the top of the candle. Tip it slightly over the top of the candle, forming a small lip.You can do it while the candle is light, though the top will be hot. Otherwise, light it after you put the foil on.This trick helps to melt the wax more evenly. You can get special lids for candles that achieve the same purpose."

Position the shelf on the wall.,
Prepare the cleat.,
Mark the cleat line on the wall.,
Locate the studs in the wall.,
Attach the mounting board to the wall.,
Install shelf.",How to Install a Fireplace Mantel2," Determine the exact placement of the mantel shelf above your fireplace. Most fireplace mantel shelves are placed 50-60 inches above the floor. When positioning your shelf, make sure to think about the combustible height. Since wood is a combustible  material, there are codes and guidelines that must be followed when placing a mantel over a combustible chamber, such as a fireplace.


If a mantel is 10"" wide, the minimum distance from the top of the fireplace is usually 19"". For an 8"" wide mantel, the distance is 17"", and for 6"" it's 15"".After levelling the shelf, draw a line on the wall that corresponds to the edge of the mantel. Make a mark in the direct center of your fireplace. You want to make sure your mantel isn't one-sided.

, The cleat is what holds the mantel shelf to the wall. The mounting board should be long enough to fit the width of your shelf.


Measure the length of the cleat. Then, using that measurement, find the center line and mark that on the cleat. You will line this mark up with the mark you made on the wall in Step 1.
The top of the cleat needs to have an angled edge, not a straight edge. Take a saw and cut a 45 degree angle lengthwise along one edge of the cleat. This is what the mantel hangs on.
Dry-fit the angled edge of the cleat into the mantel. Make sure they fit snugly together so that the mounting board will support the mantel.
If you do not want to saw an angled edge, you can use a flat edged cleat. Make sure your cleat is wide enough for the mantel to be fastened to the cleat with screws.

, Dry-fit the mounting board into the mantel. Using a tape measure, measure the length from the top edge of the mantel to the bottom edge of the cleat. Draw a second line beneath the line drawn on the wall from Step 1 using the measurement you just took.


If you do not want to measure the two pieces together, measure the length of the mantel and the length of the cleat. Add those two measurements together to determine how far to draw the second line beneath the first line.

, When you hang a mantel, you want to make sure that you hang the object on the studs. For a mantel shelf, you will probably have 3 studs.The easiest way to find a wall stud is to use a stud finder, which can be purchased from a local home improvement store.


In most houses, studs are spaced 16"" apart. Studs are usually 1.5"" in width. When you attach the shelf to the stud, you need to drill or nail into the middle of the stud, which is 3/4"" from the edge.
If you don't have a stud finder, try finding an electrical outlet on the wall. One side of the electrical outlet will be nailed to the stud. To locate which side the stud is on, use the heel of your hand and gently knock the wall on each side of the outlet. The side without the stud will sound hollow, while the side with the stud won't. After you have determined the side with the stud, measure 3/4"" from the side of the electrical outlet. This will be the center of the stud. Using a tape measure, you can mark the studs along the wall every 16"".

, Align the flat, bottom edge of the cleat with the bottom line. Make sure the cleat is level before you attach it to the wall.


If you are attaching the shelf to brick, try for around 5 screws.If you are attaching the shelf to dry wall, drill or nail into the studs.
Drill holes into the wood before you fasten it to the wall. This helps the wood not to split., If you are using an angled cleat, fit the shelf over the mounting board, making sure the shelf fits tightly against the wall. Make sure the shelf is level.


If you are using a flat cleat, fit the shelf over the mounting board. Then, fasten the shelf to the cleat along the back edge near the wall. You can either attach the mantel to the cleat using nails or screws. When attaching the mantel, you want to try to drill or nail in the center of the side of the cleat.

Keep a firescreen in front of the opening when you are not using it.,
Set a mirror in front of the opening of your fireplace.,
Display the fireplace tools.,
Add color and fragrance with some potted plants in front of the fireplace.,
Stack some logs or pinecones in front of the opening.,
Place a rug or a few arm chairs on the floor in front of the hearth.",How to Decorate a Fireplace2," Firescreens are usually made out of metal mesh or glass. Glass firescreens are often considered to be safer than mesh screens, because they don't allow sparks to pass through. You can get decorative ones, etched with frosted designs.


This section will give you ideas for what you can place on the hearth and around your fireplace. You do not have to use all of them. Instead, choose a few that appeal the most to you, and stick with them.

, It will reflect light and make the room seem bigger.

, If you own a fireplace, you likely own a rack to store extra rags and a fireplace tool set, complete with brushes, shovels, and pokers. Position the log rack to one side of the hearth, and the tool set to the other side.


If you own a log rack, be sure to keep several logs stacked on it. This is a good idea even for gas fireplaces that do not use logs; they can make the gas fireplace appear more convincing.

, One or two potted plants should be enough, so long as they cover the opening.


Evergreens and poinsettias are perfect for winter. Bulb plants, such as tulips and lilies, are perfect for the spring.

, If you are using pinecones, consider getting the scented kind. You can find them on arts and crafts stores during the fall and winter seasons.

, If you are using a bench or stool, consider draping a throw or blanket over it to make it cozier.

Make sure that the mantle is wide enough.,
Have a focal point.,
Arrange some ornaments, vases, or statues on the mantle.,
Add some color and fragrance with candles.,
Place family-related stuff and personal in the center.,
Bring the outdoors indoors.",How to Decorate a Fireplace3," Whatever you choose to display must not extend past the edge of the mantle. If the mantle is too narrow and the object is too wide, you risk having the object fall off and break.


This section will give you ideas for what you can place on top of your mantle. You do not have to use all of these ideas. Instead, pick out a few that appeal the most to you.

, Hang something large and bold above the mantle, such as a large photograph, mirror, or painting. Make sure that the frame matches the style of the mantle and the rest of the room. For example, if the mantle is very ornate, use an ornate frame. If the room is very modern, go for a sleek, modern frame.


Mirrors are great for smaller rooms because they can make them appear larger than they actually are.

, Try to choose objects that match the style of the room that the fireplace is in. For example, if the room has a Victorian feel to it, try to choose some vases or statues from the Victorian era. This will help prevent clashing. Also, try not to overcrowd the mantle. Less is more. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Statues or busts, particularly those of famous composers and historical figures
Pretty, porcelain bowls or vases, which you can later fill with cut flowers or potpourri.
Glassware, such as glass vases, bowls, and statues, which you can also fill with cut flowers or potpourri.

, Get some candles that you like, and arrange them on the mantle. To protect the mantle, place a coaster, charger, or tray beneath the candles. Whatever you decide to use should not extend past the edge of the mantle. Here are some more ideas to get you started:


White or ivory candles will fit with most rooms.
Match the candle to the room. For example, if the room has lots of blue in it, try to choose a blue candle.
Match the candle to the other items on the mantle. If the other items are mostly blue with a bit of cream, try picking out cream or ivory colored candle.
Mix and match the heights. Consider having some tall candles and some shorter ones.
Consider getting candles that match the holiday or season. For example, you might use a fresh, fruity scent for summer, and a warm, spicy scent for winter.

, This will help draw attention to some of the more sentimental items, such as a special family photograph, or a wedding portrait. Place photographs into frames that match both each other and the mantle. Keep the colors muted so as not to detract attention from the photos themselves. You don't have to just put up photographs. Here are some other ideas as well:


Children's artwork, diplomas, and awards can also work. Be sure to frame them first so as to protect them from soot.
Cards, such as birthday and Christmas cards, can make great seasonal decorations.
Handmade items, crafted by family members, can also be very special. Such items include figurines, wood carvings, and even handcrafted dolls. A fireplace mantle is the perfect place to display them.
Don't be ashamed to display personal awards, such trophies, ribbons, and paper awards.

, Natural things, such as rocks and pinecones, are great as breaking up the symmetry and monotony of a fireplace mantle. Their organic forms offer a spark of interest, and some can offer a flash of color. Here are some examples of what you can use:


Rocks and stones are great for adding that organic shape to your mantle. Crystals are great for adding that bit of sparkle.
Shells, pebbles, and sea glass look lovely displayed in a wide, shallow, glass bowl. You can also display larger shells on their own.
Pinecones are great for the fall and winter seasons. You can pick some up outside, or buy scented ones from the store.
Cut flowers in vases or potted flowers can add some color and fragrance.

Consider decorating for the holidays.,
Use ornaments, pine, and other evergreen for Christmas, Hanukkah, and the Winter Solstice.,
Use lots of pumpkins for Halloween or Thanksgiving.,
Use bulb flowers and softer colors for spring, but bear in mind the holidays.,
Use brighter colors during the summer.",How to Decorate a Fireplace4," This is a great option for those who do not have a lot of space in their homes. Seasonal decorations can take a lot of room. You can, however, limit your decorations to just the fireplace to save space. Your home will look festive without looking crowded or tacky. This section will give you some ideas.

, These decorations will also work for the winter season in general. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Use hooks to hang up Christmas stockings (use hooks if you are hanging them - tape will hold the empty stockings but full ones will fall from the weight).
Use rolled up tape or foam mounting tape to stick Christmas tree ornaments to the top of the mantle. Use large and small ornaments for balance. use ornaments, as used on trees, and use clear tape to stick it on the mantle.
If you celebrate Hanukkah, try including a menorah, a dreidel or two, and lots of blue and white.
If you don't celebrate any religious holidays, cut some evergreen branches, and spread them over the top of the mantle. You can also drape a pine garland or some string lights over the top of the mantle instead.

, There are some other items you can use as well, such as:


Place a cornucopia filled with dried corn, miniature pumpkins, and miniature squash in top of the mantle. If you have a large cornucopia, you can place it on the hearth instead.
Arrange some miniature pumpkins on the mantle for Halloween. As it gets closer to Thanksgiving, add some miniature squash and dried corn.
Make a spooky fireplace for Halloween by arranging candelabras, skulls, old candles, and potion bottles on the mantle. Place a cat statue or a jack-o-lantern on the hearth.
Drape a garland made out of fake fall leaves over the top of your mantle for quick, fall decorating. To make it more suitable for Halloween, add some fake cobwebs and plastic spiders.

, Softer colors, and bulb plants (such as daffodils, lilies, and tulips) will be suitable for most of the spring season. There are some holidays, however, where you might want to switch things up a bit. For example:


For Easter, place some colorful eggs into a basket, and place the basket on the mantle. You can also decorate the mantle with figurines of chicks, bunnies, and lambs. If the basket is large enough, you can also tuck it inside the fireplace.
For St. Patrick's Day, you could place a horse shoe (with the curved side down, like a ""U"" for good luck), or some plastic gold coins on the mantle. You can also add items that have Celtic knots on them.
For Valentine's Day, you could switch out some of the spring decor, and add some more red, pink, white, or ivory. You can also add lace doilies under candles for a more romantic look/
Most spring flowers, such as tulips and hyacinths, are poisonous to cats and dogs. You may want to consider getting fake ones instead., You can also use tropical plants, such as orchids and hibiscus. If you like candles, try to get ones with fruity scents, such as passion fruit, orange, or coconut. If bright, fruity, and tropical aren't your thing, consider using a sea-side theme instead, such as:


For a nautical theme, consider getting one o those bottles that has a model ship inside. You can also drape some netting over the top of the mantle.
For a seaside theme, try displaying some of the shells you found at the beach.
If you like candles, try getting some that have an ""ocean"" or ""seaside"" scent to them. They will usually be light blue in color.

Get your fireplace inspected annually.",How to Clean a Gas Fireplace," Before you begin cleaning your gas fireplace, you must first make sure you turn the gas valve to the “off” position. If you leave the gas running, it could cause a dangerous gas leak in your house.The gas valve is typically on the wall next to the fireplace.
You also need to wait until all of the gas fireplace components are cool before you begin the cleaning process.;
, Remove the gas logs from the fireplace and take them outside for cleaning. Use a soft paintbrush to brush away any dirt or debris from the logs. Be gentle with your brushing because you don’t want to damage the fragile logs.Be sure to check each log for signs of corrosion before returning them to the fireplace for use again.
When you replace the logs, put them back exactly as they were. Don’t rearrange them. The logs are designed and situated in a certain way to produce the best results.

, Remove each lava rock from the gas fireplace and place them on an old towel. Use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to go over each lava rock individually. This should suck up any loose dirt or grime that has settled on the rocks.If some of your lava rocks are too small to be vacuumed without getting sucked up in the machine, put a piece of cheesecloth over the nozzle of the vacuum cleaner and secure it with a rubber band.
You can also use the vacuum hose to clean up around the vent of the heat exchanger.

, Use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to clean up the inside of the fireplace. Stick the hose attachment into the interior and turn the vacuum cleaner on. Look specifically for spider webs and other dust bunnies that you can clean up with the vacuum cleaner.This will help you remove any dust or debris from the inside.

, Use fireplace glass cleaner to clean the glass covering of your gas fireplace. Spray the cleaner on a dry cloth and rub it in a circular motion on the glass. Once you have achieved the desired results, let the glass dry completely before you start another fire.You can purchase fireplace glass cleaner at any home improvement store.
You should not use regular glass cleaner like Windex for this task, as the ingredients in these kinds of cleaners can have adverse reactions to the carbon deposits that accumulate on the fireplace glass.

, Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away any excess soot or dirt that has accumulated over time. After each wipe, be sure to rinse out the cloth in warm water to keep it clean.Only use water to wipe down the inside of the gas fireplace. You don’t want to use a cleaner with harsh chemicals in it that could react badly with the heat from the fireplace.

, Take a soft cloth and dampen it with warm water. Use the cloth to wipe down the exterior framework of your gas fireplace. Make sure you continuously rinse out the cloth to remove any soot or dirt so that you don’t just keep reapplying it to the fireplace.Regardless of the material – marble, brass, gold, stone, etc. – water should work well enough to clean the exterior of your fireplace if you clean it regularly.

, If you need something stronger because there is a buildup of dust or soot, try using mild liquid dish soap. Pour a small amount of the liquid dish soap into a bowl of warm water and mix it together until it is sudsy.


Use a soft cloth dipped in the soapy water to gently wipe away any grime that has formed on the exterior.

, In order to make sure your gas fireplace keeps working properly for years to come, you’ll need to inspect all of the pieces on a regular basis. Take a look at the gasket to make sure it isn’t cracked or broken.You should also check the outside vent for the gas fireplace for any debris that could cause a problem. Leaves and animal nests often become problematic in outdoor fireplace vents.

, Your owner’s manual will provide you with detailed instructions on how to clean and care for your gas fireplace. It’s important that you follow these guidelines even when practicing at-home care and maintenance yourself.If you don’t follow the instructions in the owner’s manual, it’s possible that you could void the manufacturer’s warranty.

, Gas fireplaces should be inspected by a trained professional once every year. This will help ensure that your gas fireplace is functioning properly and that there is no potential for damage or harm. An inspector will look at all the pieces – including the logs and the lava rocks – to make sure all of the pieces are in proper working order.Most general handymen or home repair service people should be qualified to inspect fireplaces, but an HVAC specialist would be the best option.

Use a mirror to highlight your focal point.,
Be strategic about lighting.,
Decorate the area sparingly.,
Use plants to enhance the ambiance.,
Choose fabrics based on comfort.,
Select colors to set the mood you'd like to evoke.",How to Arrange Furniture Around a Fireplace," The way the seats are arranged with respect to one another will depend on your intended use of the space. In order to promote conversation, seats should face inward and toward each other. If you plan to watch television together, seats will tend to face in one direction., The distance between different seats can promote different types of interaction. Closely-spaced chairs are ideal for intimate conversation, while wider spacing is more suited to entertaining groups of friends who may need space to move about.

, The positioning of tables, credenzas, shelves, and other storage elements is more flexible than that of the chairs and sofas. Place them in convenient locations based on their intended uses.For instance, if you have a side table that you use to hold drinks, be sure that it is located within reach of a chair that you sit in often.

, If you have a small space, limit the pieces of furniture in the room; you want to prevent your room from feeling overcrowded. Make sure that your arrangement encourages conversation without overwhelming the room’s space., Open or square living rooms allow for more flexibility with furnishings. Pull furniture to the center of the room and arrange it around a small coffee table, for instance. If you have a long, narrow room instead, place furniture against the walls to make the space look larger.

, This arrangement begins with the sofa, as this is typically the largest piece of furniture. Place it at a 90-degree angle from the fireplace. This one-sided seating arrangement makes it easier to entertain large groups and opens up the other half of your room.

, This design starts with a sofa across from the fireplace, and incorporates two loveseats, each at a 90-degree angle from the fireplace, completing a “U” shape. Armchairs can replace the loveseats if you would prefer or if space is limited.

, You want to allow for a comfortable level of heat on a chilly night, so keep at least two or three feet of space between seating and the fire. Keeping some space between the fireplace and your furniture will emphasize the fireplace as the focal point., This will help to reinforce the fireplace’s role as the focal point of your room. After positioning your favorite seating element, the remaining chairs can be arranged based on your preferences.

, Most living rooms with fireplaces will also contain a television and other entertainment center components. Your goal is to keep the television from becoming its own visual focal point, which could detract from the beauty of the fireplace and make the room feel less focused.A convenient way to place the TV is by hanging it on the wall directly over the fireplace. This resolves two competing focal points by merging them into one.

, Your guests will assume that the room’s main attraction is wherever a large mirror is hung, if one exists in the room. Place one directly above or beside your fireplace to highlight its role as the room’s focal point., You do not want lighting to detract from the fireplace’s ambience. When arranging lamps, make sure that you accommodate the fireplace's light into your lighting scheme.A bright lamp placed right by the fireplace can deaden the lively and welcoming appearance of the flames, for example. Instead, position lamps away from the fireplace, and allow for a relatively low-light setting in which the fireplace can feature prominently.

, Try not to overdo the décor, as your fireplace will be the center of attention. Take advantage of this by placing your favorite photographs on the mantle. If you have a particular painting you would like to feature, hang it above the fireplace.

, Plants or flowers on either side of the fireplace can add a soothing feel to the room. Your guests will be able to breathe easier and will feel more relaxed around these reminders of nature, even if the plants are fake.

, Soft blankets and fabrics, especially handmade décor with crochet or knitted designs can enhance coziness in your room. Select comfortable fabrics with simple patterns for a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere., The colors you use will influence the tone and mood of people while they are gathered around the fireplace. Blue encourages relaxation and calmness, while purple is associated with luxury and can encourage creativity, so both would make good options. Crimson, however, has been proven to increase feelings of stress and anxiety."

Clear the pilot light line of soot.,
Blow dust out of the main burner.",How to Clean Gas Logs," Locate the control valve on your gas log system. It is the dial you use to ignite the fireplace. Turn the dial to the off setting. The burner valve in the system will close, restricting gas flow and shutting off the flames., The logs must only be handled when cool. Come back in an hour and move your hand over the front of the fireplace. Continue moving it into the unit as long as it does not feel hot., When removing the logs from the fireplace, set them out on newspaper, scrap paper, an old bedsheet, or other protective surface set on the floor near you. Choose something that you won’t mind getting sooty.


If you do not have the owner’s manual, take a picture of the log placement. Incorrect placement when you return the logs to the fireplace can void your warranty and lead to more soot.

, Once the logs are moved out of the fireplace, use a brush to remove the soot. A small paint brush or nylon scrub brush will reach soot in the cracks of the logs. You do not need to dip the brushes in water.Another option for cleaning includes using a vacuum cleaner to lift the soot. Some vacuums also have soft brush attachments that you can use to dislodge soot stuck in the cracks.
Avoid stiff scrubbers, lots of water, or harsh cleaners. These will chip or discolor the logs., To remove soot still clinging to the logs, use a dry, soft rag. Wipe it over the whole log. The soot should brush off without exposing the logs to water or cleaner that could damage the logs or create more soot.Cleaners should only be used if they are approved in the owner’s manual.

, If necessary, some logs can be treated with a small amount of water. Dip a soft cloth into lukewarm water, wringing out excess moisture. Wipe it over the logs to remove leftover soot. Check with your owner’s manual to make sure this treatment is okay.


If you are unsure, test the rag in an inconspicuous place, such as the back side of one log, first.

, Run your vacuum cleaner around the logs to pick up any of the soot you brushed off. This will ensure that the soot doesn’t spread throughout your home. Once done, dispose of the paper when you are ready to return the logs to the fireplace.

, Use a vacuum with a hose to reach into the fireplace and remove the soot that has collected on the floor. This can be done anytime, even without removing the logs, to reduce the amount of soot collecting in the fireplace., Use a compressor or a can of air no greater than 30 PSI for this. Locate the pilot light, which is where the flame lights the burners. On it, right next to its tip, is an oxygen depletion sensor that has two small holes in it. Blast air through the holes to clear them out., Follow the gas tube on the ground as it goes into the burner where the logs sit. There will be a hole or gap in the tube near where it meets the burner. This is where air mixes with gas. Clear it out using the compressor or air.

Close the fireplace doors.",How to Clean Fireplace Glass1," Do not try to clean the glass immediately after you have used the fireplace. Turn off your gas fireplace and ensure that the glass is cool when you try to clean it as this leads to the best results., Since gas fireplaces don’t require wood, many of them have glass doors that are locked in place rather than easily swinging open. You may have to refer to the owner’s manual or an online guide for your specific fireplace model to learn how to open the glass door.


Many models require you to release door latches placed behind upper and/or lower louvre panels in order to open the glass door., Your local home improvement store, fireplace retailer, or online fireplace retailer will all have special fireplace glass cleaners available.You should not use Windex or any other ammonia based glass cleaner as it could have adverse effects.This is because carbon is the primary source of buildup on the fireplace glass, and ammonia-based cleaners are not formulated to clean carbon deposits., Use a soft, dry cloth and pour some of the cleaner directly onto it before using the cloth to apply the cleaner to the glass.Your specific cleaner will provide instructions for the exact amount to use based on the size of your fireplace doors. However, it will probably be a dollop approximately the size of a fifty-cent piece., With the cleaner on the cloth, begin at one corner of the glass and rub in small circular motions to get an even application of the cleaner across the glass.Continue rubbing until the cloth easily glides across the glass. This is the indication that you have sufficiently cleaned off any buildup on the glass., Your specific cleaner will provide instructions on how long to allow the cleaner to dry. Ensure that you leave the cleaner on the glass for this full period, so it can continue penetrating any buildup., Use a separate soft, dry cloth to buff the remainder of the cleaner off the glass after it has dried.As you buff, any cloudy spots from the cleaner will disappear to reveal the sparkling glass beneath.

, If you have definitely buffed the cleaner away but some carbon buildup remains on the glass, repeat the process with another application of the fireplace glass cleaner.

, Once the glass is clean, you’re all set. Make sure you properly reattach the door or clip it back into place for gas fireplace models.

Dip the cloth in the fireplace ash.,
Scrub the sooty glass.,
Wipe away the paste.,
Use the solution to clean the glass.",How to Clean Fireplace Glass2," This method only works for wood-burning fireplaces since it requires the leftover ash from the fuel source, which gas fireplaces do not leave behind. Open the glass doors to access the sooty glass.

, You can use plain water if you wish, but adding the white vinegar helps break down the sooty carbon residue.Adding the mix to a spray bottle will make it easier to apply, and the mixture makes a good cleaner for other household surfaces as well.

, You don’t need to soak the towel or the cloth. Simply dampen it with the solution.

, Find a spot of fine ash in the fireplace and dip the cloth in it to get a light layer over the damp portion.Ensure that you only pick up the fine ash and not anything larger on the towel. Anything more abrasive than the fine ash can scratch the glass.

, The fine ash makes the perfect slightly abrasive material to scour the carbon residue on the glass. Scrub in small circles, but don’t worry about scrubbing too hard. You will likely have to apply more of the solution and dip the towel back into more ash several times as you go.


The soot and ash will work into a paste as you scrub along each section of glass. This is how you can tell when you’re adding enough of the solution and ash.
If any large pieces of residue are stuck to the glass and won’t budge, use a razor blade to break it down to something the paste can manage.Be very careful to contact the residue but not the glass with the razor blade. Otherwise, you risk scratching the glass.

, Once you have scrubbed the soot off all portions of the glass, wipe away the ash/solution scouring paste. You can use another paper towel to wipe it away.

, With the sooty paste wiped away, you can use the warm and vinegar solution and clean paper towels or a microfiber cloth to finish bringing the glass to a sparkle."

Cut your ""flames."",
Attach your flames to dowels.,
Arrange your dowels in the location you want your fire.,
Place your fan under the flame.,
Place your light source(s) under the flame dowels.,
Test your flame.,
Conceal your fan and lights.",How to Make a Fake Fire1," In this method, we use the airflow from a fan to cause a fake fabric ""flame"" to billow and blow. The size of your flame will depend on the desired size of your fake fire or the space limitations of your fireplace. Taking these measures into account, cut flames accordingly.


When it comes to cutting flames, you have several options. You may want to cut many thin strands of fabric to give your fire a thin, ""wisp-y"" appearance, or, alternatively, you may want to cut a flat flame-shaped sheet for a more robust look. You can even create a 3-dimensional flame by using a tented piece of fabric open at the bottom -- however, if you do this, be sure to cut several holes at the top for the air to pass through or you'll have a ""fat"", stationary flame.;
, The base of each fabric flame should be secured to a wooden dowel to keep the flame in place while allowing it to blow freely. Take each flame you've cut and attach its ""bottom"" to a dowel with a staple, tape, or other method that allows the rest of the flame to move freely. You may attach all your flames to one dowel, but for a more impressive, staggered effect, use several different dowels.


If you're using the ""tented"" flame described above, attach each side of its open bottom to two dowels so that its bottom is held slightly open. This allows air to flow through, inflating the flame.
Note - to be clear, flames should be attached to the long, round side of a dowel - not either end.

, Lay the ends of the flame dowels across cross pieces in your fireplace grate or across the top of a basket or coffee can, etc. Set your dowels so that they're spanning the space directly above where you want your fan to be. The dowels should run parallel to each other so that they present the wide face of each flame to the audience.

, Arrange your fan underneath your flames so that it blows ""up"" through them. If you're using a fireplace grate, this means putting the fan right underneath it. If you're using a basket, put the fan face-up at the bottom of the basket. If you're using a coffee can or other similar container, you may need to carefully cut the bottom out and secure the fan so that it blows up through the hole.


You may find that it's easiest to put your fake fire directly in front of an electrical outlet so that the fan's cord can't be seen stretching across the floor.

, Arrange red, orange, and/or yellow colored lights under your flames so that their light shines directly up into them. Theater rental companies should have colored lights available, but you may find it easier to simply shine normal flashlights through colored glass or cellophane.

, Before you finalize the arrangement of your flames, lights, and fan, it's smart to give them a test drive. If you can, dim the lights in the room, then turn on the colored lights and blower. If everything's working correctly, your flame should billow realistically, illuminated from below. If it doesn't, make adjustments as necessary and test again.

, Now that you know your fire works as intended, it's time to give it the appearance of a real fire instead of a fan-powered contraption. For instance, you might try placing logs over and around the flames. You might also want to spread fake ashes and burnt debris over and around the fire.


If you don't have real logs at your disposal, don't worry - you can make fake lightweight logs by cutting pool noodles into short sections and wrapping these in construction paper.
Another good idea is to mimic the appearance of ""coals"" by piling a string of LED or Christmas-style lights beneath the fire. The effect is best if you can find red or orange lights or if you put a layer of red or orange cellophane over the lights.

Make tissue flames.,
Make logs from paper towel rolls.,
Glue your logs and flames together.,
Add fake rocks (optional).,
Shine a flashlight behind your flames.,
Set up a fan behind your fire (optional).,
Finished.

",How to Make a Fake Fire2," You can arrange your flame-colored tissue paper in any way you see fit to make flames. When you're done, use a hot glue gun to stick your individual flames together into one multi-colored bonfire. One quick, easy way to create tissue flames that gives great results is as follows:


Lay a fresh sheet of tissue paper on a table before you. Pinch it gently in its center. Holding on to the sheet, whip your hand up quickly and gently catch the tissue paper. The force of pulling the tissue through the air should shape your tissue paper into a flame or bouquet shape. Handle it gently - it's easy to deform.

, Use a sharpie to make wood grain lines on several paper towel rolls or toilet tissue rolls. You may want to cut longer rolls in half so that your logs are similarly-sized.


If you have time, as an extra touch, try lightly soaking the paper towel rolls in water, crushing them in your hand, and allowing them to dry before drawing wood grain lines on them. This will give them a wrinkled, realistic appearance, mirroring real logs.

, Now that you have flames and logs, it's time to build a campfire. Arrange your logs in a way that looks like a real campfire - for instance, you may choose to have them lying in a loose pile or leaning against one another in a pyramid-like arrangement. Glue your logs securely in place with a hot glue gun. Next, glue your flames in place. For a realistic appearance, have some flames on top of the pile of logs with others emerging from the sides, as in a real fire.

, As an added decoration, you may want to add grey coals or rocks in and around your campfire. Doing this is easy - all you need to do is paint styrofoam packing peanuts grey (spray paint is cheap, easy, and works well). For bigger rocks, cut or break chunks from styrofoam packing material.

, Putting a small, well-concealed flashlight behind your fire is a great way to give it a flaming glow. Prop a small, medium-intensity flashlight so that it shines up into the base of the flames. Done correctly, this will make the flames at the base of the fire brightest, giving the impression that the fire is glowing with intensity.


You may find that conventional bulbs give a better effect than LED bulbs. LED bulbs usually give off a ""white"" light and can be quite bright, while conventional bulbs can have a warmer, slightly dimmer, more natural ""yellow"" glow.

, If you have space, a small, gentle fan can give your flames a constant rustling motion, mimicking the effect of real flames. If you can, have the fan blow up directly behind the fire, otherwise, set the fan at its lowest setting a few feet behind the fire. The flames shouldn't drastically bend or sway - you're looking for a gentle, subtle effect that's not too distracting.

Consider safety before all else.,
Purchase the right fire tools.,
Use the right firewood.,
Obtain your wood from reputable sources who can vouch and prove the origin of their wood supplies.,
Clean out the ash regularly.,
Have the chimney cleaned regularly.",How to Maintain an Open Fire in Your Home," Although the fire is confined to a fireplace, it still can present a fire hazard to your home. Some key safety considerations:


Before use each year, check that the chimney is cleared of debris and that birds or other animals haven't taken up residence in the top.
Keep furniture and furnishings a safe distance from the fireplace and ensure that any close furniture is able to withstand direct heat. Do not leave plastic furniture of any kind near a fireplace.
Keep a space around the fireplace that uses fireproof or fire resistant materials. Tiles, slate, concrete, etc. are appropriate materials to make a space around the fireplace for sparks to fall upon and self-extinguish. Do not have rugs, carpet, or flowing fabrics anywhere near this space around the fireplace - the risk of embers sparking a fire is too great. While natural fibers cope better with heat, all fibers risk catching on fire and should be kept well away; scorch marks can result on woolen sweaters for those who sit too close and if that happens, you are too close! Cotton and synthetics have no fire resistance, so take care wearing or hanging these anywhere near live flames.
Use a fire screen around the fireplace to prevent embers from sparking when you are too busy to tend to the fire, such as when leaving the room for any reason, or when caught up in conversation. Fire screens are very important when young children are around and youngsters should be taught early on about correct fire safety.;
, Do not skimp on quality fireplace tools. You need a poker, a shovel, a brush, and perhaps tongs to lift, shift, move logs and to clean up the ash mess after each fire dies down. Good tools result in safe handling of the fire.

, Not all woods prove to be good woods for burning. Some things to consider include:


Has the wood been obtained from a sustainable source? Do not burn wood needed to help biodiversity, such as hollow logs which provide homes, and do not burn any wood from endangered species of plants and trees.
Is the wood safe? Some wood is coated in creosote, or other forms of chemical to protect the wood against rotting, borers etc. When these woods burn, the toxins from the chemicals can be released and fill the air that you and your family breathe. Be aware especially of softwoods, as tend to get used a lot with chemical treatments. Know the origin of the wood and if you do not, err in favor of not burning it.
Some hardwood varieties don't burn well. Ask for advice from the business or person who provides you with the wood.
Is the wood dry and properly seasoned? Wet or improperly seasoned wood will not burn properly and can smoke, sputter, and even put out the fire.

, Ask for relevant authority certificates to verify their statements and get advice from trusted neighbors and friends.

, Although a tiresome job, ash left to pile up in a fireplace renders the fire less effective and is a respiratory health hazard. Remove after each fire burning, usually the morning after. Wear a mask to prevent respiratory distress from flying ash if this is a concern for you. Dispose of the ash responsibly and beware of hot coals still within the ash - you don't want a fire sparking in your garbage! It can be helpful to have a dirt pit in the yard to dig the coals into, and use the earth to quench the coals. When removing coals, always use a metal dustpan or scoop, not a plastic one which can melt when hot coals come into contact with it.

, Organize a professional chimney sweep to clean the chimney at least yearly. That way, you can be reassured that all is in order!

Check that the damper is open.,
If your fireplace has glass doors, open the doors 30 minutes before lighting your fire.,
Check the draft.,
Set up the base of your fire with newspaper and other tinder.,
Stack kindling on your tinder in a grid, creating a stable foundation for your larger logs.,
Stack one or two larger logs on top of your kindling base.,
Light the newspaper first.,
Open a window slightly.,
Add really big logs.,
Stir the wood down at least half an hour before you want it to go out.",How to Light a Fire in a Fireplace1," The damper is a device that controls the amount of air flowing through the flue. The flue is the passage or duct for smoke in a chimney. Feel inside the chimney or pop your head inside to look at the damper with a flashlight. There should be a lever which you can try moving one way or the other. One direction will close the damper, the other will open it — check to see that the damper is open, or else smoke will pour back into the room. This is much easier to do before lighting a fire in there. Once you have determined that the damper is open, you are ready to get started.;
, This will allow the inside of the fireplace to come to room temperature. Cold air is heavier than warm air, so if the outside is too cold, it can create a river of cold air flowing down the chimney, into the fireplace, and trapped there by the doors. By opening the doors and allowing some warm air from your room to rise up the chimney, it may be enough to start the draft moving upwards.

, Light a match near the opening of the flue and see if the draft is coming down or going up. If it is still coming down, you must find a way of reversing the draft and getting it to go up. Under no circumstances can you light the fire with the draft coming down. One method is to use a starter block (StarterLogg is one brand — break off a quarter of a stick) or a commercial wax log (such as Duraflame or Pine Mountain). These will light and stay lit, creating some warmth inside the firebox and helping the draft start upwards, and they burn with little smoke:

Close the damper. This will stop the air from coming down and pushing the air into your living area.
Put the block on the back of the fireplace shovel, light it and place it up inside the fireplace near the flue opening. What you are trying to do is to heat the upper part of the fireplace.
When you have heated it (you will need to use trial and error to determine how long this process is) slowly open the damper and with luck and skill you will find that the heat and fire from your little block will force the air up the chimney. When the draft has fully reversed (you will hear the air sucking the fire and heat from the starter block), you can safely light your fire.

, Newspaper or tinder will help light the fire and create plenty of flames in the beginning.


Crumple up four or five pages of newspaper into light bundles and place them on the grate as bedding. Don't use too much, or you'll generate a lot of unnecessary smoke.
If you don't have newspaper, you can use other Tinder to create flames. Tinder is light, dry material like dry moss, straw, tiny twigs, or newspaper that takes a spark. Tinder gets lit first and burns very quickly. The key is to get enough tinder under the kindling so that the kindling begins to burn.

, Kindling catches fire easier than big logs, helping generate a bigger flame in the beginning and sustaining the fire for a longer period of time.


Be sure to stack your kindling horizontally. This means laying it down flat, not standing it up on end. Additionally, leave gaps for air to pass through. Air is fuel to a fire.
Stack it in layers, criss-crossed. Stack two or three larger pieces of kindling on top of the newspaper, and then two or three more pieces on top of those at a perpendicular angle, creating a kind of grid. Continue stacking smaller pieces of kindling onto the grid, each new levels perpendicular to the last.

, Depending on your kindling placement, you may be able to fit a couple logs over your kindling securely.


Generally, opt for smaller logs over larger ones. Larger logs may look nicer and be more fun to burn, but they have larger surface areas, making them tougher to catch fire. Two logs that are the size of one is almost always preferable.
Stack the wood at most to two-thirds of the height of the fireplace. You don't want your fire to rage out of control when you light it.

, The kindling lights from that. Watch the smoke carefully for the first half hour. The smoke should be nearly undetectable if it's drafting right up the chimney.


If the smoke from the chimney turns black, the fire is not getting enough oxygen. Use your fireplace poker to lift the wood stack carefully; just pry it up a little, like jacking up a car. Take care here — all you need to do is allow some air to get under it. If your bed of coals underneath the grate is too high, use the poker to spread them out under the fire, leaving a couple of inches of air space.
If the smoke is grey, most of the combustible material is escaping through the chimney instead of burning.
You probably did not light the fire from above.
You may have used wet wood.
The fire is getting too much oxygen. Yes, this is confusing - fire is a delicate balance of air and fuel. When there's too much oxygen, the fire has a hard time catching hold of the fuel, and can make more smoke than normal.



, If you're still having trouble getting a good draft on the fireplace, and smoke is coming back into the room, try opening a window about an inch. This works best if the window is on a wall opposite the fireplace, with few obstructions — you will not want to have people seated between the window and fireplace. Sometimes, this breaks a kind of ""vapor lock"" on the room and allows the smoke to rise up the chimney.


If people are between the fireplace and window, they will be chilled because the fireplace will start to suck air up. It will start pulling hard from that window, which will create a stream of cold air running between the window and fireplace.
Stay out of the way and let it go — sometimes if the chimney isn't tall enough, this is the only way to get the draft running well and keep smoke out of the room. The rest of the room should stay warm, it's just the draft path that will be a little chilly.

, If you're trying to enjoy an evening, you can make sure the fire will go a while without tending by building it properly to start with. Once the fire is going well, you should begin to see some red, glowing embers beneath the fire.


As the smaller wood catches and the fire burns hot, grab a larger, thigh-sized piece of wood. Put that on top of the fire carefully, being as certain as possible that the stack is not leaning side to side any direction.
The bigger wood takes a while to catch fire, but once it does, it will burn a long time without you having to get up and stir it or move it around. The glowing embers will keep things hot, and you should be nice and toasty for a couple of hours this way.

, Break it up with your poker and try to spread it out as much as you can over the area of the firebox. The thinner it's spread, the quicker it will burn up and go out. Check after the fire is out to insure that the coals and embers are all dead. If so, close the damper so that you do not lose valuable home heat through the chimney all day long.

Put two large logs — the bigger the better — in parallel about 15 inches (38.1 cm) apart.,
Place one cross-bar across the two large logs.,
Crumple newspapers (not glossy paper) on the bottom of the fireplace.,
Place some kindling on top of the newspaper.,
Light the fire from the newspaper or tinder.,
Place some logs in between the large logs on top of the cross-bar.,
Finished.

",How to Light a Fire in a Fireplace2," Make sure they're perpendicular to the pane of the closed glass doors, or fireplace opening. These large logs will be the bed of the fire and contain the embers to feed it.

, This log should be about the diameter of your forearm, and it should rest parallel to the pane of the glass door or fireplace opening, closer to the opening of the fireplace.


This cross-bar will hold the other firewood and keep an air vent open where the fire can draw fresh air to feed it from underneath.

, Alternately, use other tinder like dried twigs or wood shavings as a base.

, Do not put any larger logs or fuel on top yet. If you can stack the kindling in a grid fashion, leaving plenty of space in between for air to pass through.

, Make sure that the kindle starts to burn — you'll want to hear crackling noises.

, Again, these logs should be (about half the diameter of your forearm, resting parallel wit the cross-bar. Keep this arrangement at all times: two logs, one cross-bar on top and firewood held by the cross-bar.

Using a permanent marker, make two marks on opposite sides of the bottom rim of one can.,
Using your tin cutters (very strong scissors might work here) cut out the rectangular area you marked in the previous step.,
Cut around the inner edge of the sardine tin so you have a small metal tray.,
Make two cuts on one of the longer sides of the sardine tin from the top to the bottom of the tin, and fold this panel out to form an extension of the bottom of the tin.,
Make a mark in the middle of the other side of the tin, between a quarter and a half inch up from the bottom.,
Place the cut out and widened steel can in the sardine tin with the back of the can up against the side where you drilled the hole.,
Push the marker through the hole in the sardine tin and mark the can.,

On the second can, make two marks on the opposite sides of the can a little more than one inch from the top.,
Insert the steel wire through one hole and thread it out the other.,
Take one of the cut out can bottoms from earlier and cut two slivers off of it, forming a more oblong shape.,
Mix up some high-temperature epoxy (about two peas' worth).,
Once the epoxy is cured, place the can with the steel wire (the damper segment) on top of the cut-out can with the sardine tin (the firebox segment).,
Align the damper segment so that the longer part of the steel wire points the same direction as the firebox opening.,
Remove the damper segment and squeeze a very generous ribbon of the high-temp silicone sealant around the top of the firebox segment.,
Straighten the damper segment to line up with the firebox segment and allow the sealant to cure as stated on the instructions.

",How to Build a Micro Sized Outdoor Fireplace from Recycled Materials3," Clamp the can to a table or other solid platform and drill holes slightly larger in diameter than the steel wire you will use where you made your marks.

, On the free end, bend about one half inch at a 90 degree angle so the wire doesn't pull back out. On the end attached to the spool, cut it about 3 inches (7.6 cm) and bend the same direction at a 90 degree angle as the other side. The bent steel wire ends must be pretty close to parallel with the damper inside to allow better control when operating the fireplace.

, This will be the damper plate. Drop it in the bottom of the can with the steel wire. Using the rectangular cutout from Firebox Assembly Step 2 as a support, maneuver the damper plate until it is held up against the steel wire from beneath. The long dimension on the damper plate should be parallel to the steel wire (small adjustments can be made in the next step). The bent steel wire ends must be pretty close to parallel with the damper inside to allow better control when operating the fireplace.

, Using a toothpick as a spreader, generously apply it so that it covers the steel wire and sticks to the can bottom piece. Now is the time to make sure the can bottom piece is aligned parallel to the steel wire. Leave the epoxy to cure overnight or for at least six hours.

, Test the damper by moving the longer side of the steel wire with your finger. If it snags, wiggle the it a bit to get it moving. If it swings freely, proceed to the next step. If it catches a lot, check inside to see where it catches; you may need to bend that area to get a smoother fit.

, Make a small mark at the junction to allow you to easily align it again.

, Place the damper segment back on the firebox segment and align it using your mark. Use a toothpick to spread the silicone sealant to fill any gaps.

Think of a tagline.,
Make sure you write about your film highlights.,
Use your character's name in order to carry your listener along.,
Avoid making your pitch too long.,
If you have a surprise ending, include it.,
Think about why you have a cliffhanger if your film ends with one.,
Keep in mind who will be reading or listening to your pitch.,
Include your contact details if your pitch is voluntary.",How to Write a Film Pitch," This should be a sentence (one line) that describes your film. It's purpose is to grab your reader's attention. Once you've thought of one, it'll be easier to expand on your story without writing too much. Your tagline may determine whether or not your reader will read on.;
, (Think: movie trailer.) They show enough for the audience to know what it's about and decide to go out and watch the film, but they don't reveal the entire contents of the film. When elaborating on your film, remember to try and keep your story original, so it doesn't sound like every other film ever made.


For example, a young teen enters a grocery store. As he's paying for items, armed men enter to rob the store. Shopkeeper doesn't cooperate and gets killed. The young teen is a witness. (A very basic and familiar story beginning, right?) Armed men decide to kidnap the young teen and decide to hold him hostage in hopes they will get paid for his return. Except no one turns up looking for him. (This is the beginning of your twist and originality).

, Also, if there is a well known character from another film that is similar to your character, mention that to give your listener a better sense of your character. For example, if your character is a Jack Sparrow type, saying ""Jack Sparrow type"" will let them better understand what you mean.

, The general rule for writing and delivering a pitch is, ""the shorter, the better."" This also depends on who will be receiving the pitch. In some situations, a time/word/page limit is given. (If so, be sure not to exceed it!) Try to keep it down to a few sentences if possible. If you don't need to elaborate, don't.


For example, 'Wedding Crashers' can be described using only the title. It's a film about people who crash a wedding. The only elaboration needed would be to explain how these wedding crashers are different from any others. What's their story? Do they have a motive?

, You're pitching to someone you want to invest or pay attention to your film, you need to be sure to pitch your entire story. Again, keep it short and sweet. Your aim is to intrigue your readers, not bore them to death.

, Is it absolutely necessary? If it is, steer clear of common, frequently repeated cliff-hangers such as "" ...and the rest is history."" Writing about your whole plot may help in selling your film.

, Pay attention to how busy and influential they are. And whether they will have time to read through it all. Time is of the essence. Pay attention to the demands of the reader. If your pitch is voluntary (the reader hasn't actually invited you to send a pitch), don't write too much. If they are interested in your story, they will contact you for a longer treatment or script.

, This includes your name, email address, and phone number. If it is appropriate, you can include an address or P.O. box to which that they can mail letters.

Gather your financial statements and information.,
Record your monthly income.,
List your fixed monthly expenses.,
List your variable monthly expenses.,
Total your monthly income and expenses.,
Adjust your variable expenses to hit your goal.,
Review your budget every month.",How to Understand Personal Finance Basics1," Creating a budget is one of the most important aspects of personal finance. A solid budget allows you to plan for how you’ll spend the money you bring in each month and illustrates your spending patterns. To begin, gather all the financial information you can, including bank statements, pay stubs, credit card bills, utility bills, investment account statements, and any other information you can think of.


Most people make monthly budgets so your goal is to figure out how much you make in a month and what your monthly expenses are. The more detail you can provide, the better your budget will be.;
, After gathering all of your financial data, separate out your sources of income. Record the amount of income you bring home in a month. Be sure to include any side jobs you have.If your income varies from month to month, it may be helpful to figure out your average monthly income for the last six months or so.

, Next, look over your financial documents and record any fixed expenses you have, or those that are essential and do not change much from month to month.


Fixed expenses can include things like mortgage payments or rent, credit card payments, car payments, and essential utilities like electric, water, and sewage., You also need to record your variable monthly expenses, which are items for which the amount of money you spend each month varies. These expenses are not necessarily essential and are likely where you will make adjustments to your spending in your budget.


Variable expenses can include things like groceries, gasoline, gym memberships, and eating out., Once you have recorded all of your income and expenses, both fixed and variable, total each category. Ultimately, you want your income to be larger than your expenses. If it is, you can then decide where it is best for you to spend your excess income. If your expenses are more than your income, you will need to make adjustments to your budget to cut your spending., If your budget shows you are spending more than you are earning in income, look at your variable expenses to find places you can cut back on spending, since these items are usually non-essential.


For example, if you are eating out four nights a week, you may have to cut this back to two nights a week. This will free up money you can put toward essential expenses like college loans or credit card debt.In addition, you may be paying unnecessary monthly fees, like overdraft or late fees. If you are spending money on these types of fees, work on making your payments on time and keeping a bit of a cushion in your bank account.Alternatively, you can work on earning more instead of spending less. Evaluate whether or not you can pick up a few extra hours of work a week, work overtime, or work any side jobs to increase the amount of money you’re bringing in each month., At the end of each month, take some time and review your spending over the past month. Did you stick to your budget? If not, where did you veer off course? Pinpointing where you are exceeding your budget will help you figure out what kind of spending you need to pay attention to most. Reviewing your budget can also be encouraging if you find you are sticking to it. You may find that it’s extremely motivating seeing the amount of money you saved by cutting back the number of days you eat out a week, for example."

Once the pellet has been fully engulfed for a minute, carefully add a second pellet.,
Add a third pellet two or three minutes after the second, but sooner if the flames seem to by dying down.,
After the third pellet is burning well, slowly close the damper to about halfway and watch the reaction.,
When you choose to stop feeding your fire, the last pellet will burn itself out into a glowing ember.",How to Build a Micro Sized Outdoor Fireplace from Recycled Materials8,", The steel wire ends show the angle the damper is pointing, they should be vertical. If you're not sure, look down the chimney to see what's happening inside.

, It might take a little while to catch, depending on the type of fire log you bought.

, This is easiest to place on the edge of the grate and slide it in with the pokers until it touches the first pellet. The second pellet will catch from the first; when you see the first stop flaming and become a little ember, you can push the second pellet further in. The pellets make very little ash, and the glowing remains will slowly burn down and fall through into the bottom of the sardine tin.

, This will take practice to determine when is best to add the next pellet.

, If you see the flame and smoke start to come out the front of the firebox, open the damper some until this stops. The most efficient operation is when the smoke all goes up the chimney, but is restricted enough to slow down and heat the cans, causing them to radiate the heat out. Every fireplace will be different, so you will need to experiment with how to best work the damper.

, There will be a little smoke when this happens, but not as much as normal wood would produce. Let the fire go out completely and allow the fireplace to cool before moving or disassembling the chimney.

Pay more than the minimum amount due each month.,
Transfer credit card balances with high annual percentage rates.,
Calculate the amount of debt on each credit card.,
Dedicate excess funds toward paying off debt.,
Consolidate your debt.,
Refinance your loans.,
Choose a student loan repayment plan.",How to Understand Personal Finance Basics2," Even following a strict budget doesn’t mean you can totally avoid debt. Large purchases, like cars, school, and houses often require you to take out a significant loan. In addition, it can be easy to rack up credit card debt quickly. One of the personal finance basics you must understand is how to take care of this debt as quickly as possible. The first step to doing this is to pay more than the minimum payment as often as you can.


For example, say the minimum payment on your car loan is $50 a month. Paying even $60 a month toward this loan can help you pay it off sooner and cut down on the amount you pay in finance charges over time. The more you can pay above the minimum, the better., If you have a credit card for which you are paying a high annual percentage rate (APR), it might be a good idea to look into transferring this balance to a credit card that offers a lower APR or no APR for a certain amount of time. This way, your entire payment will be applied to your balance, not interest.


Read the fine print before transferring a balance. Most cards charge a transfer fee (3% of the balance, for example) and only offer 0% APR for a limited amount of time (12 or 18 months, for example). Make sure you understand the terms of your new agreement and shop around for the best option before transferring your balance., If you have multiple credit cards, compare the amount of debt you have on each one. You can use this information in two different ways:


Some people believe paying off the credit card with the smallest balance first is best. The idea here is that getting the smaller amount of debt paid off will motivate you and allow you to focus on your remaining debt.
Alternatively, some people believe you should focus on paying off the largest balance because you will be paying the most in interest on this balance. To do this, you would try to make more than the minimum payment on this balance, while paying only the minimum on your smaller balance.
If possible, the best solution is to pay more than the minimum simultaneously on each balance., Once you are able to follow your monthly budget, dedicate any extra funds you have at the end of the month toward paying down your debt. It can be tempting to use this money to treat yourself to a fancy dinner or a new TV, but remember your long-term goals before doing this. In the long run, paying down debt will serve you better than treating yourself to something unnecessary., If you have multiple credit card accounts, student loans, a mortgage, a car loan, or any combination of these debts, consolidating them into one payment may help you manage them more easily. Typically, when you consolidate debt, you’ll get a debt consolidation loan. These loans usually have a lower interest rate and require lower monthly payments.


While consolidating your debt can make it easier to manage, it may also increase the amount you’ll pay in the long run because it extends your payments over a longer period of time.
If your credit score is not good, you may need a co-signer to be able to get a debt consolidation loan.You can also consolidate your credit card debt by transferring all of your balances to a 0% APR credit card. If you think you can pay off your debt within 12 to 18 months, this might be a good option. However, if you think it will take you significantly longer to pay it off, this might not be a good option because the 0% APR is usually only good for 12 to 18 months., Refinancing is generally a good option if your financial situation has improved since taking out your loan. Similar to consolidating your debt, refinancing your loans also consolidates your debts and may allow you to make lower monthly payments on your loans. Refinancing might also allow you to shorten the term of your loan to pay off your debts more quickly. In addition, depending on your financial situation, you may also be eligible for a lower interest rate., If you can afford it, the standard repayment plan is your best option for repaying federal loans. A standard plan requires you to pay the same amount every month over a ten year period. If you can’t afford the payments on a standard plan, however, the government offers two alternative categories of plans—income-driven and basic.


Income-driven repayment plans extend the terms of your loan to 20 or 25 years and require you to pay a certain percentage of your income toward your loan each month, rather than a fixed monthly payment. In addition, any amount still owed at the end of your loan term is forgiven.
Basic plans include standard, graduated, and extended repayment options. Standard is the best option if you can afford it, but graduated or extended plans may be right in some situations. Graduated plans start you off with low payments and gradually increase them over time. This plan can be good if you expect to make more money over the years. Extended plans extend the terms of your loan to 25 years, allowing you to make smaller payments each month, but pay more in interest over time."

Set up automatic deposits.,
Contribute to a retirement savings plan.,
Build an emergency fund.",How to Understand Personal Finance Basics3," It can be tough to commit to putting money into your savings account every month, but it is important to do so to ensure you have enough money for emergencies and for your future. If possible, make automatic payments into a saving account each month.


For example, set your bank account so it automatically transfers $50 from your checking account to savings account at least once a month.
Or, if your paycheck gets deposited directly into your account, you can usually set it up so that a certain portion (either a dollar amount or a percentage) is deposited straight into your savings account. Most professionals recommend putting 10 to 20 percent of your income towards savings each month., You should start saving for retirement as soon as possible to ensure you’ll have enough money to live comfortably when you are done working. The amount you need to contribute to this savings account monthly depends on a number of different factors, like when you start saving, how much you are starting with, and whether or not you’re going to receive any kind of employer contribution.


Many employers offer a 401k, or a retirement savings plan, of some kind to their employees. A lot of companies will also match a percentage of the employee’s contributions into this account over time. If your employer offers a plan of this sort, start contributing to it as soon as you can, even if it is just a small amount.
If you are self-employed or your employer does not offer any kind of retirement savings plan, you can set up your own plan through investment websites or many banks.
Consult a financial advisor to figure out how much you should be putting away for retirement to reach your goals., In addition to saving for retirement, you also need to save for emergencies, like losing a job, costly car repairs, or unexpected medical expenses. You can use your bank’s savings account for this emergency fund.


Financial professionals recommend you have enough in your savings account to cover a month and a half of living expenses for each person you claim as a dependent. For example, if you are married with one child, you should have enough to cover four and a half months of living expenses."

Invest in a Target Date Fund (TDF).,
Diversify your investments.,
Invest in your 401k.,
Invest in a Roth IRA.",How to Understand Personal Finance Basics4," Figuring out where to invest your money is one of the hardest parts of personal finance basics. Essentially, you want to invest in a variety of stocks, bonds, and treasuries—but which ones? Target Date Funds make this a little easier for you. A TDF is basically a hands-off retirement account. You enter the age you want to retire and the TDF will automatically spread the money you put into this account across a wide variety of stocks, bonds, and treasuries.


Some of the recommended companies through which to do this are Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price., If you choose a more hands-on approach to investing, it is important to diversify your portfolio to reduce risk. Diversifying means that you choose a variety of stocks, bonds, and treasuries in which to invest. You should make sure your investments are spread over a number of different companies and industries. This way, if one company or industry suffers a financial downturn, you will only lose a portion of your investment, not the whole thing., As mentioned above, investing in a 401k provided by your company is a good idea. There are a couple really good things about this option. First of all, most of the time, the money you put into a 401k is deferred on your taxes until you take it out of the account. Some 401ks are taxed before investing, however, so check with your employer to find out which one you have. Second, your employer will often match the amount of money in your 401k (up to a certain amount) so you are, essentially, getting free money just for investing.


You should invest in a company match 401k even if you are in debt. The return you receive on this type of investing is often more than what your debt is.The amount of money your company will match often depends how much you invest in your 401k. Usually, you have to hit certain investment thresholds, which will then determine the percentage your company will match., Another investment opportunity offered by many employers is a Roth IRA. In a Roth IRA, you pay taxes up front on your investment. Investing in a Roth IRA is an especially good idea for young people with low incomes, considering the tax rate will likely increase in their lifetime. This type of investment can be very helpful because it will provide you with a pot of money for your retirement that won’t shrink due to taxes."

Check that the damper is open.,
If your woodburning heater has glass doors, open the doors 30 minutes before lighting your fire.,
Check the draft.,
Set up the base of your fire with newspaper and other tinder.,
Stack kindling on your tinder in a grid, creating a stable foundation for your larger logs.,
Stack one or two larger logs on top of your kindling base.,
Light the newspaper first.,
Open a window slightly.,
Add larger logs.,
Stir the wood down at least half an hour before you want it to go out.",How to Build a Fire in a Woodburning Heater1," The damper is a device that controls the amount of air flowing through the flue. The flue is the passage or duct for smoke in a stovepipe or chimney. There should be a lever which you can try moving one way or the other. One direction will close the damper, the other will open it — check to see that the damper is open, or else smoke will pour back into the room. This is much easier to do before lighting a fire in there. Once you have determined that the damper is open, you are ready to get started.;
, This will allow the inside of the fireplace to come to room temperature. Cold air is heavier than warm air, so if the outside is too cold, it can create a river of cold air flowing down the stovepipe or chimney, into the woodburning stove, leaving it trapped there by the doors. By opening the doors and allowing some warm air from your room to rise up the chimney, it may be enough to start the draft moving upwards.

, Light a match near the opening of the flue and see if the draft is coming down or going up. If it is still coming down, you must find a way of reversing the draft and getting it to go up. Under no circumstances can you light the fire with the draft coming down. One method is to use a starter block (StarterLogg is one brand — break off a quarter of a stick) or a commercial wax log (such as Duraflame or Pine Mountain). These will light and stay lit, creating some warmth inside the woodburning heater and helping the draft start upwards, and they burn with little smoke:

Close the damper. This will stop the air from coming down and pushing the air into your living area. Most woodburning stoves, in addition to a damper, have a vent that restricts the air entering into the woodburning heater, so you can use this instead of the damper to control the air flow.
Put the block on the back of the fireplace shovel, light it and place it up inside the woodburning heater, near the flue opening. What you are trying to do is to heat the upper part of the heater.
When you have heated it (you will need to use trial and error to determine how long this process is), slowly open the damper and with luck and skill you will find that the heat and fire from your little block will force the air up the chimney. When the draft has fully reversed (you will hear the air sucking the fire and heat from the starter block), you can safely light your fire.

, Newspaper or tinder will help light the fire and create plenty of flames in the beginning.


Crumple up four or five pages of newspaper into light bundles and place them on the grate as bedding. Don't use too much, or you'll generate a lot of unnecessary smoke.
If you don't have newspaper, you can use other Tinder to create flames. Tinder is light, dry material like dry moss, straw, tiny twigs, or newspaper that takes a spark. Tinder gets lit first and burns very quickly. The key is to get enough tinder under the kindling so that the kindling begins to burn.

, Kindling catches fire more easily than big logs, helping generate a bigger flame in the beginning and sustaining the fire for a longer period of time.


Be sure to stack your kindling horizontally. This means laying it down flat, not standing it up on end. Additionally, leave gaps for air to pass through. Air is fuel to a fire.
Stack it in layers, criss-crossed. Stack two or three larger pieces of kindling on top of the newspaper, and then two or three more pieces on top of those, at a perpendicular angle, creating a kind of grid. Continue stacking smaller pieces of kindling onto the grid, each new level perpendicular to the last.

, Depending on your kindling placement, you may be able to fit a couple of logs over your kindling securely.


Generally, opt for smaller logs over larger ones. Larger logs may look nicer and be more fun to burn, but they have larger surface areas, making them tougher to catch fire. Two logs that are equal in size to one is almost always preferable.
Stack the wood at most to two-thirds of the height of the firebox. You don't want your fire to rage out of control when you light it.

, The kindling will ignite from that. Watch the smoke carefully for the first half hour. The smoke should be nearly undetectable if it's drafting right up the flue.


If the smoke from the chimney turns black, the fire is not getting enough oxygen. Use your fireplace poker to lift the wood stack carefully; just pry it up a little, like jacking up a car. Take care here — all you need to do is allow some air to get under it. If your bed of coals underneath the grate is too high, use the poker to spread them out under the fire, leaving a couple of inches of air space.
If the smoke is grey, most of the combustible material is escaping through the chimney instead of burning.
You probably did not light the fire from above.
You may have used wet wood.
The fire is getting too much oxygen. Yes, this is confusing - fire is a delicate balance of air and fuel. When there's too much oxygen, the fire has a hard time catching hold of the fuel, and can make more smoke than normal.



, If you're still having trouble getting a good draft on the fireplace, and smoke is coming back into the room, try opening a window about an inch (2.5cm). This works best if the window is on a wall opposite the wood heater, with few obstructions — you will not want to have people seated between the window and heater. Sometimes, this breaks a kind of ""vapor lock"" on the room and allows the smoke to rise up the chimney.


If people are between the wood heater and window, they will be chilled because the wood heater will start to suck air up. It will start pulling hard from that window, which will create a stream of cold air running between the window and wood heater.
Stay out of the way and let it go — sometimes if the chimney isn't tall enough, this is the only way to get the draft running well and keep smoke out of the room. The rest of the room should stay warm - it's just the draft path that will be a little chilly.

, If you're trying to enjoy an evening, you can make sure the fire will go a while without tending by building it properly to start with. Once the fire is going well, you should begin to see some red, glowing embers beneath the fire.


As the smaller wood catches and the fire burns hot, grab a larger piece of wood. Put that on top of the fire carefully, being as certain as possible that the stack is not leaning side to side any direction.
The bigger wood takes a while to catch fire, but once it does, it will burn a long time without you having to get up and stir it or move it around. The glowing embers will keep things hot, and you should be nice and toasty for a couple of hours this way.

, Break it up with your poker and try to spread it out as much as you can over the area of the firebox. The thinner it's spread, the quicker it will burn up and go out. Check after the fire is out to insure that the coals and embers are all dead. If so, close the damper so that you do not lose valuable home heat through the chimney all day long.

Revise your compensation plan.",How to Write a Compensation Plan," Sit down and list out all of the employees you will need to run your business. If you have no idea, then reach out to another business owner in your industry and ask.


For example, you might need one part-time receptionist, a personal assistant, and two full-time associates.
Be as comprehensive as possible. If you find out you need to add staff, then you’ll need to find the money to pay this person. You won’t be able to reduce your current employees’ compensation to pay for them.;
, You need to write out a description of a job so that you can find salaries of comparable jobs. For example, what you think a receptionist might do could be what most businesses have personal assistants do. You want to pay a reasonable salary based on job requirements and skills, not title. A proper job description should include the following:job title
day-to-day responsibilities, such as “answers the phones and forwards caller to appropriate personnel”
educational experience (high school or GED, associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree, etc.)
years of required experience
soft skills, such as the ability to accept criticism and work as part of a team

, You should pay a competitive salary so that you don’t lose employees. However, you need to decide whether you will pay above market salaries in order to attract top talent.Before you can make that decision, you should research salaries for comparable jobs. Take out your job description and see how much other businesses pay people for comparable employees. You can research in the following ways:


Use websites to check salaries in your area. You can use PayScale, Indeed.com, Glassdoor, or Salary.com.
Talk to other business owners. You can ask other owners what they pay their staff.
Search job advertisements. The ad should list the starting salary range for each position, which will give you some idea of the prevailing rate. Make sure the employer is of similar size.

, Employee overtime is generally compensated at 1.5 times the employee’s regular base rate of pay. Accordingly, you should decide whether you’ll have employees work overtime, and which ones. You’ll need to account for this amount of money.


It’s not true that salaried employees are automatically exempt from the overtime laws. Instead, an employee must earn at least $455 a week in salary to be exempt. They must also do work that is managerial or supervisory in nature, requires high-level business decisions, or requires an advanced degree.Accordingly, you can’t budget your secretary for a salary of $28,000 and expect them to work 50 hours a week without paying overtime.

, Base pay is only part of a compensation package. Incentives, such as bonuses, help you retain top performers. They also create incentives for employees to give above-average performance. Incentives can be paid in cash, stock, or benefits.Carefully consider whether you will offer incentives to employees. Incentives don’t work in all industries.


Giving an annual performance bonus might work at a company that is mostly salary-based. However, it probably won’t work at places such as cafes or retail stores where there is high employee turnover.Commissions as a percentage of sales can work at companies where profits per sale range widely. However, they don’t work where sales representatives do not have the same opportunities.
Commissions as a set amount probably won’t work at companies where sales are unstable.
Weekly or monthly bonus contests work better at jobs where staff is mostly paid by the hour. They work less well at salary-based businesses.
Remember you don’t have to adopt an incentives scheme right off. You can wait until your business is up and running.

, Compensation also includes fringe benefits. You should research what are standard benefits in your industry. Many businesses offer the following:


health insurance
dental insurance
vision insurance
life insurance
short-term disability insurance
sick leave
annual (vacation) leave

, Discuss health insurance and other benefits with an insurance broker or agent, which you can find in your Yellow Pages. You can also use the SHOP marketplace, which is a government website set up to help small businesses: https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/employers/.


Alternately, you can talk to a Professional Employer Organization (PEO).A PEO allows you to outsource certain management tasks, such as providing benefits. Search for PEOs online.

, You should analyze your company’s short-term and long-term goals, which will influence your compensation plan.For example, you might be focused on growing your company aggressively in the short-term. If so, you might want to adopt incentives to drive growth.


By contrast, you might want to retain employees for as long as possible. If so, you can offer above-market pay with a strong retirement benefit. This might entice employees to stay with you for a long time.

, This can be fairly easy if you are disallowing overtime. Simply add up the expected compensation for each employee. Don’t forget the cost of benefits.


For example, if you have six employees being paid $25,000 per year, then you have $150,000 in base compensation. If benefits are 20% of base pay, then you have $180,000 in total compensation.
Things can get a little more complicated if you intend to hire employees using compensation as a range. For example, you might expect to pay $30,000-35,000 for someone. Add up the total compensation if you paid everyone the minimum, and calculate total compensation if you paid everyone the maximum.

, You can’t overspend on compensation. If you do, then you’ll become insolvent and have to close up shop. Accordingly, you should compare your expected compensation with what you can afford.


You might need to offer low compensation, especially if you are a new business without much cash flow. However, you could include performance-based compensation so that you can reward employees if business takes off.
Meet with an accountant if you don’t know how to free up the money to pay for the employees that you need. You can get a referral to an accountant from another business owner, your local Chamber of Commerce, or your state’s accounting society., Your compensation plan must follow federal, state, and local laws. For example, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires that you pay at least a minimum wage. It also requires 1.5 time in overtime compensation for each hour worked over 40 in a week.State and local laws can supplement federal law. For example, your city might have a much higher minimum wage.
Find a business attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Ask for a referral and schedule a consultation.

, You can list the job descriptions at the start of the document. However, it’s probably better to simply refer people to an Appendix, where you will collect all job descriptions.You can write something like: “Positions/Titles and Job Functions. See Attachment A.”

, Based on your research, set a salary range for each job. Type each job classification and the salary range. For example, the job of receptionist might pay $23,000-27,000 annually or $11.00-13.25 per hour.Generally, new hires will be paid toward the low end of your range. However, you can pay on the higher end depending on someone’s experience or whether you really want them.

, Pay grades can start with beginner, and progress through intermediate, junior, and senior levels.People in higher grades will be paid more. Using pay grades allows you to reward excellent employees.


Alternately, you could “steps” within each job classification. You can use steps as a way for salaries to keep pace with inflation. For example, a starting salary might be $25,000. In the second year, you might want to increase by 3% to keep up with inflation.
Steps can be used when people progress simply based on the amount of time they’ve been at the company instead of based on performance.

, A compensation plan should also identify the hours you anticipate employees working. For example, you might have your receptionist work 9:00-6:00 with an hour unpaid lunch.If you have a lot of employees, you can group them and set hours for the group.

, Explain in detail the benefits your organization will provide to employees. Break out each benefit you provide and offer an individual explanation of each benefit.


For example, if you offer overtime, you can write: “Nonexempt employees will be paid overtime compensation in accordance with the FLSA. They will receive overtime pay for each hour worked in excess of 40 in a workweek at the rate of one and a half times their regular rate of pay.”For sick leave, you can write: “Employees will earn 10 days of sick leave credit each year. At the end of the year, any unused sick leave will be carried over to the next year. However, no employee may carry more than 30 days of sick leave. Any excess sick leave earned will be converted to annual leave, at a rate of two sick days to one day of annual leave.”
For health benefits, you can write, “Company will pay 60% of the health insurance costs for each employee.”

, Your compensation plan should lay out the policy for determining whether to pay a raise and calculating how much. You’ll want to follow this plan so that you don’t give out too much (or too little) in raises.


For example, you should first review your job descriptions and salary ranges to make sure they are still accurate. If they aren’t, you might need to give everyone a raise.
Generally, a pay raise should be a bump of 5% or less. It is rare to give 10% or more, unless you are also promoting someone., To remain competitive, you should participate in compensation surveys or perform your own.Make sure your compensation plan states that you will regularly review survey data to assure that your compensation is in line with the market.

, Before advertising, analyze whether you can afford to bring someone onto the company. For example, you might decide you want to hire an in-house auditor or attorney. Look at your budget and do basic online research to see how much you’ll have to pay the person.


Consider other options, such as using a temp agency or hiring an independent contractor.Using a temp agency, for example, can make the costs predictable.
If you’re hiring a new person to work in an established job classification, then the employee should be paid according to the existing classification. Look at your existing job classifications and see if the new employee could fit into one.

, You need a job description to advertise. You’ll also need one when you research comparable market salaries. Sit down and write out a draft of the job description.


Circulate the description to appropriate managers and others in your business. Ask them to revise your job description.
As your business grows, other employees will know more about staffing needs. Have meetings as necessary to hammer out what you are looking for in a new employee.
You may also want to create a compensation committee that will create a job description and research comparable salaries.

, When you add a new employee, you can’t forget what you are paying your current employees. They may be miffed if you pay someone new a much larger salary than what they are receiving. Accordingly, compare salaries so that they are internally fair.You may need to increase your current employee’s compensation in order to make them comparable to the salary of the new employee.

, You’ll need to add the new classification to your compensation plan. If you revised other classifications, then make those revisions as well. You want your plan to be accurate.


Even if you don't add a new classification, you should revise your plan if information becomes outdated.

",How to Use “Magic Formula Investing” to Beat The Market," The central premise in Greenblatt's stock investing strategy is that of ‘value investing’. Fundamentally, value investing involves buying stocks that are undervalued, fallen out-of -favor in the Market due to investor irrationality. Greenblatt’s formula for value investing you could say is an updated version of Benjamin Graham’s ‘value investing’ approach.


Graham is author of the classic bestseller The Intelligent Investor and widely acclaimed to be the father of value investing. Value investing follows the principles of determining the intrinsic value of a company and buying shares of a company at a large discount to their true value allowing a margin of safety to ride out the ups and downs of the share price over the short term but safeguard consistent profitable returns over the long-term. The hallmark of Graham's value investing approach is not so much profit maximization but loss minimization. Any value-investing strategy is very important for investors, as it can provide substantial profits in the long-haul, once the market inevitably re-evaluates the stock and raises its price for a stock to fair value.;
, Greenblatt’s “Magic Formula” investing is designed to #1. beat the market and #2. withstand any short-term peaks and troughs in share price. Benjamin Graham, described investing in stocks as like being a partner in the ownership of a business with a crazy guy called Mr. Market subject to wild mood swings.


Why do share prices move around so much when it seems clear that the value of the underlying businesses do not! Well, here’s how Greenblatt explains it: Who knows and who cares!! All you got to know is that they do. This doesn’t mean that the values of the underlying companies have changed. And that’s what Greenblatt’s “magic formula” takes advantage of once you stick with over the medium-to-long haul.

, Greenblatt’s “Magic Formula” uses two simple criteria to screen stocks for investing:


Earnings Yield - First, stocks are screened by Earnings Yield i.e. how cheap they are relative to their earnings. The standard definition of Earnings Yield is Earnings/Price i.e. Earnings Per Share. Greenblatt has a slightly different definition of Earnings Yield and calculates it as follows:
Earnings Yield = EBIT/Enterprise Value - EBIT (Earnings before Interest and Taxes) is used in the formula rather than Earnings as companies operate with different levels of debt and differing tax rates. And Enterprise Value (Market Cap plus Debt, Minority Interest and Preferred Shares - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents) is used in the calculation rather than the more commonly used P/E ratio. This is because Enterprise Value takes into account not only the price paid for an equity stake but also any debt financing used by the company to generate earnings.
Return on Capital - Next, Greenblatt’s “magic formula” screens companies based upon the quality of their underlying business as measured by how much profit they are making from their invested capital. Return on Capital is defined as:
Return On Capital = EBIT/(Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)
Net Working Capital is simply capital (cash) required for operating the business and Fixed Assets are buildings etc.
Greenblatt's “Magic Formula” simply looks for the companies that have the best combination of these two factors and voila….more or less. I think it could be worthwhile to look under the bonnet of any companies that satisfy these 2 criteria. For instance, you might want to consider how sustainable is the company’s competitive advantage i.e. how long can a company sustain its superior Return on Capital invested. Also, when applying earnings yield, make sure you are using normalized earnings (rather than overstated or super-normal earnings)?

, So now that you understand the 2 basic criteria by which Greenblatt's “Magic Formula” screens stocks, how do you go about actually doing this for yourself? Pick “Magic Formula” Stocks as follows in the next steps, which are a step-by-step breakdown of how to pick “magic formula” stocks.

Watch if your significant other takes charge of your money.,
Look at your credit reports and credit card statements frequently.,
Take note if your partner tracks everything you spend.",How to Spot Signs of Financial Abuse1," One of the signs of financial abuse in a relationship is one of the partners demanding to control the finances. This could mean forcing you to hand over your paycheck to your partner, and then only receiving a small allowance.


Only one person having access to the bank account is also a sign that abuse could be taking place.;
, Abusers often forge documents in order to open credit in their partner’s name. Then, they often destroy the credit so that the other is left with limited financial choices when it comes to leaving the relationship.


Monitor your credit score often to see if you have lines of credit you didn’t know about. Also, check your statements each month to look for charges you didn’t make., Abusers often control their significant others by wanting to know how much they spend. Your partner may ask you for receipts or even become angry if you buy something without asking first. The abuser may then limit the amount of money given to you as a punishment."

Get property insurance.,
Buy life insurance.,
Get health insurance.,
Buy automobile insurance.",How to Understand Personal Finance Basics5," You should invest in property insurance to protect your home, which is often one of your biggest assets. Property insurance is actually required if you have a mortgage. This type of insurance will protect you from having to pay out-of-pocket for any major unforeseen home repairs.


If you rent, it is just as important to invest in renter’s insurance. Your belongings can add up to a significant investment and getting renter’s insurance will help protect you in the event of a burglary, fire, flood, or other disaster., Getting life insurance is especially important if you have a family or are married. Life insurance makes sure your income (or at least part of it) is supplemented in the event that you pass away. This is important because your family could face very tough financial situations if they are unable to make up for the portion of income you brought to the table., Health insurance premiums can be a small price to pay if you find yourself sick or seriously injured. Medical bills alone can put you in serious debt if you don’t have some sort of insurance policy. In addition, you’ll likely miss a significant amount of work if you are seriously injured, leaving you no way to pay these bills.


Many employers offer health insurance to their employees at a discounted rate. Usually only full-time employees are eligible to receive health insurance through the company, but some companies may offer it to part-time employees as well.
Buying health insurance independently, without the help of an employer, can be expensive. However, it is worth investing in to make sure you are not crippled by debt in the event you become sick or injured., Finally, you should invest in automobile insurance. In fact, it is required of anyone who owns a car in the United States. Auto insurance helps cover the cost to repair your car after an accident and medical bills for you and others involved. A major car accident can put you in debt from car repairs and time off work if you’re injured. It is also possible your assets can be seized to help pay for the other driver’s medical bills if the accident is your fault. Having automobile insurance can help diffuse some of these costs and help keep you out of debt."

It may seem like you have plenty of time to save for retirement, but you can actually lose a lot of money in interest if you wait too long. Make financial planning a regular part of your life—like going to the doctor—and get started as soon as possible., If you are planning a future together, make sure to include your significant other in your planning. Talking to your partner and including them in the process will ensure you are both on the same page with your spending and saving habits and allow you to develop a plan that meets both of your needs., Some people assume that everything will work out in the long-run and ignore negative cues about their finances. If you do this, however, you could set yourself up for a major loss. Instead, think about how negative financial situations, like severe drops in the stock market, might affect your financial security and plan alternative options., Many people see saving for retirement as a race to reach a certain amount of savings before the date they retire. This approach can be misleading, however. Instead, think about the things you’ll need to pay for, like housing, healthcare, eldercare, hobbies, transportation, and so on. Do your best to figure out how much these products and services will cost you and how you’ll finance them.

Jute, which takes the second place, is exported from one country only, namely, from India. If we take the production of minerals, we find the same picture, since we deal here to a certain extent with what is known as the natural resources of a country.
Coal, for instance, is exported from countries with large coal deposits (England, Germany, United States, Austria, etc.); kerosene is produced in countries having an abundance of oil (United States, the Caucasus, Holland, India, Romania, Galicia); iron ore is extracted in Spain, Sweden, France, Algeria, Newfoundland, Cuba, etc.; manganese ore is to be found mainly in the Caucasus and Southern Russia, India, and Brazil; copper deposits are in abundance mostly in Spain, Japan, British South Africa, German Southwest Africa, Australia, Canada, United States, Mexico, Chile, and Bolivia."" - Imperialism and the World Economy, Nikolai Bukharin, 1917;
, These include being based on how it allocates its resources. Resource allocation and use is a problem and opportunity with which all societies are concerned, and it consists of:


Which goods and services should be produced with society's resources?
How should they be produced?
Who should get them and for what purpose?
Who decides such questions (and how)?

, If an economy is inflexible or unresponsive due to whatever caused rigidity, it would leave no room for innovation or advancement. There are many ways for allocating resources, and they include ideologies comparable to those that follow:


Traditional, tribal economy - resources are allocated according to the long-lived practices of the past in each area. These economies were the dominant method of resource allocation in human history and still remain strong in many tribal societies in parts of Africa, South America, Asia, and the Pacific. They are stable and predictable, as long as that particular set of economy, of traditions and market conditions, exists without complicating factors.
Command economy- resources are allocated mostly by explicit instructions from some higher authority. These are also called centrally planned economies. The government usually controls all resource allocation in this type of economy.
Market economy- resources are allocated according to individual private profit.
Mixed economy- By far the most common economy. This is where some resources are centrally distributed and some resources are privately allocating according to profit.
Participatory economy- where economic actors can participate in the economy. Defined by Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel.
Economic democracy within a nation, state, village, tribe or community, etc. means people can participate in some meaningful way in deciding many of the fundamental questions and answers posed in this arena. There are various forms of votes from pure democracy to representative forms. Inputs by citizens or individuals would be regarding allocation and marketing of resources and products of each economy: many considerations include who sets the laws and regulations of assets, workforce, management, supervision, unions, environment, safety, zoning if any, marketing, pricing, how to use and pay out compensation from incomes derived.

, Economic growth is the increase in production of goods and services that occurs over long periods of time. When the annual output of goods and services has risen faster than the population, you have positive economic growth.

, ""In 1810, India was exporting more textiles to England than England was exporting to India. By 1830, the trade flow was reversed. The British had put up prohibitive tariff barriers to shut out Indian finished goods and were dumping their commodities in India, a practice backed by British gunboats and military force. Within a matter of years, the great textile centers of Dacca and Madras were turned into ghost towns. The Indians were sent back to the land to raise the cotton used in British textile factories. In effect, India was reduced to being a cow milked by British financiers.
By 1850, India's debt had grown to 53 million pounds. From 1850 to 1900, its per capita income dropped by almost two-thirds. The value of the raw materials and commodities the Indians were obliged to send to Britain during most of the nineteenth century amounted yearly to more than the total income of the sixty million Indian agricultural and industrial workers. The massive poverty we associate with India was not that country's original historical condition."" - Michael Parenti, Against Empire

, Real GDP is the total value of all final goods and services produced for the marketplace during a given period, within the nation's borders. Such that, when real GDP rises faster than the population, output per person rises, and so does the average standard of living. In other words, the higher the real GDP, the richer the country.

,, Inflation is costly to society. If inflation rises too fast, people are no longer willing to hold on to money and will begin bartering with each other for goods and services, wasting valuable time and resources. In other words, high inflation rate slows economic development. This is why stable prices (a low inflation rate) are an important macroeconomic goal.

, Net exports are a country's total exports minus its total imports. So when a country produces more than it purchases, it earns more money, and as a result, it becomes richer.

",How to Build a Fire in a Woodburning Heater2," Make sure they're perpendicular to the pane of the closed doors, or fire box opening. These large logs will be the bed of the fire and contain the embers to feed it.

, This log should be about the diameter of your forearm, and it should rest parallel to the pane of the glass door or fireplace opening, closer to the opening of the firebox.


This cross-bar will hold the other firewood and keep an air vent open where the fire can draw fresh air to feed it from underneath.

, Alternatively, use other tinder like dried twigs or wood shavings as a base.

, Do not put any larger logs or fuel on top yet. If you can stack the kindling in a grid fashion, leaving plenty of space in between for air to pass through.

, Make sure that the kindle starts to burn — you'll want to hear crackling noises.

, Again, these logs should be about half the diameter of your forearm, resting parallel with the cross-bar. Keep this arrangement at all times: two logs, one cross-bar on top and firewood held by the cross-bar.

Examine the person’s home and financial situation.,
Monitor the person’s credit reports.,
Ask questions.",How to Spot Signs of Financial Abuse2," Take a look around the potential victim’s home for signs that items are missing, or that their living conditions have changed for the worse. They could be signs that someone is stealing their possessions or that they don’t have enough money now because it has gone missing from their account.


If possible, look at the person’s bills to see if they are being paid and on time; if not, it could be a sign that money is being taken away from them., Abusers may take out credit cards in the elderly person’s name. If possible, ask the elderly person if the accounts that are open are actually theirs. If not, report the abuser to the police.You can help an elderly person who is being abused financially by setting up insurance against identity theft and starting credit monitoring. Talk to your bank or local insurance company to learn how.

, Ask the elderly person if they’ve interacted with any salespeople or given money to them. Elderly people are often victims of scams because they are trusting, and may not understand what is actually going on. If your loved one has purchased any kind of new property, made recent investments, or the like, they may have actually been scammed.


Ask to see any documents that pertain to the money spent, and examine them yourself to see if they are legitimate. You might say, “Dad, where did you get this new gadget?... Can I see the paperwork and receipts they gave you in the store?”"

Save little by little.,
Change personal codes.,
Speak up.,
End relationships with abusers.",How to Spot Signs of Financial Abuse3," If you’re in a relationship, take money discreetly from your account or out of your paycheck and save it so that you can eventually leave, if you can. Hide the money in a secret savings account or leave it with someone you trust. Overtime, you may have enough saved up so that you can leave the relationship and start a life on your own.


You may have to get a secret additional job in order to save enough money, or if you are unable to take money from your account without it being noticed. Use the guise of volunteering or that you are spending time with your friends and family to cover for the time you are away while working., Contact your bank or that of an elderly loved one and change PIN codes and other personal information so that the abuser doesn’t have access to the money. Additionally, get in touch credit card companies to change the password so that no one can track activity but the designated account holder.


You may also want to remove your partner or others as an authorized user on bank accounts or credit cards so that no one else has the right to withdraw money or use cards., Confront the person you believe is taking advantage of an elderly loved one. Ask the person you think may be exploiting the elderly person to explain any recent big purchases or questionable behavior. If their explanation doesn’t make sense, you should trust your gut and suspicions. Contact the proper authorities to take action against this person.


You might say, “I noticed that Mom has a lot of recent online purchases…Can you explain these?”
Quite often, people who take advantage of the elderly are those who are the closest to them. Adult children or live-in caregivers often have access to the elderly person’s accounts and are commonly those who commit the financial abuse., If you are in a romantic entanglement or the friend or relative of someone who is committing financial abuse, it may be wise to separate yourself from this person. In many cases, it may be difficult to do so because the person may be near and dear to your heart.


If you have trouble becoming estranged from a financial abuses, consult with an attorney or financial advisor who has experience with such matters. You might say, “My husband’s gambling habit has ruined my credit and I don’t know how to handle this situation. What can I do to protect myself financially and stop the abuse?”

, Things like:a charger, custom case, or pre-bought apps. If the phone has a deleted app on it, like Flappy Bird, this can raise the price quite a bit. On the flip side, if you sell without things like the charger or box, this can lower the price (not by a ton, but still quite a bit).


The charger
Custom cases
Pre-bought apps
The box

, This also alters the price. A new, unopened iPhone 6 will sell for good money, but a beat up old Nokia flip phone will sell for much, much less, if ever at all. If the screen is cracked, the battery is missing or the phone is locked with a password you can't remember, get these issues fixed, don't sell at all or only sell individual parts.

When you're satisfied with the length, simply tie a knot in the twine at the end of your fabric strips.",How to Make a Garland With Scrap Fabrics,"

Coordinate the scraps by their color.
Determine how much yardage you have. You will be able to make approximately 30 inches (76cm) of garland per yard (91cm) of fabric you have on hand.
Choose 2 to 4 coordinating fabrics to use for your garland.;
, 

If needed, wash the fabric. This step may only be needed if the intended fabric is dirty or smelly--such as those that are musty or reek of mothballs. Stained fabric usually can be used as the stained parts are usually simply not included.
If needed, press the fabric smooth. This project will work with fabric that is not perfectly smooth, but creates a different look.

, The strips should measure five inches long by one inch wide (12.5cm x 2.5cm). You can cut them longer if you wish, but you will need to cut them all the same length for best results.

A rotary cutter and mat make this part of the project a breeze.
You will need approximately 24 strips per linear feet of finished garland.

, Tie a knot around 10 inches (25cm) from the end., Place it under the twine, ready for tying.

,


Use a simple overhand knot for best results.







, Then reach for your next piece of fabric and repeat.

, Tie until you have reached the length you like or until you run out of fabric., Finish by cutting the end of the twine long enough to facilitate hanging.

Have your answer served on the debt collector.,
Gather any necessary documents or information.,
Respond to any discovery requests.",How to Answer a Lawsuit for Debt Collection in Texas," Even if you are being sued by a debt collector, the name of the original lender should be listed on the petition, as well as the full amount the debt collector believes you owe it.


The legal papers you receive include an original petition and a citation. These are the same as a complaint and summons, but they are called by different names in Texas state courts.
The citation states who is suing you and how much they claim you owe them.;
, Pull your credit report to verify the debt for which you're being sued, and note the information about the debt on your report.


If you can't find information about the debt on your credit report, it's possible that the debt collector has identified the wrong party. If that's the case, you must take action quickly to avoid having a judgment appear on your credit report for a debt you don't owe.
Your credit report also may show the last time you made a payment for the debt. You can use this date to figure out if the debt collector has run out of time to file a lawsuit against you.

, Debt collectors only have four years from the date of your last payment or promise to pay to sue you for the debt in Texas.


If it's been more than four years since your last payment or the last time you spoke with the original creditor or a debt collector, you may be able to get the lawsuit dismissed. However, the court won't dismiss the lawsuit unless you file an answer and raise the issue of the statute of limitations.

, Texas gives you either 14 days or 20 days to file an answer to the debt collector's original petition, depending on which court the debt collector used.


Your citation also states how many days you have to answer the original petition. For example, if the lawsuit was filed in county or district court, your answer will be due on the Monday following 20 days from when you were served.
If you get confused about when your answer is due, you can call the clerk's office and have them explain it to you.

, The caption for your answer will be exactly the same as the caption on the debt collector's original petition.


You don't have to draft a formal answer in the correct format. If you're representing yourself, a handwritten letter to the judge may be enough to qualify as an official answer to the original petition.

, The title tells the court what sort of document you're filing and the type of information that will follow.


Even if you're handwriting a simple letter to the judge, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require that you title it ""original answer."", The introductory paragraph identifies the parties to the lawsuit, the type of lawsuit, and explains what the document is going to be about.

, With the body of your answer, you respond to the claims the debt collector set forth in the original petition.


The less detail you go into, the better. You want to avoid accidentally making admissions through the course of responding to the original petition. If you don't have a specific denial such as stating that the claim is time-barred by the statute of limitations, you may be best served simply by making a general denial of all claims.
If you have any motions, they may be included in your answer. For example, if you want to file a motion for the court to dismiss the lawsuit because the statute of limitations has passed, you may include this within the body of your answer.Texas law does not require answers to a lawsuit for debt collection to be made specifically under oath, so you can make a general denial of all issues. Under the Rules of Civil Procedure this is sufficient to put all matters in issue., Make a statement that everything in the answer is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, drop down a few lines, and create a blank line for your signature.

, Every document you file with the court must include a certificate of service indicating that a copy will be served on the other party in the case., Once you've finished drafting your answer, print it up and sign it. Since it doesn't have to be verified, you don't have to worry about signing it in front of a notary public., You must make at least one copy for the other side and one copy for your records. The clerk will keep the original.


You must send a copy of every document you file with the court to the debt collector who filed the original petition., To officially answer the lawsuit for debt collection, you must file your answer with the clerk of the court where the original petition was filed.


You generally won't have to pay any filing fees to file an answer to the lawsuit., After you've filed your answer, have the sheriff's department or a private process serving company serve it on the debt collector.


After you've filed your answer and completed service, the court may either schedule a pre-trial conference or go ahead and schedule the trial. Either way, you'll receive notice in the mail of the court's action.Some courts may want you to go to mediation before you go to trial and attempt to settle the dispute there. If so, you will receive information on how to contact a mediator and schedule a session., If you know of any documents that would support your defense against the debt collector, pull the information together and make copies to use as evidence in your case.

, If the debt collector included any written discovery along with the original petition, you should get started on those as soon as you file your answer.


Depending on where the debt collector filed the lawsuit, it may have included discovery requests such as interrogatories or requests for production along with the original petition.
Texas law gives you 50 days to respond to written discovery requests submitted with the original petition. Because they can be time-consuming, it's best to get started on them right away. In some instances, you may have to get documents from another person or business, and it could take additional time to process such a request.
If you don't respond to the discovery requests, you may lose the lawsuit automatically, even if you filed an answer.
If the debt collector sends you discovery requests after it receives your answer, you have 30 days to respond to them.Discovery documents or other responses to similar requests should be sent directly to the debt collector or (more likely) the debt collector's attorney rather than filed with the court."

Understand the risks of using offshore protection.,
Distribute your assets properly.,
Talk to your accountant.",How to Evaluate Offshore Asset Protection," Safe assets are those that do not expose you to potential legal liability. For example, you are unlikely to be sued because you own cash, bonds, or shares in mutual funds.These are all safe assets.;
, Dangerous assets are those that could subject you to legal liability. They include real estate and automobiles.Someone could get injured on your real estate, and you could injure someone with your car.

, Offshore asset protection isn’t cheap. In particular, you could pay considerable fees managing your assets in the offshore accounts and trusts. For this reason, you should weigh how much money you have.For example, a foreign trust generally costs $20,000 to create. Accounting fees and administration typically costs an additional $7,000 a year., Not all creditors are the same. For example, if you injure someone in a car accident, then that person is a private plaintiff in a lawsuit. Assets held in an offshore account are typically shielded from private plaintiffs.


Offshore trusts offer less protection against a government authority, such as the IRS or a state taxing authority.Using offshore protection vehicles probably won’t shield your money from these government authorities.

, One protection vehicle is an offshore bank account. You can park cash in these accounts and put them out of the reach of creditors from your home country. Often, you can open up an offshore banking account in the name of a private offshore company.Bank accounts have minimum deposit amounts, depending on the country. They can range from $450 to a quarter of a million dollars.For example, opening a bank account in Switzerland requires a higher minimum deposit.
You can work with your attorney to identify the best places to open a bank account. Often, you can have the bank account in a different country from where you have other asset protection vehicles.

, With an offshore company, you title all of your property to the company. Because you own the corporation or the LLC, you still control the assets. However, because the assets are no longer in your name, it is harder for creditors to find them.An LLC also offers additional protection. As the name implies, an LLC limits the liability of its owners. If the LLC is sued, then the individual owners cannot be liable for the injuries caused by the LLC.

, In a trust, you transfer title to assets to the trust. You are called the “settlor” and the person who manages the trust is the “trustee.” The trustee manages the trust property for the benefit of beneficiaries. You can create a trust so that you are both the settlor and a beneficiary.A well-drafted offshore trust will contain a “duress provision.” This provision states that the trustee will ignore any request by the beneficiary to remove assets from the trust when the beneficiary is compelled by a court order.
This means that a U.S. judge can’t order you to remove assets from a trust to satisfy a judgment creditor who won a lawsuit against you.

, A transfer clause in a trust gives the trustee the power to move the trust to a different country in certain situations. For example, you might have a trust in the Cook Islands. If someone files a lawsuit in the Cook Islands, then your trustee could move the trust to a different country. The creditor would then have to file a new lawsuit in the new country.Transfer clauses make it very difficult for creditors to win lawsuits against you in the country where the trust is located. Before the lawsuit can get too far, the trust has been moved.

, Using offshore trusts is legal so long as you create them before you become liable to a potential creditor.You cannot create trusts or other asset protection vehicles to defraud someone or commit a crime.


For example, imagine that you are a doctor. You want to put your assets in an offshore trust and an offshore bank account. After moving the property offshore, you commit malpractice and injure a patient. Your assets are protected if the patient wins a lawsuit against you.
Now imagine that you injure a patient first, and then quickly try to move assets out of the country to protect them. In this situation, offshore asset protection probably will not protect you., You should get referrals to an attorney, especially one with experience in the Fraudulent Transfer Act as well as the creation of offshore asset protection vehicles.If you know someone who is using offshore asset protection, you can ask him or her for a referral to their attorney.
However, you might not have any leads. In this situation, you can get a referral to a business attorney. Be sure to call and ask if they have experience with offshore asset protection.

, There are a few countries which are quite popular for offshore asset protection—Cook Islands, Belize, Nevis, and Cayman Islands. Each has different laws which are friendly to debtors. You and your lawyer should discuss which country has the friendliest laws.


For example, in Nevis, a person has to hire a local attorney and put up $25,000 to start a lawsuit.These hurdles can scare off many people from suing you.
In the Cook Islands and Belize, a person who sues you must prove their case for fraud beyond a reasonable doubt, which is much higher than the standard in the United States.

, Many U.S. states are trying to compete with foreign countries for the asset protection market. They have adopted rules that make domestic asset protection much more attractive.You should talk with your lawyer about whether you can accomplish your asset protection goals using domestic asset protection trusts.
Also compare costs with offshore asset protection trusts. For example, a domestic trust is generally cheaper. You can set up a domestic trust for $10,000 and pay roughly $5,000 a year in fees for accounting and trust administration., Offshore protection is not risk-free. For example, a judge could still hold you in contempt of court for not turning over assets you own. According to some media reports, judges are doing this more often.With contempt, a judge can put you in jail for refusing to obey the court’s orders. For this reason, having assets in a trust might not offer 100% protection.
Talk about the danger of contempt with your lawyer. Generally, a judge will order contempt if they find you made the transfer fraudulently after injuring someone or accruing a debt.

, Part of a comprehensive asset protection plan involves making sure that assets are not grouped together in the same trust or LLC. For example, if you have cash and real estate in the same trust, then someone suing you for an injury sustained on the real estate could get access to both the cash and your real estate.You can protect yourself by separating dangerous assets from safe assets. For example, you should put cash and bonds into a bank account but transfer dangerous assets like automobiles into a trust or an LLC.
You should also separate dangerous assets from each other. For example, you could transfer them to individual LLCs.

, Generally, offshore asset protection does not offer tax advantages. You still must disclose your income from the trust to the IRS, though you don’t have to pay taxes to the foreign country where the trust has been set up.To fully understand the tax consequences, you want to involve your accountant or another tax professional.
Make sure that your accountant has experience in this area of the law. Not every accountant understands how tax rules apply to offshore assets.

, If you enjoy baking, you might like to make your own moon cakes for the celebration. For details on making your own, see How to make moon cakes. Give yourself plenty of time to practice making them if you've never tried before––they are labor intensive and time-consuming, which is why so many of them are now made commercially.


Chinese moon cakes tend to be round (like the moon), while Vietnamese ones tend to be square but the shape used is flexible.Traditional fillings for moon cakes include: lotus bean/seed paste, sweet bean paste, five kernel, egg yolk, jujube paste or dried/jam apricots. However, there are many modern variations, so if you're a keen baker, search online for the many variants of making moon cake fillings.

, Making easy lanterns at home is a good way to involve the children and other family members in preparing for the event. Some ideas for making lanterns include:



Make sky lanterns for releasing into the sky.

Make a Chinese paper lantern for decoration purposes.

Make real lanterns for lighting and hanging around the home and garden.

, When the day arrives, wait until nighttime. Call your family over (this is a time of family togetherness) and watch and admire the moon together. Watch the moon rise and then disappear into the clouds or into the clear sky. Share your experiences of the moon: how bright it is, the way it looks in the night sky, the impressions it leaves on you.


If you can't be with your family, still gaze at the moon and think about your family. Suggest that they do the same too, and you'll all be looking at the moon together, even if apart.

, Cut the moon cakes into fourths. Use toothpicks to eat the moon cakes.


While you eat, talk about the origins of the Moon Festival. This is a good occasion to learn more Chinese or Vietnamese history, either by viewing history information provided on the internet or looking at relevant history books.

, Enjoy the glow emitted by the lanterns. If you have floating sky lanterns, release them (of course, only do so if this is legal in your area––don't do it where dry grass could catch on fire and start a wildfire).


In some places you can see lantern boats being launched. This is a beautiful sight, so check your local news to see if this is happening near you.

, This is in reverence to various deities. It also adds to the atmosphere.

, If there is a local Chinese or Vietnamese dance troupe near where you live, you might be lucky enough to see a live dance and join in the celebrations with the crowd.

Get the appeal form.,
Attend the hearing.,
Take another appeal.",How to Dispute Your Tax Assessment," Once you receive the bill in the mail, you should read it as soon as possible. The appeals process may have deadlines, so the sooner you can check your bill the better.


The window of time in which to appeal can be short. In Maryland, you only have 45 days from receiving the bill to appeal.Find prior bills so that you can compare the amount of the assessment. If the municipality has reclassified your land or valued it differently, then make note of this fact.;
, You should be able to find the office’s phone number on the bill itself. If not, you can stop by your town office or county clerk’s office and ask.

, Before you can dispute the valuation of your property, you need to know how the taxing authority assesses the real estate. Typically, assessors rely on the following pieces of information:the amount a purchaser would pay for the property (“fair market value”)
the class of the property (residential, commercial, farming, etc.)
how developed the land is

, If you think the assessor has valued the property too highly, you should get an independent appraisal. A great piece of evidence is to have an appraiser testify at your appeal about the property’s value.To find an appraiser, you can visit the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s website at https://www.asc.gov/National-Registry/FindAnAppraiser.aspx and search by city and state.


You should also look for comparable properties in the county. You can use this information for two purposes. First, if the property has sold recently, you can use the price as evidence of the “fair market value.” Second, you can find out how much the property was assessed and see if the tax assessment was lower than yours.
If you use comparable property to help show fair market value, the sales should be recent. The transaction should also be at “arm’s length”; in other words, not between relatives or friends., To dispute the assessment, you should schedule a meeting with the assessor.Perhaps the assessor made a mistake or does not have all of the relevant information about your property.


Depending on the office, you may need to fill out a complaint form before meeting with the assessor.You should ask for any form, if required, and complete it.

, You should have the assessor explain how he or she determined the amount of tax. You should have the assessor show you your record and explain how the calculation was made.Make sure that the assessor has accurate information about the property’s size, age, condition, number of bathrooms, and other physical characteristics. If the assessor’s information is inaccurate, ask the assessor what documentation you will need.
For example, the assessor may have been confused and assessed you for an addition that you didn’t build. Ask the assessor if he or she will come out to your property to take a look or if you should bring photographs to show.

, Sometimes an assessor has to rely on his or her judgment if you deny entry onto the property. If you don’t live in the property, then you may not have been around when the assessor stopped by initially.


In some counties, the assessor may not even attempt to visit each individual piece of property. Instead, the assessor does a “mass assessment” of the area.You should ask if the assessor visited your property.
Be open to a day and time to meet with the assessor at the property. If you want an accurate assessment, then you will need the assessor to see the property.

, Should the assessor stand by his or her assessment, then you will want to bring an appeal. Each county or state will have different methods of bringing a formal appeal, so be sure to ask the assessor about the process that applies to you. You should follow the directions provided.

, Because of how complex it can be to change an assessor’s mind, you should give some thought to meeting with an experienced tax attorney. He or she can assess your situation and offer advice on how to bring a strong appeal.


An attorney can also advise you whether or not it is in your best interest to bring an appeal. If you appeal, your property taxes could increase.You want to be sure any error made was not made in your favor. If it was, then your tax bill could rise once the assessor fixes the error.
You can often find a qualified attorney by visiting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. To find your state bar’s association, use the American Bar Association’s search engine available at its website.
For tips on how to find a qualified attorney, see Select a Property Tax Attorney.

, To make the strongest appeal possible, you should have relevant evidence that shows the assessment is wrong. The type of evidence will depend on your county, but generally you should get:the property record card and photographs of the property you are appealing
property record cards and photographs of similar properties
a copy of the deed or sale contract
an appraisal
a list of recent sales of comparable properties

, Most offices should have a form for you to fill out. If not, you should ask your lawyer. Complete the form and submit it with any required documentation to the appropriate office.


Different counties will allow different appeals. For example, the board you appeal to may allow you to appeal both the classification of your property as well as the valuation.Alternately, some boards might only allow you to appeal the valuation.When you submit your appeal form, ask for handouts describing any rules, policies, or regulations that you must follow during the appeal.

, At the hearing, you will be able to present the evidence you believe supports your claim. The assessor might also attend and present evidence also. The board members may ask you questions so that they can understand the evidence.You should strive to introduce all relevant evidence at the initial appeal. If you take a subsequent appeal from the board’s decision, you might be limited in your ability to introduce new evidence at a later date., After you appeal to your local board, you might have the ability to appeal to a state board or to a state court.Discuss with your lawyer whether taking another appeal is worthwhile.


You probably will have to pay your taxes as you await the outcome of any subsequent appeal.If you prevail in the subsequent appeal, then the taxes you paid will be refunded.

Then, take the items to a place where they can be recycled. This will be especially helpful if you collect items that cannot be recycled at the local recycling center, such as electronics, batteries, and paint cans., You could organize a film festival in your community focused on ecological issues. Watch An Inconvenient Truth, The Day After Tomorrow, Soylent Green, or Erin Brockovich. If children are attending, consider adding WALL-E or FernGully: The Last Rainforest.If you plan this in advance, you could add your city to the Wild & Scenic Film Festival Tour., This shows customers that it is important to consider where your products come from and how they are made in order to leave a smaller footprint on the environment. Invite local artists and crafters who make their products sustainably.

For example, choose artists who use recycled materials in their projects, or knitters who use eco-friendly yarns to create clothing and other items.

, You could organize a poetry reading at a local coffee shop or bookstore to create a platform for people to share their opinions, worries, and hopes about the environment. An event like this also helps connect people through a love of nature. Choose poets or poems that focus on environmental issues, such as eco-poetry.

You may also want to include dramatic readings or performances as well.
You can choose to read poems like “Flood” by Pablo Neruda or excerpts from Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass., This is a fun way to get people together for a good cause. Invite local musicians to play music in an outdoor venue. You could even find musicians who use recycled materials for their instruments, or musicians whose music focuses on nature or environmental issues.

If possible, you could charge an entry fee and donate the money to an environmental cause, such as saving endangered species.
You could play recordings or have bands cover songs like “Mother Nature’s Son” by the Beatles, or John Mayer’s “Waiting on the World to Change.”

, Trees are great for the environment, as they turn carbon dioxide into oxygen. Gather a group of people together and arrange to plant trees in your community. Get permission before planting in public places such as parks, or choose to plant trees in your own or your neighbors’ or friends’ yards., Invite your neighbors to help clean up the area in which you all live. This is a great activity to do with children. Pick up trash, pull weeds, or even do minor repairs to fences or houses in the area., Invite adults and children from your neighborhood to participate in a nature scavenger hunt. Create a list of items to find, such as: a yellow flower, a green leaf, a ladybug, a feather, a smooth rock, a blade of grass, a puffy cloud, something blue, etc. Consider handing out prizes to the winners, like eco-friendly tote bags., Set up a booth outside the local library or grocery store, after obtaining permission. Speak to people about environmental issues or hand out brochures or information kits. This can be a great way to educate others about important environmental subjects."

Adopt an eco-friendly, sustainable lifestyle.,
Choose to purchase sustainable, organic, or Fair Trade goods.,
Take public transportation to reduce your environmental impact.,
Get involved in a conservation, restoration, or eco-community project.,
Plan your garden space to include edible items.,
Refuse, reduce, reuse, and recycle.",How to Celebrate World Environment Day3," Do an inventory of your energy usage, your consuming habits, and your reliance on unsustainable products and make a list of ways you intend to curb your unsustainable activities and habits and replace them with sustainable ones. Set yourself a timeline to meet, with harder changes coming at the end of the timeline.


For instance, consider eating meat-free meals twice a week. You could also make a point of turning off lights and electronics when not in use. Another idea is to commit yourself to walking to work or the market as often as possible.

, Read the labels of origin and manufacture of your goods, and decide if you can make better choices. Find out if your products are certified as sustainable, organic, locally made, or Fair Trade. There are lots of things a label can tell you if you choose to read it.


Sustainable products include those that are sustainably obtained, for example, all forest products with the FSC logo are logged using sustainable forestry practices.
Organic products, such as cotton clothing, cause much less environmental damage than non-organic methods, such as conventional cotton-growing practices.
Locally made products decrease the impact on the environment because they travel less miles, which means less emissions, to make it to the consumer.
Fair Trade products are ethically produced, and take into account the native people as well as the environmental resources, in the areas they are produced.
If you can’t find a label, email or post a message on Facebook to the company, retailer, or manufacturer responsible for the product. Facebook is a great method because lots of other people will check out your question and be waiting for the answer!

, Make a choice to use public transportation more often than you do already to cut back on the amount of noxious fumes introduced into the environment. Carpooling is also a great way to reduce emissions. You can also ride your bicycle or walk to close destinations.

, Today is a great day to sign up and get involved with people who are doing rather than talking or reading. Sign up to help restore an old building in town, or join a local water conservation group.

, If you have a yard or garden that sits empty, make a plan to plant fruits, veggies, and herbs for personal use, or even bee-friendly flowers. Growing your own food helps reduce strain on the environment. Things you can do that will make the most of your garden include:


Compost your scraps. Use this compost to boost the garden's production.
Create a part of it that is edible, and plant seasonal crops. For those of you with merely a balcony or a tiny plot, you can still grow food such as a potato in a bag and small sprout gardens in your windowsill. You could also join a community gardening project.
Grow herbs and spices that add flavor to your food, look beautiful in the garden, and that also have medicinal, beauty, healing, spiritual, or other uses. Borrow a book from the library to learn more about herb and spice use.
Encourage beneficial and friendly wildlife to your garden through careful planting and shelter creation.
Learn to make your own garden sprays using items that are toxic to bugs and mildew but not to people and pets!

, Refuse to buy unsustainable products, reduce your consumption, reuse items and materials around your home, and recycle everything you can. All that clutter has to go somewhere, so make a choice not to bring in into the house to begin with and if it has to leave, make good choices about where it's going to end up!Think about borrowing, sharing, donating, time-sharing, etc., instead of buying for keeps. Or pass it on after you've read/used/watched/worn/enjoyed it.

Attempt to settle the case.",How to Answer a Credit Card Lawsuit," In most states you only have 20 days to file your answer.You may have longer than 20 days if you were served by mail or some other way rather than in person. There should be a summons or other document with the complaint that tells you exactly how long you have to respond.Debt collection law firms may file hundreds of lawsuits a day, assuming most of the defendants won't answer and they'll win a judgment by default. By responding to the complaint, you force the debt collector to prove its case against you.;
, Before you start writing your answer, take some time to read over the complaint and review your own financial records to find any documentation you have about the debt.


If you have a copy of your credit card agreement, review the terms to find out which state's law applies to the agreement and what the agreement says about selling the debt to a collection agency.
You also can check your credit report to find out additional information about the debt such as your payment history, the date of your last payment, and when it was sold off to a collection agency.
If you recognize the debt and don't dispute it, evaluate your budget and finances and consider whether you can settle the debt without having a judgment on your credit report or going through the stress of a trial.
Many states require credit card companies or collection agencies to attach documents such as the signed credit card agreement to their complaint. If these documents were not attached, you also may be able to state in your answer that the plaintiff failed to state a claim for which the courts can grant relief., If the lawsuit was filed after the statute of limitations expired in your state or the state that governs the credit card agreement, the plaintiff cannot use the courts to collect the money.The statute of limitations for credit card debt typically is between three and six years. You can find out the statute of limitations in your state by using the map available at http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-state-statute-limitations-1282.php.
The length of time typically is computed from the date the last payment was made.It doesn't matter the size of the payment. You also may restart the statute of limitations period simply by talking to a customer service representative and acknowledging that you owe the debt, so if the statute of limitations is an issue in your case, don't contact anyone at the credit card company or collection agency that's holding the debt.Some credit card agreements include a clause that they are governed by the laws of a particular state, rather than the law where you live. For example, American Express card agreements are governed by Nevada law, which has a six-year statute of limitations., State law and court rules include various affirmative defenses available to debtors who are sued by credit card companies or collection agencies.


Affirmative defenses rely on facts outside the complaint. As you are the party raising these issues, you have the burden of proof.One affirmative defense you must state in your answer is lack of personal jurisdiction based on improper service. The court has rules on what constitutes proper service – the correct way to deliver the complaint to you so you have legal notice that you are being sued. If the complaint was delivered to you in a different way, you can assert this defense.For example, New York law states the complaint should be given to you personally at home, or mailed to you. If the plaintiff mails your complaint, they must also have a copy attached to your door or given to someone of suitable age. Therefore, you might assert a defense of lack of personal jurisdiction if the complaint was given to your six-year-old son.If the plaintiff is a collection agency rather than the original credit card company, you might be able to raise the affirmative defense that they have a lack of standing – meaning they are not the correct person to sue you because you never entered into an agreement with them.If you challenge the collection agency's right to sue you, they must present evidence to the court – such as the valid written transfer of a signed credit agreement – that they have the right to sue you. Many collection agencies don't have this documentation.If you were a victim of identity theft and never applied for a credit card at all, this also can be raised as an affirmative defense.Many states such as New York require debt collection agencies to be licensed and registered in the state and include a license number in the complaint. If such information is missing, you may have an affirmative defense based on the plaintiff's failure to include this information or conform to these laws., If the debt is substantial, or there's any information that you don't understand, an experienced attorney can assist you in answering the complaint and protecting your interests.


Your state may have additional defenses that you overlooked in your research, but an attorney experienced in credit card lawsuits and consumer defense would know exactly what means are available to you to dispute the debt.
An experienced consumer attorney knows the law and the court system, and also has familiarity with the collection agencies and their tactics.In some situations, such as if your only income is from Social Security or other public benefits, you may be considered judgment-proof by the court. Certain types of income including disability benefits cannot be collected to satisfy a debt.An attorney would be able to tell you if your income is exempt or you are otherwise judgment-proof. Additionally, if you receive public benefits you probably qualify for free or reduced-fee representation from your local legal aid clinic.
Most consumer defense attorneys will at least provide you with a free consultation, and may be able to work with you on fees. The attorney understands that you probably don't have a lot of money to spend on a legal defense if you're being sued for a credit card debt., Many states have forms and instructions available for answering a credit card lawsuit, either online, at the court clerk's office, or at legal aid clinics.


In some states, you may have received an answer form with your summons and complaint, or you may have to go to the clerk's office in the court where the lawsuit was filed to get the form., The caption is the heading for all documents in the case and can be found at the top of the first page of the complaint.


If you don't have an answer form, copy the caption on the complaint, including the formatting.
The summons and complaint you received should have the same heading. It states what court the lawsuit was filed in, the name of the company or collection agency that filed the lawsuit, and your name.The caption also includes the number the lawsuit was assigned. If your caption does not include a number, it means the plaintiff had the complaint delivered to you before it actually filed the lawsuit., If you don't have a prepared form, start your answer by stating who you are and the purpose of the document you're filing with the court.


This doesn't need to be more than a sentence or two, and you can generally copy the language in the introduction to the complaint, changing words where necessary to suit your position. For example, if the complaint begins ""Comes now the Plaintiff, XYZ Debt Collection, and submits this Complaint,"" you could write something like ""Comes now the Defendant, Sally Consumer, and submits this Answer.""

, Any allegation to which you don't directly respond will be treated by the plaintiff and the judge as though you agreed to it.You have three options to respond to each allegation: you may either admit it, deny it, or say you lack knowledge or information about it. Saying you lack knowledge has the effect of a denial, forcing the credit card company to prove the information.Most answer forms have a box you can check to generally deny all the allegations in the complaint, if you don't want to go through them separately and if you don't admit any of them.
Keep in mind that the company suing you has the burden of proof on all the allegations it makes in its complaint.If you admit an allegation, you're making their job easier because you're saying they don't have to prove that allegation. They're the ones taking you to court – make them prove their case.
You must answer truthfully, but denying an allegation doesn't mean that you're saying it's false or that you're trying to avoid your debts– it means you're saying the plaintiff must prove it.For example, if the complaint states that you entered into a credit card agreement with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff is a collection agency who bought your debt from the original credit card company, you should deny that allegation. You never entered into any agreement with the collection agency itself.It's possible your credit card agreement has a clause allowing the credit card company to sell the debt to a collection agency if you don't make a certain number of payments on time, but that's the collection agency's responsibility to prove – not yours.
Specifically make them prove the amount you owe. Your debt may have changed hands multiple times before it was taken over by the collection agency that sued you, and somewhere along the line there may have been an error in calculation., If you have any affirmative defenses that apply to your case including the passage of the statute of limitations, you must list them separately after responding to the plaintiff's allegations.If there is an affirmative defense that applies in your case, you must raise it in your answer or you won't be able to bring it up again in the future.Since affirmative defenses are waived if not raised in your answer, you should err on the side of including a defense, even if you're not entirely sure if it applies to your situation. It's better to include an affirmative defense you later learn you can't prove than to later find out an affirmative defense you didn't raise would have won you the case.If your income is exempt from collection, for example if your only income is from Social Security or disability benefits, you can include this at the end of your answer for information purposes.The plaintiff may reconsider the cost of suing you if it realizes it cannot collect.
You may have a counterclaim if the debt collector has violated the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (FDCPA). Review the federal law or speak with an attorney, especially if you've been receiving phone calls from the collection agency late at night or at your workplace.If you successfully prove violations of the FDCPA, you could be awarded attorney's fees and costs along with statutory damages of $1,000, in addition to any other punitive or economic damages., After you've completed the body of your complaint, leave a blank line and some space for your signature.


Below your signature, print or type your full legal name as well as contact information including your address, phone number, and email address., If the court requires any additional information or forms, they will be included with your answer form or listed on your summons.For example, some states such as Washington require you to fill out a Declaration of Exempt Income and Assets in addition to your answer. This form lists income such as Social Security benefits and assets such as your residence that are exempt from collection by state law., Some jurisdictions require you to have your signature verified by signing it in front of the clerk or in the presence of a notary public.


Answers typically must include verified signatures if you raise certain affirmative defenses that relate directly to the merits of the plaintiff's case.Make at least one copy of your answer for your records before you file it, as the court will keep your originals. You should also make a copy to send to the plaintiff's attorney – don't send the plaintiff your originals., The certificate of service states that you have had the plaintiff served with a copy of your answer.


Write the date you plan to have the plaintiff (or the plaintiff's attorney) served and the address on the complaint, then check the box or write out how you intend to provide service. Typically you can have your answer hand-delivered – whether by a sheriff's deputy, a private process serving company, or by anyone over the age of 18 – or you can mail the answer using certified mail., You must serve the plaintiff on the same day you fill out the certificate of service.You typically can serve the answer by mailing it to the plaintiff's attorney using certified mail. You'll find an address under the attorney's signature on the complaint. Once you mail your answer, keep your certified mail receipt as proof of service.If the complaint you received did not have a file number, you may not have to file your answer with the clerk (since the lawsuit itself has not been filed yet), but you do have to serve the plaintiff by sending a copy of your answer to the plaintiff's attorney before the deadline listed on your summons., You typically can file your answer with the court either by mailing it or hand delivering it to the clerk's office.


When you file your answer, the clerk usually will provide you with a court date for the trial. Mark that date on your calendar and be sure you show up to court on that day if you aren't able to settle the case before then.Some states such as Massachusetts require you to file your answer with the clerk within five days of the date you served the plaintiff.Any such deadline will be listed on your summons.

, If you have the ability to do so, you might consider contacting the company that sued you and finding a way to settle out of court.


The company may be much more willing to settle for a substantially lower amount after you've filed an answer to the complaint requiring them to prove each allegation. Additionally, collection agencies typically are more willing to settle if you've hired an attorney."

Use an online search engine.,
Compare banks with similar features.,
Visit banks in your area.,
Consider using an online bank.,
Negotiate to eliminate fees.",How to Avoid Minimum Balance Fees1," The first way to avoid paying minimum balance fees on any account you have is to put your money into a bank that does not charge any such fees. You can search for banks, locally or nationally, using any of a variety of online search engines. You can enter certain criteria that are important to you and receive information about banks that meet those conditions.


For example, at FindABetterBank.com, you can use their search feature to search for banks with no fees or limited fees. The search feature will ask you a series of questions to establish which features are most important to you. Based on your answers, it will generate a list of banks you may consider.;
, Whenever you are considering a new bank, you should make sure that you are looking at the same group of features. If you are considering two or more banks, and the features they offer are different, then you should consider the value of those features. For example, you may be willing to pay some small fees for features that are important to you, such as unlimited ATM use.You should consider all the ways in which you use your bank before you begin your search. Then rank the features in order of importance.

, In addition to searching online, which will consider hundreds of banks across the country, you should search locally. Either call or walk in to a local bank and ask to speak with an accounts manager. In many cases, small local banks will offer better deals with fewer fees because they want to generate local business., Online banks are institutions that do not exist in a physical building. They still offer many of the same services, such as storing your money, check writing, and even ATM use. Because they do not have the same overhead costs as a physical bank, they can afford to charge fewer fees for the same services.The website MyBankTracker.com provides a list of online banks and reviews of their services., When you open an account with a bank, you should speak with an account manager about eliminating minimum balance fees. At a smaller bank, that is trying to attract your business, the manager may be able to help you with these fees. If you have a good credit record, without a history of overdrawing your accounts, you may be able to encourage the bank to do away with these fees."

Know where you have your accounts.,
Read your statements each month, even of accounts you don't use frequently.,
Read the fine print.,
Choose accounts without inactivity fees, especially for longer-term accounts, such as retirement accounts.,
Make a small transaction regularly.,
Keep your address current.,
Know the rules.,
Question the fee.,
Keep your checkbook balanced and current.",How to Avoid a Bank Inactivity Fee," Keep a simple list. You may wish to list the banks' contact information on the same list.;
, Be on the lookout for fees and any other unexpected activities.

, Find out what the rules are about inactive accounts at your bank. Most banks can provide you with a copy of your account agreement and rules if you request one.

, For tax-deferred accounts, remember that fees may come out of the same money that has a special tax status, and that that money is often subject to annual contribution limits.

, Even if you keep an account for the purpose of long-term storage, do something with it every now and then, such as depositing or transferring a little money. The frequency (and in some cases, the amount) will depend on the terms of your account.


If you keep a calendar, write your next transaction on it when you make the previous one. If you keep an electronic calendar, make it a recurring appointment with a reminder in advance of when you need to act.
Find out whether checking your balance counts as an activity. If the bank only needs to know that you still exist, logging in now and then or making a phone call might be enough.
Find out whether automatic transactions count to avoid inactivity fees.
Make sure the transaction you make won't put your accounts below any minimum balances or trigger other fees.
Find out whether transactions in linked accounts count. If you have multiple accounts at the same institution, they may all count as one.

, Depending on your bank and how it handles your inactivity, you may be notified of inactivity before your account is charged a fee—or declared abandoned. That notice will probably arrive at whatever address is on file for you, so be sure to update your address each time you move.

, In some places, inactivity fees are forbidden. , If you do get charged an inactivity fee, call your bank and object. Not all banks will refund a fee, but many will—once—if you ask. If a bank gets enough complaints, it could even change the policy and fee schedule.


If you do get a fee refunded, take steps to make sure the problem doesn't happen again.

, Don't compound the loss of an inactivity fee by accidentally incurring an overdraft or dropping below a minimum balance because of it.

Select an overdraft option.,
Ask to have an overdraft charge eliminated.,
Negotiate if you have a series of overdraft charges.",How to Avoid Being Charged Overdraft Fees1," Your bank may offer a service that limits or completely eliminates overdraft fees. Typically you have three such options:


Overdraft coverage: a limited coverage in which the bank will honor a check that pulls your balance below zero, anticipating that you will reimburse them in the immediate future.
Overdraft protection: the bank will automatically withdraw funds from another of your accounts or grant you a line of credit in the event of an overdraft. A line of credit typically involves interest payments and transaction fees.
Complete opt-out: you're under no obligation to have any overdraft protection at all. If you opt out, one or more of your checks could be rejected. In such a case you might be charged an overdraft fee.;
, If you very rarely overdraw an account you've maintained for a long time, approach a customer-service representative about having the overdraft fee removed. Many banks will waive such a fee for normally reliable customers.

, Your bank may consider waiving a series of charges stemming from the same overdraft if you're willing to set up a savings account for automatic overdraft protection. As an added incentive you could offer to accept other services with the bank in exchange for eliminating the fees.

Find out why your account was closed.,
Determine if you're entitled to any notice.,
Review your recent purchases.,
Get a check for the balance.,
Suspend automatic payments.,
Take care of any direct deposits.,
Look at your ChexSystems report.,
File a complaint with your government banking authority.",How to React if Your Bank Closes Your Account1," When you get notification from the bank that your account is being closed, that notification also may give you a reason – but not necessarily. Even if it does, it's still a good idea to call your bank's customer service number and ask.Your country may have laws forbidding the closure of an account for a discriminatory reason, such as because of your race or gender. Aside from that, banks generally are free to close accounts for any reason or for no reason at all.
Typically accounts are closed because you are significantly overdrawn, have had frequent overdrafts, or have bounced a number of checks.
Keep in mind that in most cases, the bank is not required by law to tell you why they closed your account, and may refuse to give you a reason.;
, In some countries, banking law requires a bank to provide you with reasonable notice if they are going to close your account. What constitutes ""reasonable"" may differ significantly.For example, New Zealand requires at least 14 days' notice, while at least 30 calendar days' notice is required in the U.K. for personal accounts.The amount of time that constitutes reasonable notice also may depend on whether your account is a business or personal account, and whether you are the only account holder or hold the account jointly with someone else.

, If you only use your debit card for purchases, you may not have any pending transactions. However, if you've recently written a check and it hasn't cleared your account yet, you'll need to make arrangements with the merchant.If you have online access to your account, check the list of transactions and reconcile them with your own receipts or records of purchases to figure out what's still outstanding. If you can't access your account online, go to a branch and ask for a print-out of your recent transactions.

, If your account balance is positive when the bank closes your account, it should issue you a check for the balance. If your account is over drafted, on the other hand, you'll need to make arrangements to pay that off.If you do have an overdraft on the account, try to make arrangements with the bank to get it paid as quickly as possible. Owing money to a bank can devastate your credit, and may impede you from being able to get another bank account.
Keep in mind that while the account remains overdrawn, you also may incur additional fees, increasing the cost the longer you go without paying it.

, If you have automatic payments set up through your bank, they likely have already been stopped. However, if you have any automatic payments set up through the company you have to pay, you'll need to contact that company to have the payments stopped.Go through your records and make sure you've gotten everything. Look out especially for payments that may only come every other month or once a year.

, If you get your paycheck direct-deposited to your bank account, you'll need to make other arrangements before the bank closes your account for good. You may want to let a check go through, however, if you have an overdraft.Take a look at the balance and, if there is an overdraft, talk to someone in customer service at your bank about the situation. If you over-drafted soon before your check hit, the bank may be willing to work with you to reinstate your account.
If reinstatement isn't an option, call your employer or the payroll department as soon as possible to make sure the situation is corrected so you'll have access to your paycheck. If your employer requires direct deposit of paychecks, you may have to open another bank account first, but your employer needs to know about the situation as soon as possible.

, If you bank in the United States, the account closure may have been reported to ChexSystems, a consumer reporting service that provides banks with information about your banking history and relationship with banks.There are several different companies in the U.S. that do this, but ChexSystems is the most popular. You may want to contact your bank to find out which system they use.
You can get a copy of your report by visiting consumerdebit.com or calling 1-800-428-9623.
If there are any inaccuracies on the report, you can dispute them with ChexSystems and they will work with the reporting institution to correct them.

, If you believe the bank's closure of your account was illegal or unfair, you can take the issue to your government's banking authority. Search online to find the correct office to file your complaint.For example, in the U.K., you would file a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman service.
In the U.S., if you feel the bank has closed your account unfairly, go to consumerfinance.gov and file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Before you file your complaint, gather as much information and documentation as you can of the account closure. The more information you provide the government, the better they can help you.

Find reliable methods to check your account balances.,
Know when and how your account balances are measured.,
Make adjustments to your balances as necessary to avoid fees.",How to Avoid Minimum Balance Fees2," Most banks now offer the ability to check your account records online or even by telephone. Many banks provide an app for use on most smart phones, so you can check your balance in the palm of your hand., Banks can use one of two different methods to determine whether to apply a minimum balance charge to your account. If you are aware of these methods and keep track of your accounts, you should be able to stay a step ahead of the bank and avoid incurring any minimum balance fees. Banks commonly assess fees based on either your daily or monthly balances. You should ask the bank officer which system is used when you set up your account:A daily balance system checks your account balance at the end of each day.
An average monthly balance system measures your account balance each day, and calculates the average balance at the end of the month.

, When you know your bank's system for measuring your balances and assessing fees, you can correct your balance to avoid those fees.If your bank applies the daily balance system checks, you will need to be aware of your balance each day. If you know that you have dropped below the minimum balance with some transaction during the day, you should add money to your account by the end of the day to avoid the fee. Using online banking or your cell phone app should help with regular daily balance checks.
If your bank applies the average monthly balance system, then as the end of the month nears, you will need to check your average balance. You can either get a printout of the month's activity, and then calculate the average yourself, or see if your account report will include a running monthly average.

Link multiple accounts together.,
Set up direct deposit.,
Pay your bills online.,
Combine resources with a trusted friend.",How to Avoid Minimum Balance Fees3," If a bank measures a combined balance of multiple accounts, then it is already using a system of linking your accounts together. If this has not been suggested, you may wish to ask about it when setting up your account. Find out if you can link a savings or retirement account to your checking account, and thereby avoid paying maintenance fees. Some banks will even let you avoid paying fees if you have your mortgage or other significant loan with them., Ultimately, banks make money by holding your savings. If you set up a direct deposit for your paycheck, the bank will be able to count on that regular source of income. Many banks offer programs that eliminate fees if you establish a direct deposit account with them.You may need to ask about the direct deposit feature for avoiding fees when you open your account. It may not be evident unless you ask about it.

, If you use your bank’s online bill paying features, you can often avoid minimum balance fees. Even if you use the online bill paying as infrequently as once a month, many banks will credit this and will not charge the maintenance fees., Find someone you can trust to share an account with. If the two of you combine your money, you will each have an easier time maintaining a minimum balance.


The bank will consider the account to be a single account. You and your friend will need to develop a system of managing the account between yourselves, so you each know how much of the money belongs to each of you. If you can do this, you should have an easier time meeting the minimum balance.

Have everything prepared prior to getting into the line.,
Ask all questions that you have that is not in writing.,
Understand and respect any signs in and out of the bank.,
Have patience.,
Know when the bank is in operation.,
Acknowledge how long a check would take to be cleared.",How to Practice Proper Bank Etiquette," If you have multiple transactions, always have it ready and available. You can also easily organize them using paper clips or sticky notes at home. Be sure to have the proper picture identification card and bank card in your hand, so that you're not fidgeting in your wallet when you are asked for it at the last minute.


If you're planning to open a new account, research on the specific documents you will need beforehand. They will require a valid picture identification card (that includes a date of birth and current address) and a social security card. New accounts are created in a different section of the bank (such as Customer Service), not with the bank teller, so be sure to find the correct signs.
Be sure to thoroughly read any fine print before selecting a specific bank account, especially concerning the interest rates, overdrawn fee penalties, if one needs to use their credit/debit card (usually ""X"" times in a month), etc.;
, It's wise to get the full information, instead of being in a situation where something happens and you get penalized for it out of nowhere.

, Some banks offer the convenient option of drive-through banking, however, they may be limited on what they can do, versus banking inside.

, While most metro and big banks have five to seven tellers assisting clients, especially at rush or high volume hours, smaller local ones typically have one to two at any time. Please do not question tellers in the middle of a transaction, as this is not only rude and disrespectful, but it is a breach of privacy with the other person.

, This fluctuates and is different from bank to bank. Most to all banks are open from Monday through Friday (non holidays), with the option of Saturday. Selective locations may be open on Sunday, usually if the bank is located in a supermarket.


Friday afternoon is the busiest time for a bank, as many people are coming off work to deposit their paycheck before the weekend. Mondays are also typically busy, especially when the bank is closed on the weekend.
ATMs (automated teller machines) allow the clients to do limited banking at any hour of the day. ATMs can be used by anyone with a regular bank account to withdraw money from, however, they may find having to pay a fee if the ATM is not associated with their specific bank branch.

, Some banks, such as Bank of America, automatically deposits a certain amount (depending on your current available balance), but the remaining would be cleared the next business day of the bank. So for example, if you deposited a check on a Friday and if the bank is closed on the weekends, with Monday as a federal holiday, the entire check would appear on your bank statement on Tuesday. The clearance of deposits differentiate from bank to bank, so please be aware of this information to avoid disputes with tellers and other bank associates.

Visit the genre of shops in the area that apply to the type of auction you want to attend.,
Read newspaper ads.,
If there is a phone number in the ad, find out the terms.,
Find out when inspection time starts and attend!,
When you attend your first sale, take note of the 1/2 dozen or so dealers that buy the most often.,
When you do find a good auction, attend it as often as possible.",How to Find a Great Auction to Buy Items for Resale," For example, if you're looking for a good antique auction to start attending, stop in the local antiques shops and ask what there are for good auctions in the area. Sounds obvious, right?! But here is what to listen for...listen to what the dealer doesn't say. The more a dealer speaks poorly or negatively about an auction he or she attends, the more likely they are trying to keep a good thing secret. Think for a moment, why would a dealer keep attending a lousy auction?;
, Look for ads in the classified ad section rather than flashy display ads. Flashy ads are indicative of an auction that will be high priced and may have reserves (a set price on an item) and a very enormous crowd. While any auction can be profitable to attend, it is usually best to steer clear of the glitzy ones, at least for the beginner.

, Is it an absolute auction? An absolute auction is one that has no minimum or reserve bids on items. These are the best auctions to attend! Is there a buyer's premium? A buyer's premium is like a tax that everyone who purchases at that auction must pay above the winning bid price. Most auctions in our days do charge a buyer's premium, 10% is not unreasonable. There is also something called a credit card penalty. This is usually disguised by stating a 12 or 13% BP that is discounted for cash or check payments, hence a 2 or 3 % percent penalty for using your CC. Don't you already pay enough interest when you use a credit card?

, A good auction gives at least 2-3 hours to inspect the merchandise. Never attend an auction if you can't make the inspection, unless you're prepared to gamble. Most auctioneers sell at a rate of about 100 items per hour, which is why they sell ""as is"". They simply don't have the time to give a detailed description of all the items. Since almost all items at auction are sold AS IS, there are sure to be some damaged, refinished, fake and incomplete items at any given auction. Beware of any auctions that offer very little or no inspection time.

, Ask them where there are other auctions in the area that they attend.

, By frequenting good sales you help increase the bottom line of that business helping to ensure that they'll stay in business. It's tough for many auctioneers to keep the quality of merchandise consistent, so good attendance certainly helps. And when an auctioneer gets to know you as a buyer, he/she will go out of the way to accommodate you, and keep you coming back.

Negotiate for lower fees.",How to Minimize Bank Fees1," When you are shopping for a new bank, think about the services or features that you use and appreciate the most. Then consider which features you may not need and could do without. For example, some people will be willing to pay more for unlimited ATM use, but don’t care about free checking. Another person, however, may rely on writing checks and will want to minimize those particular fees.You should consider all the ways in which you use your bank before you begin your search. Then rank the features in order of importance.;
, Use an online search engine to look for banks that say they don’t charge banking fees. The best way to minimize paying fees on any account is to put your money into a bank that does not charge any such fees. Run a search for “no fee banks” or something similar. If you select a more specialized search engine related to banking, you can enter certain criteria that are important to you and receive information about banks that meet those conditions.


For example, you can use the search feature at FindABetterBank.com to search for banks with no fees or limited fees. You will be asked a series of questions to help decide which features are most important to you. Based on your answers, you will generate a list of banks that best fit your desires., Online banks do not exist in a physical building. Nevertheless, these financial institutions still offer many of the same services. With an online bank, you can still deposit and withdraw money, write checks and have access to ATMs across the country. Because these institutions do not have the same overhead costs as a physical bank, they may be able to charge lower or fewer fees for the same services.MyBankTracker.com provides a list of online banks and reviews of their services., Searching online is a useful tool and can give you information about nationwide banks. However, you may be able to find better deals and more customer service at a smaller, local bank. Either call or walk in to a local bank and ask to speak with an accounts manager. Because the smaller bank may need your business, you might be able to get some special deals with lower fees., When you have narrowed your search for a bank, you should speak with an account manager before opening an account. Ask about eliminating fees for some of the services that are most important to you. At a smaller bank that is trying to attract your business, the manager may be able to help you with these fees. If you are a good customer, with a strong banking history, the bank may be encouraged to draw your business and might be willing to reduce or deduct certain fees."

Avoid relying on your ""available balance."",
Keep your check register up to date.,
Balance your checkbook.,
Include bank card purchases in your register.,
Remember that deposited checks, including paychecks, take time to post to your account.",How to Avoid Being Charged Overdraft Fees2," It's tempting to accept the ""available balance"" shown on your ATM receipt. However, that figure does not reflect checks that haven't yet been presented for payment (""outstanding"" checks) or bank card purchases that haven't been processed yet. You may also have some automatic payments that will occur within the next few days.

, The best way to ascertain your available balance is to keep your check register up to date. Immediately record every transaction so that you have an accurate record of checks that will soon be presented for payment. That will let you know how much money you have available.


Find out if your bank or credit union has an app to help you maintain your check register. Check with your bank about online services. Many banks offer a portfolio of services to help their customers manage money.
If you prefer managing your register on paper, do it consistently so that you know that your available balance is accurate.

, A pending overdraft fee may indicate that you haven't balanced your checkbook lately. Do this regularly in search of arithmetical errors or failure to record transactions.

, If you occasionally make bank card purchases, be sure to note them in your register. Such purchases, like checks, often take a few days to clear.

, It's best to wait a day or two before drawing on those deposits. (The bank can tell you when those funds will be available for use.)

Try the envelope system.,
Create an artificial buffer.,
Ask about your bank's policy regarding deposits and payments.,
Look into your bank's policy regarding the crediting of deposits.",How to Avoid Being Charged Overdraft Fees3," One way to avoid overdraft fees is to use mainly cash in your transactions. You can do that and stay within budget by using the envelope system.Take several envelopes and label them according to budget items (gasoline, eating out, groceries, etc.).
At the beginning of the month take out cash from your account and put the amount that's budgeted for each expense item in the envelope with the appropriate label. For example, if you've budgeted $100 for gasoline for the month, put $100 in the envelope labeled ""gasoline.""
When you want to buy something within your budget, do so by pulling the cash out of the appropriate envelope. If it's time to spend $20 for gasoline, pull $20 out of that envelope and use it to pay for your fuel.

, Give yourself a cushion in the event something goes wrong or you make an error when balancing your checkbook. Set a lower limit for your balance, and never let it fall below that. For example, you might prefer never to let your account fall below $100 (perhaps $500 if you write a lot of checks or often write big checks). Some accounts require a minimum balance to avoid fees. Fees for going below a minimum balance are generally smaller than overdraft fees, but they are still an unnecessary expense. Ask your bank or credit union if they have such fees, and what their requirements are for your minimum balance.
If you're trying to build up savings, maintain your own minimum balance (above whatever the bank requires), and raise that minimum every month. Besides creating your own insurance against overdraft fees, you'll also be providing a cash cushion, which can help you avoid going into debt in case of a financial emergency or unexpected expense.

, Some banks will process payments prior to processing deposits. That means if you have a deposit and a payment on the same day, your account could drop below zero if the payment is processed before the deposit. Understand the policy, and schedule your payments accordingly.

, You might find that corporate paychecks clear sooner than handwritten checks do. Familiarize yourself with the bank's policies about how long it takes certain checks to clear, so that you know when you can expect the money to be credited to your account.

Identify banks that do not use ChexSystems.,
Try a small community bank.,
Consider a credit union.,
Look for a second chance checking account.",How to React if Your Bank Closes Your Account2," If your bank closed your account, you may have negative information on your ChexSystems report. However, not all banks use ChexSystems. There also are some that review all applications on a case-by-case basis.Likewise, if your bank used a different service, you should look for banks that don't use that service. These banks will be more likely to open an account for you because they won't know about what happened between you and the bank that closed your account.
You may be able to find this information on the bank's website. If not, you can always call the toll-free customer service line and ask. Many branches also have the logo of the service they use on their doors.

, Smaller community banks are far more likely to review applications on a case-by-case basis, and typically are more forgiving if you had your account closed because you overdrafted or made a mistake.If you apply for an account at a small community bank, go into the branch in person rather than applying online (many of these small banks don't even accept applications online). Dress presentably in clean, neat clothing so you make a good impression with the banker.
Be as open and honest as possible about your past relationship with your old bank and the reason you want to open an account. This can prevent you from having problems again with this bank if they discover you lied on your application or failed to disclose important information.

, Since credit unions are owned by their members, they tend to be more forgiving of past mistakes. Credit unions also typically offer more assistance with budgeting and financial responsibility, if that has been a problem for you in the past.Credit unions typically only allow certain types of people to be members. For example, they may only accept employees of certain companies, people who live in a certain community, or people who fit other criteria. Check the credit union's website to find out if you meet their membership criteria before you apply.
You also might ask your employer if there are any credit unions you qualify for because you work there.

, In the United States and some other countries, a number of large banks offer second chance checking accounts for people who have a history of troubled banking relationships.Use these accounts as a last resort. They typically have annual fees and may require you to maintain a fairly substantial minimum balance at all times. They also may have other requirements that you would have difficulty meeting.
If you do get a second chance checking account, you typically have the option of converting it to a regular account after you maintain it responsibly for a year or longer.

In other countries, you may be able to find similar services.You also can find a lot of information online or in personal finance books at your local library to help you get your financial life in order.
If your bank account was closed due to overdrafts or bounced checks, you may want to use these resources to get a better handle on your finances.

, If you've had problems in the past keeping up with your finances, you may want to check your bank account on a daily basis and make sure you know what's coming in and what's going out, and when.Set up online access to your new bank account so you can check the transactions in real time.
Use a debit card rather than checks, which will make it easier for you to keep track of your money since checks can take several days to clear your account.

, If you open a new bank account, make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully and understand what fees you'll be charged and when you'll be charged them. This is especially important if you have a second chance checking account, as these typically come with more fees than a standard checking account.If you regularly take out cash at ATMs, try to do so at your own bank's ATM rather than the ATM of another bank or third party. Even if the fee is small, these can add up and are easy to forget when you're mentally calculating how much money you have.

, Your bank will send you a statement every month, whether electronically or in the mail. Even if you review your transactions online regularly, it's still important to go through this statement.Deadlines to report errors or fraudulent transactions, or to dispute transactions or fees, often are connected to the date the statement was issued. For this reason, it's important to review your statement and make sure everything is correct.
Keep your own records and keep track of your receipts. You may want to use an online finance app for this purpose. Most require you to pay for a subscription, but some are free.

, If you've set up automatic payments for your bills, a reminder a few days or even a week before will ensure that you check your bank account and make sure there's enough money there to cover the bill.The reminder also puts the payment to the front of your mind, so you remember to mentally discount your balance by that amount.

, If you have the means to do so, opening a checking and savings account at the same bank and linking the two accounts can help you avoid overdrafting your checking account in the future.When you have a linked savings account, if your transactions exceed your balance, your bank will automatically transfer money from your savings account, or draw from the savings account rather than from your checking account.
Check for and be aware of fees for doing this. Some banks will only withdraw a certain amount from your savings account at a time to cover overdrafts, and others charge a fee for this service, which may be as high as the fee they would charge for an overdraft or bounced check.

, A common fee that is charged by most banks is the overdraft fee. This is a fee that is almost entirely within your own control. You just need to keep track of the balances in your accounts - most notably, your checking account - and be careful not to write any checks beyond that amount. This will also apply to whatever account is linked to your debit card, since a debit card works much the same way as writing checks.You may get some help in avoiding overdraft fees if you can link your checking or debit account with your savings or money market account. If you link your accounts in this way, you will be less likely to overdraw.

, Some banks allow free, unlimited ATM use, while other banks may allow you a number of visits, and then charge a fee for each use. You should also know if your bank is a member of any national or worldwide ATM networks. You may be allowed free ATM use within your network but be charged a fee for using ATM outside your network.If you have any questions about ATM fees, call your bank and ask.
You can avoid paying ATM fees by staying within your network and monitoring your use so you do not exceed the number of free visits that your bank allows.

, Many banks will charge a fee for replacing a lost credit card, debit card or ATM card. In some cases, this charge may be as high as $20. This is one fee that you should be able to control. Be careful with your cards, and you will not need to contact the bank for any replacements.Don’t accept this fee on its face. If the need arises to replace one of your cards, contact a customer service representative at the bank. Find out if the bank intends to charge a replacement fee. If so, you can often have the fee waived simply by asking.

, Many large banks will charge a fee if you close your account prematurely. When you open your account, you should find out whether there is any requirement to keep your account for a set length of time. Banks rely on the certainty of having your money, and if you withdraw prematurely, they may charge a fee for that. To avoid the fee, just be aware of the requirement and stick to it.If you must close your account early, try (as with anything else) to negotiate your way out of the fee. Speak with a manager at the bank and try to explain that you have a strong reason for closing your account early.

, Fees related to credit card use are a part of banking costs. The most common credit card fee is charged for making your monthly payments late. Nearly every credit card issuer charges a fee, ranging from $10 to $50 for each late payment.Paying your credit card bills on time not only helps you avoid the late fee but also helps maintain a positive credit rating.

Ask questions when you open your account.,
Read and react to notices from your bank.,
Consolidate your accounts.,
Keep your bank aware of any address change.",How to Minimize Bank Fees3," Too many people open accounts quickly and without planning. If you seek to open an account, whether savings, checking or money market, you should find out about the fees that are connected to it. Some of these fees are within the bank’s control, while others may be the result of federal regulations. In either case, it is your duty as the account holder to understand the fees that you face.For example, federal banking regulations limit the number of withdrawals per month that you can make from a money market account. If you need regular access to your money, you might get charged excessive fees if you open the wrong account too quickly.

, If your bank is going to institute a new fee or increase the charges on an existing fee, they must provide you with notice before enacting these changes. These notices often come in your monthly bank statement. Too many people disregard the details of these notices and, as a result, are not aware of the change in fees. To avoid getting caught off guard, you should check you monthly statement carefully and read the details of any notices that are included.If you receive notice of a new or increasing fee, you should decide what action you can take to minimize the impact of the change. For example, if you receive a notice that your bank is going to start charging for ATM use, you can then change your habits regarding the use of ATMs.

, Operating with multiple bank accounts only increases the possibility that you will be charged fees. It also will multiply the amount of total charges that you could face. For example, if your bank charges a monthly maintenance fee for each account, then having three accounts open will triple the amount of the fee that you pay. Carrying multiple accounts also increases the possibility that your minimum balances may drop below allowed levels.For example, some people might open separate accounts for “Household spending,” “Child Care Expenses” and “College Savings.” While on the face, these seem to make sense, you subject yourself to multiple fees. A better plan would be to combine these into a single account and then keep your own private records of the subcategories.

, If you move, you need to notify your bank of your new address right away. Some banks charge fees for returned mail. You also risk missing notices of changes in fees if the bank does not have your current address. If the bank does not know your current address, they can’t notify you of fee changes. Even so, you remain responsible."

Review the Fashion Auction sites and Choose the Right One for you


The sites differ in many ways, including the types of fashion items offered (LuxeWin is more Contemporary, Oohilove is more Luxury, JoJoLie is more Classic, etc.,
Study the Bidding Patterns of Prior Winners


Each site allows you to view past auction wins.,
Use your Free Bids


Sites generally offer new players from 1 on (Oohilove) to as many as 5 on (LuxeWin) Free Bids for registering.,

Do not waste your bids early on in the game.,
Start with Beginners Only Auctions


Most sites have them and reserve them for those bidders that have not yet won an auction.,
Select which Auctions to Bid on Carefully


If you’ve studied the pattern of prior auctions, you should see that there are certain days of the week, times of the day and types of items that are less competitive.,
Be In It to Win It


Don’t participate with a few bids in many auctions but rather concentrate your bids on the very few that really matter.,
Consider Using the Bid Concierge To Bid For You

Keep the Faith and Have Fun


Don’t expect to win right away or to win without purchasing bids.",How to Win Online Penny Auctions,"), the cost of purchasing bids, the auction rules, the number of Free Bids that you get, the number of bidders per auction, etc. Focus on the one site that has the products that you want and the right mix of factors to increase your chance of winning.;
, Note the user names of frequent winners. These “whales” often win because they are willing to throw a large number of bids at a particular auction item, so you don’t want to get into a bidding war with them if you can avoid it. Conversely, you will see that some winners are able to win using very few bids and at very advantageous prices. Was it time of day, type of item, time overlap with another auction that ran long? Look for patterns that will give you the advantage.

, Use them before considering the purchase of a Bid Pack. Clustering them in one auction is usually more successful than spreading them out across multiple auctions.

, Wait till the auction clock reaches the last few seconds to start bidding. Keep in mind that waiting too long can cause your bid to not make it to the site’s server on time due to your internet connection and other factors, so generally 5 seconds or so is as late as you may want to be.

, The auction item is usually of lesser value, or a Bid Pack, but there are fewer bidders and no “whales” to compete against. Here’s where you can test strategic approaches against other newer bidders.

, There will be a lot more bidders for the Jimmy Choo Bag than for the Rachel Leigh Earrings. Don’t bid on items that you really don’t want but don’t throw away your bids hoping beyond hope that you will win a $1,500 item with just a few bids either. Work the system to your advantage.

, You have got to be willing to put a sizable number of bids behind your involvement in an auction to ensure that you outlast other bidders. Buy plenty of Bids in advance to make sure that you don’t run out mid-auction.

, You can input the price at which you’d like the Concierge to start bidding for you, the price at which you’d like the Concierge to stop bidding for you and the number of bids you would like for it to place. Many of the “whales” have learned to use the Bid Concierge effectively. On many high value items, the highest bidder frequently engaged the Bid Concierge to secure the win.

, The Free Bids give you a chance to get a taste of the action and a feel for how it all works without risk. Winners buy plenty of bids and are willing to commit when they select an auction they want to win. They don’t win every time, and didn’t necessarily win in the beginning, but they continued and developed strategies that have paid off for them. You can be a winner too if you learn how to work the system to your advantage.

, On this step, you can set the following:


Auction type
Standard Auction: This is a single quantity auction.
Dutch Auction: Dutch auction enables you to list a multiple quantity auction. For example, if you have 100 pens to sell you can list all of these together in a single lot. Bidders will be able to select how many they wish to bid for.
Currency: You can select your preferred auction currency using the drop down menu available.
Quantity: This field is only active if listing a Dutch auction. Please see above for an explanation of this listing type.
Auction Starts At: This requires you to enter the minimum bid you are willing to accept. You can also set a reserve price to ensure you do not sell the item for this amount. Please see below for more information on this.
Reserve Price: Enabling a reserve price effectively means you will not sell the item for less than the amount set, for example you can set the start price at 5.00 but only accept winning bids over 50.00, should a bid be placed for 49.99 the item will close without a winner.
Buy out (if available): Buy out allows you to set an amount you are willing to sell the item for straight out. For example you can set the start price to 10.00 but offer interested parties the option to buy the item immediately for 100.00.

You can also list buy out only auctions. These auctions remove all bidding options, meaning the listing can only be purchased for a set amount. To set a buy out only auction, you need to set the buy out value to be exactly equal with the start bid.


Offer-Range (if available): You can set a price bracket in which you are willing to list to give offers. For example, if you set the price brackets from 15.00 to 100.00 interested parties will be able to offer you an amount within these brackets, you can opt whether to accept or decline these offers at any time via the member's area.
Bid increment: This option can be used to set your own custom bid increment if preferred.

Play in all possible auctions: The first rule is to participate in all auctions one at a time weather or not you need the product.,
Place bids early: When you place bids early, your chances of getting a position highly increase and you spend less in the process.,
Create Gaps: As the auction progresses, more bidders join the fun, and many think the winning bid will be far away from the maximum price.,
Bid for fixed value: Conventionally it’s seen that participants, who bid at Bidstall, end up winning when their bidding amount is about 30-40% of the product.,
Heavy bidding: While this strategy is recommended for bidders with high risk appetite, it’s not a bad strategy either.,
Finally remember, there is no free lunch anywhere, there never will be.",How to Win Bidstall Online Bidding Auctions," Bidstall, provides you the chance to convert your win to cash or credits . This may work out as e side income or you can accumulate credits towards playing in bigger Bigger unique strategy based auctions where the need to buy bid package is greatly reduced.;
, Further the possibilities of getting to know where opponent bidders are placed relative to you is increased. At Bidstall you end up paying a less bidding fee if you are an early bidder in the strategy based auction.

, With a proper strategy, this mindset of other bidders can be used to your advantage. The recommended technique during an auction bid process is to get a position first by placing a bid & follow it up with a series of 20-30 bids downwards. In the process leave one or 2 gap bids. In the event your lower positions are cracked you always place the gap numbers as the competition is likely high on the lower side of the bidding bracket.

, So be ready to invest that percentage of amount. No guarantee you will win, but statistically about 95% of bidders have been winners when their investment is between 30-40%. The more you bid the better your chances of winning.

, When you place more bids, you essentially knock out competition from freebies & small bidders, but still have a chance of getting the product. Keep a tab on your bid packs to ensure you do not overbid the value of the product in the one of the best strategy based auction sites.

, Bidding fee in strategy based unique auctions is non refundable. So always bid carefully and responsibly. If you still lose accept the loss sportingly, as you cannot win everything. It’s a game, in which, there is only one eventual winner. Accept that win or loss is a part of the game and move on to the next auction.Master these online auction winning tricks.

Weigh the advantages and disadvantages of attending live and Internet auctions.,
Call your local police department and read the newspapers to learn about auctions in your area, if you've decided to attend a live auction.,
Research police auction websites if you decide to attend an auction on the Internet.",How to Buy Then Sell a Car Impounded by the Police1,"


Decide if attending a live auction is the right choice for you. Attending a live auction will allow you to see and inspect the cars. However, attending a live auction will take up more of your time than an Internet auction. The drive time and time spent at the auction will take up most, if not all, of a day. You will also need to make arrangements to get the vehicle home after it is purchased.
Browse the various Internet auction sites to determine if you want to attend an online auction. If you purchase a vehicle on the Internet, you can make all the bids from your computer. You won't need to worry about transporting the vehicle because it will be shipped to you. However, you will be relying on the information provided on the site regarding the condition of the vehicle. Unlike a live auction, there is no opportunity to inspect the vehicle.;
, Enforcement agencies will have information on when and where auctions are held. Agencies that impound vehicles also will put the information in your local newspaper.

, Some websites charge a fee for participating in vehicle auctions. When you find a site you like, register with the website.

Look for auctions held in less popular or crowded areas.,
Research the vehicles listed online a few days before the auction date.,
Bring cash or proof of an approved loan to the auction.,
Take a set of tools, car oil, and an air pressure gauge.,
Show up early and check in.,
Inspect the vehicles you are interested in bidding on.,
Do not bid more than you can afford.,
Check if there is a towing company on site.,
Get a key cut for the car by an on site locksmith, if available.,
Bring the car to a mechanic for a full inspection before driving it.",How to Buy Police Impounded Cars," Like any auction, the more crowded it is, the more competition you may have. A big crowd could drive the bidding prices up or cause you to lose out on a bid for a vehicle. Look for auctions that are situated in less populated areas or tend to fly under the radar.You can search for police auctions in certain areas online. Focus on auctions outside of a major city, if possible, or in a smaller town or city, as these may be less crowded than auctions held in larger cities or known areas.;
, Most auctions will list the vehicles that will be available at the auction a few days before the auction date. Look over each listing and identify which vehicles you are interested in bidding on. You should try to choose at least one to two vehicles in the event you lose out on a bid so you have a backup vehicle you can still bid on.If you have your eye on a Mercedes-Benz CLK listed online, for example, you should note the details listed for the car. Then, you should research the market value of a used Mercedes-Benz CLK and determine how much you would be willing to bid for the car. Make sure you are clear on the maximum you would be willing to spend on the car as this can prevent you from overbidding in the chaos of the auction.

, Police auctions will only take payment in cash or proof of an approved loan for the winning bid. If you are planning to pay with an approved loan from your bank, you will need to be able to cover a minimum deposit for the full cost of the vehicle.You will also need to cover the cost of taxes, title, and registration fees. Cars sold at auction do not come with a warranty and are considered “as is” so you will likely need to purchase insurance and a warranty for the car once you buy it.
You will also need enough money to cover the cost of towing the car from the auction and the cost of cutting new keys for the vehicle if it is sold without keys.

, You will not be able to drive the vehicles before you bid on them so inspecting the car beforehand with tools, car oil, and an air pressure gauge can help to ensure the car is in working order., The vehicles at a police auction are often shown in a set order so get to the auction early and check in with the auction. You can get a copy of the showing list at check in and have a chance to inspect the vehicles you are interested in before the auction starts., Use your set of tools to do a quick inspection of the vehicles you plan to bid on. The vehicles appear at the auction untouched, which means they are in the exact state they were in when they were confiscated by the police. Be prepared for the vehicles to be filthy, damaged, or full of someone else’s stuff.Do not be put off by surface level dirt or strong smells, as these can be cleaned out as long the vehicle’s parts are in good shape.Lift the hood of the vehicle and give it a good inspection. Look at the brakes, the shocks, and the quality of the tires on the vehicle. This will help you determine if the vehicle is worth bidding on and how much you should bid for the vehicle.

, It can be easy to get caught up in the chaos of bidding wars and quick sales at the auction, so focus on staying calm and not bidding more than you can afford. Remember your predetermined limit you set for yourself as you bid on the vehicles you are interested in and try not to overbid in an attempt to outbid someone else.


Avoid making quick, in the heat of the moment decisions and really be certain you want a vehicle before you start bidding on it. You don’t want to end up having to pay more for a vehicle than you can afford or than it’s worth because you got caught up in a bidding war.

, Depending on the condition of the car you bought at the auction, it may be drivable or it may require a tow to your home or to a car mechanic for a tune up. Most police auctions attract towing companies who know they will have customers who need their services. Look for a tow truck parked outside of the auction or ask the auction for a referral to a towing company located nearby.Some auctions allow you to store your purchased vehicle, for a fee, if you cannot pay for a tow or are planning to do maintenance on the car another time.

, Most auctions also attract locksmiths who can cut keys on site for cars that are sold without keys. Look for an on site locksmith or ask the auction to refer you to a locksmith nearby, as you will not be able to drive your new vehicle without a set of keys., Though you may have done a quick inspection on the vehicle before the auction began, you may not realize certain issues with the vehicle until you pay for it and get a closer look at it. Depending on the state of the car, you may want to have it towed to the nearest car garage, where you can get a full inspection and tune up on the car before driving it. This will ensure the car is safe and ready for the road."

,, This number is the least amount of payment you are willing to accept on the sale of your item. Setting the bottom limit protects you from having your item sold at an unreasonably low price or at a significant loss.

, Check autograph collecting publications, such as ""Autograph Collector"", that list advertisers from autograph auction companies, and websites like Roger Epperson's Autograph Alert Truth for reviews of autograph auction houses.

, For example, some auction houses specialize in autographs from famous sports personalities, others may specialize in notable personalities who have autographed stocks and bonds.

, Public records show that ""Remember When Auctions"" and ""RRAuctions"" have been involved in lawsuits related to autograph fraud. The Universal Autograph Collectors Club has issued warnings on at least one autograph auction company from New Hampshire.

, Autograph auction houses usually supply their terms on request. Often, this information is downloadable from their website.

, Unless you are a professional autograph dealer, the auction company should take responsibility for proper evaluation of your autographs, and also provide guarantees of authenticity to their customers.

, Is the auctioneer properly licensed in states that require licensing? Is the auctioneer a full-time autograph dealer or a front for an autograph dealer?

, Be prepared to send them copies of your autographs.

, This includes commissions, production costs, catalog photos, mailing and packaging, applicable taxes, and interest on cash advances. Get all of their fees in writing before proceeding further.

Sleep on it for at least 24 hours.,
Research the boat before the auction date.,
Stick to a limit.,
Know the terms of the auction house.,
Prepare your vehicle.",How to Buy a Boat at an Auction," A boat is a major purchase; it should not be made in haste. This is where most people get in trouble. The best deals are made when you can confidently and without regret, walk away from the bargaining table. At auction, if you are being impetuous, you will bid the price up higher than you really should.;
, If you can get in to the auction site early, and many houses have a preview day, do it. You need to get the exact specifications of the boat and price compare. You will have a horrible taste in your mouth if you end up buying a boat at auction that you could have purchased for a better price elsewhere.

, You need to have a budget and stick to it. If you want to spend $4000, then don't bid it to $4005. If you are going to be mad that you let it go for only $5 more than what you wanted to spend, then you need to budget $4005 for the boat. You have to go in with a definite stopping point, otherwise, you will get caught in a bidding war and in such a situation, it is very easy to let your emotions, rather than your wallet dictate. That is dangerous.

, Unless you walk around with a bag full of money, you will need to know beforehand how much down the auction house requires. If you need or plan on financing your purchase, you will need to have this taken care before the auction. Auction houses do not generally offer financing or broker such deals.

, Auction house terms not only define the purchase price and security deposits; they also dictate when the property must be removed. If this is an estate auction, it is usually the same day or within hours. Auctions at the auction house property might be a little more liberal and allow more time to remove the boat. They may also charge a storage fee if you cannot remove it right away, so read the fine print.

"
"
Attend a few auctions without bidding.,
Inspect the items or property prior to bidding.,
Speak to the auctioneer well in advance of the auction if you have questions or need clarifications.,
Get there early.,
Pre-register and get a bidding number.,
Be clear when making bids.,
Have transportation ready or be prepared to pay for delivery.",How to Bid at an Auction," This will help you understand what the auction involves and the procedures that are followed. It will also give you a good idea of how people bid and react to price increases.;
, This is very important for property, as auctions are usually sold ""as is"", so get your building inspections done in advance! For goods, pre-inspection times are set by the auctioneer, usually the day before or perhaps only hours before the live auction. Make use of this time; there is no point rocking up at the last minute and thinking you can work out what you want to bid on and why!

, If there are things you're not sure about, such as the title, condition of sale, auction process, etc., be sure to ask. It is useful to ask how long the auctioneer thinks it will take to get through the lots too. Most importantly, make sure you understand all the payment instructions and requirements before registering for an auction.



Writing a personal or travelers check or using a credit card is not the same as cash. Many auction houses only accept cash.
Many auction houses add a buyer's premium and local taxes (such as general sales tax), so be prepared to pay more on top of the winning price. Find out in advance.

, This enables you to get a good position and helps you see the auctioneer and the auctioneer see you.

,


Most auctions today require that anyone intending to bid be pre-registered with the auctioneer and assigned a bidding number. This bidding number is usually written on a card that the bidder can hold into the air, signifying to the auctioneer of the intent to bid. The registration is on-site.
If you do not register and receive a bidder number you will not be allowed to bid.
While allowing a bit of privacy for bidders, it enables being recognized as a bidder by the auctioneer.
The auctioneer will announce the number of the winning bidder along with the winning amount.

, Call out, put your hand up, flash your bidding card, etc. Basically, do whatever is effective in calling attention to your bid. If the auctioneer misses you, repeat your action until he or she sees you.


The fall of the hammer constitutes the sale. A bidder can withdraw a bid prior to the fall of the hammer but not after; after, a contract of sale has been formed.
If the hammer falls and you made a bid but the auctioneer did not see you, dispute the sale and ask for the bidding to be reopened. The auctioneer does not have to comply but if others saw you bidding and back you up, you might succeed. This is why it is important to be clear about bidding.

, Auction houses tend to like fast clearance of purchased items, so be sure to have your transport options sorted out in advance.

Sell what you would buy for yourself.,
Choose the auction website you want to use.,
Offer trustworthy options to your potential customers.,
Stay in contact!,
Market your items.,
Play fair.,
Put customers first.,
Don't be a fraud!",How to Make Money With Online Auctions," If you have your own crafts or items to sell, that's great. But if you want to sell consumer goods, you'll want to buy them from elsewhere and re-sell them through an auction. The key is to balance your outgoing and incoming money so you make a profit; buy low and sell high.


Let's assume that you want to sell Nokia mobiles and you have found them for $42 including shipping, on Amazon, now you need the research: search on the internet to see what is the price range for that item, and let's assume that the prices are from $40 to $60. Read carefully the quantity available, and all the details for the product you found (location, dispatch time, description); you will need to reproduce that exactly in your listing and to make sure that you won't remain out of stock when you still have your opened auction for that product.
Let's say that you will sell the product for $55, using PayPal, and you have received the payment from your customer. Now go and buy the phone from Amazon and you will earn a $13 profit (from which you will have to pay your auction fees and your PayPal fees) so this means that you will remain with a profit of around $7-8, depending on the auction website you are using. If you sell at least 3 pieces a day you will have $24 in your pocket, but you can sell more;
, eBay is one of the biggest online marketplaces, but there are other options too, with varying fees and options.

, Each website you choose will have several verification features. Become verified! This will help your customers trust you, and lead to more potential sales.


List more items; if you only have 1-2 items for sale, you will not give your visitors the possibility to choose, and if they are not happy with the selection, they will go to somebody else

, If you have more items for sale you will probably receive a lot of messages with questions from customers. Respond to them all in a timely manner, you should insert in your auction a line like ""all your messages are answered in 12-24 hours""

, Some auction sites receive enough visitors to give you a steady stream of potential customers. However, others are smaller, and you'll want to do the legwork to promote your store. Use everything you can to share your auction links: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit and so on


Choose your words carefully when you list your item and when you post about it. Try not to sound spammy, but offer genuinely reliable items at a fair price, and you'll gain traffic and customers.

, To build a loyal customer base and not end up dealing with poor reviews and returns, you have to be honest and fair. List the condition of all items honestly, and follow up with any customer concerns. Make sure you offer:


Accurate description of the product
Exact shipping details
Dispatch times
Return policy

, Remember to provide your customers with tracking numbers, and to offer a friendly customer support before, during and after sale.

, Why take a few dollars on one scam sale when you can do a good job and grow every day? If you don't send your buyer his product, they will report you, and you can be blacklisted both from the auction sites and the payment transfer companies.

Familiarize yourself with RubyLane.,
Come up with a name for your store.,
Choose which items to sell and make sure they fit into RubyLane's selling policies.,
Once you've decided on your initial items, take photos.,
Write a compelling, relevant description of each item.,
Price your items appropriately.,
Fill out a pre-opening checklist.,
Make an initial payment to RubyLane for maintenance and other assorted fees.,
Open your store and sell your items.",How to Sell Antiques on RubyLane," This will allow you to develop your pages so they look professional and appealing. Check out items similar to yours so that you know how to market your antiques appropriately on the site.;
, RubyLane calls this your nickname. It is how you will be known both on RubyLane and anywhere else you decide to advertise. It's one of the most important parts of selling online. Your name should be easy to remember and be associated with what you are selling.

, They are very particular about what can be sold on their site, and it's curated, so be very careful about what you are selling.

, They should be clear, show all aspects of the item and any relevant markings. If you are selling antique or vintage jewelry, you must have clear pictures of the front and back of the pieces.


Make sure your photos show your items to their best advantage. Also, be sure to show any repairs, flaws or other things that your buyer would want to know before purchasing. There should be no surprises.

, If you know the providence, add that as well. People like to know the history of the antiques they've purchased. It adds to the cache and can raise your selling price considerably. Better descriptions of your items will help them sell faster and be more compelling to customers.

, Do your research. Look at similar or exact items both on RubyLane and on other sites online. See how much others have sold their antiques for and price close to their prices, leaving yourself a little bit of room for negotiation.

, This is paramount. RubyLane will not let you open without this. It should be filled out as soon as you're ready to open your store. A representative from RubyLane will go over the checklist along with your store and either approve your opening, or tell you what must be changed before you can open. Do not be discouraged if you have to make changes, most people do.

, There are fees involved with selling, the same way other sites charge. However, since you're charging more for your items it will all balance out.

, Once your checklist is complete and approved and your store looks professional, you will be able to open your store. Once you do so you can start selling right away. Put ads on social media, tell your friends and family and start making sales.

Remember that buying at auction should save you money.,
Avoid online auctions for hotly contested items, where the price will be driven up by buyer demand.,
Look around the Internet to see what prices you can find.",How to Buy at Online Auctions," If it’s going to cost the same as, or more than going to a store and just buying the item, then why buy it through an auction site?;
, Unless the item is rare or hard to find, you shouldn’t spend more than the average price for it.

, Sometimes buying at online auctions isn’t the best thing after all.

"
"
Look for seller feedbacks.,
Be informed of the jewelry item you’re bidding on.,
Know about the legitimacy of the jewelry itself.,
Know the actual price of the item you are bidding on in the retail market.,
Know about the standard shipping charges.,
consider the mode of payment.",How to Buy Jewelry at an Online Jewelry Auction," Pretty much all jewelry auction sites have buyer and seller feedback system installed to help both buyer and seller rate each other on how transaction went. This is also a good way to find out if the person is a genuine seller. The more comments in the feedback, the better it is for you to confirm the legitimacy of both seller and jewelry item.;
, It is very important to know all about the jewelry item you are bidding on to make sure the item is genuine and not a fake one. Don’t hesitate to ask any anything you don’t know regarding jewelry item you are bidding on to the seller. You should know that many auctioneers have no refund facility for items once purchased on auction. Hence it is important to know everything about the jewelry item before bidding.

, You should make certain the jewelry you see on the screen is the same you will get and genuine. It is important to make sure the jewelry you are bidding on is genuine. Therefore ask the seller for maker’s name, trademark and certification etc.

, Always survey the market first to know the price of the item in retail market. One can easily get caught up in the excitement and overbid during online auction. You should always estimate your budget and keep in mind the value of the item you bid on.

, Find out whether the seller covers the shipping charge or not. Ask the auction house about their shipping policy and whether they can ship it to your location.

, Credit card is a safe and reliable mode of payment as you can easily dispute a transaction not made by you. However most auction prefer PayPal and other online means of transaction as safe mode of payment. Never ever issue checks but instead opt for money order.

"
Don't assume the buyer understands what you want them to understand with a picture.,
Don't be lazy.,
Avoid using subjective language.,
Don't overstate the value or rarity.,
Do not be ambiguous.,
Never stoop to criticising anybody else.,
Avoid auction fatigue by listing lots.",How to Avoid Online Auction Description Mistakes," The adage ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" comes with as many stories of why this saying isn't always accurate. A picture can be doctored, it can be dark and it can be dismal. A buyer cannot make up the description that is lacking simply by viewing your pictures. Even stellar sets of photos with arrows to features cannot ever make up for a good, solid description. To help allay a buyer's fears and assumptions, avoid relying on the pictures alone and definitely avoid using such cop-out terms as:


As is
Item as pictured
Item purchased in condition seen;
, No matter whether you are a one-time seller or a full-time seller, you need to take the time to detail the key points about the item you are selling. If you don't do this, then perhaps the local pawnshop is a better bet for you. A description of key elements will help the buyer assess readily whether or not this sale is worth pursuing and if your item is the one that beats the other similar items hands down. There is no need to make it overly long or flowery but there is a need to make clear, concise statements about the elements of the item that matter. Then use the photos or illustrations to back up your written points.

, Nobody really cares if you think this item is the best thing since sliced bread. Buyers in Wagga don't know sellers in Oregon from a bar of soap, so why should they trust your say-so that ""this item is the best thing anywhere in the world."" Unless you've travelled all over the world examining this item in great detail, you really don't have a leg to stand on making such a broad sweeping statement. If you have done so, state such along with your business or professional qualifications!

, There is a bizarre tendency for enthusiastic amateur sellers to believe that they are holding the only stock of its kind in their collection because they don't take the time to look further afield and some even don't bother to look on the online auction site itself for duplicates! Avoid such lines as ""there's no better deals anywhere else"" or ""this is rare and it's unlikely you'll find another one anywhere"". That is just an invitation to go and find another one and the more a buyer turns up, the lower on the list goes yours. Stick to factual statements, such as it's in excellent condition for its age, it is brand new, it is less than cost price in ""insert your"" region, has no foxing, is still in original box etc. Factual statements those are things buyers do want to know when comparing apples with apples and can often check.

, When you leave things out or you use euphemistic language, you do your sale and your buyer an injustice. One of two things can happen with ambiguous language: the buyer may buy and then be angry or disappointed when they assumed things arising out of the unclear description and leave you poor feedback. Or, the item won't sell because savvy buyers haven't a clue what you're getting at. Again, be clear, concise and straightforward in your description. If the item has bad points, be honest; this will enable buyers to pay a price reflecting the problem whilst accepting it and it may even be a problem that is easily remedied or is outweighed by rarity or uniqueness.

, Whether it be other online sellers, or stores, or a non-paying bidder just do not do it. It is poor taste, it reflects badly on you and it is often untrue because you just do not know the full story behind what other sellers or buyers are doing and this could land you in hot water with them, let alone putting off future buyers. Buyers don't like a bad sport and the more negativity written into a sale, the more a buyer will be hesitant, even if only subconsciously. Friendly, open and welcoming language without being condescending or deriding of others is what makes for the best read on an auction page.

, If part of your despair at writing descriptions is due to trying to list single items that would be better sold as batches (for example, knitting patterns, used stamps, baby's bibs etc.), then don't hesitate to do so and to put your writing efforts into fully describing the lot and explaining the bargain being received by the buyer in getting a lot rather than a single item. This can be a very helpful way for buyers who have accumulated too many items in a burst of enthusiastic collecting.

Know the terminology.,
Place a bid.,
Wait for someone else to bid.,
Keep a constant track.,
Receive a confirmation email.",How to Bid in Online Auctions1," A unique bid is referred to that single bid which is placed on a bid amount for the auction. It will be only categorized as unique if no other competitor has placed a bid on the same bid amount. If a competitor has placed the same bid, then both bids are classified as non-unique. Buyers bid for different products online. The one with the unique bid gets the product.



For example – If A places a bid at $2 and no one else place a bid on the same amount, it is considered as a unique bid and A will win. If B places a bid on the same item at $2, then it will be categorized as non-unique and none of them wins the auction. It is necessary for B to place bid more than $2 in order to win the auction.;
, You place a bid that is the unique bid on your favorite product which will make your existing unique bid the lowest bid. You can also place a bid that is more than your opponents bid amount. It should be the unmatched and highest unique bid until the time auction closes to win the item.

, If someone else places a bid higher than yours, then immediately place a unique bid to supersede theirs. If not done over the time, the other person wins the bidding auction.

, Revisit the auction site regularly to check the status of your bid and also the status of your competitor bids. Evaluate your bid again and click the confirm bid button, once done.

, Once the bidding ends, the winner will be notified by an email from the auction website. It will indicate the confirmation about your winning and also the explanation of what needs to be done next.

"
Understand the technique.,
Enter your maximum bid.,
Keep constant track of bids.,
Receive a confirmation email.",How to Bid in Online Auctions2," This process is also known as an auto bidding system. Buyers can set their maximum bid for the product.  So, if the bidder is not virtually present at the time of bidding, automatically the bidding will perform on his behalf up to the defined amount. This information is only made visible to the bidder. After reaching the defined bid value, the bidding will stop.


For example: The starting bid for an item is $5. A is the high bidder to place a maximum bid of $6 on this item. His maximum bid of $20 which will be kept confidential from other members. B places a bid of $7 and becomes the highest bidder. Automatically A’s bid is raised to $8 outbidding B at $7. It will continue till the time any buyer crosses $20. It is the limit set by $A which is only known to him. If nobody crosses $20, then A is the winner. If anyone crosses $20, A will receive a mail to increase its limit.

, Buyer is supposed to enter maximum bid after selecting their favorite item from the online auction. After placing, it is not necessary for the buyer to be present for bidding. The bid amount will keep on increasing on his behalf, outbidding others till it reaches the defined value.

, Keep visiting the online auction regularly to check the status of your bid and your competitor bids. Evaluate your bid again and click the confirm bid button, once done.

, Once the bidding ends, the winner will be notified by an email from the auction website. It will indicate whether you have won the product and also the explanation of what needs to be done next. You can also recheck by checking your name as a highest bidder on the auction website. ,

Have your account information handy.,
Take identification.,
Have your cash and checks ready.,
Know the bank hours.",How to Fill Out a Deposit Slip1," You definitely want to make sure that the money you are depositing goes into the right account. This is particularly important if you have more than one account at the same bank. If you do not have you account number memorized, take your checkbook with you. Your checks contain your account number.If you are making a deposit into savings, make sure that you have that account number. You can look it up on the online banking site, or view one of your hard copies of a recent statement.
Your checks will come with some deposit slips that are printed with your information (name, etc.) You can use one of these, or your bank will have blank slips available if you don't have your own with you.;
, It is a good idea to take a photo id with you when you go to the bank. You probably will not need it to make a deposit, but just in case there are any problems, you will have it with you. It's always best to be prepared.Make sure that you know which forms of identification your bank branch accepts. You should be able to find this information by calling and asking or viewing information on the bank website.
Typically, you will need a driver's license, passport, state id card, or student id card.

, Make sure that you have all of the currency you would like to deposit. If you have cash, make sure that you have counted it, and then recounted it to make sure that you know the precise amount that you want to deposit.If you are depositing checks, you will need to endorse them. On the back of the check, there will be a designated space for your signature. Under your signature, you can write ""For Deposit Only"". That way if you lose the checks on the way to the bank, no one will be able to cash them.

, Many banks offer several different sets of business hours. The times that their drive through lane is open is often different from the lobby hours. Also, many banks have a 24-hour ATM in their vestibule. Familiarize yourself with all of the hours and days that the bank is open.Decide ahead of time whether you want to drive through, walk in, or use the ATM.
If this is your first time filling out a deposit slip, it is a good idea to use the lobby. There will be more people available to help you if you need it.

Use a pen.,
Write legibly.,
Deposit checks or cash.,
Receive cash back.",How to Fill Out a Deposit Slip2," It is smart to use an ink pen rather than a pencil when filling out a deposit slip. That way, no one will be able to alter the information you have recorded. The teller will also be able to more easily read numbers written in a dark ink.


Don't worry if you make an error. Just rip that one up and start over on a new slip.

, There are some different things you will need to write on the deposit slip. You want to make sure that the bank employees are able to read everything easily.

It is very important that you regularly review all of the deductions made from your account, not just your account balance. If you were charged a fee, you will want to contact your bank as soon as possible to address the issue.;
, Whenever you sign up for a bank account or a credit card, you will be given a terms of service (TOS) to review. This document provides important information about your account and will describe any services that the bank will provide you and any fees or penalties that you may be charged. If you misplaced or can no longer find your terms of service, you can usually access them online on your bank’s website or you can request a copy in person at a local branch. When evaluating whether you have been mistakenly charged a bank fee, you want to review your terms of service for the following:


Are you required to maintain a minimum deposit? Some banks offer “free accounts” so long as you maintain a minimum monthly amount in your accounts. If you fail to maintain that minimum monthly deposit, your bank may charge you a monthly service fee for the account.
Are there any limits on withdrawals? This information should be contained in your TOS. Banks may charge you a penalty if you exceed the number of allotted withdrawals.
Are you charged a fee for writing checks? Some banks only allow its customers to write a certain number of checks before incurring a penalty.
Are you charged a fee when you use your debit card?
Are you charged regular account fees? Some banks charge their customers monthly or yearly fees for maintenance or other account related services. You want to review your TOS to understand under what circumstances you can be charged a fee., Once you identified that a fee was debited from your account, you want to determine what type of fee that you were charged so that you can discuss it with the bank and try to have the fee waived. Generally, a bank customer may see the following types of fees charged to their account:


An annual fee that is charged for you to maintain the account.
A penalty for failing to keep a minimum balance in the account.
A penalty fee for overdrawing your account (attempting to withdraw more money than you have in your account at a particular time).
A late payment fee.
A penalty fee for stopping payment on a check., Some banks provide overdraft protection, which means that if you write a check or pay for something with your account and it costs more than you have in your bank account, the bank will pay the charge by either taking the money from your savings account or from a line of credit. Every time that the bank uses the “protection” you are charged a fee per transaction that overdrew your account. Legally, you must consent to be part of an overdraft program.


Because of banking abuses regarding overdraft protection, Congress passed a law that requires all bank customers to “opt-in” for overdraft protection, which means that the bank can’t sign you up without your knowledge.
Before challenging an overdraft fee, you should determine whether you consented to overdraft protection.
If you can not recall signing up for the program, call your bank and ask them to provide you evidence that you signed up for the program.
Even if you consented to overdraft protection, you can still challenge a fee and seek to have the fee waived., Before you begin negotiating with your bank to remove a fee, it is important that you determine whether you made a mistake. It could be that you didn’t read your new terms of service, or a check that you had written a long time ago came out unexpectedly. If the mistake was yours, you may need to take a different tact than if the bank made the error.


With a bank error, you can demand an immediate correction to the problem and even express outrage and the bank’s incompetence. However, unpleasantness will rarely help you get your way, as most of the people you'll be talking to have no authority to correct the error.
If you made an error that led to a fee, you are requesting that the bank do you a favor based on your banking history, your relationship with the bank, or any other argument that can help you demonstrate that this was a simple mistake.

, Once you notice a fee on your account, you want to address it as soon as possible. You should review your TOS, determine the type of fee, and pull together any notes or information that you have regarding your account so that you are prepared to talk to a bank representative. You should pull the information together quickly and even if you don’t have all of the information, you should still contact your bank. Generally, it is easier to have a fee removed if you address it as soon as possible., The best first step to take in negotiating with your bank is to speak with an actual person. Generally, this will get you the quickest response and requires the least amount of effort on your part. You want to speak with a customer service representative. You can usually find the phone number for your bank on the back of your ATM or debit card or on the bank’s website., While you may feel frustrated or even angry about the charge on your account, you should not take this frustration out on the customer service representative. By being polite, the person on the phone assisting you may be more inclined to help waive the fee. Politely explain why you are calling and state that you are seeking their assistance in addressing a fee charged on your account. Even if initially the employee states that they cannot help you, you should politely persist and ask them to review the fee.If the bank made an error, they are generally going to be more inclined to quickly resolve the mistake.
If a fee was charged because of an error that you made, you may need to convince the customer service representative to help you.
For example, you can say “I understand that fees are charged for a reason but I am requesting that the bank do me a courtesy and waive this fee. I am a loyal banking customer and I would like to be able to continue our banking relationship. I would appreciate your assistance in waiving this fee.”

, You want to be polite but clear in requesting that the bank waive the fee. As mentioned above, a bank employee may at first state that he or she is unable to help you by removing your fees. In such cases, the customer should respectfully ask to speak to a supervisor with the authority to take the requested action. While you should still proceed in a polite manner, you should also set forth the reasons that the bank should remove your fees. Banks do not want to lose a valuable customer over a fee dispute, particularly if the fee is not significant. When explaining why you think the bank should remove the fee, consider the following arguments:


If this is the first time that you overdrew your account, you should state “This is the first time that I have overdrawn my account and I would hope that the bank would make an allowance for a one time mistake.” A bank may be willing to help a customer if this is the first time that they were penalized.
When asking that a fee be removed, you can admit that you made a mistake. For example, if you forgot to record a check that you had written and then did not have sufficient funds to cover the check, you could explain “This has never happened to me before but I somehow forgot to record the check and I was not expecting the money to come out of my account or I would not have written any additional checks.”
By showing that your conduct was accidental, the bank may be more inclined to help you.

, If the bank employee appears unmoved by your specific arguments about why the fee should be removed, you should make a broader argument about your loyalty to the bank. If you are a longstanding customer, you can argue that the bank should remove the fee as a courtesy to you. Banks do not want to lose their longstanding customers over a fee dispute. You can use this to your advantage.


You can say to the bank employee, “I have been a loyal customer for a number of years and I would hope that the bank would want to assist a customer who has never really had any issues before this moment.”
If the employee fails to help you, you can always state that you think it may be time to transfer to another bank if this is how your current bank wants to treat you.
While these arguments may not work, many banks will waive a fee to keep a good customer., If the customer service representative refuses to waive the fee, you should politely ask to speak with a supervisor with the authority to help you. It may be that the representative doesn’t have the authority to waive the fee or he or she feels that they have waived too many fees recently. Once it is clear that the person is not going to assist you, it is time to ask for a supervisor and go through your arguments again.

, If speaking to a customer service representative and his or her supervisor doesn’t help, you should consider visiting your local branch and meeting with a bank employee face-to-face. It is more difficult to turn someone’s request down when they are sitting in front of you. You should explain what happened and ask that the fee be removed. If the fee was for failing to keep a minimum balance or other penalty, you can discuss other banking options that may help eliminate potential fees in the future., If you feel that you bank has been unfair or misleading, discriminated against you during the lending process, or violated a federal consumer protection law, you can file a complaint against the bank. If you are concerned that you may have been charged an excessive and illegal overdraft charge or other illegal fee, it is important to raise that concern with your bank and if they fail to act, take steps to report the bank’s conduct.


You can view a state-by-state legal guide to credit and debit surcharges at: http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/credit-or-debit-card-surcharges-statutes.aspx.
Federal law prohibits banks from charging customers overdraft fees unless a customer has agreed to the overdraft service. If you did not agree to this service, you should report your bank., Depending on how your bank was chartered, you can file a complaint at one of several government agencies. The first step is to determine at which agency you should file your complaint. You can do this by using the Federal Reserve System's financial institution search tool located at: http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/SearchForm.aspx.


If you want to file a complaint against a national bank, banks that have the letters “N.A” after their name, or federal savings and loans, or federal banks, you should file your complaint with Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) handles complaints against state-chartered banks.
The National Credit Union Administration handles complaints about federally charted credit unions.
If you are unsure where to file your complaint, check with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFBP). The CFBP investigates complaints about a wide array of financial services including student loans, mortgages, credit cards, banking, and debt collection. You can file a complaint with the CFBP at: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/., Each agency has its own website where you can submit complaints. It is important that you provide all of the information requested by that agency. Generally, your complaint should include the following:


Your complete name and mailing address, which should match your bank’s records.
The best telephone number at which to reach you and your email address.
If applicable, the name of your attorney or other designated representative with whom you want the agency to discuss your complaint.
The name and address of your financial institution.
The type of account that you hold at the financial institution.
The name of any person(s) at the bank with whom you have been in contact.
State whether the bank has responded to your complaint.
A clear and detailed explanation of your complaint., Generally, once you have submitted your complaint, the agency will contact the bank in question and attempt to get a response to your allegations and additional information. The bank usually has a certain amount of time to respond. For example, CFBP gives banks 15 days to respond and expects a bank to close almost all complaints within 60 days. While filing a complaint cannot guarantee that certain charges will be credited back to your account, involving a government agency dedicated to protecting consumer’s rights should increase your chances of getting the matter resolved.


Generally, once the bank responds to the complaint, the government agency will allow you to view the response.If you still feel that you have suffered damages as a result of the bank’s illegal activity, you could consider hiring an attorney to file a lawsuit against the bank. Typically, however, the damages in question do not warrant an individual lawsuit.
If the bank’s illegal behavior impacted a number of customers, some attorneys file lawsuits on behalf of the entire group (called a class action).
You can conduct an internet search to see whether there are any pending class action lawsuits against your bank for the same reasons that you filed your complaint. If so, you can contact the attorney on the case and discuss joining the lawsuit.

With cars, you will generally find that scammers try to get you to send them money in advance, for whatever reason.,
But there never was a car!,
While it's not an outright scam, what you might find is that the car does turn up, but simply doesn't live up to the description - it has been oversold, in the tradition of used car dealers through the ages.",How to Spot eBay Automobile and Computer Scams1," For some reason, some people aren't all that reluctant to pay 50% or 25% of the money before delivery using a relatively insecure payment method, especially on a car. They reason that the seller will obviously deliver it, as they'll want the other half of the money.;
, Pictures of cars aren't hard to find, and the experienced scammers will have a whole library of pictures of different cars. The seller just got your $5,000 for nothing, and you can leave them all the negative feedback you like. They'll just go and open another eBay account and find their next sucker.

, If this happens to you then you should open an eBay dispute and say your item was not as described - you might get a partial refund.

If you bid in a computer auction but don't win, the seller might email you to ask whether you would like to buy a computer the same as the one they just sold through their own website.

,
This is a bad idea!,
There are sellers with nothing but positive feedback who use this scam often - and since you won't be able to leave them any feedback on the transaction, their reputation will stay that way.",How to Spot eBay Automobile and Computer Scams2,", You have no guarantee that the item will ever arrive, and you haven't just given them your money - you've given them your credit card details too.

, If you complain to eBay that you bought an item outside the site and got scammed, they will tell you to get lost and not do it again.

"
"
There are lots of ways to beat the scams.",How to Spot eBay Automobile and Computer Scams3," First, whenever you buy anything expensive, be sure to check your seller's reputation thoroughly. Make sure they have sold items of a similarly high value before, and haven't just sold a string of $10 items to get their feedback rating artificially high. If you want to be even more cautious, insist that the money is placed in an escrow service (eBay recommend escrow.com - don't use any other service unless you're sure of it).

Lean towards fee-free accounts.,
Don’t settle for a financial institution without mobile banking.,
Consider the availability of physical locations.,
Decide based on interest rates.,
Ask about specific security features.,
Take customer service seriously.,
Consider maintaining accounts at multiple financial institutions.,
Consider banking with a credit union.",How to Switch to a Better Bank1," Many financial institutions do not charge fees to open an account. However, many accounts do penalize you with automatic fees if your account balance drops below a certain minimum level. Further, many accounts also have overdraft fees.Ask to see a written description of any fees associated with the accounts a financial institution offers. Often, you will be shown a printed table that includes all of the potential fees and penalties you may incur.
In terms of checking accounts, credit unions almost always offer accounts with less frequent or smaller fees compared to banks.;
, Admittedly, this one of the few factors that many larger banks handle better than smaller ones. That said, the convenience of online banking, including the availability of easy-to-use apps for your phone, is important.At a minimum, make sure you’re able to check your balances and make deposits and payments online. A financial institution that doesn’t offer these services yet is clearly behind the times.

, For many financial institutions (though not all), there will be certain things you need to do in person. Proximity to a branch location is therefore another factor worth considering, especially if you prefer to do your banking in person.The availability of ATMs is also important if you like to be able to withdraw cash easily. While bigger banks often have many ATMs, most credit unions belong to the CO-OP system that allows their users to use other credit union's ATMs without paying a fee.

, Rates may or may not be an important factor, depending on how much money you keep in deposit accounts. If you do tend to keep money in savings and checking accounts, you can make money on those deposits from high annual percentage yields.Online-only institutions are often able to offer higher interest rates, and thus better returns on your deposits, compared to banks with lots of branch locations.

, You should only bank with a financial institution you can trust. In fact, financial institutions are increasingly offering the ability to customize your own security settings. For instance, you can set up text alerts through many mobile banking platforms to notify you about account activity. Be sure to ask a bank employee about the specific security features their accounts offer.Another specific security feature you may want is the ability to lock and unlock your debit card as you wish. Further, ensure that debit cards issued by the financial institution you're considering include a chip.

, As important as online banking is, don’t underestimate the importance of being able to talk to someone when you need to. In this capacity, big banks are notoriously inaccessible. It can be especially helpful (and comforting) to speak with a human being via phone or live online chat about anything you have a question about., If you are searching for a specific financial service that is not offered by your current institution but are otherwise happy with the account you have, you may want to simply open an additional account elsewhere. This will allow you to select a new account based primarily on the service you’re looking for.For instance, keep your current checking account, but consider opening up a new account at an institution that offers the best rates on auto loans.
Visit the Consumer Reports website and search financial institutions according to the service you’re shopping for. For auto loans in particular, credit unions are often the best bet.
Credit cards and mortgages are other services that you may be able to find a better provider for. The best options for credit cards and mortgages are often financial institutions that are exclusively online. Credit unions can also be great for mortgages.

, For many people, credit unions offer several distinct advantages overs banks. Perhaps most important, rates and fees are almost lower at credit unions, and customer service is almost always better. That said, banks often do have better online banking interfaces, and their size may make accessing your money during international travel easier.The main difference between these two types of institutions is that banks exist primarily to generate profit that goes to the bank’s owners and business executives. More to the point, they exist to make money off of you.
Credit unions are legally tied to a certain region, employer, faith, or other community association. The money that credit unions make becomes small dividends that are paid to all account holders, discounted loan rates, fee reductions, and other benefits for the credit union’s members.
Go to www.mycreditunion.gov to learn more about credit unions, and to find a credit union you may be eligible to join."

Open new accounts with a small deposit.,
Compile a list of the ongoing transactions associated with your old account.,
Notify those who make regular deposits to your account.,
Transfer money from your old account.,
Re-route automatic bill payments through your new account.",How to Switch to a Better Bank2," For most financial institutions, you’ll need to visit a branch location to open a new account. Online-only banking, of course, can be done entirely online. Either way, read through the fine print before signing anything, and pay particular attention to any fees associated with your account.There will often be a minimum initial deposit to open an account with a new institution. There’s no rush to deposit any more than that, as long as the account you're opening doesn’t have fees for accounts below a certain balance.

, Include the following: any direct deposits from your employer or another source of income, as well as any regular payments you make from the account. Further, include any checks you’ve written that have not been cashed yet.Check your account history online, as well as you checkbook, to make sure you’re not forgetting anything. For instance, you may never think about the monthly gym membership that’s automatically withdrawn from your account.
Use this list as a checklist to help you transfer each type of transaction to a new account.

, Once your new account is open, contact your employer or other income providers with the updated information about your new account. If you receive other regular payments - from rental properties, for instance - ensure that your new account information has been made available.More specifically, provide the routing number for your new bank, as well as your own account number to your manager or human resources department.

, Whether to open your account, or a short time after, you may wish to transfer funds from your old institution to your new one. There are many ways to do this, including a direct transfer.In order to do a transfer, you’ll need both institutions’ routing numbers, as well as both of your personal account numbers. The bank you’re leaving may charge a transfer fee. Luckily, electronic transfer is not your only option.
You may also write a check to yourself from your old account, and deposit it into your new one. Set up mobile banking for your new account to make this especially easy, as many banking apps include the option to photograph a check and deposit it electronically.

, Stop paying bills from an account you intend to close as soon as possible. If you have scheduled payments that are made on a certain day each month, they can easily be canceled through your financial institution in person or online.If you have authorized any business to make automatic ""pull"" payments from your account each month, you may have to contact those businesses directly. In the future, it is better not to provide authorization for third parties to make withdrawals from your account.
Wait to start paying bills out of your new account until your direct deposit payments start to come through.

Leave a balance in your old account for a while.,
Contact the institution directly to close an old account.,
Check for and close any zombie accounts.",How to Switch to a Better Bank3," For a at least a month after you stop using an old account, keep enough money in the account to cover any payments you may have forgotten about. If there is a minimum balance fee associated with your old account, keep the balance above the minimum.Before actually closing your an account, make sure direct deposits have been re-directed, automatic bill payments are being successfully deducted from your new account, any checks written against the old account have cleared, and you have new your new debit card and/or checks.

, Many financial institutions require a written letter to close an account. Provide the numbers for the accounts you wish to close, as well as an address where you would like the check with the remaining balance sent.Include the date, your phone number, your written name, and your mailing address as well.
A short, simple letter will suffice. For example, “Hello. Please close the accounts with numbers XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX. Further, please mail a check with the remaining balance to .”
Keep a copy of all of your financial records, but especially the correspondence about closing your account.

, If you forget about a source of income and an automatic payment is made to an old account, some banks will automatically reopen an account. Believe it or not, you may then be required to pay monthly maintenance fees and minimum balance fees on that account.Periodically check for zombie accounts by keeping the phone app for your old account’s online banking platform. Log in about a month after you close the account, and then again a few months after that.
Contact your old financial institution directly if a zombie account has been opened. You’ll likely be able to close the account without penalty. If your old bank pressures you to pay fees incurred because a zombie account was reopened, consider filing a report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Count the number of checks you bounce.,
Add up the fees you are assessed.,
Assess your comfort with online banking.",How to Know if You Need an Overdraft Protection Plan1," Anyone might occasionally bounce a check. However, if you do it several times in a year, then you would benefit from an overdraft protection plan.There might be many reasons you bounce checks. For example, your pay schedule might be set up so you don’t get paid when the bulk of your bills are due.
Alternately, you might always be short on money because you are living beyond your means.;
, When you overdraw your checking account, you might be assessed many different fees. You should add them up and ask whether you can continue to pay these fees each year. These fees make you go deeper into debt:Overdraft fee. This fee is charged each time you withdraw more money than you have in your checking account. For example, you have $100 in your checking and you write a check for $150. If the bank clears the check, it will charge an overdraft fee.
Non-sufficient funds fee. This fee is like an overdraft fee. However, the bank refuses to clear the check.
Returned check fee. The merchant you wrote the check to might charge a fee also for any bounced checks.

, The easiest way to find out your balance is to use online banking. You can log into your account at any time and find out the current balance. If you are comfortable checking your account regularly, then you might not need an overdraft protection plan.


However, if you don’t have a home computer or don’t like putting your financial information online, then you might want an overdraft protection plan.

Identify the different types of backup accounts.,
Check the fees.,
Analyze whether you can fund a second account.",How to Know if You Need an Overdraft Protection Plan2," With an overdraft protection plan, the bank will dip into a backup account when your checking account can’t cover the check. The second account might be any of the following:savings account
credit card
home equity line of credit

, Typically, you will still be charged a fee for transferring money out of your backup account into your checking account. For example, you might be charged a $12.50 fee for a transfer.This fee is typically lower than a non-sufficient funds fee or an overdraft charge, but it is rarely free.


If your backup account is a line of credit, you will also be charged interest rate for the loan until you pay it back.Find out how much you are charged each day.

, If you’re bouncing checks because you don’t have enough money, then an overdraft protection plan is a temporary measure. You can’t deplete your backup account and continue to overspend.


If you do, then there won’t be any money to cover your check. The bank can refuse to clear the check and charge you a non-sufficient funds fee. Alternately, the bank could clear the check but charge you an overdraft fee.
You might use a credit card or credit line as your backup account. However, you'll need to pay the money back. If you don't, then interest will compound and you'll find yourself deep in debt.

Sign up for email alerts.,
Don’t select overdraft protection for your debit card.,
Create a budget.,
Carry extra cash for emergencies.",How to Know if You Need an Overdraft Protection Plan3," Many banks will email you or send you a text message once the amount of money in your checking account falls below a certain level.This is a good option to choose because alerts are typically free.


Once you receive notification, you can adjust your spending levels until you get more money in your checking account.

, According to U.S. law, you must opt-in for overdraft protection for your debit card. However, banks can still automatically charge you a non-sufficient funds fee for checks.If you avoid opting-in, then your debit card might be declined when you try to use it. This might be embarrassing. However, you’ll avoid any overdraft fee, which will save you money.

, You need to identify why you are overdrawing money from your checking account. If it is because you are living beyond your means, then you need to create a budget and stick with it.


Identify fixed expenses. These are expenses that don’t change month to month, such as your home (rent or mortgage), health insurance, and some utilities.Calculate your variable spending, which differs month to month. Variable spending includes entertainment, meals out, vacations, and other luxuries. You should reduce this amount as much as possible when creating a budget.
Increase your income if necessary. Find a part-time job to supplement the income from your day job.

, Cash is the least expensive method of paying for an emergency.If your car breaks down and you need a cab home, or if you need to stay in a motel during an emergency, you can pull out your saved cash and pay.


Remember to carry the cash with you. Put it in a money clip and store it at the bottom of your purse or in your wallet.
Avoid spending the cash on non-emergencies. If you spend it, then you won’t have the money when you need it.

Decide what to buy and sell.,
Get your products from wholesalers or drop shippers: This is a crucial part, because here is where your money has to be invested.,
Sell the articles on eBay: Be professional when doing so.,
Check your feedback: Always try to keep a good feedback, nothing is more important on eBay, so you should better give somebody a full refund if he returns your product, because one bad rating can ruin your business.",How to Start an eBay Home Business,"


Find out what interests you: The most important step is to find out what you're interested in, because selling what you know will greatly facilitate the task of answering questions of potential buyers about your product. Just imagine you sold cellphones without knowing anything about them and someone asks you whether your cellphone has a 3 mega pixel or a 2 mega pixel camera, and you don't know what a mega pixel is, nor if your product has a camera! The potential buyer would most probably take you for a scam and never consider buying from you!
Find out what sells well: Selling Polaroid films now when nobody has the corresponding cameras anymore would probably not make you millions, instead of that, selling laptops, cellphones or cameras is a profitable business at this moment. But keep in mind that it can sometimes be more profitable to sell to a smaller market because generally there is not as much competition on these as for very big markets. For instance, if you sold iPhone's, you would have to get them at a very good price to stay competitive because everybody sells them nowadays. So maybe you should choose stuff that's not as hyped in the moment.
Consider the price range: Selling high-priced items generally allows you to get better profits because you add more value to your product as you would if you sold something that only costs a few bucks. Selling blank notebooks for 7$ when buying them at 5$ gives you 2$ profit each time, selling cellphone for 500$ which you bought at 400$ gives you 100$ profit each time, but keep in mind that in order to sell higher priced items, you need more capital to invest at the start, and you should know your turf because people are less likely to give 500$ to a nobody than giving 7$!;
, Look on the web for drop shippers or wholesalers, people which sell you larger quantities of products at good prices, in order to buy something and resell it on eBay. Drop shippers are companies that you don't have to buy the products from, you just sent them a single order when somebody buys a product from you, and they sent it directly to your customer, without you ever seeing the product. This can greatly facilitate your work because there's less for you to worry about, as there is no shipping, etc, but sometimes this has turned out badly for some people, when the drop shipping company sent out the wrong product or something. Be informed exactly what it will cost you to get those products! (Ask about shipping or customs fees!)

, Add many photos of the product, preferably ones that you took yourself with much detail. Write in the article description exactly what the product is and in what condition it is. If you sell stuff you already have at home, that's fine, but inform anybody who's looking to buy it if there are scratches or malfunctions, etc. Honesty is most important! And answer in time if you get a question from a buyer, because they're likely to look for someone else's offer if you're not fast enough.

, Most people don't even consider buying from you if you have less than 98% good ratings! The customer is king! So do what it takes to keep him happy.

Decide if you want to sell new, used, vintage or antique merchandise on eBay.,
Consider shipping issues and costs when choosing what you want to sell.",How to Start a Business on eBay4,"


If you want to sell new merchandise you may need a steady wholesale supplier or drop shipper as your business grows. Initially you may be able to obtain enough new merchandise locally by shopping on clearance and hunting down good buys; but as your business grows your merchandise needs will increase.
Choosing the used, vintage and antique merchandise market means scouting out area flea markets, secondhand or consignment shops, auction houses, and estate and garage sales to keep a steady supply of unique marketable merchandise on hand.

,


Your customers want to have their purchase in their hands at a reasonable price. Because they have to pay shipping fees, they consider their bid price and their shipping costs when deciding how much they are willing to pay for your product. Heavy items cost more to ship; consequently, they may sell for considerably less than lightweight items that are cheaper to ship.
Damage caused during shipping is the responsibility of the seller. Not only is damage greater with breakable items, but the amount of time you spend packaging them and the money you spend on packaging supplies and shipping insurance increases.

Setting up a professional website with ways to contact you, photos of artwork, a shopping cart and information about yourself will characterize you as an authentic seller.


The best Internet-based art marketing is done with cross-promotion. You should link your eBay account to your website and also consider creating marketing emails or a Facebook account to advertise your auctions to your customers. Ebay is simply 1 part of the art selling puzzle.;
, You should write about yourself in the ""My World"" and ""About Me"" sections. Your ability to distinguish yourself as a reputable buyer will pay off in increased sales.

, PayPal allows a delayed payment function, which means that you are paid when the customer is satisfied. Consider creating a premier or business account on PayPal.

, In order to gain a rating as a reputable art seller, you should aim to have a painting's documentation that you will transfer to the buyer. You can advertise this in the item description when you sell online.

, If this is rare art, you should have the work appraised. If it is art that is available elsewhere, you should find what other sellers are charging in galleries and online.


Visit eBay's Art Seller Central to research how paintings are selling on eBay. This will help you look at past and current auctions.

, Art lovers are visual people, so ensure that you have good quality photography for each of your paintings. Hire a professional photographer to photograph all the paintings, if you do not have the ability to do it well yourself.


Use the proper lighting. Indirect natural light is likely to give the best representations of color. Try to use a shaded spot outside.
Use a contrasting background. Black or white walls or sheets can help to create a gallery effect and bring attention to the item.
Photograph your paintings without extra clutter in the room. Other items or people will serve as a distraction and make the painting less likely to sell.
Take a photo from all angles, in order to give a good representation of the painting. Also, include a gallery photo with the painting hanging on a wall. Art buyers are used to seeing paintings in this setting, and it gives some perspective.
Consider upgrading to the Gallery Plus option to show your painting. Ebay will charge you some extra money to do this, but it is less than $1 per listing.

, Use a blog, Facebook and your own website to advertise regular painting sales. Some people have found success with a ""painting a day,"" which encourages people to check their blog or social media accounts regularly.

, Most Internet marketing is driven by using keywords that users type into a search engine to look for items. In the case of eBay items, you have 55 words that should include ""painting,"" ""art,"" and the artist, medium, country, style and any other items that will help to specify your art in a search.


You can research keywords to use by going onto the eBay art shop, art.shop.ebay.com. Look for ""Popular Searches"" to see what terms people are using to look for art.

, If someone doesn't want to buy the item they have found, they may like another painting that is in your banner and go directly to your account.

, Regular art buyers will recognize and respect these terms.

, Ebay tells people to put a low starting price for their items and to avoid using a reserve price, or minimum bid. They suggest that following these guidelines will help to increase the number of bids you get on your items.


You may want to experiment with these rules occasionally, in order to see what will work best for the type of paintings you are selling.

, Wrap the items in bubble wrap, box them and seal them very well with high-quality packaging tape. Make sure that you detail how the item will be shipped and how much it costs on your eBay seller account.


Use crates, if the items is big. If your item is above 150 lbs., you may choose to ship it with freight.
Take out shipping insurance on paintings. If your package is worth a lot of money, make sure you invest in insurance in case of damage.

, Notify your buyer if there is a delay, send them the tracking confirmation and thank them for their purchase. Ebay is a wonderful environment for repeat customers and seller reviews determine how reputable you look.


Write feedback to your customers. Feedback is important if you intend to sell a lot of art, because it will distinguish you from fraudulent art sellers. If there is a problem with an order, the way that you fix the problem may be more telling to potential customers than a perfect selling record.

, Paying a fee of approximately $16 per month will allow you to have an attractive eBay store front, and it will give you access to an email list. This will increase the number of people who hear about your auctions.

Decide what you’re willing to give up.,
Sort the good from the bad.,
Check for damaged clothing and accessories.,
Wash or dry clean all the clothes.",How to Sell Used Clothing on eBay1," You’ll need to choose items that are in good enough shape to sell, and ones you won’t mind letting go of. It can be easy to get stuck at the stage of choosing which clothes you can do without. A good approach is to separate the clothes you wear frequently from the clothes you aren’t wearing and continually pass up when choosing an outfit.The odds are good that you won’t regret selling anything that has been gathering dust in your closet, and that you won’t wear these neglected items again.;
, It might not be worthwhile to try selling items that have a low resale value. To get an idea of what an item of clothing could be worth, do a search from the eBay homepage. Your search terms should include at least the brand name, size, and style of clothing.


Clothing brands that tend to sell well and at a good price include J. Crew, Victoria’s Secret, Bebe, Columbia, Tahari, Banana Republic, Under Armour, Miss Me Jeans, Theory, Lululemon,River Island, Zara, Topshop, Miss Selfridge,Claiborne, Patagonia, Tory Burch, Michael Stars, Hudson Jeans, and Rachel Roy.

, Some of your choices might also be too damaged to be attractive to buyers. For the more valuable items, a small hole or tear that could easily be repaired is ok. But long rips, big holes, stains, or major discoloration tend to make the item difficult to sell. Shoes should have all eyelets intact, no stains or tears to the material, and a sole that is not visibly worn down.

, Put each item you plan to sell through the wash or have them dry cleaned. In addition to being eBay’s policy,washing gets your clothes in the most presentable shape for being photographed. Some cotton items may be ironed as well--wrinkly clothing can put off potential buyers.


You’ll need to dry clean certain delicate fabrics, such as silk and suede. Check the item’s tag for specific cleaning instructions, and look out for the “dry clean only” phrase."

Set up a photo shooting area.,
Display clothes on hangers or lying flat.,
Take clear, high-quality pictures.,
Use a tripod.,
Fill up the frame.,
Capture the defining details.",How to Sell Used Clothing on eBay2," Choose a space indoors that gets indirect natural light, where you can hang up your clothes or lay them out on a table. A white door or wall, or a white sheet as a background will help the item stand out better (unless it is solid white itself, in which case use any background but shades of white).


If natural light won’t be enough to illuminate the item, set up lamps with lampshades around the area to provide extra sources of diffused light.Avoid direct sunlight or using the camera's flash, which can distort the garment’s colors., Avoid using plastic or wire hangers--a nice wooden or fabric-covered hanger will be much more attractive. Affix the hanger to a hook already in the wall or on a door, or to an adhesive hook.Lay pants flat on a low surface, making sure to smooth out any creases as much as possible.


If someone is available to help you, try modeling the clothes yourself. This will attract more attention, and give potential buyers a better sense of the item’s shape.A mannequin can also do this job quite nicely.

, Most modern digital cameras and cell phone cameras will produce images that are detailed enough to post on eBay. Take bright (but not overexposed), well-focused shots. The images should give an accurate representation of the colors, textures, and dimensions of the item


In your camera's settings, select the highest level of photo quality. The minimum photo length allowed is 500 pixels for the longer side.
Taking photos with a minimum length of 800 pixels will allow users to zoom in on the image of your item., If you're having trouble with blurry photos, either add extra light sources (without using the flash), or use a tripod to steady the camera. Most digital cameras have a timer function that allows to you set a countdown to when the photo will be taken automatically. This allows fully hands-free picture taking (if you use a tripod), which is another way to prevent the camera from shaking and taking blurry pictures., The item you're photographing should take up about 80% to 90% of the picture's frame to show adequate detail.If you're taking close-ups, the whole frame should be filled with the subject, but be sure everything is still in focus, is bright enough, and that it's clear what element is being shot.


Some digital cameras have a macro setting that improves the clarity of close-ups. Use this setting if you're shooting closer than one foot (30 centimeters) from the subject.

, It’s recommended that you shoot at least the front, back, and brand tags (external and internal) of the item, in addition to any flaws such as holes, tears, or discoloration.Even better is to photograph components such as pockets and fringes, and standout elements like embroidery or unusual stitching.Imagine how you might inspect the item in a store. What elements would you check the most? Take photos of anything that might be of interest."

, To begin, click on the “Sell” link on the top left-hand side of the eBay homepage. After choosing “Create a listing,” you’ll be asked to type in a description of the item. Follow the example provided, listing at least of few characteristics of the item, including gender, size, color, and style. A category will then be suggested for you, and if it seems accurate, click on “Create Listing.”For example, a search for “women’s gray LL Bean capri pants size 10"" will recommend the category of ""Pants.""

, Include basic elements such as brand name, style, color, and material. The more descriptive your title, the more often the item will show up in shoppers' search results.


For example, an appropriate title for a pair of jeans is something like, ""Ralph Lauren Polo Jeans Black Classic Boot Cut Size 8.""

, Be as descriptive as possible, including the brand name, material, size, color, and any pattern or embellishments. Use adjectives such as “dark” and “light” for colors, since the photo won’t appear the same on all screens. For women’s dresses give waist size and dress length, and for men’s shirts give armpit-to-armpit length, plus sleeve length.For example, a good description of a vintage blouse would be, ""Vintage 70's Pat Argenti sheer ruffle front blouse. Small black buttons in back, faux button front. No size tag so please check measurements for fitting. Measures unstretched approximately: 40"" (102cm) bust, 40"" waist, 23"" (58cm) shoulder to hemline. Dark green velvet ribbon detailing. Please note ribbon coming apart near the neck, also separating near the underarm & bust seams.""
Give all measurements in both inches and centimeters for the convenience of international shoppers.
Other helpful measurements include bust/chest, waist, hips, inseam, pant length, and bell width (for skirts or dresses).

, You have the option of selling the item at a price that you set, or putting it up for bid along with the option of a fixed-price sale (“Buy it Now”). If you’re concerned about your auction item selling at a really low price, you can set a reserve price under which it can’t be sold. Otherwise, for less valuable items, setting a low starting bid at $1 or lower can attract a high volume of bargain hunters.The greater the number of bidders, the better the chance for bidding competition that elevates selling prices.

, On the ""Create Your Listing"" page, in the section titled ""Bring your item to life with pictures, click on ""Add Pictures."" You can add one photo for free, but additional shots will cost a little extra. It's worth paying this extra price, especially for the more valuable items, to add several pictures for the the customers' convenience.

, You can make three shipping price options available to potential customers: free shipping, flat fee shipping, and calculated cost shipping. Offer at least one other method besides free shipping in case the customer needs expedited shipping.


For flat fee shipping, you set the shipping price when listing the item, based its packed weight. Use eBay’s shipping cost calculator to help estimate a cost for your item.With calculated cost shipping, the shipping cost will be calculated for your customers at check out, based on your zip code, the customer’s zip code, and the weight of the packed item., You’ll be given the option to choose mail carriers and shipping speeds to offer to potential buyers. Make as many shipping methods available as you’re willing to accommodate, but try at least to offer several expedited shipping options, since some customers might decide not to buy your item if they can’t get it promptly.


Strongly consider offering free shipping: it’s an incentive to buyers, you’ll get an automatic 5-star seller rating for shipping, and you’ll show up higher on the list of shoppers’ searches for your items."
"
Have plenty of envelopes and boxes at hand.,
Pack the item carefully.,
Print a shipping label.,
Follow up with your buyer.",How to Sell Used Clothing on eBay4," Once payment has been confirmed, you should have your package ready for shipment. For general shipping, a bubble envelope or small- to medium-size cardboard box should be large enough and provide enough protection for most clothing items.


Use a USPS First Class envelope for lighter clothing and accessories such as scarves and ties, if the item and envelope together weigh less than 13 ounces.
For packed items weighing more than 13 ounces, use a USPS Flat Rate Priority envelope or box, if you’ve offered these shipping options to your buyers., Since you took care to wash and iron your clothing for sale, try to pack the item in a way that will allow it to arrive with as few wrinkles and creases as possible. Fold shirts and pants neatly, and wrap them in thick paper or a sturdy plastic bag to provide extra protection and stabilization in the package.


Use commercial-grade packing tape to seal boxes and envelopes, and to affix your mailing labels to them.

, Use the eBay Print Label tool to easily print out postage-paid shipping labels. From the “Sold” page (the one that lists your sold items), check the box to the left of the item you want to print a label for, then from the “More actions” drop-down menu, select “Print Shipping Label.” The next page will give you a summary of the order, including shipping address, method, package weight, and shipping price.

If the buyer has any questions before or after the purchase, or after receiving the item, be sure to respond in good time to their inquiries. Be courteous and understanding in dealing with their questions.Your helpfulness in answering customers’ questions should count towards a good seller review, as well as building customer loyalty.

Ship the package.",How to Sell Perfume on eBay," Make sure that you have everything you plan to sell in the listing before you create it. This includes the perfume bottle, inner spray cap, and outer cap. If you have the original box, grab that, too.


You might be able to sell the perfume even if you're missing a few non-essential pieces, like the outer cap or box. Be aware of the fact that missing pieces will lower the market value of the perfume, though.;
, Most perfume can be sold on eBay, but the website does have a few restrictions worth noting.Used perfume must not have an applicator that comes into contact with the body.
Perfumes must comply with FDA regulations, regardless of whether they are commercially produced or homemade.
If the perfume has been opened but is still unused, you must still mention that the container has been opened.

, The precise price range you set for your perfume will vary depending on the age of the perfume, its current condition, and the current market value of the perfume.


If the perfume is still sold in stores, your listing will need to be well below retail value. Perfumes that are rare or discontinued may sell for a higher price point than they did when they were actively on the market, though.
One of the easiest ways to determine the best price point is to search for your perfume by brand and fragrance name on eBay. Check through the current listings for that fragrance, noting the price of those in similar conditions to the perfume you're selling. The price you set should be close to the price marked for these similar listings, but you can sell yours at a higher price if it is in better condition than all of the others presently listed.If you are selling a rare perfume or discontinued fragrance, you may need to consult a perfume collector's guidebook to determine its current value. Use the indicated value as a guide when setting your own price point.

, You must include a photograph of the perfume you're selling in its present condition.


If the perfume is new and sealed in its box, you can take a photograph of the sealed box. Make sure that the name of the perfume and bottle size are legible in the picture. You should also show the unopened seal.
If the box has been opened but you still have it, take a picture of the bottle with the box beside it.
If you can see through the bottle, make sure that the remaining amount of perfume can be seen clearly. For bottles that are not transparent, you need to specify how frequently the perfume had been used and how much is left.Use a plain white background when snapping photographs of colored bottles so that the true color of the glass and the perfume itself can be clearly seen. If you have a clear glass bottle, use a plain black background.
You can also include a photograph of the perfume from the manufacturer's website, but only as a secondary picture. Always include a picture of the actual product being sold.

, If you haven't done so already, you will need to create an eBay account.


Go to the registration page: https://reg.ebay.com/reg/PartialReg?ru=

Enter your name, e-mail address, and password before hitting the ""Submit"" button.
Follow the on-screen instructions to select a username and complete the registration process.
You will also need to link a payment method to your account. PayPal is the most popular option, but you can also use a credit or debit card.

, When you start the listing, your title should include the brand name, fragrance name, size, and condition. After setting the title, hit the ""Get Started"" button to continue.


To start a listing, you will need to click on the ""Sell"" link on the ""My eBay"" section of the website. You should be redirected to the ""Start a new listing"" page, and from there, you can enter a title for your listing and work through the rest of the process.
Choose an appropriate category for your listing when prompted. Usually, perfumes should be listed somewhere under the ""Fragrances"" section of the ""Healthy & Beauty"" category.
As you set up your listing, you will also need to upload a photograph, enter a description, pick a selling format (auction or Buy It Now), set the price, and set the time frame for the auction.

, Since the buyer does not have the opportunity to test the scent before the purchase, you should describe it as thoroughly as possible.


At minimum, you should describe the basic fragrance type of the perfume. Most perfumes can be classified by one of five categories: floral, citrus, green, spicy, or earthy.If you know of any specific scents (vanilla, sandalwood, rose, etc.) that have been included in the formula, mention them by name.
When in doubt, check the manufacturer's description of the fragrance for more information on the scent itself.

, At minimum, you need to indicate whether or not the bottle has any dents, scratches, chips, stains, or worn spots. You should also note the bottle type.Most perfumes will be sold in standard spray bottles, but if the bottle is an atomizer, that detail is worth noting. An atomizer bottle has a squeeze ball attached to the spray nozzle, and for many perfume collectors, that bottle design is more desirable than the standard spray bottle would be.
Describe the material the bottle is made from. Most perfume bottles are made from glass, but some can be made from plastic.Indicate the width, height, and depth of the bottle, even if you have already mentioned how much perfume is inside. More detail is better than less if you want to make your buyers happy.
Look for any manufacturer's signatures or labels on the bottle. Mention any such details if they exist.
Describe the label, too. State the material the label is made from and the current condition of that label.

, You need to state in clear terms whether the perfume is brand new, opened but unused, or used.


Even if the perfume level can be seen in the picture, you should clearly specify how much is left. If you do not know the exact amount, estimate it, erring on the side of caution by guessing too low rather than too high. Buyers probably won't complain if they get more perfume than indicated, but they will if they feel you cheated by selling them an amount less than what you indicated.

, You need to state both the fragrance name and the manufacturer's name. Sometimes, two separate fragrances can have the same name even though they were produced by different manufacturers. Mentioning both can clear any possible confusion.


Mentioning the manufacturer's name can also assure the buyer than the perfume is authentic and not a bootleg scent.
It may also help to note whether or not the company is a famous one.

, Any other notable piece of information that has not been covered by the basics should be included in your description, as well.


For instance, if you are including the original box with the bottle of perfume, mention that in your listing. This is especially important if the perfume bottle has some collector's value.
If you're selling discontinued perfume or a vintage perfume bottle, you will need to indicate how old the perfume is. Include the manufactured date for any perfume older than five years and any empty perfume bottle older than ten years.
If you are selling a valuable perfume, consider quoting a perfume collector's guide on its current market value. Cite the book, author, and page.

, Periodically check on your listing to determine how much interest there is in the perfume you're selling.


You might be able to make adjustments to the auction to increase the likelihood of selling the perfume. For instance, if you aren't getting any bids, you might be able to lower the reserve price up until the last 12 hours of the auction.

, You should receive an e-mail once the perfume sells. Send the invoice as soon as possible, then prepare the perfume so that you can ship it within the next one or two business days.


Note that you should wait until you receive payment before shipping the package.

, Perfume is considered a hazardous material, so no matter which organization you choose to ship it through, there will be some restrictions on the method and packaging.


Legally, you will only be able to ship the perfume within the continental United States. The shipping method may also be restricted to ground transportation only, and you may need to fill out a form or special label to accompany your package.
To learn more about various shipping restrictions, visit the website of the shipping organization you plan to use.

, Pack the bottle of perfume in a secure box with plenty of packing material to prevent it from shifting during shipment. Secure packaging is crucial if you want to prevent the bottle from breaking and the perfume from leaking.Choose a sturdy box. Ideally, there should be approximately 4 inches (10 cm) of space around each side of the bottle.
Wrap the bottle in several layers of bubble wrap. Tape the bubble wrap in place.
When packing multiple bottles, make sure that there is space in between each one. Cushion each one separately and do not allow them to touch.
Any extra space in the box should be filled with additional bubble wrap, packing peanuts, newspaper, or air-filled shipping pillows.
Place an invoice indicating the recipient's name and address in the box. The invoice should also describe the contents of the package.
Seal the box with packing tape.
After everything is sealed, gently shake the box. You should not be able to hear or feel anything move around inside.

, Write both the buyer's address and your return address on the outside of the package. Drop your package off at the shipping organization of your choosing, fill out any necessary forms, and pay the shipping rate. After that, you've completed the process on your end.


Consider purchasing tracking or delivery confirmation for your package so that you know when the buyer has received it.
You may also wish to check in with your buyer after the package reaches him or her. Ask the buyer to contact you if there were any problems with the delivery and politely request positive feedback if the experience was a good one.

To find the item you bought, look under ""My eBay"" and ""Purchase History."" You should be able to find the order, which will have a link to the original item.;
, Check to make sure the shop takes returns at all. Sellers on eBay have the option of not offering returns, so it's possible you may be out of luck. Many shops will offer returns, though, just because it's good business.However, if what you got didn't match the description offered by the seller, you should be able to get a return no matter what, according to eBay's policy., Shop owners have several options when they set up their return policy. They can set how long you have to return an item, as well as what kind of refund you'll receive. They can also set a restocking fee or make you pay for return shipping.Before trying to return the item, make sure you're still in the time range the seller has set.

Then, you'll need to add details about why you want to return it. Finally you can add photos of the item to the form if you need to prove a point. Click ""Request a Return"" when you are done.

, Once you click on return, eBay should give you return labels. You'll have a return shipping label, which will go on the outside of the package, as well as a return packing slip, which will go on the inside of the package., In some cases, you may need to wait on eBay to contact the seller. Usually, you'll only need to wait if the package is large or hard to ship. You may also need to wait if you need to send the package internationally., Repack the item to get it ready to ship, placing the packing slip inside. You can put it back in the same package if it is still suitable for shipping.

That way, if there's a dispute, you have some evidence of when the package was returned.

, When using an eBay shipping label, you'll get tracking information, so that you know when it reaches the seller. Once the seller has gotten the item, you should receive a refund within 6 business days.For a replacement item, the seller should mail it within 5 days of receiving the request, not the item.

Review eBay's rules and policies.,
Report directly from the listing.,
Gather information about the transaction.,
Open a case at eBay's Resolution Center.",How to Report Fraud on eBay1," Before you report a listing as fraudulent, check eBay's rules to figure out how to best categorize the activity.


The website has specific rules for buyers and sellers, as well as rules for everyone who uses eBay's site and services. Violation of some rules and policies can result in eBay suspending the user's account or even blocking the user's IP address.You also can find general information and tips for staying safe while using eBay by browsing the articles in eBay's Security Center at , If the listing itself is fraudulent and is still active on the site, you can click the link at the bottom of the page that reads ""Report this listing.""


In some cases, the listing may already be closed, or the activity may not be related directly to the listing or the item sold. For example, one common fraud scheme involves contacting a losing bidder on an item and offering them a second chance to buy the same item at a reduced price. The scammer then has his victim send money through a wire service or money transfer company and doesn't follow through with delivery of the item.If you are a seller on eBay, you also may be the target of fraud on the part of a buyer. A scammer may contact you to purchase an item, offering to send you a check or money order for an amount greater than the sales price. They tell you that you can deposit the payment and send them a check or money order for the difference. Of course the check or money order you deposit is counterfeit, and the scammer has run off with the money and also potentially the item you intended to sell., Keep copies of any correspondence with the buyer or seller, along with any information you can pull from the user information page.


To report fraud to eBay, you generally need to have the user name as well as a reference number or any other information about the specific listing where the fraud has occurred.
For example, if you've used the ""contact member"" system within eBay, you may have a name or email address for the person, or you may have exchanged emails., eBay provides a service to mediate between you and the other user and investigate or resolve any complaints.


For example, if you bought an item and didn't receive it, you can use the Resolution Center to let eBay know. An eBay customer service representative will contact the seller for you and attempt to resolve the matter.If the issue you've encountered isn't described by any of the limited options available for you to open a case at the Resolution Center, you can contact eBay customer support directly and discuss your problem with a representative."

Research your state's law.,
Gather information about the incident.,
File your report with the police department.,
Cooperate with any further investigation.",How to Report Fraud on eBay2," Since police only investigate complaints that violate state law, studying the elements of criminal fraud in your state can help you figure out what information you need to file a complete report.Although the specific requirements and wording vary among states, criminal fraud typically includes the same basic elements. Generally, the person must misrepresent an important fact knowing that what they're saying is false, with the intent to deceive you into giving them money or property.Also keep in mind that you must have suffered some actual loss to be a victim of fraud. If you see a listing and recognize it as fraudulent, you can still report it – but the person typically can't be found guilty of fraud unless someone has actually fallen for their scam. However, they possibly could be prosecuted for attempted fraud., You will need information about the other user and details about the transaction so the police are able to conduct an investigation.


Using your knowledge from your legal research, focus on any documents or statements from the user that might indicate a criminal intent to defraud you.
Keep in mind you're probably not going to find anything that proves the person knew the things they were telling you were false. You don't need to do any extensive detective work – rather, you should leave this work up to the police. Just focus on making sure you get the details about the transaction down along with any correspondence you've had with the user.

, Once you have all your information together, call or stop by the nearest police precinct to submit your report.


Keep in mind that typically the police in the town and state where the perpetrator is located will be primarily responsible for investigating the activity. However, if you submit your report to your local authorities they will be able to transfer information if necessary.Some police departments have online forms you can fill out to submit a report. You can find the appropriate contact information for your local law enforcement agency by visiting http://www.usacops.com.
In your report, include a detailed chronological description of the events that took place. If you can reconstruct a timeline from the day you first encountered the listing until the moment you realized you were a victim of fraud, this can be helpful to the police as they investigate your report.
When you file your report, ask for a reference number and a copy of the official report for your records. You may need them to add support to other reports or complaints you file., As the police investigate the activity, you may be contacted for additional information.


Additionally, if you have the reference number for your case, you can call the police department to check on its status.Police have discretion on whether to pursue claims, and how long to pursue them. If losses are minimal and the police have very little information to go on, they may opt not to extend the investigation."

Begin your auction listings at lower prices to save on insertion fees.,
Reduce the amount of Listing Upgrade features you currently use.,
Use a free photo hosting website to upload photos of your items to eBay.,
Post your reserve price in the body of your listing to prevent bidders from losing interest in the auction.,
Apply for final value fee credits when buyers return or do not pay for the items you sold them.,
Begin with the Basic store level when you open an eBay store.",How to Reduce eBay Fees,"


Insertion fees are mandatory fees that you will pay for each item you list for sale on eBay.
You will pay the lowest insertion fee rates when you start your auction listing price at lower than 99 cents (0.72 euros). Insertion fees will increase gradually when you start your auctions at higher prices. For example, if you begin an auction for an item at 25 dollars (18.28 euros), your insertion fee will be 75 cents (0.54 euros); whereas an auction item you begin at 50 dollars (36.57 euros) will have an insertion fee of 1 dollar (0.73 euros).
View the eBay website provided in the Sources section of this article to view the current insertion fee rates.
If you create listings for fixed-price items instead of auctions, your insertion fee will always be 50 cents (0.36 euros) for items priced at 99 cents (0.72 euros) and higher.;
,


Listing Upgrades are additional features you can add to your listings for a fee, such as formatting your item's title in bold text for 1 dollar (0.73 euros), or placing a border around your listing for 3 dollars (2.19 euros).
Limit your Listing Upgrades to higher-priced or rare items that you specifically want to stand out from all your other listings. This practice will help reduce your accumulation of extra eBay fees.
A complete list of different types of Listing Upgrade features can be viewed on the eBay website provided in the Sources section of this article.

,


EBay will allow you to post 1 photo of your item for free, however, each additional photo you add to your listing will cost 15 cents (0.11 euros).
If you use a free photo hosting website to upload extra photos of your item, you will not have to pay additional photo fees to eBay.

,


Reserve prices represent the lowest auction bid you are willing to accept on your listing and begins at 2 dollars (1.46 euros) for items priced up to 199 dollars and 99 cents (146.28 euros).
When potential buyers bid on your item with a price that is lower than your reserve price, they will receive an automated message from eBay stating that the reserve has not been met. If buyers are unsure what the reserve price is, they may give up on the bidding process and move on to another auction.
Most sellers will start their auctions at low prices to encourage bidding, but add reserve prices to their listings to prevent buyers from paying too little for an item.

,


As a seller, you will pay final value fees on every item that is sold, starting at 7 percent of the final sale amount for fixed-price listings and 9 percent of the final sale amount for auction listings.
All final value fee credits can be requested through the Resolution Center, which can be found in the My EBay section when you are logged in to eBay. You will have a maximum of 60 days after your listing ends to request the final value fee credit.

,


EBay stores are eBay sales platforms that will list all your items on a customized page for you or your business and require you to pay a monthly subscription fee.
The monthly fee for the Basic store level is 15 dollars and 95 cents (11.66 euros) and is ideal for sellers who are new to eBay or have minimal inventory. Upgrade later to the Featured or Anchor store levels when your eBay store begins to sell a higher amount of items.
The monthly subscription fees for the Featured and Anchor store levels are 49 dollars and 95 cents (36.51 euros) and 299 dollars and 95 cents (219.27 euros) respectively.

Contact the Postal Inspection Service.,
Complete your mail fraud complaint.,
Cooperate with any further investigation.",How to Report Fraud on eBay4," If the auction or sale proceeded to the point that the U.S. postal service was involved, the perpetrator could be guilty of mail fraud.For example, a dishonest seller may have pocketed your money and not sent the item you purchased, or used fake user accounts to bid on their own merchandise and drive up the price. If you mailed a payment and received no product in return, or if you received something in the mail that didn't match the description on the listing, the activity may constitute mail fraud., Understanding the elements of mail fraud enables you to choose important and relevant information to include in your report.


You should focus in particular on the involvement of the U.S. Postal Service. If the postal service was not involved in the transaction, mail fraud probably did not occur. However, if you paid for shipping and did not receive the product, the postal service is involved – even if indirectly., The Postal Inspection Service investigates reports of mail fraud from individuals.


If you want to report mail fraud, you can contact the Postal Inspection Service by calling 1-877-876-2455.

You must include your name and contact information – you cannot submit a mail fraud complaint anonymously., Once your report is received, a postal inspector may contact you for additional information.

Star bidding from the beginning.,
Consider ""sniping."",
Use eBay auction alert software.,
Get in touch with the seller.",How to Place Your Bids at Online Auction Sites Like eBay," By starting bidding from the very beginning of the auction, you can make the seller realize that you are a serious buyer. Also, this gives you time to find out any restrictions that the seller has put on his auction. Rarely, online auctions are open for the restricted bidders only. In such condition, you must contact the seller to seek permission to bid.;
, Do-it-yourself auction sniping is technique of placing a bid within the last few seconds of the auction. DIY auction bidding gives you an opportunity to win the product without giving other a chance to bid again and outbid. Provided that you place a higher bid that the current highest you, your bid will be successful other has placed the bid that is higher than yours just a few second before the auction ends. You must be aware of the fact that eBay uses proxy bidding. Thus, regardless of the fact that you wish to place your bid just a few seconds before the auction ends, you must log into eBay to place your bid. Also, you are required to confirm your bid. So make sure that you have enough time to do this. As other may be using the same sniping method, you could still lose the auction.

, There are lots of eBay auction alert software that are capable to snipe for you automatically within the last few second of the auction. For the most part, eBay auction sniper software is successful. They work just like do it yourself manual sniping does but they are more precise and reliable. You just need to enter the auction product ID, the price you are willing to bid and your eBay account details so that the eBay sniping software can log in to your account. Just search eBay alert software in the Google and you will find many free and paid versions of eBay snipers.

, If you have decided to win the auction anyhow and want to have the product immediately, get in touch with the seller and ask them that you want to pay the highest amount if they are ready to close the auction early and switch the product TO the buy it now auction. If your offer is lucrative enough, the seller will agree to close the auction and auction and sell the product directly to you. However, you need to make sure that the auction is not closed away from the eBay since it will violate eBay terms and conditions. Also, this will give you a little protection as buyers.

Write a very clear description of the product in your eBay auction.,
Upload good pictures of the item you’re selling.,
Offer free shipping if possible and build the extra cost into your price point.",How to Structure Your eBay Auctions for Maximum Success," You need to be very clear and specific in the title. People should be able to see at a glance exactly what you’re selling. The title should get your potential customers interest and grab their attention right away. Spend a good deal of time crafting a killer title for your product.;
, Try to emphasize the benefits of your product. Make the description interesting. Use short sentences, short paragraphs and bullet points in your sales copy. This combination makes for very readable and entertaining copy.

, You should use a good quality digital camera and a nice, white background. You can use white sheets if you’re on a budget. Be sure to provide multiple angles of the product, as well as close-ups. Try not to use stock picture, take your own!

, Many people will actually pay more just to get the free shipping. Use this aspect of human nature to your advantage! If you offer free shipping, be sure to say so in your title or subtitle.

Choose a low starting price.,
Choose a cost based starting price.,
Choose a buy it now price.",How to Use Pricing Strategies for Your eBay Business," This means your starting price is only 99 cents or a couple of dollars. There are many benefits to low starting prices. First of all, you’ll save a significant amount of money on listing fees over time. Your listing fee goes up as you increase your starting price. Also, low starting prices encourage a lot of bidding. This can be very helpful to draw people into your auctions. Many folks are highly attracted to auctions with lots of bids. They equate the number of bids an item has with its desirability. More bids are better than less bids in any case.;
, With this method you start the bidding at the cost you paid for the item. So if you paid $25 for something, you start the bidding at $25. This method removes the risk of losing money. You're guaranteed to at least break even with this model. Do remember though, that your listing fees will be higher, and you may deter bidding action due to the higher starting price. Use this system on items that you're not sure will sell well. It’s acts like insurance.

, It lets impulse buyers buy without waiting. It’s a great way to sell more products. Do remember that the buy it now option disappears after the first bid has been placed on your item. That’s ok though. The buy it now option has always worked well for me. It should for you too.

Provide a detailed description of each item you sell and let the buyer know exactly what to expect.,
List your terms of sale, shipping options and shipping charges clearly and succinctly.,
Use your spell check function.,

Keep in touch with your buyer, but don't flood his email with unnecessary information.,
Ship items as soon as possible.,
Leave a positive feedback for your buyer, as most buyers are willing to respond by leaving good feedback for you.",How to Receive Positive Seller Feedback On eBay," Don't distract the buyer with confusing, unnecessary information. Include the positive points of your product but don't exaggerate.;
, Note any tears, dents, nicks, scratches, bumps or fading and don't play down any problems. The listing may not be as appealing, but a buyer who gets unwanted surprises is almost sure to leave you a bad seller feedback. If possible, include a clear photo.

, Charge enough to cover your shipping and handling, but don't inflate your costs, as doing so leaves buyers feeling ripped off.

, If you're unsure how to spell a word, use an online dictionary. Do your best to use proper punctuation. Properly written listings present well and indicate a level of professionalism. Write emails carefully and spell check before you send.

, State in your description that you'll answer questions promptly, then do so. Answer questions from potential buyers as soon as possible, as a prompt response displays good customer service and a slow response will annoy your buyer. Be polite and appreciative. Give clear, direct answers. Good customer service is always appreciated, and is the most important way to receive positive seller feedback on Ebay. Bad customer service won't be forgotten.

, Let your buyer know when his item has been shipped and the expected arrival time. Always say thank you.

, If the auction ends on a weekday, ship on the same day. Never wait more than two business days to ship. Pack the item neatly with adequate protective padding. Packages are often handled roughly, and a customer who receives damaged goods is unlikely to leave positive feedback. Spend a few extra cents and purchase tracking, which will enable you to answer questions if shipping is slow, eliminating possible headaches for both you and your buyer.

, Leaving a short note only takes a few minutes of your time, and is a simple way to provide good customer service. Send a polite email asking your buyer to repay the favor, but don't pester your buyer if she doesn't leave you feedback. If your experience isn't good and you honestly can't leave your buyer positive feedback, it's best not to say anything. Leaving mean, negative feedback only makes you look bad.

In general, the going rate for eBay consignment is 20 to 40 percent of the end sale price. The price you charge the consignor should be enough to cover your fees and still provide enough profit for you to be worth your time.;
, Be sure to include all fees that apply to the sale, what is to be done with merchandise that does not sell, and when and how the proceeds from the sale will be given to the consignor.

, When selling consignment for others, the money paid to your consignors comes off of your profit the same way that you would subtract product costs if you were selling items you purchased for resale.

, It is always best if you can get experience working with people you know before growing your business.

, A satisfied consignor will tell others about your service, helping your business to grow.

,,,


A search of eBay closed auctions provides a more accurate look at the market, because auction-style selling often brings bid activity at the end of the auction.
Taking items on consignment that do not have an eBay market is a waste of time, and in most cases you will be out the eBay listing fees. In most consignment situations there is no cost to the consignor if the item doesn't sell.

,


Alternatively, some sellers offer only an eBay listing service and do not ship the merchandise to the customer. If you run your consignment business that way, leave the items with the owner. Note: This is a very dangerous way to do business. If the owner fails to ship timely, you get the negative feedback and the shipping defect.
If you are not taking the item to your house for listing, you must take pictures of the merchandise at the consignor's house. Also record all necessary information, including dimensions, weight, condition and anything else you need to know when listing an item.

,,, The amount of time you wait before paying consignors is affected by a number of variables, including the payment methods you accept and your stated return policy, among other things. Make sure the transaction is completed to the customer's satisfaction before paying the consignor. Note that PayPal allows buyers 6 months to file a claim.

, This will allow you to handle more consignors without the travel time and expense of going to their homes.

Learn the best times for ending your sales.,
Avoid the low bid days.",How to Pick the Best Day to Start and End Your eBay Auctions,"


Sunday evening is the absolute highest time of bidding activity on eBay. Maximize your auction by planning it to end at about 11 pm eastern standard time on Sunday.
Friday and Saturday. Friday before 6pm can be a good day for your younger person and student market. However, weekend days are usually better than weekdays.
Monday and Thursday. Monday's are fair because a lot of people surf the net (and especially eBay) during work to help with ""after weekend withdrawals"". Thursdays are ok times to end your eBay auctions in the spring and summer because many people will cast their bids before they leave for weekend trips.;
,


Wednesday. For whatever reason, Wednesdays are one of the worst days to launch your eBay auction
Tuesday. Tuesdays receive the lowest number of bids out of all the days of the week.

Identify the dispute.,
Gather necessary information.,
Contact the other party.,
Access eBay's Online Dispute System.,
Characterize the dispute.,
Enter the transaction number.,
Wait to hear from eBay.,
Leave feedback.",How to Open a Dispute on eBay," Take a few minutes to sit down and write down important information about the dispute. The most common issues are receiving a faulty item or not receiving payment. Also think about how you want the problem resolved. Do you want a refund or do you want the item replaced?;
, Before opening a dispute, you should make sure that you have the following information:


the name of the other party.
the transaction number. This should be on any correspondence associated with the transaction. It will also appear on the “My eBay” page.
the date of the transaction.
the date you were charged (if you paid for an item).

, You should attempt to resolve the dispute informally. Sometimes problems can be fixed quite easily. Contact the other party through eBay (instead of through private email). By contacting the other party through eBay, eBay will be able to trace the communications.


The other party should promptly agree to issue a refund, pay for the item, or replace the item. If the other party does not respond in a day or two, you should open a dispute with eBay.

, To open a dispute, first visit eBay's online dispute resolution system. Click here to be directed to the resolution center.


You may be required to sign in using your eBay login and password., After visiting the resolution center, you must describe the nature of your problem based on whether you are disputing an item you purchased or an item you sold.


If you purchased an item, then you must choose between ""I haven't received it yet"" and ""I received an item that does not match the seller's description.""Alternatively, if you sold an item, you must choose between ""I haven't received my payment yet"" and ""I need to cancel a transaction.""If the options available do not properly characterize your problem, then you can select ""My problem is not listed here.""

, After characterizing the nature of the dispute, you need to enter the transaction number for the transaction in dispute. After entering the transaction number, eBay will ask you questions regarding the disputed transaction.

, Upon submitting your dispute, eBay will contact the other party to obtain a response. Depending on their response, eBay may ask you for additional information before you can make the claim final.


The dispute process should take a few days before you hear back from eBay.
After the dispute process is complete, you may receive a refund and the dispute will be added to the record of the other party. In limited instances, eBay may ban a member due to the sheer number of open disputes.
If you sold a good to a party who never paid, you may be offered the opportunity to make a Second Chance Offer to other bidders or relist the item for free.

, If you are a buyer, you can leave feedback for the other party by clicking on “Leave Feedback” in your “My eBay” page. Be sure to stick to the facts but also warn others of the difficulties you had with the seller.


For example, you can state, “Sent broken product” or “Never sent.” Refrain from commenting, “Terrible seller!” or “Beware: Don’t do business!”

Use descriptive key words in your listings to generate a higher number of views from potential buyers.,
Begin and end your listings during the times and days most people will be available online.,
Set your shipping fees at realistic, reasonable prices and offer combined shipping discounts.,
Post clear, quality photos that display your items from all angles.,
Focus on or specialize in selling multiple items from a specific niche.,
Demonstrate quality customer service skills toward every buyer and potential buyer.,
Include your detailed payment, shipping, and return policy information or terms and conditions in every listing.,
Sell items that you purchase from outlet stores or wholesale companies.,
Sell items on eBay for your friends and family members.,
Sell items that are rare or popular.,
Set low prices for your listings if you have set them up as auctions.",How to Maximize Your Profits on eBay,"


This practice generates more views because buyers use different word combinations in their searches.
This practice also helps buyers who are looking for very specific items that you may be selling. For example, if you are selling a pair of shoes, describe the brand name, size, color, shoe style, and condition of the shoe, rather than using a basic description such as ""Women's Shoes Size 7."";
,


Set your listings to close on weekends during evening hours. If you want your listing to close on a weekday, consider choosing an afternoon lunch hour or sometime in the evening.
EBay uses the Pacific time zone. If you live in the Central time zone and want your listing to end exactly at 7 p.m. your time, you must set it to end at 5 p.m. on eBay's website.
Consider ending certain listings at times that will attract the largest number of likely buyers for that item. For example, if you are listing an item that will appeal to elementary school teachers, arrange the listing to end after school hours in the evening.

,


Some buyers will leave you negative feedback if they purchase an inexpensive item from you with unusually high shipping fees. For example, if you sell an item with a 10 dollar (7 euros) value for 2 dollars (1.4 euros), you may disappoint a customer if the shipping fee is 8 dollars (5.6 euros).
Offer a lower shipping rate or combined shipping discounts if people buy more than 1 item from you.

,


Items with attractive photos that accurately portray their condition will be more appealing to potential buyers.
Place your items in bright light with a neutral background and use cameras with higher resolutions for increased clarity.

,


This practice will allow you to become more familiar with every type of product in the niche, teach you how to properly price your niche items, and teach you more about buyers in that niche.

,


Satisfied buyers will leave positive feedback for you with eBay, which signifies your reliability as a seller and can improve your reputation in the eBay community.
Answer emails on time and immediately respond to inquiries about your item.
Send your items to buyers immediately and package the items carefully and neatly to ensure a safe delivery.
Provide honest information about your items and be up-front about existing flaws. For example, if a pair of leather shoes you are selling have a small tear in the fabric, disclose this information in your listing.

,


This practice will prevent potential disputes or misunderstandings between you and the buyer.
Misunderstandings can result in negative feedback that affects your reputation or results in a refund for the buyer. For example, if you use recycled or used boxes to ship your products, post this information in your listing to prevent buyers from filing a complaint about the packaging you used.

,


You may be able to purchase high-end products at low prices and sell them on eBay to make a substantial profit. For example, you may be able to buy a sweater from a prominent name-brand store for 10 dollars (7 euros) that is valued at 140 dollars (99 euros) and sell it for a similar amount.

,


Ask your friends or family if they have items you can sell on eBay that they no longer want or use, or have the time to sell.
Offer your friends a percentage of the earnings if their items sell on eBay.

,


Rare items can be profitable because buyers may not be able to find them elsewhere; whereas popular items will attract a large number of views from potential buyers.

,


Lower prices will encourage competitive bidding among your potential buyers and may result in higher ending sale prices than you expected.

, Once you are signed in to your normal eBay account. Go to http://cgi4.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SellerSignIn, which will ask you to confirm payment details for your seller account.

, Pay special attention to the “Listing Conditions” sections, because they will tell you how to list an item in a legal way. Make sure you are able to print shipping labels and ship items in order to successfully sell on eBay.

,,, This will take you to the advanced search. Although once you begin creating your listing there will be a tool to do this, it is easier to accomplish using the search bar.

, This shows only any listings that ended in the last 15 days.

, It's often best to filter by item condition, since new and used items do not sell the same. Click 'Search.'

, This is the default sorting style. Sorting items by price may be exciting, but it's unrealistic. You are probably not going to get the highest price.

, If the price is green, the listing sold. If the price is red, the item did not sell. Only pay attention to listings that sold.

, Determine what your item is worth. Figure out what was successful and unsuccessful about other user's listing. Use caution in how you use this information: Use it as a learning tool, do not to copy.

, You will need to do a new search without checking for completed listings only. If there are currently many of whatever you want to sell listed, you may want to wait. The competition will drive your price down. However, if you see many listings, but also see that a lot sold in your advanced search, you have no problems, since demand is high.

, Read through the “tips and hints” section.

, This could be considered the most important part of the listing since it is the first and often the only impression a buyer will have. Use as many searchable keywords to describe your item as possible (avoid using words people aren’t likely to search for like “WOW” and “L@@K”)


Include: Brand name, manufacturer, artist, specific attributes, short description of the item

,,, Depending on what you did in previous steps, the category may already be there. If so, verify that it is accurate. This will help people find the item based on the type of media, clothing or other product they want to buy.There are two methods of finding the category.


Keyword Search: Type in a brief description of the item and eBay will search for the category that item is most likely to be found in.
Browse for Categories: Select the best category from a list.

, Include a photo, or up to 12 photos for a slightly higher fee, as well as the dimensions, color and shipping info. Use as many specifics as possible. Using proper grammar and format will give the buyer added confidence in the seller.


In order to get more photos on the account without paying, you can create a double photo on Photoshop or other photo-editing software and upload a single photo of several angles.
Choose template inserts. eBay suggests several standard sentences in each section to help you sell your item.When you become an advanced seller, you can create HTML templates to reuse for similar listings., This will allow you to see competing listings and choose your price accordingly., Choose your selling period if you plan to have the item on auction or in a classified ad. Don’t make the sell period too long for most products, since people usually make more bids in the last day.

, Then, list the cost of shipping or several shipping options the buyer can choose. Offering free shipping or free pick up can also be a good marketing tool for your product.

, Ship flat rate or have fee calculated based on the buyer's address. Offering to ship internationally yields more potential customers.

, Specify whether returns will be accepted. Specifying a policy, even a no-return policy can increase sales if it is listed.

, Previewing it will allow you to catch errors. Edit the information to perfect the listing before you publish it.

, You will be charged a listing fee to your pre-set account or billed on a monthly basis., There are plenty downloadable html templates for ebay seller.,,, Edit your listing if it doesn’t have any buyers or bidders in order to make it more attractive.

If no results are found for your keywords eBay will likely suggest keywords to use. If you decide to use eBay's new keywords, click on the new keywords to redirect to a new results page. If eBay’s suggestions don’t match what you’re looking for make change the keywords and search again.

, Click any title of an item to be redirected to the item’s page. If the item wasn’t found determine if: the search needs refining, or if the keywords were too specific.

,
Review the product description, shipping details, payment instructions, and return policy.,
Send the seller a question (or questions) regarding the item.,
Decide whether to bid or 'Buy It Now.'",How to Make eBay Purchases4,",,, If any of these details might change your mind on bidding, go back to searching for a different listing.

, By asking questions you have a chance to get to know the seller prior to the transaction. The response time and the quality of the response is a good gauge of how the sale will go. Ask the seller any questions regarding the item or the seller's policies.

, The ‘Buy It Now’ option will skip the bidding process and purchase the item for the specified price. Once bidding has started on an item the ‘Buy It Now’ option will become unavailable. Consider the time left on the auction when deciding whether to bid or ‘Buy It Now.’ If an item has just a little time until auction close you will probably win the item cheaper through bidding.

, Before confirming check that the number you entered is correct, misplacing a decimal point could be a costly mistake. Once you click on 'Confirm Bid' you have entered into a binding agreement to purchase the item if you win the auction. After clicking ‘Confirm Bid’ you may receive notice that you have been outbid (this happens immediately through eBay’s proxy bidding), if this happens return to step 1 and recalculate your maximum bid.

Always contact the seller before you bid.,
Read the description very carefully.,
Take a look at the seller's feedback.,
Make sure you know how they would make you pay.,
Always total up the cost of the item and the shipping cost, and the insurance cost should you choose to put insurance on it.,
Shop around to find the best deal.,
Take note where the seller lives.,
Look for 'Buy It Now' items.,
Make sure you know how long it will take for the item to get to you.,
Always note the item number.,
Check if a return policy is offered.",How to Know Whether to Bid or Not on eBay," This helps you get a good idea of what kind of a seller they are. This also allows you to ask questions about the object. They don't always include every detail. Whether it is a mistake or not, the listings should be very accurate, so if there's any question about what something includes or doesn't, if it has a return policy or not, or anything you might not understand, email the seller. If they do not email you back, do not bid on the item unless your question wasn't going to affect your bidding. If anything should go wrong, and you have a good explanation, you can retract your bid if it's before the auction ends.;
, If you made a mistake, misread, didn't read the whole description, etc., you can't blame the seller. If you won an item that you don't want because you made a mistake, it's yours. The only way to send it back is if the seller has a return policy. Then again, you could refuse to accept it, but you would have to deal with eBay. If the description isn't clear, don't bid on it. Email the seller and ask in detail about what you don't understand.

, If they have good feedback, you can probably trust them. Also, look at some of the comments they've received. Sometimes a seller will get pretty bad comments. Depending on what the comment is about, you can probably determine whether you should bid on the item. Also, look at the type of items the seller usually sells. If the item you're looking at is unlike anything they usually sell, it could be cause for suspicion.

, Some sellers use PayPal, which is very helpful when it comes time to pay. If they want your credit card number and you don't want to give it to them, use an alternative way to pay. If there are no other alternative ways, you will have to give him your card number, although most sellers use PayPal or another type of payment system.

, Sometimes the item will sell for a pretty low price, until you look at the shipping cost. You could end up paying much, much more than you had planned because you didn't look at the shipping price.

, Sometimes you'll have your eye on a certain item, when another auction might have fewer bidders, less time, and be going for a lower price. Always have more than one option, if possible.

, The farther a seller lives from you, the more the shipping cost will be. If he lives close to you, you might be able to save the money and pick it up personally.

, Sometimes these items are better than the auction items. Even though some of them might be a little or a lot more expensive than the auctions, you can ensure that you will get the item and that somebody else can't pull it right out from under you.

, If the item is for a birthday, Christmas, or any other type of present, make sure that the item will reach you within enough time. In reality, you can't find out what day, hour, minute, or second it will arrive, but you should get an approximation. If it doesn't reach you in the approximated time, contact the seller. Do not contact eBay. It might not have arrived when you expected for a number of reasons: the seller didn't send it soon enough, there were problems with the mail, etc. If the seller sent it, then it's neither you nor the seller's fault. The seller should then contact the mail service. If the problem is with the seller, such as he changed his mind and doesn't want to sell, then contact eBay. They will take care of the matter. You might not get your item but you will get your money back, and most likely the seller will be banned from eBay for a while.

, This is the best way to keep track of an item you have won, bid on, or are planning to bid on. Sometimes the auction will be taken off of eBay for certain reasons. If you need to email the seller about an item not arriving to you, and the auction has been removed from eBay because it's over, you can type in the item number and get all the information you need from the auction page.

, Sellers that stand behind their products will offer a return policy. Be sure to read the terms and conditions as most return policies expire very quickly.

, The gallery photo option eBay offers is a great way to get your listing noticed. Many more people are willing to look at a picture than click on an auction. Once they see your picture and are enticed they’ll click through to see more. Having a picture of your product in plain site will greatly increase the number of people clicking on your auction. This spells more bids and higher final prices!

, You can develop trust and rapport with a simple webcam and voice -- just keep it personal and real. Highlight what YOU want the prospective buyer to see. Share details about the product that would otherwise go unnoticed in a flat photograph.

, Subtitles are a great way to add extra attention-grabbing benefits. Remember, the key is to get a person’s attention. By adding compelling text in the form of a subtitle, you will greatly increase the attention-grabbing power of any auction. However, be sure that the item your selling is a high enough ticket item to warrant the extra cost. You wouldn’t want to use a bunch of fancy and expensive features if you’re selling a $3 item. But the subtitle option eBay offers is very important for higher priced items.

, You can be successful in a popular niche if you provide something that no one else is providing.

, Several excellent resources are provided below.




Wholesalers- By contacting various wholesalers you can easily negotiate very favorable pricing by buying in quantity. You can get whole pallet loads of goods that can be resold for large profits. This is a great way to go if you have a few thousand dollars to invest. By buying hot items in bulk, you can quickly realize large profits. This is a good way to go for those with a little know how.
Trade shows- Find a trade show related to the market you want to sell to. Trade shows can be a wonderful place to find new and innovative products. Many of the smaller companies at trade shows are looking for distributors. They will be very negotiable when it comes to price per unit. You can likely get them to take care of the shipping too if you negotiate properly.
Importing- This is the most challenging and the most profitable way to source eBay products. By importing goods directly from other countries, you bypass all middlemen. This means drastically increased profit margins for you. While importing can be challenging, it’s often worth it for the payoffs that can be had. Be sure to read up on the finer points of importing before trying this yourself. Importing also requires the most capital because of the shear volume you must buy in. If you are good in business and have a good sense of the market, you can make loads of money by importing.

Look at the price.,
Check the seller's feedback profile.,
Ask a question.,
Look around.,
Look at the item.,
Read the description of the item thoroughly.,
Look at the type of image being displayed.,
Look closely at the actual feedback.,
Save the seller.,
Use the Buyer Protection Program.",How to Find Reliable Sellers on eBay," Is it too good to be true? Chances are, it is too good to be true. It could have been stolen, maybe it isn't working, etc. Try to find if there is a reason for the low price.


Sometimes, a seller will start a 'minimum' bid, but he won't take anything less than a certain amount. Just because the price is 0.99 cents, doesn't mean that it would be sold for that. Take that into consideration.;
, That is the number by the star. This will lead you to a screen where you can check the numbers and what was said. By recent, the numbers go back 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months.

, Don't be afraid of opening a dialog with the seller. A good seller will encourage communication in order to get your business.

, Don't stop at the first seller that looks ok. You might think that everything is fine, until you look at others and get the opportunity to compare. He may be the best...but then again, maybe not.

, What condition is it in? What condition do you expect it to be in?

, Has this item been in use for the last decade...in storage for a while, or only driven by his grandma on Sunday.

, Is it a photo of the actual object, or is it a stock photo of the item. (e.g. a stock image of a Canon camera lens, or the actual picture of the lens you are trying to buy).

, It's your money. Be sure you are getting what you want.

, Once you have found a good seller, 'save' him. That makes it easier for you to look him up and find out if he has anything you might be interested in buying.

Register with eBay.,

Search the site.,

Sort your results.,

Find out more.,

Make a bid.,

Monitor the auction.,

Pay for your item.",How to Get Started on eBay," You will be required to provide your name, email address, and other information that will help to identify you as a user of the site and allow you to bid on items. You will also need to create a username and password.
, Now you're ready to get started with bidding. In the search box at the top of the page, type the name of an item or type of item that you are looking for (e.g. Beatles records, or simply The Beatles). You can do a general search, or search within several categories such as Music, Sporting Goods, or Books.
, Many searches, particularly for popular items, will show several pages of results. In order to find what you want more quickly, you can sort the items by price, time left in the auction, date of listing, or payment options available.
, By clicking on an item in the list, you can find out further details about the item, such as where it ships from, the seller's feedback rating from previous customers, and a picture of what you would receive.
, If you decide that you'd like to try to buy the item, you can bid on it by clicking ""Place Bid"". Most auctions will require bids in increments of at least 50 cents (for example, if the most recent bid is $7.00, your bid will have to be at least $7.50.). You can also type in a maximum bid amount, and eBay will continue to bid for you up to that amount. This is helpful so that you don't have to sit online and continually watch the item. If your bid doesn't work you need to enter your credit card details because you have bid on too many items at once.
, Every once in a while, you will want to check on the progression of the auction and see who else has bid. If you are not the high bidder, you can raise your bid up to the end of the auction in order to win the item.
, If you win what you were bidding on, you will receive an email notifying you of the sale. From there, you should either contact the seller to discuss details of payment and shipping, or wait for him or her to contact you. It is considered polite to complete this part of the process as soon as possible. PayPal is the most common payment processor used by eBay buyers and sellers to send and receive payments, so you should consider signing up with PayPal as well at https://www.paypal.com/.

Try good old fashioned haggling.",How to Get a Good Deal on eBay," Search online, call or go in person to local retail stores to see how much the item you want is selling for. Use the lowest retail price you can find as a starting point in your search. This is the price you’ll want to beat on eBay.;
, Once you know the local retail price, do a search online to see if it is being offered for less. Amazon is a good place to start. There are also search aggregators that will search many stores at once. And don’t forget to try Craigslist. Prices there are sometimes cheaper than eBay, and you can save on shipping by picking up the item.

, Now that you know how much the item costs outside of eBay, it is time to see how much it has been selling for on the site. Do a search and under options, click on “completed listings.” This will show you all the items sold in the past 90 days. Look at the final bids and compare them with retail and online prices to see if eBay is the best option. If so, use these bidding figures as a reference for how much you are willing to bid., eBay sells both new and used items. You can save a lot buy opting for used, but be careful when buying very expensive items, as they will not have a warranty.

, Particularly for large items, postage can add a lot to the final price, so it may make more sense to buy the item locally via craigslist or a retailer. When you search, sort items by ‘Price + P&P: lowest first’, to show the cheapest items with postage included.Always double check postage before bidding.

, eBay automatically search titles only. If you’re not finding the items you want, try clicking “include description” in the advanced search in order to search the description as well., If at first you don’t find the item you want, or find it but not at the price you want, then you can follow your search so that eBay will then alert you when the item you are looking for is for sale.

, Because these items are only available to those in a restricted area, they usually get fewer bids. That means less bidding up of the price. You can find lists of pick-up only items on sites like BayCrazy, Click “worldwide” for location in advanced search or in the left-hand bar after your search. Clothes and gadgets, in particular, are often cheaper overseas., The key to getting good deals on eBay is finding items that are getting few or no bids, because the more bids, the higher the price. One great way to do this is to look for misspelled entries (i.e. “diamond necklace” instead of “diamond necklace”), because if no one can find the item, no one can bid on it..


Try using a site with a spelling mistake spotter, like Fatfingers, BayCrazy, Goofbid or Bargain Checker.

, These overlooked items usually go for much less than ones that receive heavy bidding. You can search for them on BayCrazy or LastMinute Auction., Although buying from an experienced seller with a high rating offers more security, you can often find better deals buying from new sellers who don’t know the value of what they are selling. Look for sellers with low but positive feedback. This is a great way to find cheap “buy it now” items., eBay has changed the way it functions so that the bid you place on an item is now the maximum you are willing to pay, while the bid that shows up on the site is only an incremental increase on the most recent bid, until your maximum is reached. This means you may pay less than your maximum bid. People tend to bid round numbers, so to ensure your maximum bid has the best chance of winning, enter something like $20.01 instead of $20. This means if someone else enters $20, you will still win the bid., Some sellers will allow you to make a best offer, which they will decide whether or not to take.On eBay, do an advanced search and click “accepts best offer”.
Once you’ve found an auction that accepts offers, enter the seller’s username in the best offer tool at Goofbid.It will show you the items the seller has accepted best offers for, including the average reduction.
Use this information to determine the price to offer. For instance, if they typically accept 25% below the list price, you’ll know that knocking 25% off the price of your item will have the best chance of being accepted while saving you the most possible.

, The fewer bidders there are in the last minutes of an auction, the lower the price will be and the greater chance you will have of winning the auction. You can therefore save money by bidding on auctions that end when there are the fewest people online.Look for auctions that end after midnight on weekdays. Friday nights – when the fewest people are online – are the best time to bid. Sunday evenings from 6pm EST to 11:30pm EST are the worst.Try using BayCrazy to find auctions that close late at night., There is no point in bidding on an item early on: this will only drive up the price. To maximize your chance of winning the bid at the lowest price, place your bid as late as possible, preferably in the final seconds before the auction ends. You can do this manually or using a sniping tool., These tools will automatically enter a bid at a price you select in the last seconds of an auction. They take away the stress of doing the bidding yourself, and you can use them to bid on items that close late at night, when you are asleep. There are two drawbacks: 1) they usually cost money; and 2) they sometimes require giving them your eBay password, which is a security concern. If you do give away your password, make sure it is different from all of you other accounts (email, bank, etc.).Here are a few of the more popular sniping tools:Goofbid– Free with registration.
Sniper– After a free trial, it charges 1% of the winning auction price (min. fee $0.25, max of $9.95).
JBidwatcher – Free. Available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
eSnipe– Charges 1% of the winning auction price (min. fee $0.25, max $10.00).
AuctionStealeror AuctionBlitz– Offers both a free service, and priority service with a higher success rate. Monthly subscription plans start at $8.99. One-time monthly plans start at $11.99.
Bidnapper– A 15-day free trial, then subscriptions from $7.99 monthly to $49.99 yearly. You can also prepay for snipes: 10 for $19.99 or 25 for $36.99.
Gixen– Free with ads, or $6 for an ad-free service with a higher success rate.

, If you don’t want to use a sniping service because of cost concerns, security worries, or because you think you can do it better yourself, then you can snipe manually.Start by adding the item you want to you “watch list” so that eBay will let you know when the auction is about to end.
With 5-10 minutes left in the auction, open the auction page in two browser windows. In one browser, enter the price you are willing to pay and click “place bid”. There will be a confirm page. Do not confirm yet.
In the other browser window, hit refresh to keep track of the time remaining in the auction. Continue refreshing until there is 1 minute left.
Use a clock to count down 40 seconds from when there is 1 minute left, and then in the other browser window, click to confirm your bid. If you do it right, you can snipe the bid from unsuspecting buyers, but be warned: it’s very difficult to outbid automated sniper programs, which usually bid in the last 10 seconds or less.

, This works especially well with “buy it now” listings or auctions with a high start price and no bids. Click “ask a question” to contact the seller, and then make him or her an offer.Be polite and professional if you want to succeed.
“I’d love to buy . I see it has no bids. Would you consider a lower price than the listing? Say $x?” will work better than an abrupt. “Will you take $x for it?”

, There is a big difference between a wholesaler and middleman. With a true wholesaler, you get the best deals and prices. Having a re-seller's certificate is the most important thing to buy a lot of wholesale products at very low affordable prices. True wholesalers like to deal with other legitimate businesses.

, This is very important because sometimes you sell on eBay a product and when you come back to pack it and ship it, you find it damaged if it was not well stored. This will be very disappointing to you as well as to your buyer.

Since ending a listing early can cause buyers disappointment or inconvenience, your reason should be a fairly unavoidable one. Try to avoid simply ""changing your mind"" about selling something.
You are not allowed to end a listing just to avoid selling an item when a desired price was not met. Doing so is a violation of eBay policy.
The most legitimate reasons are when an item is lost, broken, or otherwise unavailable for sale.If you the description, title, or price is wrong, revise the listing or add a note to the description about the error. If these options are unavailable to you for some reason, then you can end the listing early.;
, There are fewer restrictions if you end a listing more than 12 hours before it is already due to end. If the listing is due to expire in less than 12 hours, there are more restrictions you will need to deal with, and they may prevent you from ending your listing.


You can end a listing early if there are at least 12 hours left, regardless of whether or not there are any bids on it.
If there are fewer than 12 hours left, you can end the bid if there are no bids, including no canceled bids. If there is one bid or more, you can end the listing, but only if you agree to sell the item to the current highest bidder.
If there are fewer than 12 hours left and there are no bids because you have canceled them, or if there are bids but the listing's reserve price has not been met, you cannot end the listing early.

, If there are 12 or more hours left and one or more bids on your listing, you will need to pay a fee if you want to end the listing and cancel those bids.


Note that this fee does not apply to listings in the ""Real Estate"" or ""eBay Motor vehicle"" categories. It does not apply if you are using the Classified Ads selling format, either.
You will not be charged a fee for the first auction listing you end early throughout the course of a calendar year, but any listing you end early after that will result in a fee if these conditions apply. Note that a calendar year is any date in between January 1 and December 31.The fee will be equal to the final value fee you would have paid if the listing ended on its own and sold for the highest bid you received at the time of the ending.You will still be charged standard listing fees even if you end the listing early.

If you want to wait until after a listing ends with a winning bidder, contact the bidder and explain the situation. If you can reach an understanding with the bidder, you can cancel the entire transaction.

, If you are cancelling your bid due to a typographical error or communication problems with the seller, you can use ebay’s standard bid retraction form. Ebay will routinely allow you to cancel your bid for the following reasons:



You entered the wrong amount by accident: If you accidentally enter $890.00 instead of $89.00, you can retract your bid and enter the correct amount as a new bid.

Significant changes made to the auction after you entered your bid. You may cancel your bid if the seller makes changes to the item's description, condition or shipping terms.

You are unable to contact the seller. If you have unanswered questions about the item and are unable to reach the seller by email or telephone, you can cancel your bid.

, You will need to enter the item number for the auction, and choose the reason for canceling your bid from a drop down menu.


You can find the item number in the top right corner of the “description” section of the item listing, just above the rectangle labeled “Item Specifics”
Click ""Retract Your Bid"" at the bottom of the ""Bid History"" page. Follow the instructions on each page until you reach the form.

Remember to click ""Retract Bid"" at the bottom of the form to finalize your request.

, Bids may be cancelled at the seller’s discretion, and many sellers will be willing to cancel your bid as an act of good faith.


Contact the seller as soon as possible, and remember that it is up to them whether or not to cancel your bid.
If the seller does not want to cancel your bid and you win the item, you are under legal obligation to buy the item.
This will not affect your feedback rating. However, a “bid retractions” line will be added to your feedback page, and if you cancel bids too often, sellers may block you from bidding in the future.

, Due to the complexities of these types of transactions, ebay acknowledges that these bids don’t create a formal contract between the buyer and seller. While you may not be legally bound to complete the purchase, bidding without the intent to buy is a violation of ebay’s policies.
”Buyers’ remorse” is not considered a valid reason for cancelling the transaction, but if you learn of a problem with the purchase after you win the item, it is within your rights to cancel.

"
"
Compare the price.,
Look at the seller's feedback score.,
Read the description carefully.,
Look at the shipping fees.,
Message the seller if you have any questions.,
Don't click the ""Buy it Now"" or ""Place Bid"" button til you're sure.",How to Buy Things on eBay2," When buying an item on eBay, make sure that you have thoroughly researched the item before placing a bid. Look up the market value and search for similar items on auction and watch what prices they're selling for. This way, you will get a good idea of the going rate for a particular item, so you will recognize a genuinely good bargain when you see one. Take the time to do your research and make informed decisions before buying.Just imagine how angry you'd be if you rushed into purchasing a watch for $50 (thinking this was an excellent deal) only to see the same watch sell for $30 a week later.
Whatever you do, don't rush into a purchase just because you think it might be your only opportunity to buy - with the exception of very rare collectibles, most sale items will pop up again and again on eBay.

, Once of the most important things you need to consider before making a transaction on eBay is the feedback rating of the seller. The efficiency, openness and trustworthiness of the seller can make a huge impact on whether your buying experience on eBay is positive or negative. Each seller has a feedback score, which they receive based on the reviews of eBay customers who have previously bought items from them. This information is available on the description page of the item to be sold, in the top right hand corner.Whether the seller's feedback rating is good or poor should inform your decision to buy the item. If the rating is poor, you buy the item at your own risk. Though uncommon, it's possible that the seller may ship you a broken or faulty item, or fail to send the item at all.
You can also read reviews of each seller on their feedback page, written by previous buyers. This will also help to give you an idea of what you can expect when buying an item from them.

, To save time and hassle, it is important that you read the description of each item very, very carefully, to make sure it is exactly what you're looking for. Some pictures or titles may be deceiving (whether intentionally or otherwise) and you might be fooled into buying the wrong thing. Make sure to read the entire description thoroughly, looking out for any mentions of flaws or problems with the item.Remember that if you are disappointed with the condition of your item when it arrives, even though the flaws were clearly noted in the item's description, you will have no one to blame but yourself. In this situation it might be very difficult to arrange a return and the seller will not be happy.
Examples of things to watch out for include whether the item is new or used, whether it comes in its original packaging, and whether it includes any necessary extras (batteries, chargers etc.) Be wary of very vague or confusing descriptions, as there is an increased risk that the item will not be what you expect.

, Shipping fees are another expense you will need to factor in to the cost of buying things on eBay. It is very important to check the cost of shipping before you buy, as many buyers get caught out by very low selling prices which are balanced out by exorbitantly high shipping rates. For this reason, you always need to factor shipping costs in to the total price of your item. The shipping information should be stated clearly beneath the selling price of the item.If you are not satisfied with the shipping charge on the item, then you should not bid on it. It is very unfair on the seller to commit to buying the item, then refuse to pay high shipping charges. If you really wish to find a compromise, message the seller before agreeing to buy the item, to see if a solution can be found.
You also need to check what location the seller is shipping from and where they are willing to ship to. This is particularly important if you are buying from an international location, as some sellers will refuse to ship outside their own country. This information is available underneath the shipping costs.

, Good communication between the buyer and seller can transform any buying experience from poor to excellent. Most high-rated sellers will be very responsive towards any questions or queries you might have about the item itself, the shipping method and fees and the payment method.In order to message the seller, scroll down the item page until you reach the ""Question and Answers"" box beneath the item's description. There will be a link titled ""Ask a question"" which you can click on to message the seller.You should make sure that you have all of the correct information about the seller's preferred payment method and return policy before making a purchase. If this information is not supplied on the item page, ask the seller directly.

, What many new buyers don't realize is that by clicking on either the ""Buy it Now"" or ""Place Bid"" button, they are committing to purchasing the item and there is no going back. Once you hit either of these buttons, the seller is automatically charged a fee by eBay for their use of the site, so they will not be happy if you try to back out of the sale.In some cases, the situation can be resolved if you have a legitimate reason for backing out of the sale and you message the seller immediately requesting a cancellation. You may need to cover the cost of the fee they've already paid, but at least you won't be forced to buy an item you don't want.
If you do not have a legitimate reason for backing out of the sale and simply refuse to pay for the item, the seller is entitled to open a non-paying bidder dispute against you. This may result in an unpaid item strike being placed on your account, which will deter future sellers and buyers from wanting to do business with you. If you get three of these strikes, eBay will suspend your account."
"
Use the ""Buy it Now"" option.,
Place a bid.,
Check the status of your bid.,
Make a payment.,
Give your seller feedback.",How to Buy Things on eBay3," If an item gives you a ""Buy it Now"" option, you will be able to bypass the auction process and purchase the item immediately. The price of ""Buy it Now"" items an vary quite a lot - depending on the seller's strategy:


Sometimes the ""Buy it Now"" price will be very low -- this is when the seller is trying to get rid of the item in a hurry, so they sell it at a lower than average price. You can get some great deals using the ""Buy it Now"" option, but these items get snapped up quickly, so you will have to act fast to avail of them. A good way to deal with this is to set up email notifications, where eBay will notify you when a particular item becomes available for immediate purchase.On the other hand, the ""Buy it Now"" price can often be higher than the average bidding price. This is because sellers are counting on buyers who need particular items in a hurry and are not willing to wait the several days it takes to bid in an auction. So unless you are in a hurry, it's important that you do your research to find out the average selling price for a particular item, before buying it using ""Buy it Now"".

, If the ""Buy it Now"" option is unavailable, or you're hoping to get a better deal on an item, you can use eBay's innovative online bidding system. The bidding system is very simple, all you need to do enter the maximum amount that you would be willing to pay for an item. eBay will then compare this amount to the bids of other potential buyers and will increase your bid incrementally each time you are outbid. They will continually raise your bid until they reach your maximum amount.eBay will only raise the price of your bid high enough to outbid other potential buyers. Once they reach your maximum amount, and the auction is still running, you will either need to accept defeat or raise your maximum bid.
Once you have placed a bid, there is no way to retract it. If you win the auction, you will be obligated to buy the item. If you refuse, you will face penalties from eBay and may even have your account suspended.

, Make a note of how much longer the auction will be running for and check back periodically to see how your bid is doing. Once the auction ends, you will receive an email notification from eBay informing you whether you won the item or not. If you did, the email will also provide instructions on what to do next.

, The next step is to complete your payment for the item. You can reach the payment page by clicking on the ""Pay Now"" link, which can be found on the ""Review Order"" page, on the confirmation email, on the listing page and on the ""Purchase History"" page on My eBay. The viable payment options are decided by the seller, and while most will accept payment by credit card or through Pay Pal, some sellers will request payment by check, money order or bank wire transfer.Never send cash to a seller in the mail. It could potentially get lost or stolen, or the seller might keep it and refuse to ship you your item.
You should make your payment as promptly as possible after winning the auction, a seller is entitled to open an unpaid item case if you fail to pay for the item after as little as two days.
When entering your shipment information, double check it to make sure all of the details are correct. If the information is incorrect and the item is shipped to the wrong address, you are the one at fault.

, Once you have you have received your item, you can can rate the seller based on whether you had a positive or negative experience. eBay encourages you to leave feedback as it creates trust between buyers and sellers and improves the overall customer experience. You can leave feedback by going to the ""Feedback Forum"" on the eBay site and clicking on the ""Leave Feedback"" link on the right hand side of the page.While feedback is encouraged, it is advisable to contact a seller directly about any negative experiences before you give them a poor rating. Most sellers will do their best to reach a solution which is agreeable to both of you - whether that's providing a refund, or some other form of compensation. Your bad experience may have been due to unforeseen circumstances or simple human error, so it is best to give sellers the benefit of the doubt before slating them on the forums.
When giving feedback, you can rate your experience as positive, neutral or negative, as well as provide a more detailed seller review. Try to be as factual and informative as possible and avoid making any offensive or personal comments, as this may discourage other people from selling to you.

Bid using odd figures.,
Bid at strategic times.,
Don't bid early and high - do one or the other.,
Try bid sniping.,
Use proxy bidding.,
Watch your auction carefully.,
Don't panic if you find yourself in a bidding war.",How to Buy Things on eBay4," Most of the time, when people place a bet they keep it to a nice round number, like $50 or $300. However, your chances of winning a bid can be greatly increased if you use odd figures instead, such as $50.03 or $301.87. This way you can win an auction by paying only an extra few cents more than the next highest bidder.For example, if you place a bid of $150.97 on a piece of furniture, you may win the auction over someone who placed a round bid of $150.00. You get your coffee table, but you only had to spend an extra 97 cent to do so.

, eBay is busiest at specific times of the day, and at these times there are more people bidding on each individual auction. Thus, logically, if you can bid during the site's quietest hours, you increase your chances of winning more bids. eBay gets the most traffic during business hours on weekdays and in the early evenings, on Eastern Standard Time. It's at its quietest in the early hours of the morning, around 1 am to 2 am.You can take advantage of this fact, particularly if you live in an accommodating time zone, if you place your bids while all of the East Coasters are asleep. Surprisingly, many auctions end during the early hours of the morning, so you'll have plenty of items to choose from.
Holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving are also quieter than normal days, so take advantage of this by placing your bids while the turkey's in the oven.

, Many new eBay users make the mistake of placing a high bid early on in the auction. This is not a good move, as it makes it obvious how much you want the item and marks you out as a newbie. You can either make a low bid early in the game and increase it as the competition intensifies, or you can place a high bid near the end of the auction, only when it becomes necessary to secure the item.Unsurprisingly, most sellers will be very happy if you place a high bid early in the game, as they know that they are guaranteed that amount no matter what.
Unfortunately for you, you may end up having to pay a much higher amount for an item you could have got for half the price, if you'd played your cards right. Avoid over-bidding by researching amounts that have been paid for similar items during past auctions.

, Bid sniping involves placing your bid as late as possible in the auction, typically in the last minutes or seconds before it closes. The thinking behind this is that other buyers won't notice or won't have time to outbid you and you will win the auction. Although sniping is a very popular strategy and works in a lot of cases, it has a number of flaws.Firstly, if your snipe is a lower value than that of the maximum bid of another buyer, then eBay will automatically increase their bid to the next incremental value. In this case, you will not have enough time to come back with a higher bid and you will lose the auction, in addition to raising the buying price for the winner. Lose-lose.
Secondly, sniping is very risky if you have your heart set on a specific item. A last minute sniping war with another buyer may cause you to bid higher than you originally intended out of panic, thus undoing any potential savings. In addition, you run the risk of your computer crashing, of unexpectedly having to log in again before placing your bid or some other external factor which will prevent you from making your bid., Proxy bidding is the system outlined in the previous section, whereby you enter the maximum amount you are willing to pay for an item and eBay does the bidding for you. This is the easiest way to bid, as eBay will enter the lowest possible winning bid on your behalf, then increase it incrementally (up to your maximum amount) as competing bids are submitted.This is a pretty safe way to bid, as the only way you will lose the auction is if the selling price is higher than your maximum amount.
Only eBay knows what your highest maximum bid is, that information is not available to the seller or to other potential buyers.

, You can bide your time and wait to see how the auction is going before entering your maximum bid. This will give you a chance to see how fierce the competition is and how low you can possibly bid to win the auction. You can watch a number of ongoing auctions easily by clicking the ""Add to Watch List"" link on the item's description page. You can then access the auction information by going to your My eBay page. Remember to check back every day for updates., Bidding wars happen all the time on eBay, particularly in the final few seconds before an auction closes. This is all part of the fun - you may be certain that you have placed the winning bid on an item, only to find out at the last minute that you have been topped by someone else.


It is possible to increase your maximum bid to get another shot at securing the item, but without knowing what the other buyer's maximum bid is, you cannot guarantee that you'll win.
Don't be too angry or frustrated if you you lose an auction. The same items pop up again and again on eBay and you may find an even better deal next time round.

Never allow websites such as eBay to save your payment details. Not allowing your computer system or websites to store your payment details helps keep your payment information confidential.
Log out after you have completed your transaction. Otherwise, someone could use the same computer that you were using to buy products and have them billed to your account. This rule is especially important when using a public computer that is accessed by multiple users.;

If you don’t know exactly what kind of item you want, you can browse eBay listings by category to see all of the items listed.

, When you find the item that interests you, read the listing completely. Does it tell you everything that you need to know? Is it clear, detailed, and easy to understand? Does the listing tell you if the item is new or used? If these things are not clear, or you have questions, e-mail the seller and ask for clarification.


What the seller tells you becomes part of the sale deal and provides a reason for return if the seller misleads you. It is better to be aware of everything than to throw away money in the hope the item will live up to your expectations.

, Check product listings and other web sources to ensure that what is described in the eBay listing is what you are looking for. Many products have similar models with different features, so it pays to be well-informed about the product you are looking at.

Anything above 95% is usually an indication that the seller is good - some negative feedback is to be expected in the world of sales and may simply be a reflection of a difficult customer or someone who had expectations that were unrealistic.


Check how many transactions the seller has performed. While it may not be wrong to do business with someone with only a few transactions (they may be new!), you are more likely to receive good service from sellers that have performed a large number of sales. A seller with a lot of sales will usually process your order faster and work to ensure that you are satisfied.

, PayPal is one of the most common payment methods on eBay, as payments can be processed immediately. If you don’t have a PayPal account, it is recommended that you set one up before you begin bidding to make the process smoother.


Don’t purchase from sellers who only accept cash. Avoid these sellers.

, This will give you the average prices paid for the item in the past which lets you make a comparison and gives you a notion whether the ""Buy It Now"" price or the auction listing prices are fair or not. If you are bidding, as opposed to buying immediately, it gives you an indication of how much you should be willing to bid.


You can perform a Completed Listings search by clicking the ""Advanced"" link next to the search bar. Check the ""Completed listings"" box in the ""Search including"" section. Enter in your search keywords and then click the Search button.
Listings in red will be completed listings.

, The “Buy it Now” option allows you to purchase the item for a set price instead of having to go through the bidding process. For rarer items, using the “Buy it Now” option may actually save you money if a bidding war starts.


Be sure to check the average price for the item you are purchasing. If you use the “Buy it Now” option, you may end up paying more than it’s worth.

, Your bid will automatically increase by the minimum bidding interval until you reach the maximum amount you entered. This will allow you to set a maximum that you’re comfortable with without having to constantly monitor the auction.


Placing any bid binds you to the auction. By placing the bid, you are agreeing to pay the amount that the auction closes at.
You cannot retract bids, so be sure that you are sure that you want the item. Bids can only be retracted if there was an error in entering a bid to begin with, not if you change your mind on an item.

, As the auction progresses, you will be notified if your maximum amount has been outbid. If you can and want to, you can increase the amount of your bid by returning to the listing and entering in a new amount.

, If you win the item, you will be notified. Once the auction ends, you are obligated to get in touch with the seller and work out payment and shipping details., Once the auction is complete and you have declared the winner, you and the seller need to get in touch. This communication will allow you to choose your payment method and confirm your shipping address and the shipping and handling fees. The seller will ship the item once they receive confirmation that payment has been made.

, If the seller does not receive payment within two days of the auction ending, they can open a case against you through eBay. You can avoid this by quickly paying for your item as soon as the auction is completed.


Paying quickly will often result in the seller leaving good feedback for you, which will make future sellers more likely to quickly work with you.

, The entire eBay system revolves around buyers and sellers leaving feedback for each other after the completion of a transaction. Leaving feedback for sellers after a transaction is considered good etiquette. Use the feedback to let other buyers know if the seller is reliable. Feedback options include:


Positive: You are satisfied with the transaction and would likely buy from that seller again.
Neutral: You may have some issues with the sale process but not enough to leave a negative.
Negative: Something about the sale disappointed or upset you. Before leaving negative feedback, always try to contact the seller and seek resolution. Most sellers will try to remedy any errors that they have caused because they value their feedback status. Many now offer refunds and in some cases, you may be able to reach a compromise that makes both sides happy. If you cannot reach a resolution, eBay can also intervene for you. After trying a reasonable amount to resolve the issue and you still have no happy outcome, leave a factual message as to why you found the transaction to be negative. Avoid abuse or inflammatory statements; these reflect badly on you and may cause future sellers to block you.

, If you have troubles with receiving the item from the seller, receiving an item in a different condition than was advertised, or have any other issues, contact the eBay Resolution Center. You can use this online tool to file a complaint, and potentially receive a refund from eBay for the purchase you made.


Always try to resolve your issue with the seller directly before using the Resolution Center. Most good sellers will attempt to make things right without having to escalate to eBay customer service.

",How to Buy Autographs on eBay," Positive feedback should be at least 90%. It is unrealistic to expect 100% approval for high-volume sellers since busy sellers are bound to have some disgruntled or unreasonable buyers.;
, This will tell you if the seller is affiliated with reputable autograph collecting organizations. Don't take the seller's word for it! Go to a website of an organization that is reportedly affiliated with the seller and confirm if the seller is indeed a member in good standing.

, This will give you an idea of the seller's area of interest and specialization.

, Check the obvious: Is the autograph spelled correctly? For example, Apollo 11 astronaut autograph spelled ""Neal Armstrong"" instead of ""Neil Armstrong"" is an obvious fake.

, Some websites have large inventories of authentic examples and informative articles.

, Keep in mind that many fake autographs sold on eBay are accompanied by certificates of authenticity.

Learn eBay's policies for PowerSeller status.,
Understand PowerSeller Tiers.",How to Become an eBay Powerseller1," Policies are always subject to change, but PowerSeller rules have been fairly stable for a few years. To become a PowerSeller you must:


Be an active member for 90 days.
Average a minimum of $1000 in sales per month, for three consecutive months.
Maintain a minimum of 4 average monthly listings for three consecutive months.
Have an overall feedback rating of 100, of which 98% or more is positive.
Have an account in good financial standing.
Uphold the eBay community values, including honesty, timeliness and mutual respect
Comply with all eBay listing and marketplace policies.;
, There are several tiers of PowerSeller, and your benefits vary depending on your tier. The tier you fall in is determined by consistent sales volume over a period of months. There are 6 PowerSeller Tiers:



Bronze PowerSellers have a minimum of $1000 in sales per a month. Bronze tier benefits include prioritized online support from eBay.

Silver PowerSellers must have a minimum of $3000 of business a month. Silver PowerSellers get both prioritized online support and toll free phone support.

Gold PowerSellers are required to do $10,000 of volume a month. These PowerSellers get all the benefits of the first two tiers plus free access to eBay's Account Manager Software.

Platinum PowerSellers get all the benefits of the gold tier but must do $25,000 of business monthly.

Titanium PowerSellers must do $150,000 or more of business a month.

Diamond PowerSellers have to do a minimum of $500,000 in sales or sell at least 50,000 items per month. This is the highest PowerSeller level!

"
"
Put the customer first.,
Maintain active communication with your customers.,
Choose a focus.,
Plan to be organized.,
Establish an accurate accounting procedure.,
Stay up-to-date on auction trends and changes.",How to Become an eBay Powerseller2," PowerSellers always have the customer at the forefront of their operation. Understand that your seller reputation on eBay's is primarily determined by your feedback score, therefore treating your customers right is not only common sense but good business too.


In a conflict with a customer always use the eBay email system to communicate with them in order to establish a written record.
Always keep your cool and be professional.
If the customer is wrong consider the money involved in keeping a customer against the money involved in proving you are right. Consider offers for dissatisfied customers, even if they are wrong:

Give them free shipping, or refund their shipping.
Include a free gift in the package.


Develop a listing that answers all questions about your sale, including your return, shipping and other customer service policies. Stick with it!
Be consistent with all customers when it comes to your own policies.

, Customers are less likely to be unhappy, file complaints or make your life miserable if you communicate with them.


Always send the customer a tracking number for their package.
Always include a packing slip with the auction number in the package.
Respond to any questions promptly.

, A PowerSeller is usually focused on a single article or type of product. Doing so makes all other aspects of running the business easier, including listing, packing and shipping.

, PowerSellers deal with such a large volume of business they need to develop a ""back-end"" organization (also known as a workflow) that minimizes the time they spend keeping up with their own policies regarding on-time shipping, packing, returns and similar activities. You may think of this preparation as creating an ""assembly line"". For example, you may set up a large 4' by 8' table with bubble wrap and packing materials at one end, products in the middle, and boxes, labels and packing tape at the far end.


Buy and keep a selection of shipping boxes and shipping materials in your home.
Consider setting aside an area of your home just to run your business.
Create online shipping accounts with USPS, UPS or your favorite shipper so you can print shipping labels at home.
If you do a lot of shipping consider signing up for a pickup service, rather than lugging it all to the mailer yourself.

,


Keep a paper copy of every auction, the winner, and the shipping receipts.
Keep a record of all your customers, their names and addresses.
Establish a regular schedule for balancing your books, perhaps monthly.

,


Buy good, recent books on online auctions and e-commerce in general.
Participate or read the eBay Message Boards and Forums.
Stay tuned to the eBay Announcements Board.

Learn how to take a basic quality photograph. Make sure it is in focus!
Consider creating a mini studio including photographic lighting.
Learn how to color correct photographs taken in interior or other lights.
Use a mixture of close ups and wide shots to give your customers a good feel for the item.
Remember that your photographs are part of your listing and will be considered in any disputed transaction. Photographs must be as 'true' as your listing text.
You pay no more for larger photographs than smaller ones, so make your photographs as large as possible for the eBay system.
Consider paying extra for oversize photographs and other eBay photographic features.
Only use a scanner for flat items.

,
You can develop trust and rapport with a simple webcam -- just keep it personal and real.
Highlight what YOU want the prospective buyer to see. Share details about the product that would otherwise go unnoticed in a flat photograph.

, For ten cents you can schedule any start time for your auctions. Peak buying periods are generally considered to be, Saturday, Friday and Sunday evenings between 6 and 8 pm eastern standard time. That said, the peak periods for your particular customers may vary.

, A PowerSeller resists the temptation to use ""fluff"" words like ""L@@K"", ""WOW"" and ""MUST SEE"" as these provide no information for your customer about your item, do not show up in searches, and are generally ignored by most buyers. Instead, the wise PowerSeller uses descriptive words in the headline, realizing that the headline is the ""ad for the ad"". A PowerSeller is also ""search engine savvy"", realizing that keywords in the headline are picked up by the eBay search engine, and by Google, more often than not.

, A PowerSeller has achieved their level by maintaining a high ratio of positive feedback. This is primarily accomplished by having clear and accurate descriptions of the items so that the bidder can clearly ""imagine"" the item as if it were sitting in front of her along with describing the flaws in the item. A great description should entice the bidder to bid while at the same time providing full and complete disclosure of the item's condition. Always be scrupulously honest in your descriptions.

, They offer to accept Checks, Money Orders, all types of credit and debit cards through PayPal, Billpoint, or their own Merchant Accounts. By offering a wide variety of payment options, they open up their market of available bidders and end up with higher ending bids as a result.

, By accepting bids from around the world you dramatically increase the number of customers you can attract and probably increase the end price of your item. On the down side shipping to many other countries is often difficult and awkward.

, Whether it is a discount on shipping multiple items or a discount on the actual price of multiple items, PowerSellers realize the value of a good customer and treat that customer special. Unexpected discounts tell the customer ""You're special"" and build a reciprocity that keeps customers coming back or searching the PowerSellers' auctions."

, Check and double-check the price, condition, and overall product description so that you know exactly what you are bidding on. Do not simply make your decision by looking at the photo, since some sellers purposefully post deceiving photographs on their listings.


Check the seller's rating. Previous ratings and reviews left by other buyers allow you to gauge if the purchase will be worth your effort and money. A good seller will have a rating between about 94 and 100 percent. The number of ratings a seller has is also indicative of popularity, and a seller with many high ratings is an even better option than a seller with only a few high ratings.

, This initiates the bidding process. If you are not already signed in, eBay may ask you to sign in now.


If you do not have an eBay account, you may need to create one. An account is free to create, and having one allows you to monitor your ongoing bids and orders.
Type in your maximum bid. Your maximum bid is the highest amount of money you are willing to pay for an item. Type the amount in the box and click “Continue.”
Understand how incremental bidding works. In order to ensure that buyers get the item for the lowest possible amount, eBay uses a system referred to as automatic incremental bidding. Your opening bid will be the same as the seller's minimum bid amount. If your maximum bid is higher than this minimum, eBay will automatically increase your bid in pre-determined increments. This process will continue until your maximum bid has been reached.Only bid on an item you are willing to pay for. According to eBay, every bid you make is considered to be a binding contract.For that reason, it is vital that you only bid on an item you fully intend to purchase.
Only bid an amount you are willing to pay. While you may receive the item at a lower price than your maximum bid, you should always be prepared to pay your maximum amount. Again, placing a bid serves as a binding contract, and you will be obligated to pay the full maximum bid if that price is reached during the bidding process.
Do not bid on two of the same item at the same time. If you win both bids, you will be obligated to pay both. Unless you want two of the same item, you should only bid on one listing for a particular item and wait for the auction to end before trying a new listing for the same item.
Raise your maximum bid, if desired. If you decide to pay a little more for an item, you can raise your maximum bid by simply placing another bid at a higher amount.
Know the limits on retracting bids.There are only a few rare instances in which you will be allowed to retract your original bid. If you accidentally entered the wrong amount, you can reenter the correct amount immediately to fix the error. If the item's description changed significantly after your bid was placed and you cannot reach the seller, you may also retract your bid then.

, Verify that the maximum bid amount is correct and click on the ""Confirm Bid"" button to approve it.

, The mobile version of the website is free, works on any smart phone, and can be found at http://mobileweb.ebay.com


The process of locating and bidding on an item is essentially the same on your mobile device as it is on your desktop. The only difference is that mobile versions of eBay are visually formatted in a way that makes them more accessible on a mobile device.
Alternatively, access eBay by downloading a mobile app. You can download a free mobile app for eBay for all major smart phone brands. The appearance of eBay may look different through the app than it does when accessed via the website, but you can still use the app to search and bid on items as usual.

, If using the mobile website, type a description of the item into the search bar on the homepage as usual, pressing the magnifying glass icon to initiate the search.


Select ""Browse Categories,"" located beneath the search bar on the home screen, if you do not have a specific item you are searching for and would like to look through the product categories.
If using a mobile app, the same basic technique still applies. The search bar will be positioned toward the top of the app's initial start-up screen, usually in the upper right corner or the upper center depending on the version of the app you have. The ""Browse Categories"" option is also listed on the initial screen but is usually positioned somewhere beneath your saved searches or favorites.

, Make sure you have a thorough understanding of the product description, price, and condition. Since bids on eBay are considered binding contracts, it is vital that you understand exactly what you are bidding on before you place your bid.


Look at the seller's rating. A trustworthy seller will have a rating somewhere around 94 percent or higher. A seller with more ratings is also more popular and more reliable than one with few.

, The button is the same for both mobile web and mobile app versions of eBay. This starts the bidding process.


Sign in or create an account. If you are using a mobile app, you will likely already be signed in. If you are merely using the mobile version of the website through the phone's Internet browser, you may or may not be signed in at this point.
Choose your maximum bid. Touch the bid box with your finger to highlight it and use the on-screen keyboard to type in the number. Your maximum bid is the absolute highest amount of money you are willing to pay. Select ""Continue"" after you finish typing.
Your bid will start off at the lowest amount possible. Due to eBay's incremental bidding system, your bid will continue to increase as other buyers place bids until your maximum amount has been reached.
Only place bids you are willing to see through. A bid is a binding contract. As a result, you should only bid on items you absolutely want and your maximum bid amount should only be an amount that you are willing to pay. You can always raise your maximum bid, if desired, simply by placing another bid on the item at a higher amount.
Don't plan on retracting your bid. The only time eBay will allow you to retract your bid is if you accidentally entered the wrong amount and reenter the correct amount immediately, or if the item's description has dramatically changed since your original bid was placed.

, Review the maximum bid amount once more to make sure that it is accurate and use your finger to press on the ""Confirm Bid"" option.

, If you use the mobile app version of eBay instead of the mobile website, you will be notified whenever someone outbids you.

, For example, if your maximum desired price is $50.00, enter a maximum bid of $50.11.Most sellers bid in whole dollar amounts. Many eBay auctions are won by a few cents. If another seller shares your maximum bid of $50.00, odds are, that seller will set his or her maximum bid at $50.00. By placing your maximum at $50.11, your bid will automatically be raised above your competitor's bid if the $50.00 mark is reached.

, The most effective bids are placed within the last 10 seconds of the auction.


If you place your maximum bid well in advance, a bidding war may take place in which the bids of two or more buyers are continually rising in increments. Even if your maximum bid is higher than the other buyer's maximum, the other buyer has to opportunity to raise his maximum bid even higher once your maximum has been reached.

,


Type your maximum bid into the second window and click on ""Place Bid."" Do not click on ""Confirm Bid"" yet, but make sure the button is visible.
In the first window, refresh the page by hitting the f5 button or Ctrl+R. Reload the page every few seconds to monitor changes to the current price.
Have the two windows open side-by-side, if possible. Switching back and forth can kill valuable time.
Switch to your second window, with your input bid, during the last 10 to 15 seconds. Click on ""Confirm Bid"" to place your final offer. Doing so this close to the end of the auction will make it difficult for anyone else to place a higher bid before the auction closes.

Because of the transient and high-speed nature of change in Internet business, a PowerSeller realizes the value of having their own storefront on the Web.

They have developed a following and a customer base through their eBay auctions that can help sustain them even if dramatic changes come about on their main selling venue.

Safeguard your account.,
Familiarize yourself with common scams.,
Scope out the user's account.,
Pay attention to the terms of the transaction.,
Look for red flags.,
Always pay through eBay-approved methods.,
Document everything.,
Monitor your bank account and PayPal afterwards.",How to Avoid Getting Scammed on eBay1," Before you even bid on your first item, make sure your PayPal and eBay settings are as secure as possible. It's not a bad idea to have an entirely separate email and bank account dedicated solely to your eBay transactions.


The same logic applies to your home address--especially if you're purchasing something from a long-distance seller, consider picking the package up at the post office. This method provides added security coupled with your retention of privacy.;
, If you don't know the playbook, you're liable to end up as a statistic in it. Most eBay scams that target buyers are centered around sending faulty products for an insane mark-up or simply not sending a product outright after payment is delivered. These kinds of scams happen most often with big-ticket items like cars or property, so if you must purchase a vehicle or something similar through eBay, be sure to insist on a mutual meeting place to do the transaction.
You can avoid most basic scams by simply requesting more information about the item and the terms of the item's sale. If the seller is reluctant to give you information or they appear evasive, you should give the item a pass.

, While this isn't the most accurate way to determine whether or not someone is a scammer, it eliminates the possibility of buying from someone with a ton of negative reviews or a lack of history.


This precaution is mostly contextual, so be sure to ask questions. If you contact the seller and they tell you that they've been working on eBay for years when their account was registered last week, that should raise an immediate red flag.

, If you don't read the fine print and somebody ships you a damaged or faulty item ""as is"", eBay won't side with you in a dispute. It's shady, but technically legal; therefore, you should spare yourself the trouble by reading through every single detail on the listing before you bid. If possible, request additional photos or information as well--again, if the seller is reluctant to accommodate your request, they're probably hiding something.

, Before you even contact a seller, look for negative reviews, a lack of a refund policy, missing or vague information, or requests for money orders, checks, or other third-party payment methods.


You should also generally be on the lookout for things that simply sound too good to be true. If you see someone selling a piece of expensive hardware described as ""brand new"" for well under market price, it's probably a scam.

, PayPal and eBay both keep records of transactions, and you have access to these records at any time; going through third-party sites or payment methods is a surefire way to lose the support of both companies in the event of a scam.


Pay on collection of big-ticket merchandise such as cars, large furniture, or similar items. The easiest way to ensure the cooperation of both parties in an event like this is by meeting face-to-face in a neutral area with plenty of visibility--i.e., a shopping center. , eBay and PayPal deal exclusively in written records, so if a seller wants to discuss business over the phone, politely explain this to them. They will likely be dissuaded if they are attempting to scam you.


You should keep any written records of transactions for at least a year after the transaction takes place, simply for insurance.

, In the days following your transaction, keep an eye out for any irregular activity in your bank accounts. If you spot any, contact PayPal, eBay, or your local branch and report the circumstances.

Never give up.",How to Be Successful Selling on eBay," Take a while to sit and watch for what sells and what doesn't out of the items you're interested in. Any market research data you can collect will be very useful to you later on. You'll probably see the 'sweet spots' quite quickly - those one or two items that always seem to sell for a good price.;
, Before you invest any money, see what the other sellers in your category are up to, and what their strategies are. Pay special attention to any flaws their auctions might have, because this is where you can move in and beat them at their own game.

, Get hold of a supplier for whatever it is you want to sell, and see what the best rates you can get are - don't be afraid to ring round quite a few to get the best deal. If the eBay prices you've seen are higher than the supplier's, then you're set.

, Don't throw thousands at your idea straight away - get started slowly, see what works and what doesn't, and learn as you go. Remember that it's very cheap to try out even the craziest ideas on eBay, and who knows, they might just work!

, Keep trying different strategies until you find something that works, and then don't be ashamed to keep doing it, again and again. The chances are that you've just found a good niche.

, A business plan doesn't need to be anything formal, just a few pages that outline the market opportunity you've spotted, your strategy, strengths and weaknesses of the plan and a brief budget. This is more for you than it is for anyone else.

, Now is the time to throw money at the problem. Buy inventory, and start spending more time on your business. Set a goal number of sales each week, increasing it each time.

, Once you've made a few thousand dollars worth of sales, you should really register yourself as a business. Don't worry, it's not expensive or hard to do - a lawyer is the best person to help you through the process.

, You'll probably find that you're writing the same things again and again in emails or item descriptions. This is the time to give up on the manual method and turn to automated software that can create listings for you, and respond to completed auctions and payments with whatever message you provide.

, Even when it looks like it's all going wrong, don't stop trying until you succeed. If you keep working at it then you'll almost always find that you make a real breakthrough just when things are starting to look desperate.

Monitor your bank account and PayPal afterwards.",How to Avoid Getting Scammed on eBay2," Before you list an item for sale, make sure your refund policy, payment settings, and shipping information are all accurate. You don't want someone to accuse you of scamming them based on inaccurate information--in fact, some scammers will find ways to exploit errors like this to get eBay to side with them in a dispute, leading you to lose both money and your item.

, While PayPal is relatively secure and eBay has a whole host of security benefits to keep your money safe, consider opening a separate account solely for transactions, complete with an accompanying email address.


Several users have reported success in bypassing scams by having a PayPal-related email and an eBay-related email separate of one another; that way, if, for example, a buyer contacts the PayPal email with an inquiry, you automatically know it's a scam.

, First and foremost, buyers are always looking for the best deal, so what you may interpret as a scam might be them simply trying to haggle the price. That said, most scams that are run on sellers tend to revolve around refusing to pay for an item or attempting to get their money back after purchasing said item. The most common scam is called the ""bait and switch refund"", in which a buyer complains about receiving a broken or faulty device after it ships. Since eBay is obligated to side with the buyer in the event that they provide proof--an easy enough process, since all they have to do is buy a broken version of whatever you sent them for practically nothing--you will be forced to pay them a refund. You can prevent this scam by either implementing a no-returns policy or by including buyer's insurance in the transaction.
Another common scam consists of buyers attempting to settle transactions outside of eBay--over the phone, for example--which leads to eBay having no written record of the transaction if they choose to scam you. To counteract this, never settle for anything less than a written record of your transactions, preferably through email.

, Generally speaking, you'll want to have some kind of return policy in the event that an honest mistake with shipping and handling happens. That said, be sure to state the terms of your return policy in your posting. This is an easy way to close any loopholes that scammers may try to exploit. If you're selling an expensive item--especially if it is rare--consider changing the terms of your listing to ""no refunds"". This may dissuade some genuine buyers, but it will also keep scammers away. You can always say ""more information upon request"" in your posting to counteract the harshness of this policy--honesty is on your side.

, If a buyer refuses to pay through eBay-approved methods such as PayPal, they're probably hiding something. Similarly, if they want to settle outside of eBay or they give you an unconfirmed address, consider renegotiating. Chances are fairly high that they'll reconsider if you tell them you're worried about being scammed, but this method should scare off any actual scammers. PayPal doesn't lie, and neither does eBay; email, however, might. To ensure that all of your emails regarding your account are correct, log into the pertaining service and check manually.
As a general rule, you should not accept money orders or checks of any kind--the risks are simply too high, even if your buyer's intentions are good.

, As soon as you and your buyer settle on a price, have them transfer the money to PayPal. Once you see the transaction in progress on PayPal, you can ship your item--not a second before.


You'll have a written record of the time you send your package and the time that PayPal accepted the transfer, so as long as the two corroborate, you should be safe from any attempt at a scam.

, Services such as FedEx and UPS often give you the option of tracking your package along its route; take advantage of this system to ensure the package's arrival. If your buyer tells you it didn't arrive when UPS tells you it did, you'll know not to send them a refund. Once again, eBay and PayPal will usually back you up in this case, so long as you have retained all of your written records.

, In the days following your transaction, keep an eye out for any irregular activity in your bank accounts. If you spot any, contact PayPal, eBay, or your local branch and report the circumstances.

Automate mundane business tasks.,
Find a niche.,
Write effective titles and sales copy.,
Find a back-end product.,
Use search engines to your advantage.",How to Avoid the Five Critical Mistakes eBay Business Owners Make," You need to work toward as much automation as possible. Otherwise, you’ll be strapped to your eBay business the same as any other 9-5 job. That’s not what you want. If you have the time consuming tasks of shipping, posting, ordering, etc. automated, you’re free to work on the business and not in the business. Working on the business is what grows it, while working in the business only maintains what you already have.;
, Many people make the mistake of selling anything and everything they can on eBay through only one user name. This is a mistake. You should have multiple user names- one for each specific niche you’re selling in. This way you can have perhaps five or ten user names all building feedback and credibility in their respective niches. Another advantage of niche marketing is that you can choose a username that goes with your niche.

, This is a big one. You need to make every auction you post as compelling as it can be. The title should be very clear as to what you’re selling. Don’t be misleading or confusing. If you’re selling new items in the box, be sure to put NIB in the title. The copy should be clear and easy to understand. Try to focus on the benefits of the product you’re offering instead of just the features. Utilizing sales copy tactics on eBay is just as important as on websites.

, If someone is happy with what you sell him or her, they’ll likely be willing to buy from you again. The trouble is, lots of eBay business owners don’t keep customer lists. This is a sin! You should collect all the info you can on your customers, then offer them products they are likely to be interested in. If someone buys a boat from you on eBay, you can then sell that person all the items they’re likely to need to operate the boat. Waxes, polishes, covers, motor oil, replacement parts, etc.

, Getting search engines to recognize your eBay stores is very important. Once the bots figure out you’re relevant to peoples’ needs they’ll start placing you higher up in the search results. Search engine optimization is a whole subject unto itself, which you should learn about to optimize your eBay business.

Set up a packing station.,
Do some label printing.,
Deliver.",How to Automate eBay Shipping (North America)," A great way to make wrapping and packaging easier and more effective is to set up a professional packaging station in your home. You'll find that having all your tape, boxes, cutters and other tools in one organized, well-lit work space can work wonders. Stick with this home wrapping station until you reach 5-10 sales a day. At this point you can hire someone to do your shipping for you.;
, Both UPS and the United States Postal Service offer quick and easy label printing. This allows you to print shipping labels directly from their website. Obviously, a lot easier than manually typing in customers addresses into a document then printing it.

, Delivery to the shipper is quite easy to time manage. Instead of sending out orders every day of the week, try shipping only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This will provide your customers with speedy shipping and greatly reduce the number of trips you need to take back and forth from your shipper. As time goes on, you can have an employee take over this task as well. Also, with shipping, USPS has a service where they will actually pick up your flat rate boxes that need to be shipped. You can look into this as well.

Do not sell anything on eBay that you cannot afford to lose.",How to Sell on eBay," To find eBay, simply use your favorite search engine and type in eBay. eBay tailors its site to countries all over the world, so make sure that you are looking at your country's eBay site. For people in the United States, it is www.ebay.com.


Check out eBay's seller information pages. These pages thoroughly discuss eBay's selling policies.
Experiment with eBay's search features, and browse a few listings. Knowing how eBay's search function works will help you make better listings.

Try changing the search results by changing the options in the ""Sort"" menu.
Keep a good eye on listings that appear at the top of the search results and those that appear to be receiving many bids.

;
, eBay can provide you with a name, but if you come up with an attractive name, it can increase the chances of selling. Avoid anything that is offensive or lowers the value of items you are selling. Per eBay's username policy:eBay usernames must have at least two characters and cannot contain symbols such as the at sign, ampersand (&), apostrophe, parentheses or less/greater-than signs, nor can they contain spaces or successive underscores. eBay usernames also cannot begin with a hyphen, period or underscore.
eBay does not allow the names of websites or email addresses as user IDs, nor does it allow anything with the word ""eBay"" or the letter ""e"" followed by several numbers. This avoids abuse by users who want to pose as eBay employees, or redirect customers to other, less reputable sites via eBay.
Don't use a trademarked name (such as a brand) unless you are the owner of it.
Names like ""iselljunk"" or ""chickmagnet69"" seem unprofessional and can repel buyers. Names that are hateful or obscene can be blocked by eBay.
Since so many people are already on eBay, spend some time checking that the name you want is actually available and come up with alternatives when your preferred name is already in use.
You can change your User ID later; however, you can only do this once every 30 days, and if frequently done, your repeat customers may be lost., Go to eBay's main page and look for the ""sign in"" link near the top of the page. Enter your name and a valid email address and choose a password (must have 6-64 characters and contain at least one letter and one symbol). You will be asked to choose a username after you do this.


eBay will send an email to the address you provided. Follow the instructions in the email to confirm your account.
If you have an existing business, you can also sign up for a business account. On the sign up page, click the link at the top of the registration page that says ""Start a Business Account."" You will be prompted to enter your business name and some additional contact information.

, Accepted payment methods vary by country. In the United States, sellers are required to accept PayPal or to have a merchant credit card account. Set up your PayPal account following the links from the eBay website, or visit www.PayPal.com.


Check eBay's accepted payments policies to find out what is allowed .

, One important way that ebay maintains itself as a safe marketplace is by encouraging buyers and sellers to leave feedback about each other. Buyers look at sellers' feedback ratings, and buying a few items is the quickest way to add positive ratings to your profile.


Try buying small items that you want or need anyway, and pay immediately to get good feedback as a buyer. Don't worry about buying things you can resell. The main thing is to establish yourself as a reliable member of the ebay community.
Potential buyers who see a new seller without feedback can be very wary that you're a ""fly-by-night"" seller, and they may hesitate to buy from you.

, It's not necessary to have a very elaborate profile if you are just selling small items, but adding a picture and some information can help reassure buyers that you are a legitimate seller.


For selling more expensive items, adding more information about yourself is more important, especially if you are a new seller.
People do read these to try to find out more about you, so it's a good place to explain your credentials, such as being a collector, a retailer, a person with knowledge of particular items, etc.

, eBay started out catering to hobbyists and collectors, and continues to be a great place to show off your stuff. If you are good at finding bargains or rare items in a particular category, consider specializing in items that you know a lot about.

, Obviously, illegal and hazardous items like human body parts, drugs, live animals and illicit services are not allowed. Other items may be sold, but are restricted, such as those sold in the ""adults only"" category. Check eBay's policies on banned and restricted itemsto avoid having your account suspended or even permanently banned.

, eBay places selling limits on new sellers, typically five items per month. If you're not sure what to sell, it's risky to build up inventory without conducting a few sales first. Try listing a few small items to get a feel for what sells and the logistics involved.


You can start by selling things you have around the house that you are no longer using, or by picking a few items to experiment with that you can either return or keep for yourself.
It's important to experiment before loading up on too much inventory. You may not be able to sell your items at a high enough price to make a profit, or you could end up with a lot of extra inventory that's hard to move.
If you already have some inventory from your existing collections or business, you're ready to go! Making a few sales can help you figure out the best approach to selling your goods on eBay.

, Often, what you sell is determined by what you can find. It can take time and effort to source things for eBay, so it's important to find a sourcing method that you enjoy and that you're comfortable with.


eBay itself can be a good place to find bargains. Some people look for items that are underpriced, badly presented or have misspelled titles.
If you enjoy thrift stores or garage sales, this is a great place to start. Just remember that you usually can't return what you buy, so you may end up with items that cannot sell.
Discount, warehouse and outlet stores are good places to find bargains, and often have a return policy you can take advantage of if your items don't sell.

, Remember, you have to take pictures, write descriptions, and figure out how to ship every single item you sell. This takes time, so it's more efficient to sell similar items, and items that are easy to photograph and describe.


Try to find things in bulk, or with similar features. That way you can create listing templates for yourself, or even just create one listing for multiple items.
Look for items that are easy to describe, photograph, and ship.
Look for items that you can easily ship in the same manner, so that you can pack things quickly and get bulk discounts on shipping materials.

, Bulky and heavy items can be difficult to make a profit on, because they can be expensive to ship, and take up a lot of space.


Buyers look at the total cost of the item, including shipping, so the shipping cost always has to be factored in when considering if an item can be sold at a reasonable price.
Think about space as an important issue. Working from home selling things can reduce overheads but if your stock starts taking over the space, your life won't be the same. Do you have room for your products and room to wrap, pack and store purchased items?

, Be aware that trends can pass quickly, leaving you with stale stock. For other items, you might have to wait longer for the collector or other interested buyer to turn up.

, Obviously, the more popular an item is, the more people will be searching and bidding for it. This requires a certain knack, and often successful sellers are people that intuitively know what will sell. However, eBay does have some tools for pinpointing what is popular.


Check out eBay's hot items page . Items commonly listed here include brand name clothing, electronics, gold jewelry, fashion accessories and football shirts.
Look at completed listings. This allows you to see how many of a particular item has sold, when they were sold, and how much they sold for. If you have the eBay app on your mobile device, this can be particularly useful if you're at a store or garage sale and are unsure about whether to buy something.

Type your query into eBay's search box, then check the boxes next to ""Sold listings"" or ""Completed listings"" in the ""Show only"" section of the menu on the left of the page.
For the mobile app, enter your search words, then tap ""Refine."" Check ""Completed listings"" or ""Sold items only"" under ""Search refinement options.""


You can use products built specifically for seller research, but you'll need to pay for these. Popsike.com is a free version dedicated for music sellers.
Be aware that if something is popular, there will be many sellers selling the very same things as you. It can be difficult selling in a category that is already saturated because it's so easy to get lost in the sheer number of search results, and prices are already so cheap that it's nearly impossible to make a profit as a small seller. Also, your low feedback rating puts you at a disadvantage. Popular items attract scammers who prey on inexperienced sellers who do not know how to protect themselves.

, Search eBay for items like those you want to sell, and read the listings, especially completed listings which have sold for a good price, or current listings that have attracted a lot of bids.


Take note of what sort of information or photos you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer – the same type of information will be helpful to your potential buyers.
Consider what makes you think a seller is trustworthy and how you will manage to convey that same sense of trustworthiness through your sales and profile.

,, The title is the front line in getting your auction noticed. A good title will not only give potential buyers enough information to know whether the listing is worth their time to look at, it will also attract people searching for your items.


Include all relevant words and spell them correctly. Insufficient information in a title will attract a far smaller number of potential buyers and/or bidders; consequently such an item will either not sell, or go for a much lower price than it would otherwise.
Keep the words relevant. Exclude fluff such as ""cool"" or ""excellent"". You have very little space, so use it for what people are searching for (nobody is going to be searching eBay for items titled ""L@@K"" or ""AWESOME!!!!"").
Include alternative spellings and phrasings if you have space. For example, if you're selling an iPod, put ""MP3 player"" in your title. However, eBay's search will automatically account for variant phrasings; it will also sometimes check category names in addition to the auction title. Do a search on specific terms and look at the titles of the auctions that come up.

, Photographs which clearly illustrate the item to be sold can make a listing; bad photographs can actually repel customers. Get a cheap digital camera or a camera phone if you don't have one already. You are required to include at least one photograph with your listing, and having more than one photo definitely boosts buyers' confidence. You can have up to 12 photos per listing.


Use good lighting. Where possible, turn off your flash and use natural light. Go outside, or take a photo by a window.
Rotate or crop any photos that might need it for a better appearance, and use photo editing software or eBay's photo editor to improve the picture.
Get as many photographs as your buyers will need. Take photographs of your item from every angle that you think someone will find useful. eBay offers 12 free photos on each listing.
Get photographs of any unusual feature, any defects, and so on. The extra confidence that this will give buyers is almost always (except on the lowest-valued items) worthwhile. Of course, some items only need one photo; use your judgment here.
Don't use a distracting or dirty background and get rid of any nearby clutter. A simple sheet of white paper may be used to provide a clean, neutral background for smaller items.
Don't copy photographs from other listings or anywhere else on the Internet, ever. Apart from being dishonest and fraudulent, this will almost always be copyright infringement; nearly everything on the Internet, and elsewhere, is copyrighted, whether it has a copyright notice or not.
See how to take better product photos for free for more ideas on producing good photos for eBay sales.

, Include any and all relevant information. This includes things like the manufacturer, compatibility (for items intended to be used with something else), size, weight, color, condition, measurements, and so on.


Be careful when adding too much information. A buyer can skim through information they do not need to know, but will likely hit the ""back"" button if they don't see the information they want. Extra information can also help search engines find your listing.
Put the most important information at or very near the beginning of the listing.
Keep the design simple, if you see the need to design a listing at all. Some sellers clutter their listings with unrelated elements that that it makes the listing itself more difficult to read, and display improperly on mobile devices. Let the pictures and your text speak for themselves.
Choose moderately large, easy to read text fonts for your listing and don't overdo animation, clashing colors and other distractions. Remember some buyers have poor eyesight and prefer large print. Think of ""large print books"" as an example of text size.
Be clear about any defects in the item. Buyers will find this out anyway, so let them decide for themselves what is a significant problem and what is not. Clearly describing an item's flaws helps protect you from Significantly Not As Described (SNAD) claims. However, if your item has flaws, consider not selling it at all on eBay. You don't want to get a reputation for selling junk. On negative feedback can seriously hurt or even destroy a small seller.

, You can choose whichever is convenient for you and best suited to your item


The online auction. Auctions last from 1-10 days, and can sometimes allow you to get a higher price for your item, because it encourages buyers to become competitive with each other, and enjoy the thrill of winning an item as much as the item itself.

This is good when you have something to sell that people frequently search for and seem inclined to fight over, such as a rare piece of sports memorabilia.
The auction format is also useful when you're uncertain as to what price you should sell at, and can help you determine the price for similar items in the future.


Buy It Now items are fixed-price items. They allow the buyer to buy something and have it shipped to them immediately, rather than having to wait for the auction to end.

This is great for items that people either buy routinely or on impulse, or for items where the supply already outstrips the demand, and where you want to offer a competitive price.
Items which people need immediately are unlikely to attract many bids in an auction.



, Remember that once someone buys an item from you or the auction ends, it constitutes a binding agreement to sell, and it is difficult to get past this unless both parties agree to cancel the sale. See how to determine what to price your eBay items for more details.


You can change the price at any time with fixed-price items, or before the first bid is placed for auction items.
Lower starting bids attract more bidders and interest in your item, and may well result in your item selling for more, but if an item doesn't generate enough interest or isn't visible enough, you may get a very low final selling price.
There is an option to set a ""reserve"" price for your item while offering a low starting bid, but eBay charges extra for this and some buyers find it annoying.
Don't overcharge for shipping and handling. While it's sometimes helpful to tweak the shipping price a bit to be able to offer a lower price, and account for handling and supplies, most buyers will be put off by obviously inflated shipping charges. These days, buyers expect free shipping, and eBay boosts items' visibility in the search if they offer free shipping. Unless your item is particularly heavy, increase your opening bid or Buy-It-Now price and offer free shipping.
Keep an eye on the invoices that eBay sends you and be a timely payer. You will owe commission fees and other fees over time from listing and you need to make regular, full payments in order to be able to continue listing your items for sale. While the fees might initially surprise you, treat them as very much a part of your business expenses and soon you'll remember that these need to come off the costs of your products and efforts.

, Auctions end 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10 days after you start them. When the auction ends and how long it lasts can make a difference in how much your item sells for. By scheduling your auction to end at a peak buying time, you can often get a higher selling price.


Auctions ending on weekends tend to catch high traffic, therefore increasing the chances of better end prices for your items.Many items are also seasonal, and so there are better times of the year to be selling these than other times of the year. For example, beach gear does better in summer while skis will do better in winter.
You can check out eBay's planned promotions for certain categories . Check this out and plan your sales for when these categories will be highlighted.

, Many sellers seem to go to extra efforts to intimidate potential customers; they seem to think it's essential to leave scream threats (invariably in huge, colored fonts) to report non-paying bidders, and so on. Don't do this! You wouldn't want to buy from a brick-and-mortar store wherein the owner watched you every move, nor would you want to shop at a store wherein the sales clerk complained about other customers. The Internet is no different; it's insulting to your potential buyers to treat them as potential thieves or wrongdoers; drop the bad faith approach.


If you must include additional information on your policies, ensure the length is shorter than your item description.
Consider offering a return policy. Not only does this help you to qualify for discounts on eBay, some sellers believe it makes buyers more likely to commit to buy. Very few buyers actually return their purchases, so you are likely to profit more from letting buyers feel secure than to lose money from returns. On the other hand, the discounts eBay gives to Top Rated Plus sellers who offer discounts is small enough that a single return can cost more than the monthly discount for small sellers. If you offer a return policy, all buyers are allowed to return everything they buy from you for any reason; you can never refuse a return, even for buyer's remorse. If you officially don't offer returns, you can still take them on a case-by-case basis.
Answer questions from your buyers as the auction runs its course. Be prompt about it, and always be patient, clear, professional and friendly. Buyers don't like to see unanswered questions and it impacts your professionalism, so don't hesitate to respond.

, Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the ""overview"" page) to double check and press ""Submit."" If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay.


Check your spelling. This won't make up for a bad listing in other respects, but it still goes some way. Proper capitalization and punctuation makes listings much easier to read.
Fix any mistakes. You can continue to fix mistakes in an auction until the first bid has been placed, after which, it is what it says!

, You'll get an idea of interest by watching the counter change and if few people are looking, you might need to make adjustments to the auction to make it more appealing to those browsing about the site. Learn by observing what works and does not work, and apply changes as needed.

]

End an auction if needed. You have the ability to end an auction up to 12 hours before it's due to end. This should be used very sparingly though, as watchers may well have been excited about making bids and will be disappointed to see this as habitual. Keep it for exceptional circumstances such as broken, lost or stolen items. Once you have listed products for sale, keep them in a safe place.
Lower the reserve price. Prior to the last 12 hours of an auction, it's possible to lower the reserve price if you find that you're not getting bids.
Keep an eye on buyers. It is possible to block some buyers for certain reasons such as buyers who don't have PayPal, buyers who are in countries you don't ship to and buyers with two or more unpaid item strikes. And you can also set up Approved Buyers lists that automatically allow some buyers to bid.

, Blog about your listings, for example, especially if you're an artist or crafter. Share them on Facebook and Twitter.

, People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, which in turn may make them more inclined to buy.

, Your feedback score is an oft-overlooked component of buying and selling on eBay. Buyers deciding between identical or near identical listings will usually opt for the one whose seller has a higher feedback rating. Boosting your feedback rating, as a result, is very important.

, This may be attractive if you want people to be able to search via your own distinct URL on search engines, you want to group sales items together under unique categories of your own making and if you want to build a really interesting profile for your regular and other buyers.

,,
Describe your item as if there were no pictures, and photograph your item as if there was no description.
Read a book on selling before you get started.

eBay is not a get-rich quick scheme. At best, eBay is a get-rich-slow scheme. Unfortunately, many new sellers get scammed and find it's a get-poor-quick scheme.
Do not open an eBay account to sell your iPhone or designer handbag. Professional scammers are looking for new sellers offering popular items, and they will take both your item and your money.

Decide the importance of customer service.,
Decide if e-banking is a priority.,
Compare the fees and interest rates associated with each bank.,

Decide based on investment options.,
Visit local bank branches or call an Internet bank before signing up.",How to Choose a Bank That's Right for You," Before shopping around for a bank, decide what you prefer, so that you will know which bank is right for you. Good things to consider are Automated Teller Machine (ATM) usage, low account balances, investment accounts, online banking, bill pay, credit cards and deposits.;
, If you do weekly deposits, then you may want to narrow down the potential choices to those banks that are close to home or work.


Many people do a good portion of their banking online, which could also be considered a location. If you almost never go to a brick and mortar bank branch, then consider using an online bank, rather than a local bank.

, Many banks have fees associated with use of ATM machines from another bank. Decide what banks have ATMs that would be convenient for you, so that you can avoid fees.


ATM usage should be gauged not only on your local usage, but also on your travel. If you do not travel often out of your own state, then choose a popular state bank with many local branches. If you travel frequently, then you might want to choose a national bank.

, Many credit unions have ways that you can speak to a local person quickly, if you have a banking problem. National banks often use calling centers, a frustration with some bank customers.

, Although most banks offer some sort of online banking, the sophistication of their banking websites will differ. Some credit unions or smaller banks may not have all the online options that a national bank can provide.

, Go online or go to branches and collect fees schedules.


Compare ATM fees, overdraft fees and low balance fees. Look for banks that provide free or very low payment checking accounts, low or no ATM fees. Compare savings interest rates, checking interest rates and investment interest rates. Also, see if there is an extra charge for checks or online banking.

, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides a report of many banks' financial outlook. Search their institution directory to find out about your possible choices.

, Many people are taking their money out of big banks that were involved with the sub-prime mortgage scandal and putting them in local banks or credit unions. It may be comfortable to know that your credit union uses your money to help local people finance their homes or cars.

, Although it is not necessary to keep a retirement account, certificate of deposit, or mutual fund through the same bank, it can make transfers extremely convenient. Many of the investment options require a high account balance.

, You want to make sure you are sure of the fees and schedules. Going into a bank will also help you get a feel for their customer service.

, Don't call a Used item Brand New or Mint.

, But keep it tight. Don't go on and on. You are writing an ad, not a novel.

, You don't have to be a pro, just take decent, clear photos. Photos do sell products. Some bidders will only look at the photos.

, You can develop trust and rapport with a simple webcam and voice -- just keep it personal and real. Highlight what YOU want the prospective buyer to see. Share details about the product that would otherwise go unnoticed in a flat photograph.

, Know what you are selling. Know comparable prices. Start your opening bid with a price you can live with and if you know your price is below other comparable models in similar condition, say so.

, Explain what makes it special. Is it one of a kind? Is it rare? Is it priced below market value? Whatever sets your item apart should be mentioned.

, Be specific. People look for specific items and get frustrated by looking at a ton of unrelated items. Help the right bidder find your item.

, Learn from them. Use the same or similar keywords. Again, help direct the bidders who want your item (or ones like it) to your ad.

, Tell bidders that you have related items on auction. This will encourage them to look at your other items and up your chances of multiple sales this way. Every related ad you have is just one more chance for a bidder to see all your items.

Watch both of your accounts for the next 30 days.",How to Close a Bank Account," Most traditional banks have both online services and physical locations. Some new financial institutions, however, offer only online banking options. Take the time to review the available resources and offerings at various banks.


Banks with “brick and mortar” branches can be more comfortable if you prefer to work with a live person and to have a physical location to deposit and withdraw your money.
Online banking can be efficient, especially if you are experienced with online banking and are used to paperless finances.
Consider non-traditional options, such as credit unions, money market mutual funds, and cash management accounts.;
, Paying close attention to the bank’s transfer fees, interest rates, your own typical expenditures will help you decide which financial institution makes the most sense for your money management style.


Consider the different types of accounts you need and whether the bank offers incentives, such as linking checking and savings.
Check the fees and locations for the bank’s ATMs to make sure you can access cash as you need it.Most banks require new customers to make a deposit of a particular amount, so make sure you have enough cash on hand.

, Direct payments, direct deposits and bill payments should be fully functioning at another location to avoid extra debts.Keep a record of the bank account and routing number of your primary account at your new bank.
Set up online banking with your new bank, if possible, so that you have quick access to your information and transactions.

, Request a change of Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) by filling out a form with all employers from the last year.


If you receive occasional payments by EFT from an employer, you should play it safe and ask them to update your account. A new deposit into a closed account requires some banks to reopen your old account.Remember to move any other automatic deposits, such as Social Security payments.Change the EFT account on your PayPal account, or other virtual wallets, if you use them frequently.

, Many banks will reopen a closed account if an EFT request comes in, and you’ll likely incur overdraft fees if your account was empty.Health insurance, rent and utilities are frequently sent by EFT.
Review your bank statements for the last year to determine what automatic payments are deducted from your account.

, Failure to stop these services could also result in overdraft fees, even after you have closed your account.


The terms and conditions of identity theft insurance, automatic transfer to an IRA or other services may require that you cancel each product individually.
Be mindful of any automatic transfers you have set up, such as transfers to external savings accounts from your checking account.

, Each organization that uses EFT may have a processing wait time of 30 days, although some may take extra time to process. Waiting will help also you avoid fees if you missed any automatic transactions.


If you are closing a certificate of deposit (CD) or money market account, you may be charged a fee to remove your money and close the account within 6 months to 5 years. These maturity dates require a commitment, or you may lose the interest you have accrued in addition to facing a fee.To be safe, leave some funds in your old checking account to cover any forgotten recurring transactions or outstanding checks., You should know exactly how much is in your account before you start the process. Download and print a bank statement from your online account.


If you believe you may have outstanding payments or uncashed checks, wait until the end of your monthly account cycle to check the balance.
Save this document for your records, just in case any questions or problems arise later.

, The Federal Reserve Board does not allow you to transfer money from your savings or money market account more than six times per month. Your bank may have a transfer or withdrawal limit on certain types of accounts.Call the customer number on the back of your ATM card to check on restrictions. You can also search for your bank’s customer service number online.
Transfers between accounts at the same bank count against the limit of 6, so avoid moving money before closing your account.

, You may be able to find this information online, but it’s wise to verify the information with a phone call to customer service. Banks have a variety of regulations and rules for transferring funds out of your account, especially if you’re emptying it.


Some online-only banks allow electronic transfers with no fees.
The amount of money you’re moving may affect the process; make sure you have the correct information about your situation.

, Use the information you learned about the procedure with your bank to decide if you need to transfer the money electronically, call customer service, or visit a bank branch.Visiting a branch, if your bank has one nearby, is often the most reliable option.


If you’re transferring your money in a bank branch, you’ll need your account number, bank number and routing number for your new account. You will usually be charged a percentage of the amount transferred by your bank.
Be sure to have your personal identification handy, such as your driver’s license, so you can verify your identity., Make sure you’ve verified the amount in your account, and then request a check for the balance of your account. Have it sent to your home address, with a signature required delivery confirmation, for your safety.Many banks only issue balance checks with cashier’s checks. If this is the case, there may be a charge associated with issuing the check, such as $25.Personal checks from your account may be less expensive, but cashier’s checks are deposited more quickly.Some banks offer a wire transfer, often for an even higher fee.If you’re moving from one online bank to another, you should be able to transfer the funds electronically without a physical check. You may experience a delay in the money’s delivery to your new account.

, Conduct a final check to make certain that all automatic transfers, payments, and services have been completed or moved.


Consider asking for an email or mail confirmation from the bank teller or customer service representative.
If you bank online, check your account.

, Once your money arrives, it’s important to have access to those funds right away. Watch your new account by checking online or calling your new bank’s customer service, to make certain your money is in the account and you can use it.

, After there are no funds remaining, you can close the account. You will need the approval of all the account holders to do this, so ask anyone else listed on the account to go to a branch location with you or stay nearby for approval by phone.


Use your bank’s online banking tool, or contact customer service, to check your account balance
If your final withdrawal is marked “Pending,” note the planned transaction date, and then check again.

, Since banks require a range of processes, take the time to make sure you understand your responsibilities, so that you don’t run into difficulties.Most banks do not allow online account closures, so be prepared to call customer service or visit a bank branch.
Some banks require special forms or letters that must be notarized., You should expect to receive an official letter showing that you closed your account, but it is better to ask. This letter should arrive in 5-10 business days.If you did not transfer your funds before closing your account you should also receive a check for the balance of funds remaining in your account.
Contact your bank if you don’t receive your closing documents in 5-10 business days. If these don’t arrive, chances are there is a problem with your account and it has remained open., Getting rid of these access points will help you to avoid accidental use, as well as potential fraud.

, Make sure your EFT, bill pay and other credits and debits are going in and out of the new account. Simple human error may delay the proper closing of your account."

Compare their sizes.,
Address membership concerns.,
Research the services they offer.",How to Choose a Bank or Credit Union That Is Right for You1," Banks can vary in size from small local banks to very large international corporations that are in hundreds of locations. Credit unions tend to be smaller and cater to a local community, rather than a national population.


Larger institutions tend to offer more services and features, while small institutions tend to offer more basic options.
For instance, a small institution might not be able to provide investment consulting or be able to exchange foreign currencies.;
, Credit unions are a member run not-for-profit financial institution. This means that the union's members govern the union, rather than it being governed by a large corporation. Credit unions often have membership requirements that determine eligibility.Banks do not have eligibility requirements like credit unions do. However, they are for-profit corporations that are run by shareholders.
Credit unions may have eligibility requirements based on the community you live in, your employer, occupation, religious institution, or membership to a fraternal organization.

, Credit unions and banks will offer different features, though at their core they are both financial institutions. For example, some smaller credit unions may not offer lending for mortgages like big banks do. You will need to make a list of the features that you consider important for your financial institution, and use this list to narrow your search.


If you want an institution that offers online or mobile banking, make that a priority in your search.
If you want to be able to use ATMs without fees, look for institutions that reimburse you for ATM fees or are part of a large ATM network.

Attach the collateral to the loan.,
Note the loan and security interest on the vehicle title.,
Complete the lien section on the Title Certificate.,
File the documents with the appropriate governmental office.",How to Secure a Promissory Note1," To “attach” collateral is a legal term that means you must identify the specific property that will be the collateral for the loan. A motor vehicle is pretty easy to identify, by its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and by a brief description of the make and model. As the lender, you will need to have your borrower sign a security agreement that contains this description and makes reference to the loan.A sample of a security agreement designed for a loan secured by a motor vehicle is available at http://www.ccclerk.org/SECURITY_AGREEMENT.pdf. (This particular sample is from the State of Ohio, but the general form is effective in any U.S. state.);
, For a loan secured by a motor vehicle, you must make note of the security interest on the actual Title Certificate itself. Each state will have a slightly different procedure for doing this. In general, you first need to obtain the original Title Certificate.The owner of the vehicle, who is borrowing the money, should have the Title Certificate. In some cases, if the owner already is paying on a first loan, and you are lending money as a second lien on the vehicle, then the first lienholder might have the Title Certificate. The borrower would have to contact the first lender to get the Title Certificate.

, On the back of the Title Certificate, you will find a section to report the details of your loan. You will provide the date, amount of the loan, and signatures of both the borrower/owner and the lender., In most U.S. states, to finalize the procedure of securing the promissory note with a motor vehicle, you must deliver the original Title Certificate and the signed security agreement to the DMV. The DMV will then create a new Title Certificate with the loan formally recorded on it. Some states will charge a fee for this.Check with your state’s local procedures. For example, in South Dakota, instead of the DMV, you will need to send the Title Certificate and security agreement to the county treasurer in the county where the vehicle owner resides. There is a $10 fee.In Tennessee, for example, you will need to send the financing statement and Title Certificate to the local County Clerk’s office. There is a fee of $11 for the lien notation and $5.50 for a state title fee. There also may be a local county fee."

Make copies of your letter.,
Mail your letter.",How to Write a Payment Demand Letter," A formal demand letter should be typed and sent on paper, rather than using email or sending a handwritten note, neither of which provide the same degree of seriousness and gravity.Most word processing applications have a business letter template that you can use. If you have letterhead or stationary, you may want to use that as well.
Use a standard, legible font such as Helvetica or Times New Roman, and make sure your pages are set for one-inch margins on all sides (more at the top if you need to make room for letterhead).
The body of your letter typically is single spaced, with a double space between paragraphs. The double-space between paragraphs indicates a block style, which means paragraphs themselves usually aren't indented.;
, You must have the correct name and mailing address of the person from whom you're demanding money. if the situation escalates to the point that you have to file a lawsuit, you'll need this information so you know where to have the complaint served.If you're sending the letter to another individual, finding his or her address may be relatively easy. However, if you're sending the letter to a business owner, you may want to check the state business registry at the website of your state's secretary of state to get the correct legal business name and address.
You'll need this information anyway if you end up filing a small claims suit, so you might as well get it ahead of time and send your letter to the correct party.
The name and address of the person to whom you're sending the letter should be typed single-spaced on the left-hand side of the page, typically immediately under the date of the letter.

, There's no point in sending a payment demand letter without providing multiple ways for the person to get in contact with you and send you the money he or she owes.Your own name and address typically are typed above the name and address of the person to whom you're sending the letter, and are right-justified. Your word processing application's business letter template should format your text this way automatically.
If you are using letterhead that includes your name, address, and other contact information, you typically don't have to create a duplicate block with the same information.
In addition to including your name and address at the top of your letter, you probably also want to include the same information in the last paragraph, as well as alternative means of getting in touch with you such as a phone number or an email address.

, Begin your letter by providing a summary of what happened, and the specific reason you are writing and demanding payment. Include as many facts and specific details of the incident as you have.Tell the story of the dispute chronologically, sticking to facts rather than your opinion as to what happened or any speculation as to what the other person was thinking or why the incident took place.
This is your opportunity to lay out the incident that gave rise to the dispute as clearly as possible. In the event you file a small claims lawsuit, these facts will become the statement of your case against the person who owes you money.
If you dealt with employees of the person to whom you're writing your letter, include their names if you know them. If you don't, simply refer to them by their roles or job titles rather than attempting physical descriptions, which can be faulty and lapse into subjective assessments that may be inaccurate.
Maintain a polite and professional tone, and avoid insulting or talking down to the person. Keep in mind that if you end up filing a complaint in small claims, this letter likely will be read by the judge.

, If you've previously talked with the person, or one of his or her employees, include a brief account of those conversations, and how they led to your decision to write this formal demand letter.A big part of the reason to include this information is to preserve a written account of what has transpired after the initial incident leading up to the moment you decided you needed to take further action to collect the money.
Including this information sets the stage for a lawsuit should you have to file one, by summarizing the efforts you have made to collect the money prior to going to small claims.
This summary also may help impress upon the person to whom you're writing the letter the seriousness of the situation and the efforts you've made to pursue payment.
As with your description of the initial incident, keep your account brief and stick to the facts, including as many specific details as possible.

, Start a new paragraph and make a direct and specific demand for the amount of money you are owed. Let the person know if you are open to negotiation or willing to consider a settlement, but avoid providing any specifics about the range of money you are willing to accept.Depending on the situation, you may need to provide a brief calculation to show how you arrived at the amount you believe is due. For example, if the person borrowed $200 from you, and has made two payments of $25 and one payment of $10, you might acknowledge the three payments (and the dates they were received), and conclude that the person owes you $140, or $200 minus $60 worth of payments made.
If you are open to payments in kind of some other solution other than payment of money, you should mention that as well. For example, if you are asking for your money back from a mechanic who failed to properly repair your car, you may be open to the mechanic's offer to fix your car, or provide other services in the future in lieu of a full refund.

, Provide a reasonable amount of time for the person to get back to you and resolve the situation, and explain what will happen if you don't hear from the person or receive the money you are owed within that time period.A good deadline typically is a week to 10 days from the date the letter is received. If you send the letter using certified mail with return receipt requested, you will receive a notice in the mail when the person has received your letter, and you can mark the due date on your calendar.
State that if you don't hear anything from the person by that deadline, you will file a lawsuit in small claims court to recover the amount of money he or she owes you.
You also may want to remind the person that a court judgment will appear on his or her credit report, and may negatively impact his or her credit score.

, Once you've finished drafting your letter, check it carefully to ensure there are no typos or errors in grammar and punctuation, and that it will print properly.You also may want to edit your letter for length, particularly if it is more than two pages long. Although there's no rule that specifies how long your letter should be, it shouldn't be any longer than is necessary to tell your story.
Make sure your descriptions are as concise as possible, and clearly state the facts of the incident and the demand you are making as a result.
When you're satisfied that your letter says everything you want to say and is error-free, print it up and sign it using blue or black ink.

, Before you mail your letter to the person, make at least one copy of the signed letter so you have it for your records. File it together with any other documents such as receipts that are related to the dispute.The file that you create should include everything related to the particular dispute. This way if you do end up having to file a complaint in small claims court, you will already have all the information you need together in one place.
If there are any supporting documents such as receipts, invoices, or cancelled checks that you want to include with your letter, make copies of them to enclose – don't send your originals.

, Send the original, signed copy of the letter using certified mail with returned receipt requested, so you will be notified when your letter is received.Keep all your mailing receipts and notices in the same file with your copies of your letter and other documents or notes related to the dispute.
Any other correspondence with the person who owes you money also should be included in this file. If the person calls you, take notes during the conversation.
Immediately after the phone call, type up a summary of the discussion and send the person a letter confirming what was discussed. State in that letter that unless you hear otherwise by a specified date, you will assume that your summary of the conversation is accurate.
While you're waiting for a response, you may want to go ahead and get a complaint form for the small claims court in your county. Most courts make these forms available online, or you can stop by the clerk's office in the courthouse and pick one up.

Learn the benefits of credit unions.,
Determine eligibility.,
Assess their accessibility.,
Choose an insured credit union.,
Ask about banking procedures.,
Compare interest rates.,
Look into fees.",How to Choose a Bank or Credit Union That Is Right for You2," Credit unions are not-for-profit institutions that are often cooperatives managed by their members. They often have lower rates than banks, lower interest rates, and more satisfied members.However, credit unions may be limited in the number of services that they can offer, have eligibility requirements for membership, and may not be in accessible locations.

, Some credit unions limit their membership to certain companies, occupations, certain affiliations, or industries. While credit union eligibility has expanded in recent years, you will need to speak with a credit union representative to make sure that you are eligible to open an account there.


You may also be eligible to join a credit union if your spouse or parent is a member at that union.
The credit union representative will be able to tell you if you are eligible to join that particular union based on your occupation and membership affiliations to partnership organizations, like a fraternal order or the military.
If you are ineligible at that credit union, you’ll have to look for different unions to join.

, One reason that credit unions are typically less popular is that they are intended to serve a local area so they can be less accessible when you’re outside that network. However, many credit unions are part of co-ops or shared networks that allow members to deposit and withdraw from their accounts at any of the member institutions.


Ask if they are a member of a shared branch network. There are often fewer locations for credit unions than there are for banks.With a shared branch network, you can go to any of the member credit union locations to access your account.
Ask whether they belong to an ATM network. If they are, you can withdraw or deposit money at different ATMs even if they aren’t specific to your credit union., Credit unions that are insured are able to pay back members if the credit union happens to fail. The National Credit Union Administrationis the independent federal agency that regulates and charters federal credit unions. Nearly 98% of all credit unions in the US are regulated and insured through the NCUA. Check to see if your national government regulates credit unions through a similar agency.Like the FDIC, the NCUA has a searchable database that provides information about the size, financial health, and their insurance status.Use this resource to research credit unions in your area.

, Here, you’ll need to see whether the credit union offers the services that are important to you. You can ask whether they offer online banking, 24 hour support, or financial and investment services. If a credit union doesn’t offer a particular service, you might consider it to be a deal breaker. If you can live without this service, keep the credit union on your list of potential institutions.While you can likely find the information you want on the credit union’s website, it’s easier to speak with a credit union representative and ask them your specific questions.

, Most credit unions offer competitive interest rates that are better than banks. They also tend to offer higher savings rates. Ask the credit union about the rates that they offer and use that information to compare unions.Over time, fewer banks and credit unions are offering interest-yielding bank accounts. However, credit unions are still more likely to offer competitive rates to their members.

, Across the board, credit unions tend to have lower fees than big banks. You will want to find out whether there are fees associated with going below a certain account balance, if checking accounts are free, if there are monthly account maintenance fees, and if there are overdraft fees.


Take careful notes about what these fees are and how much they will cost you. Factor in this information when you are comparing credit unions.
Keep in mind that some fees will not apply to you. For example, if you never use ATMs an ATM fee won’t make any significant difference in your decision.

Do you visit the bank/credit union weekly or do you mostly do your banking online? If you make frequent visits to your financial institution, then you will likely want to choose one with a convenient location and/or multiple locations.

, If you prefer to do your banking business from your computer, you should consider a bank that offers this capability. You will be able to find out whether a bank offers online banking by visiting their website or talking with a bank representative.


There are also online banks that do not have traditional brick and mortar locations. These banks are entirely online and offer some of the same services that a traditional bank does. This might be a good option for you if you do most, or all, of your banking online already.

, You want to choose a bank that does not charge monthly maintenance fees, has low overdraft fees, and doesn’t have a minimum balance requirement. Big banks are notorious for charging fees that their customers are unaware of when they open accounts. Rather than learning later on that you’re being charged hidden fees, investigate fees while you’re choosing a bank.Choose a bank that does not charge monthly maintenance fees for having an account. Some fees are avoidable, like if you use direct deposit.
You also want to find a bank that doesn’t have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that is very low. When you go under this amount, or you overdraft on your account, you do not want your bank to charge you expensive overdraft fees.

, Like with a credit union, banks will offer different rates for interest-bearing accounts. While these interest rates have become increasingly small over time, they can pay off if you keep a significant amount of money in a savings account.Keep in mind that the bank might require that you maintain a certain account balance in order to be eligible for their advertised interest rate. If your account goes below this amount, you would become ineligible to accrue interest., If you use an ATM frequently to access your account or withdraw money, look for an institution with a wide ATM network. Be sure to ask about their policies regarding using an ATM in a different network — some banks may charge a fee if you use an ATM that is no in their network.


Some banks will reimburse the fees you are charged for using another bank’s ATM, or are part of an ATM network that allows you to withdraw or deposit money at a large number of different ATMs., Bank guarantees ensure that if the bank were to fail, you would receive your money back. This is especially important in a recession or a volatile economy, where it can be hard to feel confident that your money is safe. Check to make sure the bank is insured, and see whether they have any limits on insured account amounts.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a federal agency that regulates nearly every bank. You can also search their institution directory to find a report of the bank’s financial outlook.Check with your nation’s Department of Treasury or Finance to see whether there is a comparable agency that guarantees insurance."

Begin by having the borrower sign a loan agreement or promissory note.,
Have the borrower sign a mortgage agreement.,
File the mortgage and loan agreement with the appropriate office.",How to Secure a Promissory Note2," A promissory note is just another term for a loan agreement. Under either title, this is a contract that identifies the loan given to the borrower and specifies the terms of repayment., A mortgage is a legal term used to describe an agreement between the parties that certain real estate will be given as collateral to secure a loan. The simplest mortgage just needs to identify the parties, describe the loan, and identify the property. Depending on the amount of the loan and the identities of the parties, some mortgage documents can become quite complicated.Some online resources exist to help you create your own mortgage agreement. One such resource is Rocket Lawyer, which provides templates that are valid for most U.S. states. You simply identify your state, provide the details of your loan, and the program creates a mortgage document for you.
You should have the mortgage witnessed and notarized. In some states, this is a requirement, such that failure to do so will nullify the mortgage. In others, it may not be required but is still a good practice.

, To finalize the secured loan with the real estate collateral, you must file the completed mortgage and loan agreement with a state office where the property is located. The requirements for filing differ from state to state. You should check with a local attorney or the secretary of state’s office for the state where the property exists to determine the appropriate filing method.For example, in Massachusetts, the loan documents are filed with the Registry of Deeds in the county where the property is located.
In Connecticut, mortgages are recorded with the town clerk where the property exists.
In New York, you must file the mortgage with the county clerk for the county where the property exists.

Attach the loan to some company assets.,
Identify the collateral carefully.,
Perfect the security interest by filing the loan documents with the appropriate office.,
Take possession of the collateral to perfect a security interest.,
Take legal control of the collateral to perfect a security interest.",How to Secure a Promissory Note3," If you are giving a loan to a company or to an individual who is operating a business, you may want to secure your loan with some property of the business. This may include the company’s own equipment, inventory that it has for sale, or even something less tangible, like its accounts receivable. To attach the loan to any such property, you will need to have the owner sign a financing statement, which is sometimes also referred to as a “UCC” or “UCC-1” statement. A sample UCC-1 is available at http://www.fullertonlaw.com/docs/appendices/17-UCC-1_financial_statement.pdf.Be careful that the individual or company signing the financing statement is the actual owner of the collateral. For example, if you are giving a loan to John Smith, an individual, and John Smith is the president of XYZ Corporation, you will need to identify carefully whether the collateral is owned by John Smith or by XYZ Corporation. The person or company giving the collateral should be the same as the person or company getting the benefit of your loan.

, To complete the financing statement, you need to identify the parties to the loan and provide an adequate description of the collateral. The description must be sufficiently clear so that any third party reading the financing statement will understand what it is meant to cover.For example, if you intend to secure the loan with a particular photocopy machine that the borrower owns, you should identify it by description, make, model, and even serial number, if possible. On the other hand, if you intend to secure the loan with all of the borrower’s office equipment, you may use a more general description, such as “Equipment.” Other general descriptive terms that are allowable are “Goods,” “Inventory,” or “Fixtures.”
You can describe intangible business assets as “Accounts,” which includes the borrower’s right to receive payments from its customers, “Chattel paper,” which includes other secured loans that the borrower may have the right to collect, or “General intangibles,” which simply includes other intangible assets that are not covered by the first two categories.

, The most common and most effective method of perfecting a security interest in tangible or intangible business assets is by filing the security agreement and financing statement. Each state has different regulations for the proper filing location. You will need to check with the Secretary of State’s office for the state where your borrower is located, in order to determine the correct place and method for filing. If your borrower operates in multiple states, you may need to file your loan documents in more than one state. In some states, you may be required to file with the Secretary of State, generally in the state capital, and also file in the clerk’s office for any county within the state where the borrower does business.It is a good idea to work with an attorney who is familiar with the laws of the state where you wish to perfect your security interest, in order to be sure that you file appropriately.
If you neglect to file your loan documents in the appropriate offices, you may lose your position of priority. The borrower will still owe you the money, but if another lender files in a place where you have not, then that lender may be able to collect the collateral before you.

, A second method, which may be more difficult than filing, is to take actual possession of the collateral. This is often referred to as repossession. You must be careful, if using this method, that you do so in a peaceful and lawful manner. You may not break in to a property to take possession of collateral, and you may not take possession in such a way that creates a disturbance., A final alternative for perfecting a security interest in property is to take “control” over the collateral. This does not require actual possession of the property, but it does require you to take sufficient legal steps so that you control what can be done with the collateral. This method generally applies to intangible assets like accounts receivable, deposit accounts or investment accounts."

Attach the loan to some identified collateral.,
Complete a financing statement to attach the collateral to the promissory note.,
Perfect your security interest.",How to Secure a Promissory Note4," If you are lending to an individual, you may wish to secure your promissory note with some of that person’s personal property. Personal property can be anything that is not a motor vehicle or real estate. This could include anything of sufficient value, such as a big screen television, bank accounts, valuable antiques, or anything else you identify., To attach the loan to any personal property, you will need to have the borrower complete a financing statement, which is sometimes also referred to as a “UCC” or “UCC-1” statement. A sample UCC-1 is available at http://www.fullertonlaw.com/docs/appendices/17-UCC-1_financial_statement.pdf.The financing statement requires you to provide the borrower’s name and address, the lender’s name and address, and a description of the collateral. The description must be specific enough to identify the property for any third party.

, To perfect a security interest in personal property, the most common method is to file the loan documents with the secretary of state’s office in the state where the borrower resides. Depending on the laws of your state, you may also need to file in the county clerk’s office or in some other location. You should check with an attorney or the secretary of state to verify the filing requirements for your state.As with business loans, you may also perfect your security interest by taking possession or control over the collateral. If using one of these methods, you must do so in a peaceful and lawful manner. You may not break in to someone’s home to take possession of any property or take any action that causes a public disturbance.

File an appeal, if necessary.",How to Sue an Abusive Debt Collector," Federal law strictly limits what a debt collector can do when collecting a debt. For example, federal law prevents the debt collector from doing the following:Calling you at unreasonable times. This will depend on your schedule. If you work at night, then a phone call at 3:00 pm when you are asleep could be unreasonable. Generally, the law assumes any call before 8:00 am or after 9:00 pm is unreasonable.
Threatening violence or using violence.
Threatening that you’ll be sent to jail because of the debt.
Using profane or obscene language.
Claiming that you owe more than you do. Also, a debt collector cannot add unauthorized interest, charges, or fees to the amount that you owe.
Claiming to be a lawyer when they are not.
Contacting third parties about the debt. Debt collectors are strictly limited in who they can talk to about your debt. They can talk to your lawyer, and they can ask other people if they know where you are. But they can’t discuss your debt with unauthorized people.;
, You should always write down the day and time of any phone call.You can use this information later at trial.


Also write down the substance of each conversation. If the debt collector threatens you or uses other abusive language (such as profanity or slurs), then you should record that information as well.
Note whether the debt collector identifies themselves as a debt collector when they call.

, You should tell the debt collector to stop calling you.If the debt collector ignores your request, then you have strong evidence of abuse.


You should probably send a letter. In the letter, you should state the dates the debt collector has contacted you. Also include a clear request: “Please stop all communication with me and with this address about this debt.”
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has sample letters that you can use at their website.Make sure to mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested. This way you can show that the debt collector received your letter.

, You can sue for compensation for any injury that you have suffered as a result of the abusive debt collection. You can be compensated for the following:


Medical or mental health treatment. If the behavior was so abusive that you fell sick or needed counseling, then you can get compensated.Lost wages. The debt collector might have illegally called your boss to report the debt. If you lost your job as a consequence, you can be compensated for lost wages.Get a copy of your W-2 or tax returns which show how much you were paid.

, The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is the federal law prohibiting abusive, deceptive, and unfair collection practices. It covers debt incurred by consumers for personal, family, or household purposes. The federal definition of ""debt collector"" includes any person who regularly collects consumer debts for another person or who collects debts for themselves under a name other than their own. Therefore, people who collect their own debts or who do not regularly collect debts are not covered by the FDCPA. The FDCPA prohibits harassing or abusive practices, false or misleading representations, and unfair practices.


Federal law will preempt any state law that is inconsistent with it. However, if a state law is more protective than federal law, the state law will not be preempted.For example, a state law like California's Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (RFDCPA) is not preempted because it is more protective than the FDCPA. Unlike the FDCPA, the RFDCPA covers more than just collection agencies. It also covers original creditors. The RFDCPA prohibits similar actions that the FDCPA prohibits., The FDCPA allows you to get your attorneys’ fees paid by the debt collector if you win your lawsuit.In addition, many state laws have similar provisions (e.g., Texas). The Texas law, for example, also limits a defendant's ability to recoup attorneys' fees to circumstances where it is determined that you filed your case in bad faith or for the purpose of harassing., Small claims courts are designed for people representing themselves. You do not need a lawyer because the process is usually simplified. In fact, lawyers are prevented from appearing in some small claims cases.


However, if you have a strong case or if the law you are suing under allows you to recoup attorneys' fees, you should not go to small claims court and you should instead file in state or federal court.
In addition, small claims courts are not well versed in applying federal laws. Therefore, if you are going to file your lawsuit under the FDCPA, you should not file in small claims court.

, You need to meet with a lawyer before filing the lawsuit. A lawyer can answer any questions that you have and can advise you about building the strongest case possible. In addition, collectors will usually stop the abuse as soon as they hear you are being represented. Be sure to ask the lawyer whether your case should be filed under a state or federal statute. Although you could hire a lawyer to do everything for you, you can also pay the lawyer just for advice.


To find a lawyer, you can contact your state or local bar association and ask for a referral.
For more tips, see Find a Debt Relief Lawyer.

, In order to file suit in federal court, you will either need to sue under the FDCPA or you will have to have diversity jurisdiction. To have diversity jurisdiction, you and the debt collector will have to be residents of different states. If you have diversity jurisdiction, you can sue under your state's law and still be in federal court.


If you cannot get jurisdiction in federal court, or if your state's laws are more protective, you should file in state court. For example, if you live in California, you may want to sue under the RFDCPA in state court.

, You will start the lawsuit by filing a “complaint” with the court. The complaint identifies the parties to the lawsuit (you and the debt collector) and explains the factual circumstances of the dispute.You also tell the court how much you are suing for.


Most courts have “fill in the blank” complaint forms for you to use. Small claims courts especially should have these forms. Stop into the court clerk’s office and ask if a form is available.
If no form is available, then ask the clerk if there is a sample you can use as a guide for drafting your own. You may need to look in a book or CD of legal forms.

, You should either print neatly or enter the information on the form using a typewriter. Each court’s form will be different, but they will generally ask for the following information:your name and address
the debt collector’s name and address
the amount you are suing for
a description of the abusive practices
the harm you suffered
the law which authorizes your lawsuit
whether you want a jury or not

, After you finish the complaint, you should make several copies. Take the original and your copies to the court clerk and ask to file. The clerk should stamp your copies with the date.


Typically, you have to pay a filing fee. This amount will differ depending on the court. If you cannot afford the fee, then ask for a fee waiver form. The clerk should be able to give it to you.

, You need to send the debt collector notice that you filed the lawsuit. You can provide this notice by sending a copy of your complaint and a summons, which you get from the court clerk. You can generally make service in a variety of ways:


Have someone 18 or older (who is not part of the lawsuit) hand-deliver the complaint and summons to the debt collector.Have the sheriff hand-deliver it for a fee. You should be able to schedule service with your court clerk.
Hire a private process server to make hand delivery. You can find process servers online or in your phone book. Typically, they charge $45-75 per service.Mail the documents. In some courts you can send a copy of the complaint and summons by certified mail.Other methods. Ask the court clerk for all acceptable methods of service.

, Whoever makes service needs to complete a form proving that they made service. This will be called a Proof of Service, Affidavit of Service, or something similar. You can get the form from your court clerk and give it to the server.After making service, the server fills out the form and returns it to you. You then need to file it with the court.
Be sure to keep a copy for your records.

, The debt collector will likely answer your complaint within a certain time frame (usually within 30 days) after they are served. Their response may come in various forms, but most commonly the response will be a general answer or denial. When you get their response, analyze it to determine your course of action.


An answer contains admissions or denials to each one of your complaint claims. It will also include all of the defenses they are raising as well as the statement of facts as they perceive them.
A general denial is a simple, one sentence response, denying all of the allegations. It may also include affirmative defenses and a statement of facts as well., Once you receive the debt collector's response, a period of discovery will begin. During this period, you and the other party will have an opportunity collect facts, get witness statements, find out what the other side is going to say at trial, and get any other information that may be pertinent to the case. In general, you will be able to use the following tools to help you:


Informal investigations, which will include interviewing witnesses and gathering public documents.
Interrogatories, which are written questions that another party is required to answer. These statements are made under oath and can be used in court.
Depositions, which are formal interviews with witnesses or parties. The interviews are conducted under oath and can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which are formal requests sent to the other party asking them to produce private documents. These might include emails, text messages, or internal memos.
Subpoenas, which are court orders requiring someone to do something., The defendant will almost always file a motion for summary judgment as soon as the discovery phase is over. This motion will ask the court to decide the case in the defendant's favor, before a trial, because there is no genuine issue of material fact and they are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. To defend against this motion, you will need to provide evidence and affidavits that tend to prove that there are disputed facts and that the law could go wither way.


A judge will view all assumption in your favor. Therefore, all you need to show is that there could be a potential factual or legal issue during the trial. If you can do this, a judge will deny their motion and you will move forward., If the case is still moving forward, now may be a good time to attempt a settlement. Going to trial can be a time-consuming and expensive proposition, and settling may get you the relief you want. You should try to speak with the other party about what you need in order to resolve the case. If you cannot come to an agreement, you may try mediation or arbitration.


During mediation, a neutral third party will work with you and the debt collector on finding common ground. In doing so, the mediator will try to foster an agreement.
During arbitration, a neutral third party will act as more of a judge. They may listen to both sides and examine the strength of each party's case. In addition, they may recommend a settlement based on what they hear.

, If you or the debt collector chose to have a jury, then your first order of business is to select the jury. Jury selection is called “voir dire.”During voir dire, the judge calls a panel of jurors to sit in the jury box. The judge then asks the prospective jurors basic personal questions.


For example, the judge will probably ask if the prospective juror knows either you or the debt collector. Jurors are also asked about their jobs and hobbies.
If you don’t think that one of the prospective jurors can be fair, then you should ask the judge to dismiss the juror. This is called a dismissal “for cause.”
You also will be given a certain number of “peremptory challenges.” With these, you can dismiss the juror without having to give the judge a reason. However, you can’t use peremptory challenges in a way that discriminates on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex.You might want to use a peremptory challenge to exclude anyone who works in a financial institution (such as a bank) or for a credit card company. These people might be sympathetic to the debt collector.
Unless you or the debt collector dismisses a prospective juror, that juror becomes part of the jury.

, You will start the trial by making an opening statement. In small claims court, the judge might ask you to just dive in and start describing your case. However, if you have a jury, then you will probably make an opening statement.


Keep your statement brief. Jurors do not have long attention spans. If possible, limit your opening statement to fifteen minutes or less.
Tell the jury what evidence you will present. An opening statement is your chance to present a road map of what your evidence will be.You will present evidence of the collector’s abusive behavior. In your opening statement, you should mention this abuse: “As the evidence will show, the defendant threatened the plaintiff with going to prison. And as the evidence will further show, the defendant even called the plaintiff’s boss to talk about the debt.”

, As the person bringing the lawsuit, you can call witnesses first. You don’t have to call any witnesses. In a lawsuit for abusive debt collection, you might not have anyone to call.


However, if the debt collector called your boss, relatives, or friends, then you could have them testify as to the date and time of the conversation. Get them to repeat what the debt collector said to them. It is illegal for the debt collector to tell these people about your debt.
For tips on how to question witnesses, see Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself.

, You will probably want to testify. Specifically, you can testify about what the debt collector said and how it made you feel. To be an effective witness, remember these tips:Sit up straight and look at the lawyer who is asking you questions. When you answer, turn to the jury and make eye contact.
Stay calm. A rattled witness comes across as unbelievable. Don’t get into an argument with the debt collector’s lawyer. Instead, take a deep breath before answering a question. If you need a break, tell the judge.
Listen closely to the questions. You don’t want to answer a question that wasn’t asked.
Never guess at an answer. Simply say, “I’m sorry, I don’t know” or “I can’t remember.”

, The debt collector might also call witnesses. You can approach cross-examination in a couple of different ways.


You might not want to ask the witness any questions. For example, a witness might not have any damaging information. Instead, the debt collector might simply call a witness to establish basic facts about your debt, such as how much you owe. You don’t need to always ask a witness questions.
You could also try to “impeach” the witness. This means to undermine the witness’s credibility. You could do that by showing that the person is biased. For example, if the debt collector has an employee testify, you can highlight that the witness works for the debt collector.

, After all evidence has been presented, you can make a closing argument to the jury. The purpose of the closing argument is to tie together all of the evidence and tell the jury how the evidence supports your case.Remember to refer back to specific pieces of evidence. The jury might have forgotten the evidence they were shown early in the trial. Explain to the jury the significance of the evidence.
For example, you could say, “I showed you the phone log which listed all of the phone calls the defendant made. Do you remember how many calls he made? Twenty-eight. And about half of those were after 9:00 pm. That many phone calls, that late at night, is clearly abusive and against the law.”

, The judge will give the jury its instructions and then send them out of the courtroom to deliberate. If you do not have a jury, then the judge should announce the verdict after both sides make closing arguments.

, If you lost, you might want to file an appeal. You shouldn’t wait too long. Depending on the court, you need to file for an appeal shortly after judgment is entered—sometimes in as little as 10 days.There are pros and cons to bringing an appeal. If the judge made a mistake at trial, or if the jury got the case totally wrong, then you can win an appeal and get a new trial. An appeal might be the only way to get compensation for the abuse you have suffered.
There are also negatives. For one, you will need a lawyer to help you draft a legal brief. Appeals are technical, and you probably can’t learn the rules on your own. Also appeals can take up to a year to be resolved.
If you want to file an appeal, then ask the clerk for a Notice of Appeal form and fill it out.

Wait for the verdict.",How to Sue a Debtor," You need to prove to a judge that the debtor owes you money. In order to do that, you should produce a contract. Typically, contracts are written and will state how much the debtor borrowed from you.


Look in your papers for a contract or a “promissory note” (which is the equivalent of a contract). It should be signed by the debtor.
If you had an oral contract, then you will need to prove that the contract existed using other evidence. For example, if the debtor made regular payments before stopping, then these payments are some proof of the existence of a contract between you.
You can also prove an oral contract with testimony. You can testify as to how much was lent and how much time the borrower had to pay you back. You can bolster your case with testimony from other witnesses who heard you make an oral contract.;
, You should figure out how much of the loan the debtor has paid off. With luck, you have kept detailed books and entered each payment, including the date and the amount paid.


If you haven’t kept detailed records, then you should find proof of payments made. For example, get copies of cancelled checks or receipts for cash payments.

, Before suing, you need to know how much you can sue for. Generally, you can sue for the following:


the amount the debtor borrowed which is unpaid (this is the principal)
any reasonable interest

, After you calculate how much the debtor owes, you should send a demand letter to the debtor. You want to do this before filing your lawsuit because it gives the debtor one more chance to pay the debt.


In your demand letter you should give the debtor a deadline for paying. Tell the debtor what methods of payment are acceptable (cash, personal check, etc.) and where those payments can be sent. Also make sure to threaten to sue if you are not paid in a timely manner.A sample demand letter is provided by the New York Courts System at https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/6jd/forms/Local/City/DemandLetter.fillable.pdf. Be sure to revise it to suit your situation.
Send the letter to the debtor certified mail, return receipt requested. Hold onto the receipt; it is proof that the debtor received your letter.
You should limit your collection efforts to just the demand letter. You don’t want the debtor to complain that you have been harassing them. One demand letter, with a clear threat to sue, should be sufficient.

, You can’t sue the debtor just anywhere. Instead, you are limited in the counties where you can sue the debtor. Generally, you can sue:in the county where the debtor lives
in the county where you signed the contract
in the county where the debtor does business

, You might be able to sue in small claims court, depending on how much you are suing for. States have different maximum amounts you can sue for in small claims.


Small claims court has many benefits. For example, you don’t need a lawyer. The process has been streamlined so that you can handle the lawsuit yourself. Also, small claims courts tend to have more convenient hours of operation.One negative about small claims court is that you sometimes can’t have a jury. If you want a jury, then you might have to sue in regular civil court.

, You start a lawsuit by filing a “complaint.” This document identifies the parties and explains the facts surrounding the lawsuit. You also state how much you are suing for.Most courts have “fill in the blank” complaint forms you can use. Stop into your court and ask the clerk if there is a form.

, Enter the information using a typewriter or by printing neatly using black ink. Provide all information requested. Each court’s form will differ slightly, but each should ask for the same general information:your name and address
the debtor’s name and address
the amount owed
your lawyer’s name, if you have one

, Make several copies of your complaint. Take the original and all copies to the court clerk’s office. Ask to file the original. The court clerk should stamp all copies with the date.


You will probably have to pay a filing fee. The fee will vary by court. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask the clerk for a fee waiver form and fill it out.

, You have to give the debtor notice that you have filed the lawsuit. You can do this by sending a copy of your complaint to the debtor. You will also have to send a “summons,” which is a legal document you can get from the court clerk. Generally, you can serve notice on the debtor in the following ways:


Have someone deliver the complaint and summons. This person should be at least 18 years old and not a party to the lawsuit.
Hire a private process server to make hand delivery. You can find process servers in the phone book or on the Internet. They generally charge $45-75 per service.
Pay the sheriff or constable to make service. In many counties, the sheriff can make service for a small fee.Mail the complaint and summons. You will probably have to use certified mail, return receipt requested., Whoever makes service typically has to fill out a Proof of Service form or Affidavit of Service. You can get this form from the court clerk.After the server makes service, he or she fills out the form and returns it to you. You then must file it with the court.
Keep a copy for your records in case any questions arise later.

, You can hire a lawyer to represent you at any time. However, many people cannot afford a lawyer’s full services. Nevertheless, you should think about hiring a lawyer just to represent you at trial, especially if a lot of money is at stake.


Most states now allow lawyers to provide “limited scope representation” (also called “unbundled legal services”). Under this arrangement, you hire the lawyer to do discrete tasks. For example, you could hire someone to handle the trial for you while you do all of the pre-trial work, such as filing your complaint.If you are interested in hiring a lawyer, then you can get a referral for a debt collection attorney from your state or local bar association. To find contact information, you should search the Internet for “attorney referral” and then your city or state.

, If you chose to have a jury, then the first thing you will do is pick the jury. Jury selection begins when the judge calls a panel of prospective jurors to the front of the courtroom. They then sit in the jury box and the judge asks them questions. Usually the judge asks basic personal questions (job, hobbies, etc.) and then asks if there is any reason they can’t be fair.


You will then be able to ask the judge to dismiss prospective jurors. For example, if a juror knows you or the debtor, then you could have the juror dismissed “for cause.” You can have any prospective juror dismissed for cause if they can’t be fair.
You also might have a limited number of “peremptory challenges.” With these, you can dismiss a prospective juror without giving a reason or even asking the judge’s permission. The only limitation on peremptory challenges is that you can’t use them in a way that discriminates against jurors on the basis of race, gender, or ethnicity.If neither you nor the debtor ask to have a juror dismissed, then that person is seated on the jury.

, After the judge swears in the jury, you and the debtor each get to make an opening statement. You will go first. The purpose of the statement is to give the jury a sneak peek of what evidence you will present.


Be sure not to argue or offer opinions during the opening statement.Instead, you simply want to let the jury know what the evidence will show.
For example, you could say, “As the evidence will show, the defendant agreed to borrow $5,000 and to pay it back in monthly installments from January 2015 to May 2015.”

, You might ask witnesses to testify. For example, if you formed an oral contract with a handshake, then a witness could testify as to what she heard.


When you question your witnesses, you cannot ask leading questions. A leading question is any question that suggests its answer. It usually can be answered with a “yes” or “no.”For example, “You were at my house on June 12, 2015, correct?” is a leading question.
Instead of asking leading questions, you should ask open-ended questions. For example, you could ask a series of open-ended questions to find out where the witness was and what she observed:

“Where were you on June 12, 2015?”
“Who else was there?”
“Did you hear anything?”
“What did you hear?”



, You might testify as well. If you have a lawyer, he or she can ask you questions. If you don’t have a lawyer, then you will probably just deliver your testimony in the form of a speech. The judge might also ask you questions. To be an effective witness, remember the following tips:Dress professionally. The judge and jurors are sizing you up from the moment they first lay eyes on you. Both men and women should wear suits, if they have one. If not, then see Dress for a Court Hearing for tips on appropriate attire.
Listen closely to the questions. If you don’t understand a question, ask for clarification.
Answer only the question asked. Don’t volunteer anything, and don’t guess. If you don’t know the answer, say, “I don’t know.”
Always tell the truth.

, The debtor might present witnesses as well. After the debtor’s lawyer questions them, you will have a chance to cross-examine them. The purpose of cross-examination is to undermine the witness’s believability.


For example, you can show contradictions in the testimony. If the debtor testifies that you had no oral contract, then ask why he made several payments to you, all in the same amount.
For more tips, see Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself.

, Your closing argument is your chance to actually argue your case. Be sure to mention specific pieces of evidence and explain how they support your case.


For example, you can show the jury the contract. You could say, “And you saw this contract. Did you remember that the defendant agreed that it was his signature on the last page? So he agreed to pay back this $2,000, except he didn’t. And even though he claimed he had paid it all off, he never introduced any evidence. No cancelled checks. No receipts. Nothing.”

, After each side makes a closing argument, the judge will read the jurors their instructions. They then retire for deliberations.


If you don’t have a jury, then the judge will probably deliver the verdict from the bench. If your case was particularly complicated, then the judge might issue a written ruling at a later date. However, most rulings should be made promptly.
In many state courts, the jury doesn’t need to be unanimous. Instead, you can win the lawsuit if three-fourths of the jurors agree with you."

Consider consulting an attorney.,
Read the FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure.,
Write your statement of claim.,
Complete other required forms.,
Submit your application packet.,
Wait for a response from the broker or firm.,
Consider any settlement offers.",How to Sue for Stock Broker Fraud2," Although you should be able to navigate FINRA's simplified arbitration procedures on your own, you may have more success if you hire an attorney.Generally, simplified arbitration is available if your claim is for less than $50,000. If your losses are greater than that amount, arbitration procedures can be more complex and you should probably hire an attorney to ensure you're able to get as much of your money back as possible.
While many lawyers are willing to take strong cases on contingency, about a third of your award or settlement will go to attorney's fees. Also keep in mind that most attorneys won't take cases on contingency that are worth less than $100,000.
In arbitration proceedings, you may be able to use a law school clinic free of charge. FINRA's guide includes a list of law schools that have securities arbitration clinics.

, FINRA has published a customer's edition of its code in plain language, which you should study particularly if you've decided not to hire an attorney.The customer code governs arbitrations between stock brokers, brokerage firms, and other financial industry professionals and their customers.
You can access a copy of the customer code at http://www.finra.org/arbitration-and-mediation/arbitration-rules.
FINRA also publishes an investor's guide to disputes, which you can download at http://www.finrafoundation.org/web/groups/foundation/@foundation/documents/foundation/p119054.pdf. This guide contains answers to many frequently asked questions investors have regarding FINRA's arbitration process.
If you have questions at any point about FINRA's arbitration procedures, you can talk to one of FINRA's staff attorneys. Although they cannot provide you with legal advice or assistance on your particular case, they can tell you about FINRA's procedural requirements.
Keep in mind that FINRA's arbitration process is only available to investors who have disputes with a registered stock broker or brokerage firm and have signed an enforceable arbitration agreement. This agreement typically is listed as a clause in the customer agreement you signed when you opened your account.

, There is no required format for your statement of claim, which you may even submit as a letter provided it includes all required information.To be valid and complete, your statement of claim must include your name, your current home address, and your home address at the time the events that caused the dispute took place.
Your statement also must include the basic facts of your dispute and the amount of money you believe you are owed in damages.
Be sure to include the dates the incidents took place. Your claim is not eligible for arbitration unless the events that gave rise to your claim happened within the past six years.
You can attach any documents, such as account statements or correspondence, that support your claim.
Information about yourself and your investment habits also may influence your case. For example, if you're a sophisticated investor who frequently trades in risky or volatile stocks, your case against your stock broker typically won't be as strong as if you're a less affluent, conservative investor who's simply trying to save for retirement.

, Although your statement of claim has no required format, FINRA has a prepared Claim Information Form and Submission Agreement that must accompany your statement of claim.The Uniform Submission Agreement states that you agree to follow FINRA's procedural rules and be bound by the decision of the arbitrator.
The Claim Information Sheet is a summary form used by FINRA staff to process your claim.
You can download these forms at http://www.finra.org/file/arbitration-claim-filing-guide.

, After you've completed all the required documents, you must file them with FINRA along with the applicable filing fee to request arbitration.You must submit originals of all documents as well as the requisite number of copies – one for each of the respondents and one for each arbitrator. The number of arbitrators you will have depends on the amount of your claim.
Make sure your originals and all copies are signed and dated.
Your application packet must be accompanied by a filing fee, which ranges between $50 and $1,800 depending on the amount of your claim. You can determine the amount of your filing fees by using FINRA's online fee calculator, available at http://apps.finra.org/ARbitrationMediation/ArbFeeCalc/1/Default.aspx.
If you cannot afford the fees, you can apply for a hardship waiver. You must make a written request and include a copy of your most recent tax return, two of your most recent pay stubs, and any other documentation that demonstrates financial hardship such as evidence of a wage garnishment or lien.
You can submit your application packet online at http://www.finra.org/arbitration-and-mediation/online-claim-filing.

, FINRA will serve your statement of claim on the stock broker or brokerage firm, who have 45 days from the date of receipt to file an answer.The answer must include the respondent's version of events, as well as any defenses or reasons they believe you are not entitled to the money you seek. Respondents also must file a signed Uniform Submission Agreement.
Respondents may attach any documents that support their arguments. They also may assert any counterclaims they have against you, each other, or other parties related to your claim.

, The vast majority of claims are settled before they ever reach the final stages of arbitration.Keep in mind that you have no guarantee of winning anything as a result of arbitration. Additionally, challenging an arbitration decision is extremely difficult once it's delivered because challenges are only permitted in very limited circumstances, and must be filed in federal court within three months of the arbitrator's decision.
FINRA will refund a portion of your filing fees if your claim is settled or withdrawn more than 10 days before the date your arbitration hearing is scheduled.

Gather information.,
Evaluate the possibility of a class action.,
Hire an attorney.,
Work with your attorney to draft your complaint.,
File your complaint.,
Have the defendant served.,
Receive the defendant's answer.,
Consider any settlement offers.",How to Sue for Stock Broker Fraud3," Before you talk to an attorney, you will need information about the fraud itself, as well as your customer agreement and any other documents related to your investment account and your relationship with your stock broker.If you previously filed complaints with any regulatory agencies, you should include any documentation related to that report and the outcome of any investigation.
Create a log with a timeline of events in the transaction or transactions that you believe were fraudulent, including any account statements or other information that documents each event.
You may want to write up an honest profile of yourself as an investor, including the reasons you wanted to invest and the types of investments you'd consider suitable. This can help your attorney analyze whether your stock broker paid attention to your needs and interests when trading on your account or tried to trick you into a riskier investment than you could handle.

, In some situations, such as if you were the victim of a Ponzi scheme, there may potentially be hundreds of other investors who suffered similar losses and would be willing to join your lawsuit.If you believe there is a possibility that your claim could merit a class action lawsuit, talk to an attorney who specializes in representing class action plaintiffs. The rules for filing and litigating class actions are extraordinarily complex, and fighting a class action requires significant resources, which is why there are law firms that work in class actions exclusively.

, Not only are securities fraud laws complex, but you can be assured the stock broker and his or her brokerage firm will have an army of attorneys on their side. If you decide to sue for stock broker fraud, you shouldn't do so without an attorney.A qualified attorney with experience in securities law also will be able to tell you how long you have to file a claim for recovery. The legal deadline, or statute of limitations, to file a claim depends to a large extent on the facts and circumstances of your case.
If you have friends or colleagues in the securities industry, you may want to ask one of them for a recommendation. Otherwise, you can begin your attorney search on the website of your state or local bar association. Typically these websites include a searchable directory of licensed attorneys in specific practice areas.
Many bar associations also have attorney referral programs that can point you to attorneys in your area who specialize in cases similar to yours.

, Your attorney will need as much information and documentation as you have to accurately formulate the allegations in your complaint.Provide your attorney with all the documentation you have, including account statements and balance sheets so he or she can calculate your losses and determine the damages you are owed by the stock broker or brokerage firm for the fraudulent acts.
Your complaint will include your name and address as well as the names and addresses of everyone you are suing, which may include not only your stock broker but also the brokerage firm where he or she works.
The bulk of your complaint will consist of your allegations, written in numbered paragraphs with a single factual statement per paragraph. These allegations must add up to a violation of state or federal securities law.
After listing the allegations, your complaint will identify the law violated and your legal theory as to why the allegations you listed constitute a violation.
The last paragraphs of your complaint will describe the monetary amounts to which you believe you are entitled as a result of the stock broker's actions.

, To initiate your lawsuit, you must file your complaint and any other required documents with the clerk of the court in which your case will be heard.Once your complaint is filed, your case will be assigned to a judge and given a case number. The clerk will issue a summons for each defendant you've listed in your lawsuit.
You must pay filing fees to file your lawsuit. If your attorney is working on contingency, he or she will add these to the costs to be deducted from any settlement or award you receive – otherwise you're responsible for paying them or applying for a waiver.
Filing fees typically are several hundred dollars, depending on the court in which you are filing your case.

, Within a short period of time after you've filed your complaint, you must have it delivered to the stock broker or brokerage firm you are suing for fraud.If you're filing your lawsuit in federal court, a U.S. marshal will hand-deliver the complaint and summons to the defendant. In state court, this duty typically is performed by sheriff's deputies.

, Depending on the court in which you file your lawsuit, the defendant will have between 20 and 30 days to file a response to your lawsuit.Typically the defendant will deny most, if not all, of your allegations as well as list defenses as to why he or she is not liable for the losses you've suffered.
The defendant may file a motion to dismiss, in which case you must respond to the motion and attend a hearing to defend your lawsuit. To successfully overcome this hurdle, you must be able to demonstrate to the judge that your case has merit and the allegations in your complaint, if proven, constitute a violation of state or federal securities law.

, At any point after you file your complaint, you can expect to get a settlement offer from the stock broker or brokerage firm you sued.The confidential nature of settlements should appeal to the stock broker or brokerage firm, especially if your lawsuit survives a motion to dismiss. Most securities professionals would rather settle quietly than litigate a very public fraud lawsuit.
Additionally, if you've not filed a class action, it's possible your stock broker might be concerned that one might materialize – particularly if he or she led other clients down the same investment path as you.
Your attorney must keep you apprised of any and all settlement offers, and will give you his or her advice on whether you should accept or reject the offer. However, keep in mind that ultimately you have the final word on whether to take a settlement.
When evaluating a settlement offer, take into consideration the time and expense of continued litigation, as well as the uncertainty that you will get what you've asked for when you go to trial.

However, each state has a maximum dollar amount for which you're allowed to sue in small claims court – typically somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000, although it may be as little as $2,000.If the amount the person owes you exceeds that amount, you usually can't simply sue them for a lesser amount just so you can get around the maximum limit.Generally, the court location that has jurisdiction over your claim will be the court in the county where the dispute occurred. If the person owes you money under a written contract, you want to sue either in the county where the contract was signed, or where most of the work under the contract was performed.You also have the option of suing in the county where the person you want to sue lives. This means that in some situations you'll be able to choose between several different courts that all have jurisdiction. When that happens, you can pick the court that's most convenient for you.;
, To recover the money you're owed through a lawsuit, you must have proof of the debt.


If you have a written contract, that part of your proof is relatively straightforward. However, in many cases money is loaned through a handshake deal in which no formal contract is signed. In those situations, proving the person owes you money can be tricky.
If you loaned someone money, be prepared that he or she may try to claim that the money was a gift rather than a loan. Any proof you may have that it was in fact a loan will go a long way.
For example, suppose you loaned a friend $1,000 to get repairs done on his car. He was supposed to pay you back by giving you $100 each week, and initially he made these payments on time. However, after five weeks he stopped paying you. Cancelled checks or receipts for those first five payments can help you establish that the money was a loan, not a gift, and that he knew he had to repay you.

, You want to make sure you're suing the right person using his or her correct legal name, and including all required parties.For example, if you live in a community property state and the person who owes you money is married, you must sue both the person and his or her spouse.
You also must make sure that you have the correct legal name for the person you're suing, as well as an address where he or she can be served with notice of the lawsuit. Without this information, you won't be able to complete your lawsuit.If you're suing a business, you can check with your state's secretary of state to get the business's official legal name. Keep in mind that he legal name may differ from the name with which you're familiar., Each state has a deadline after which you can't sue a person to recover money he or she owes you.


The length of the statute of limitations depends on whether the person owes you money under a written contract or an oral contract. Typically you have much longer, as much as 10 years, to file suit regarding a written contract. However, you must sue to enforce an oral contract within one or two years.This time period begins from the date the contract – whether written or oral – was broken. This can be tricky if you didn't have a repayment schedule with the person, because you have no specific date you can use.Make sure you check the statute of limitations that applies to your case before you file your lawsuit, because if you miss the deadline your case will be dismissed.

, If someone owes you a significant amount of money, or if you believe they will contest your claim, you may want to get an attorney's advice on how to proceed.


Keep in mind that if you're planning on suing in small claims court, you must have an attorney in many states if you're suing a person who owes money to your company rather than to you as an individual.Many attorneys offer free consultations, and it may be worth your time to at least talk to someone and get an official legal opinion on your case. If the attorney thinks it's unlikely that you'll win, or that you'll be able to collect the money even if you do win, you may want to reassess your options.
If you're concerned about the cost of an attorney, you might seek out attorneys who provide unbundled services, in which they help you with certain aspects of your case – such as preparing your paperwork for the court or drafting discovery documents – but don't fully represent you.You might also want to check with your local legal aid services or law school clinics and see if you can find low-cost legal assistance there.

, Many states require proof that you made a written demand for the money before you file suit.In your demand letter, state the amount of money you're owed and why. Give the person a brief period of time after he or she receives your letter to respond or pay the money. Tell him or her that if you don't have a response by that date you will file suit to recover your money.Make a copy of the letter before you send it so you have it for your records, and can present the copy to the court later if you end up filing suit.
Send your letter certified mail, returned receipt requested, so you know when the person receives the letter. Save your return receipt when you receive it so you have it to prove to the court that the letter was received., Many states have fill-in-the-blank forms approved by the courts for use in filing your claim.


You typically can find forms by looking on the court's website or calling the clerk's office. Some legal aid and self-help clinics also have forms you can use., If you can't find a form, you'll have to format your complaint by hand.


You can use copies of complaints filed for other cases in the same court as a guide so you know you're formatting everything properly.
The complaint tells the court what happened and why the defendant owes you money. This information typically is set forth in numbered paragraphs, with one allegation per paragraph., You may want to contact the clerk of the court where you intend to file to determine what other documents must be filed with the complaint to initiate a lawsuit.


You typically will have to fill out a summons and a certificate of service. The summons tells the defendant that he or she must appear in court, and provides details on how to respond to the lawsuit.The certificate of service tells the court how you intend to notify the defendant of the lawsuit.
Once you've finished everything, make copies of each document you're filing with the court. The clerk will keep the originals for the court's records, so you'll need at least one copy for your own records and one for the person you're suing., Once you've completed all required documents, you must file them with the clerk to begin the litigation process.


Some courts allow you to file by mailing your paperwork and fees using certified mail. You can find out from the clerk if this option is available for you.
When you take your documents to the clerk, you must pay a filing fee. This fee will vary depending on the court in which you file. If you file in small claims, the fee may be under $100, but you can expect to pay several hundred dollars to file a regular civil court lawsuit.If you can't afford to pay the filing fees, you may be able to fill out an application to have the fees waived. On the application, you must disclose details about your income and assets. If the court determines that your income is below the court's low-income threshold, you won't have to pay any court costs.Typically if you receive public benefits you will be deemed eligible for a waiver of your court costs.
If you're filing in small claims court, the clerk may schedule a date for your hearing at the same time you file.For full civil court cases, you typically must wait to receive an answer from the defendant before you can find out what the next step in litigation will be.

, After you've filed your complaint, you need to follow the court's procedures to provide the defendant with proper legal notice of the lawsuit against him or her.


In most cases, the defendant will be served by having the paperwork sent to him or her using certified mail with returned receipt requested. The return receipt serves as proof that the defendant received the complaint and has notice of the lawsuit.You also may have the option of using the sheriff's department or a private process serving company to deliver the paperwork to the defendant personally. There typically will be a fee for this service.

, In most cases the defendant must file a written answer to your complaint within a set period of time after he or she is served.


Typically the defendant has between 20 and 30 days to file his or her written answer. If no answer is filed, you can seek a default judgment against him or her.When you seek a default judgment, you typically still must prove the exact amount of money to which you're entitled.If the defendant does file an answer, it will be served on you – either by using personal service or by mailing it to you using certified mail. If the defendant raises any counterclaims, you have a similar period of time to respond to those counterclaims or the defendant can seek a default judgment against you.For example, suppose you loaned your roommate $300 and are suing her for it. Your roommate counterclaims that you owe her $200 for food of hers that you consumed without replacing it, and that she therefore only owes you $100. If you don't respond and deny her counterclaim, the judge could enter a default judgment on her counterclaim, thus entitling you to recover only $100 of the money she owes you.
The defendant also may file motions, such as a motion to dismiss. You must respond to these motions, and the court may schedule a hearing before the judge., Before trial, both you and the person you're suing have the opportunity to ask each other questions and share documents and evidence you plan to introduce at trial.


Through the discovery process, you can use various tools to gain information about the defendant's case. Written discovery includes written questions and requests for production of documents related to the case. Your written questions, or interrogatories, must be responded to in writing and under oath.You also have the opportunity to call a deposition, in which you interview either the defendant or any witnesses under oath and on the record. The transcript of depositions can later be used at trial if the person says something on the stand that contradicts something he or she said in the deposition.If you filed in small claims court, you typically won't have any discovery period – or if you do, it will be a simplified process of written discovery only., Some courts require parties to participate in mediation or other alternate dispute resolution before a trial will be scheduled.


Mediation involves having a conversation with the defendant in a neutral setting with a third-party mediator on hand to facilitate that discussion and help you reach a compromise.Mediation is a non-confrontational setting, so it can be particularly helpful if the person you're suing also is a friend or family member, and you want to preserve your relationship with them.

, Make sure your documents and evidence are organized and that you've prepared your opening and closing statements for the court.


Write an outline of your case and the events that transpired so you can present them to the court in an orderly fashion. Practice what you're going to say in front of a mirror or in front of friends or family members.If you have any documents such as a written contract that you want to show to the judge, you should make enough copies that you can keep one, give one to the judge, and give one to the defendant.If you have any witnesses you want to call to testify on your behalf, you should call them and find out if they're willing to testify. If they don't want to appear in court, you typically have the option of having the court issue a subpoena that will force your witnesses to appear.Get together with any witnesses you plan to call and practice with them before the trial. Not only should they have a good idea of the questions you might ask, but you should have a good understanding of their answers so you can plan and make sure you don't inadvertently call a witness to the stand who ends up damaging your case., You must appear when the hearing of your case is scheduled, or your case will be dismissed.


You may want to arrive at least a half hour early so you have time to get through courthouse security and find the courtroom where your trial will be held.It may be that there is more than one trial being held in your courtroom on that day. If so, find a seat in the court's gallery and wait until your case is called. Once your case is called, you may stand and move to the front of the courtroom., Since you filed the lawsuit, you have the opportunity to tell the court your side of the story first.When you present your case, speak only to the judge – don't talk to the defendant or lash out at him or her.You can show exhibits, which include any contracts, cancelled checks, receipts, or other documents that show that the defendant owes you money and has failed to pay it. You can bring copies of the documents you plan to enter as exhibits, but make sure you have the original to be entered as evidence. A copy generally won't be accepted for that purpose.If you have any witnesses, you will call them to the stand while you're presenting your case. When you finish your questions, the defendant will have the opportunity to ask questions as well., After you've presented all of your evidence, the person you've sued will have the opportunity to present his or her defense.Don't interrupt the defendant or yell out, even if he or she says something that's incorrect. You had your chance to tell your side of the story, and now the defendant has the same opportunity. The judge will make a decision based on the facts and evidence in the case.
If the defendant has witnesses, you will have the opportunity to cross-examine them just as he or she cross-examined your witnesses. Pay close attention during the witness's testimony and take note of anything you want to ask the witness about when it's your turn.

, At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence, the judge will make a ruling in your case.


The order will spell out whose story the judge found more convincing and why, and list the amount of money (if any) that you're entitled to receive from the defendant.Both parties have the right to appeal the decision. Generally you wouldn't have any interest in appealing if you got everything you asked for. However, there may be some situations in which you want to appeal even if you won – for example, if the judge ruled in your favor, but found that the defendant only had to pay you $200 when you had argued he owed you $2000., Since each state has different rules regarding how to enforce court judgments, it's best to talk to the clerk about it when you pick up your copy of the final order.


If rules in your jurisdiction are complex, you may want to consider hiring a collections attorney to handle the process for you. You typically can pay them a percentage of the recovery amount, and you may even have the ability to add those costs to the total amount of your judgment., Before you make efforts to enforce your judgment, you should talk to the defendant and find out if he or she is willing to work out payment arrangements with you directly.


Typically if someone is able to do so, they'll go ahead and pay the amount of the judgment to avoid collection activities such as garnishment, which can be embarrassing and costly., The most common method of enforcing a court judgment is to garnish a portion of the defendant's wages until the judgment is paid.


If you hold a judgment in your favor and the defendant refuses to pay, you can use garnishment to get your money. Typically you can garnish up to 25 percent of the defendant's wages, unless he or she already has an existing garnishment.If you sued a business, you also may be able to get the sheriff to seize property, assets, or even cash from the register to cover the judgment amount., Before you apply for a writ of garnishment, you must get certain details about the defendant's income and assets.

Post-judgment discovery is available in some, but not all states. Essentially you send the defendant another set of interrogatories to determine what money they have and where it's coming from.You also should use post-judgment discovery to find out if the defendant has any other garnishments, or if he or she has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.Additionally, the defendant may have certain types of income, such as public benefits, that are exempt from being seized or garnished to satisfy a judgment.
The court provides a deadline by which the defendant must respond to your interrogatories. Once you have this information, you'll know what to include in your garnishment application.

, Once you have the answers from the defendant regarding his or her employment, income, and assets, you can complete your application for a writ of garnishment.


Some jurisdictions also may call this document a writ of execution, which means you are executing your judgment. Writs of execution and writs of garnishment have the same effect.
The writ of garnishment tell the defendant's employer that he or she must withhold a certain amount of money from the defendant's paycheck., You must file your application and affidavit with the clerk to begin the garnishment process.


Some jurisdictions allow you to file your application and affidavit electronically, which could save you a trip to the courthouse.Provided your application and affidavit are complete, the clerk will issue the writ. You may have to pay an additional fee for this.Once you have your writ, you can contact the sheriff's department to have the writ served on the defendant's employer. This will begin the garnishment process."

The “Notice of Levy”, as it is usually called, is often received after the funds are already levied. So most of the time, you will find out when you cannot access the funds in your account.;
, The bank is required to include a list of rights and deadlines to object to the attachment. Write these down and make sure to meet them. If you miss a deadline, there is not much you can do to get your money back.

, While the bank has levied your account and it is frozen, outstanding checks or any other payments are returned. Create a list of all outstanding payments and contact those entities to make alternative arrangements to process the payment.


If your account had more than the value of the assignment, the bank may still process transactions.

, The Notice of Levy will identify the creditor and the case that generated the attachment. You will need this information to contact the creditor or file a motion in the court explaining why the attachment is not valid or your funds are exempts.

, After you understand your rights and are prepared to challenge the attachment in court, contact the creditor or their lawyer about releasing it or making payment arrangements. Explain that you plan on fighting it in court and on what grounds it is not valid. This possible headache for the creditor may be enough for them to make alternative payment arrangements, especially if your exemption case is strong.


The creditor already has your money, so you need a strong case to persuade them to release the funds without using the courts. However some government entities, like the IRS, or creditors could allow you to enter into payment arrangements.

, Prepare the paperwork to appeal the assignment in tandem with trying to reach an agreement with the creditor. The timeline is short, often only ten days, to challenge the attachment. If you do not successfully resolve the dispute directly with the creditor, you need to meet the filing deadline.

, If you were not able to negotiate with the creditor, it is time to file an exemption with the court. The court filing, most often called a “Claim Exemption”, will need to include reasons why those funds are exempt. You may also need to file a “Financial Statement” and a “Declaration”. This will vary by state, and it may make the process easier if you retain legal representation. Here are a few examples of related paperwork from California.Claim of Exemption (EJ-160) http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf

Financial Statement (EJ-165) http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej165.pdf

Declaration (MC-030) http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc030.pdf


, Every state is different but exempt funds can include those for basic life necessities, wages, child support, retirement funds, and social security. You will need to identify the reasons the funds are exempt or that the attachment is not valid.The Treasury Department has rules in place that prevent attachments of funds that are linked to social security benefits paid in the prior two months. The bank is supposed to review the account for any social security deposits, and it is not supposed to freeze these funds.

, You will need to support any claims so attach pay stubs, utility bills, bank statements, court ruling for child support or anything else that helps demonstrate your case to the court.

, Make at least three copies of every form to file with the court, Sheriff or levying officer. The directions for where to file the paperwork should be on the “Notice of Levy” that you received. The process varies by location, so the original Notice is your best resource for filing location.

, If the creditor agrees or takes no action to your filing, typically within 10 days, the exemption is granted. You will have the money returned to you at this time. If the creditor opposes the claim, you will receive notice of a court hearing.

, In some counties and cities, there is a tentative ruling released the day prior to the hearing. You can check this on the Clerk of Courts website typically. In other states, you will have to attend the hearing to receive a ruling.

, If you had the hearing, the judge will make a ruling on your exemption claim. It can be for all, partial or none of the amount in the attachment. After the ruling, you will either have your funds released or they will be granted to the creditor.

Request a copy of the form.",How to Fill out a Guarantor Form1," Before you begin filling out the guarantor form, make sure that you have all pertinent materials. Depending on the guarantor form, you may need bank statements or tax returns. Make sure that you have the materials, or at least the information on them, available when you begin filling out your guarantor form., When you begin filling out the form, it will ask for your personal information. This will include things like your name, home address, social security number, and phone number. You will need to provide this information so that the entity you are signing the agreement with can run a credit check., A guarantor form will also likely ask you to provide information about your financial background. You will need to include information about your income, current employment, and banking information. Because this is relatively sensitive information, avoid filling out this form in a public space., Once you have completed the form, you will need to sign it and have it notarized. You can find a notary online or at your bank. For a small fee, they will sign and stamp the form. After it is notarized, you will want to mail it to the lender or landlord.Be sure to mail the documents. The creditor or landlord will need to see the notarized stamp in person. If you send a copy, they will likely ask for the original.
If you are cosigning a loan, the financial institution you are making the agreement with will likely have a notary available.
If it is an auto loan, many car dealerships have a notary on staff.

, Once you have completed the guarantor form and returned it, ask the entity you signed the agreement with to send you a copy of the form, as well as all pertinent documents. You will need these for your records. You may also need them later if the person you cosigned for defaults.

Research your options.,
Prepare a contingency plan.,
Understand your legal responsibilities.,
Determine your guarantor requirements.,
Make a list of qualified potential guarantors.,
Arrange an in-person meeting with your potential guarantor.,
Research resources with your employer.,
Consider a commercial guarantor.",How to Find a Guarantor," The three most common contracts that may need a guarantor are mortgages, residential rentals, and credit cards. Each type of guarantor agreement may have different requirements.


On a mortgage, the guarantor is part of the mortgage process. Your guarantor will have to disclose his assets, income, and debts, as well as undergo a credit check. The mortgage company wants a guarantor that can pay for his own rent or mortgage and be able to assume yours if you default. More and more landlords are asking for guarantors on residential rentals. This is especially true in high cost of living areas like New York City. A landlord is going to want a guarantor who lives close and has a sufficient income to cover the rent payments if you default.On a credit card application, the card issuer is going to look at the guarantor's income and credit rating. In short, the credit card will be in your name, but it will be granted on the strength of your guarantor's credentials. Parents often act as guarantors on credit cards issued to applicants that are under 21. ;
, There are three ways to have someone act as security for your contract. Besides having a guarantor, you can also have someone act as a co-signer or joint applicant. The lender or landlord will usually have the last say, but it is worth it to you to ask if you have other options than a guarantor.


A co-signer also agrees to pay the loan if you default. On a mortgage, a co-signer will be listed as a joint owner of the property until the mortgage is paid off.On a credit card or money loan, the co-signer is liable for the debt, but can't make charges.
The main difference between a guarantor and a co-signer is that the lender must exhaust every possibility of collecting against you before they can sue a guarantor. A co-signer has less protection against liability and can be sued immediately.With a joint applicant, you can often pool your assets with another person, usually a spouse, partner, family member, or roommate to meet the requirements for the contract. A joint applicant is someone who will have the same rights as you as far as the property, rental, or charge account. In this type of agreement, the liability is usually equal. Both parties are responsible for the entire debt., When someone agrees to be your guarantor, he is trusting you to fulfill the contract. If you default, the consequences to your guarantor can be devastating. Before you ask someone to underwrite your contract, you need to have a contingency plan in case you run into trouble.


Keep your guarantor up to date on your financial condition. If you are beginning to struggle, it is critical that you be honest. You may need to move or ask for help with mortgage or credit card payments until you can get back on your feet.
Be prepared to release your guarantor as soon as possible. When a new job starts paying off or old debts are paid, you will usually see your credit score and cash flow increase. On a credit card, it can often be as simple as a joint phone call. On a mortgage or contract, it may require refinancing the agreement or rewriting the lease., Your guarantor has legal rights against you. He is entitled to copies of all documents regarding the transaction and to check if you are paying your bills as promised. This is only fair. If you default, the lender will be very aggressive in their actions against your guarantor. If this happens, your guarantor has the right to sue you to recover his losses if you default on the agreement., If you need someone to guarantee your apartment in Chicago, the landlord may not accept your parents in Florida. On a mortgage, your guarantor may need to be able to attend signings and other meetings. You will also need to consider what kind of assets and credit ratings your guarantor will need to possess. Ask the lender or landlord if they have a guarantor checklist., Based on the requirements of the loan or lease, make a list of people who would qualify. Common personal guarantors are parents, grandparents, in-laws, and siblings. Be realistic. If your family or close relationships do not have sufficient assets or credit rating, you may have to reconsider your plans.

, You will need to have as much information as possible, including the contract, the payment terms, the lender's guarantor requirements, your contingency plan, and a clear concise reason why you need his help.


Anticipate his questions. What would you want to know if a family member was asking you to be his guarantor? Regardless of your personal relationship, this is a business deal. Be prepared for him to answer ""no,"" especially if you have a poor credit and financial history. In the long run, the personal relationship is more valuable than an apartment or credit card.

, This is most applicable for residential rentals and mortgages. If you are moving to a new area, especially a high cost of living area, as a condition of your job, your employer may offer guarantor services. This is a legitimate question to ask during job interviews and transfers.

, As rental markets tighten, particularly in urban areas, some insurance companies have started offering guarantor services. For a one-time fee (usually around one month's rent,) the company will sign on as your guarantor for a residential lease.Commercial lease guarantors are an excellent resource for non-citizens coming to the United States for work or school. You may have considerable assets in your home country, but since suing you and your guarantor would be difficult, the landlord or mortgage company will want a domestic guarantor.
If you are considering a commercial guarantor, ask for references in the form of landlords they have worked with. Contact the landlords and ask about their experiences with the guarantor. You can also check the Better Business Bureau for complaints.
Check the default provisions carefully and what penalties you might face if your commercial guarantor has to pay off on your lease.

Read all agreements and documents.,
Determine if you can afford it.,
Consider the resources of the person asking you to cosign.,
Inquire about deadlines.,
Contact the creditor or landlord.,
Negotiate with the creditor or landlord.",How to Fill out a Guarantor Form2," If someone asks you to be a cosigner, request that they give you all pertinent documents. Because you are agreeing to adhere to the other person’s agreement, it is important for you to know what you are getting into. Ask them to send any contracts, legal documents, or financial statements related to the agreement.If you are cosigning for a loan, request a copy of the loan agreement.
If you are cosigning for an apartment, ask for a copy of the lease. Many landlords choose to have a cosign agreement on the lease instead of a separate guarantor form.

, Evaluate your finances and consider if you could cover the other person’s obligations if they defaulted. Figure out if you could make their monthly payments or cover any charges or late fees they accrued. If you cannot to meet these financial obligations, you should strongly consider not cosigning., In order to get a better idea of what you may be getting into, ask the person requesting you to be a cosigner to send you their financial records. In order to avoid getting stuck with the bill, you will want some kind of evidence that the other person is capable of adhering to their agreement.


You should ask them to send you a tax return, a pay stub, or their credit score. These things will help you get a better understanding of their finances.
Never cosign for someone you do not know.

, Because many agreements, particularly apartment leases, are time sensitive, you will need to know all pertinent deadlines. Inquire about when you need to have the guarantor form signed and submitted. If you do sign the form, getting it in on time will impact whether or not the agreement is accepted.You may also want to contact the entity the person is making the agreement with.

, Before you sign any documents, you should contact the entity with which the other person is making an agreement. If you are cosigning on a loan, contact the creditor to see if you can negotiate specific terms of the agreement. If you are cosigning a lease, get in touch with the landlord or rental company.Ask the person you are cosigning with to forward any relevant contact information.

, As a cosigner, you may be able to negotiate the terms of the agreement you are signing. For instance, with a creditor, you might try to limit your liability for the loan and negotiate for the exclusion of court costs, attorney fees and late charges. With a landlord, you might try limiting your obligations in terms of late fees and back rent."
"
Accept that you are financially liable.,
Realize that this could hurt your relationship.,
Understand the impact on your credit score.,
Consider an alternative to cosigning.",How to Fill out a Guarantor Form3," Before you complete a guarantor form, it is important that you understand your obligations. By cosigning for a loan or an apartment, you are guaranteeing to meet the financial obligations of the person you are signing for. If they fail to make their payments, the responsibility falls on you.Because you have a better credit score, the lender or landlord may sue you first because you will be more likely to pay.
For many loans, there is no way out of a cosigning agreement. Once you sign, you have agreed to pay the debt until it is gone.You may also be charged for any court or attorney fees as well as late charges.

, Because most people cosign with close friends or family members, it may be hard for you to say no. You will need to consider whether you are comfortable supporting this person’s debts. If you assume their financial obligations or are sued, you may develop hard feelings towards this person, which could cause a rupture between you. Determine if cosigning is worth the risk of destroying this relationship.If you would not be willing to loan this person money, you should not cosign for them.

, If you cosign with someone, you are taking on a lot of risk for very little reward. Your credit score may receive a small bump by cosigning the loan. However, if the other person defaults and you are stuck with their debt, this may seriously damage your credit score. Ultimately, the small benefit of cosigning is not worth the much larger hit your credit score could take., Because cosigning a loan can be so financially dangerous and complicated, you may want to consider helping in another way. Although loaning money is also fraught with issues, it does not carry any of the legal obligations that cosigning does. If the person defaults or fails to make their payments, you will only be out the money that you loaned them and not have to face the possibility of being sued or paying a much larger sum.


If you feel comfortable with it, you might offer to let the person stay with you instead of cosigning for an apartment.
You might also offer to help them find a loan with a more accommodating interest rate.

Contact a financial claims management company, optional.",How to Make a PPI Claim," PPI is an insurance policy that is activated when a qualifying event occurs, such as being laid off or illness. Once you submit a claim and the claim is accepted, the insurance company makes monthly payments towards whatever debt is covered under the policy.


PPI policies last for a finite amount of time, often one year. During this time period, you will have time to find another job, sort out your finances, and/or find another way to repay your loan.
PPI policies typically make the minimum payment on your loan, especially for credit cards. PPI should be considered a “safety net” rather than a long-term debt reduction strategy.;
, For some consumers, PPI offers peace of mind by enhancing financial security to carry you through significant illness or loss of income. PPI may be a good investment for you if:


You have a significant amount of debt that you will be unable to repay if you are unable to work or you lose your job.
You are employed in a profession where there is a significant possibility that you may be laid off.
You are at an increased risk of suffering from a debilitating illness.
You have no alternate sources of income, income protection insurance, or life insurance.

, For some people, PPI will not provide necessary coverage and therefore is a waste of their resources. PPI may not be a good choice under the following circumstances:


You are already unemployed or retired.
You need the payments immediately. Most PPIs do not pay within the first 90 days.
You have some other way to ""survive"" for a period of time without a form of income (e.g. savings, a second job, sick pay, or an existing insurance policy).
You don’t have the resources to be able to afford PPI.
You are self-employed, an independent contractor, or temporary employee. Many PPIs will not cover this type of employment., One of the easiest ways to identify PPI policy providers is to use an insurance comparison website. Conduct an internet search using the following search terms “insurance comparison website payment protection.” This search will provide you with several comparison websites. You should use at least two websites to locate PPI providers., When using an insurance comparison website, you will be asked to provide some basic identifying information in order to get a PPI quote. You may be asked for the following:


Name;
Annual salary;
Amount of PPI payout desired;
Occupation; and/or
Employer Name.

, Once the insurance website generates potential policies for you to explore, check to see whether you are eligible for the policy and whether it provides you the desired coverage (i.e. loan repayment, credit card repayment, mortgage repayment. You should also examine each policy for the following:


The length of the policy. PPI contracts typically last 12 or 24 months, so if you need a shorter policy, immediate access to funds, or a longer contract, you should dismiss any policies that do not fit your criteria.
The amount of time that you have to wait for payment. Most PPI policies do not pay out immediately upon accepting your claim. You should choose a policy that best corresponds to your ability to cover your expenses while waiting for the policy payout.
The monthly premium for the policy. You must determine the maximum amount that you can afford to pay for a PPI policy., It is very important that you closely and thoroughly read through any PPI policy that you may purchase. You should pay particular attention to the PPI policy's exclusions so that you don’t purchase a policy that will not benefit you. Some policies prevent you from making a claim if one of the following applies to you:


You work for a family business
You are under 18 or over 65
You are self-employed, an independent contractor, or a temporary employee.
You are aware ahead of time that you may become unemployed.
You are aware (or should be aware) of certain medical conditions that are listed in the policy.
You are unable to work due to certain common conditions (e.g. stress, back pain, etc.), You should never feel obligated to enroll in PPI. In recent years, some banks and lenders have been accused of mis-selling PPIs by using predatory tactics to trick their customers into buying PPI policies they don't need. Some of these tactics include:


Failing to properly explain the scenarios that you would exclude a claimant from receiving a payout under the policy.
Purposefully misleading customers by telling that the PPI policy was a required part of a loan.
Adding a PPI policy to the loan without the buyer's consent., Once you have located a policy that meets your requirements, purchase the policy and be sure to make your monthly payments.

, If you experience a loss of income, you must locate your PPI policy to determine whether you have grounds for a claim.


If you cannot locate your policy, contact your lender via email or telephone.
Request that your lender provide you with a copy of your PPI policy and discuss the details of your policy.
Be aware that you may be charged a fee if the lender has to locate an older policy.

, Review the original policy documents to determine whether you can make a claim. When reviewing your policy, consider the following:


Check whether the circumstances under which you lost your source of income are covered by your policy.
Carefully review all exclusions listed in the policy and determine if you are prohibited from filing a claim.

, Every insurance company is different, so you must follow the claim process for your insurance carrier. Insurance companies may require the following in a claims submission:


You must complete specific forms provided on the insurance company’s website or provided by the insurance company.
You may be asked to provide information about the creditor so that the insurance company knows where to send payments.
You may be asked to provide information about why your employment was terminated.
Your employer may be asked to provide information about why you are no longer working, when you stopped working, and the nature of your employment.
You may be asked to provide proof of an illness and documentation from a doctor explaining why you can no longer work.
You may be asked to provide documentation of your debt., Once you have gathered the necessary documentation and completed the required forms, you should submit your claim as soon as possible. You may be asked to fax, email or send your insurance claim to the company. Be sure that you receive delivery confirmation of your claim.

, Most PPI policies have an initial ""waiting"" period (usually called a ""deferment"" or ""deferred"" period) during which they won't make any payments toward your loan. This period can be anywhere from 30 to 180 days.


During the deferment, you will have to use other means (such as your personal savings) to pay down your debt.
You should note that if you get a new job during the deferment period, your provider won't have to make any payments on your behalf.

, If you believe that an insurance company improperly denied your claim, you should file a formal complaint. You can find a complaint template here: https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/what-to-do-if-your-insurance-claim-is-rejectedAfter lodging a formal complaint, PPI providers are usually obligated by law to respond with information regarding whether your complaint was upheld or not. Depending on the legal situation where you live, the length of time they have to respond may vary. For instance, in the UK, PPI providers have 8 weeks to respond.Don't worry about damaging your relationship with your lender. If you've lost your source of income you are entitled to try to file a claim and, if necessary, fight for a settlement.

, It is entirely possible to file and receive a PPI claim, or file a complaint and obtain a settlement on your own. However, because these processes can be long and drawn out, some customers decide to enlist the help of a financial claims management company.


Be aware that thousands of these companies exist and are known to charge high prices for their services. In some cases, these types of companies are known to take a commission of 25% or more from your settlement."

The complaint lays out the facts surrounding the lawsuit as well as the legal theories which allow the creditor to sue.You will be sent a copy of this complaint along with a summons. The summons should tell you how much time you have to respond to the lawsuit.;
, As soon as you receive your complaint and summons, you should immediately start planning your defense. In order to make the best case, you should try to meet with an attorney. You can get a referral from your local or state bar association, which should run a referral program.


You may be worried about how much an attorney costs. Realize that many people represent themselves in creditor lawsuits every day.Even if you choose to represent yourself, however, you should seek out low cost or free legal assistance.
There may be a legal aid organization near you. Legal aid organizations provide free legal help to people in financial need. To find one near you, search the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lsc.gov.
You can also meet for a consultation with an attorney. Most attorneys provide reduced-price or free consultations.

, Go through and find a copy of your loan contract. Also gather evidence of how much debt you have paid, such as cancelled checks or a monthly summary of account statement.


If you are being sued for an auto loan deficiency, then you should find your copies of all notices sent by the lender. The lender should have given you notices before selling the car as well as a notice of sale after selling the repossessed car. You will want to look through these notices for errors.

, One way you can defend yourself is to argue that the creditor has waited too long to sue.Count how much time has passed from the last payment you made.


To find the statute of limitations, search “debt collection statute of limitations” and then “your state” on the Internet.
If the creditor waited too long to sue, you can raise a statute of limitations defense and get the case thrown out of court.

, You have other defenses you can raise as well. For example, you can argue that the creditor did not follow proper procedures:The service of the complaint was faulty. Your state law will lay out how the creditor must serve you with the summons and a copy of the complaint. For example, in New York, the creditor must first try to serve you in person or else leave it with someone in your home while also mailing you a second copy. It cannot simply leave the documents with your next-door neighbor or mail it to you. If the creditor improperly served the paperwork, then you should raise this defense in your answer.
Defective notice (automobile cases). Under your state law, the creditor for a car loan must give you notice before selling the repossessed car. These notices must contain certain information. See Defend Yourself in a Car Repossession Deficiency Claim for more information. If the creditor fails to provide this notice, you should alert the court.
The collateral was not sold in a commercially reasonable manner (automobile cases). If a creditor sells a repossessed car, it must do so in a “commercially reasonable manner.” This is a fact-specific inquiry, but generally it means the seller must advertise and try to get the full value for the vehicle. If the seller sells to family or friends, or junks the car without getting an appraisal, you can challenge the creditor’s claim against you.

, You can also defend yourself by arguing that the information in the plaintiff’s complaint is wrong:You did not incur the debt. For example, if you were the victim of identity theft, then you can raise that as a defense. You are not responsible for loans someone took out while impersonating you. To strengthen your case, you should get a copy of the police report you filed when you first learned that you were the potential victim of identity theft.
You actually paid the debt. If you have paid the debt, then you can raise that as a defense. The creditor’s record-keeping might be so bad that it has not properly awarded you credit for payment. Find cancelled checks or other evidence of payment.
The amount you are sued for is inaccurate. The creditor might have calculated the amount of debt wrong. The creditor must come into court and show, using evidence, how much you owe and how the debt amount was calculated.

, You respond to the complaint by filing an answer with the court. In the answer, you respond to each allegation made by the plaintiff. Your court should have a printed “fill in the blank” answer form for you to use. Stop in and ask the court clerk.


You should also raise your defenses in the answer.For example, if the lender’s notices were deficient or if service of process was faulty, then you can state that in your answer.

, Once you have completed your answer, you should make several copies. Take the original and the copies to the court where the plaintiff filed suit. Ask the court clerk to file your answer. The clerk should also date stamp all of your copies.


You may have to pay a filing fee, which will vary by court. Ask the court clerk for the amount and acceptable methods of payment.
You will probably have to provide the creditor with a copy of your answer. Ask the court clerk for what methods of service are acceptable. Generally, you can either mail your copy of the answer or have someone personally serve it on the creditor. The server can be anyone 18 or older who is not a party to the lawsuit.
If the creditor has an attorney, then serve the copy of the answer on the attorney.

, After you file an answer, the lawsuit enters a fact-finding phase called “discovery.” During discovery, you have the right to request documents in the creditor’s possession or to ask the creditor questions (in writing or by orally questioning an employee).The discovery in a creditor’s lawsuit might be limited, since most of the evidence (such as the loan contract) should be in each party’s possession already.


You can request any documents from the creditor that you think would be helpful. For example, you might have kept terrible financial records. You could request that the creditor provide you with copies of all loan documents, as well as a schedule of your payments.
If you are in small claims court, then you might have only limited discovery. For example, you might only be able to ask for documents but not be able to ask questions orally in a deposition.

, Before trying to negotiate a settlement, you should figure out how much you can pay toward the debt. You won’t do yourself any favors if you go through the negotiation process but still can’t make payments.Accordingly, you need to calculate what you can afford to pay before contacting the creditor to negotiate.


Total up your monthly expenses—housing, childcare, medical expenses, transportation costs, food, etc. Then add up your household income from all sources.
Cut any expenses that are not absolutely necessary. For example, your entertainment budget could be cut.

, You can try to negotiate with the creditor to reduce the amount owed. Realize that you do not have a right to negotiate. The creditor can always refuse. However, you might want to call the creditor and ask if it would consider negotiating with you.


One thing you can mention is that you are thinking about filing for bankruptcy. In a bankruptcy, you can discharge most unsecured credit, such as credit card debt. If you mention that you are thinking of bankruptcy, then the creditor might feel motivated to negotiate a settlement with you., Ideally, you should aim to pay only 30-50%. Keep making counteroffers until you get the creditor down to that level. To begin, make an opening offer to pay 15% of the balance you owe.


You might have less luck negotiating with a secured creditor. A secured creditor is someone whose loan is backed by collateral which it can recover if you default on the debt.For example, a mortgage is backed by the house you bought, and a car loan is backed by the car you purchased. If a large bank holds your mortgage, then negotiating with them could be a waste of time, as the bank may require that you fill out endless paperwork before ultimately rejecting your home loan modification application., A creditor might be more willing to settle a debt if you are prepared to pay in cash in one lump sum. Let the creditor know that you have cash available and are willing to settle.


By taking the cash now, the creditor can wash its hands of you. If it rejects your offer, it must continue on with the lawsuit, which can be time consuming.

, Depending on how willing your creditor is to negotiate, you might want to consider mediation. Mediation is a form of “assisted” or “guided” settlement negotiations. The person assisting is the mediator, a neutral third party who listens to the dispute and helps the parties reach a mutually acceptable resolution.Mediation is typically voluntary, so there is little risk for giving it a chance. To find mediators, you can stop by your local courthouse to see if they run a mediation program. If they don’t, then contact your local or state bar association.

, If you and the creditor are able to come to an agreement, then make sure to get the agreement in writing.If you fail to get it in writing, then the creditor might turn around and claim never to have reached a settlement with you.

, On the day of your trial, you should plan on getting to the courthouse with at least a half hour to spare. You need to find parking and go through any security.


Before entering court, make sure your cell phone and other electronic devices have been turned off. You don’t want them making noise in the courtroom.
If you don’t know how to dress, then see Dress for a Court Hearing for tips on what a judge expects you to wear.

, If you are sued in small claims court, then you probably will not have a jury. However, if you are sued in regular civil court, then you should have the option of having a jury hear the case. The jury selection process is called “voir dire.”


During voir dire, the judge will ask the jurors basic questions about whether they can be fair and how much they know about your lawsuit. If someone knows you personally or can’t be fair, then you can ask the judge to excuse the juror for cause.
You also might have a certain number of “peremptory challenges.” You can use a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective juror from the panel without giving a reason (unless the other party claims that you are motivated by racial or gender bias in your exercise of these challenges).For example, you might want to use a peremptory challenge to remove anyone who works for a bank or other financial institution.

, The trial begins with each party making an opening statement to the jury. You should focus on telling the jury what evidence you will introduce and what the evidence proves.


For example, you might be defending yourself by claiming that you made payment: “And you’ll see the cancelled checks which the plaintiff cashed on January 2, 2015, but which were not credited to the defendant’s account.”
You cannot make an argument in your opening statement.You cannot say, “And for that reason I should win this lawsuit.” Just stick to the facts.

, You may have to testify at trial. If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will ask you questions. If you are representing yourself, then you might be able to read your testimony to the jury before having the creditor cross-examine you.


To be an effective witness, remember the following tips:Avoid speculation or guessing. If you don’t know the answer to a question, then state, “I’m not sure” or “I don’t know.”
Answer only the question asked. You shouldn’t volunteer information. Listen closely to the question and answer only that question.
Speak clearly. Look at the jury as you answer and try to make eye contact.
Always remain calm. If you become angry, then the jury might not find you credible.



, When all evidence has been submitted, you and the creditor get to make a closing argument. Your goal should be to convince the jury that the creditor has not proved that you owe the amount of money claimed.


Be sure to mention specific pieces of evidence that prove your point. For example, you could state, “The cancelled checks I showed you. Do you remember whose name was printed on the back? Keith Smith’s. And you heard from Keith Smith, who is the accounts manager for Acme Bank. He testified that he never received the check. But we have his signature on it. So the bank clearly received the check.”

, After closing arguments, the judge will read the instructions to the jury, who will retire to deliberate. In small claims court, the judge will issue a ruling from the bench.

, If you lose at trial, you have the option of bringing an appeal. Appeals can be time-consuming and costly. You will definitely need a lawyer, since appeals require technical knowledge of legal procedure.


If you want to appeal, then you should quickly meet with a lawyer to discuss your options. You might have a limited amount of time to file your Notice of Appeal. In some states, you may have only 10 days from the day final judgment is entered against you."

Apply for a state reward.",How to Report Tax Fraud Anonymously," Tax fraud involves the under-payment of any kind of taxes, including income, sales, property, or other business taxes. Tax fraud costs everyone by forcing the government to raise taxes or cut services.


While there is no definitive way to spot fraud, there are some common warning signs that someone may be committing fraud.Using cash to purchase items that are hard to trace and easy to sell. For example, antiques, collectibles, and precious metals.
Lie about their residence to avoid state income taxes. Examples of this include creating fake residences by renting post office boxes in states with no income tax.
Falsely claiming dependents. This doesn't just mean ""inventing"" children. It can also include claiming they cared for elderly relatives in an attempt to get Head of Household status and extra exemptions.
Blatantly under-report business income by not documenting sales, performing services for cash, and recording non-existent purchases of goods or supplies.
Paying employees and vendors in cash.;
, Before you can file an anonymous report for tax fraud, you need to have some basic information. The forms will ask for the name of the person or business, address, year it occurred, description of the activity, and why you believe fraud is being committed.


At this stage you can determine whether it is worthwhile to file the report. You can balance the amount of information you have versus how much information you need to file a complete report. The taxing jurisdiction is unlikely to act on a vague report with little or no details to back it up.

, The type of fraud will determine where you report it. For example, if you suspect income tax fraud, it won't help if you report it to the sales tax authority. In general, tax fraud falls into three categories: federal, state, and county.


The Internal Revenue Service has jurisdiction over individual and business income taxes. Any suspected fraud concerning income tax should be reported to the IRS. The IRS also takes reports on tax scams by paid tax preparers and other abuses.Every state has a taxing authority. It is often called the Department of Revenue, Department of Finance, or the Tax Commission. The states have jurisdiction over state income tax, sales tax, vehicle taxes, and other business taxes.The county Treasurer or Assessor is responsible for collecting property taxes and managing tax funds that are collected by the state and rebated to the county.

, The tax authority doesn't expect you to be an expert. However, you will need an idea about the type of fraud you are reporting.


The IRS provides checkbox choices on its reporting forms. Choices include false deductions, unreported income, and altered documents. For businesses, including households that hire domestic help, fraud can include failure to withhold and submit necessary employment taxes.The state will be interested in the same types of income tax fraud and sales tax fraud. For example, if a business overcharges sales tax or fails to pay it to the state.Property tax fraud can include false appraisals, lying about the use of the property, or having a senior citizen falsely listed as property owner to avoid property tax., The IRS encourages you to identify yourself and that information is kept confidential. However, the forms are clear that your identity is not required for the report to be reviewed.


If you are willing to identify yourself, you may be eligible for a reward as a whistleblower. If your information leads to the recovery of unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest, you may be eligible for a reward of up to 30 percent of the recovered amount., The IRS will not accept allegations of tax fraud by phone or online reporting. However, there are a variety of forms available depending on the type of fraud you are reporting.The Information Referral, Form 3949-A is the general form for all types of tax evasion and fraud. You can use this form to report an individual or a business. Fill out the form as completely as possible. Every bit of information aids the IRS in its investigation. You may not know details like Social Security number, but including the home address will help the agency identify the fraudster.Another common type of tax fraud is stealing Social Security numbers. If you believe your SSN has been used by another person to gain employment or file tax returns, you should use Form 14039 (or Form 14039SP in Spanish.) This is not an anonymous report. You want the IRS to help you regain your tax identity.Form 14157 is used to report complaints about a paid tax return preparer. You can report theft of refunds, incompetence in filing, falsifying documents, and failure to property complete or remit employment taxes. You are encouraged to identify yourself, but it is not required., The mailing address for each form is included in the instructions for the completing the form. Sending the form to the wrong office will severely delay, or even disqualify, your report from being reviewed.

, Whether you need the state Department of Revenue or Tax Commission, you will have to find the correct state agency and either their online tax fraud reporting website or the mailing address.To find the tax fraud reporting procedure and address, perform an online search for ""tax fraud reporting"". You can also call the general information phone number for your state government or tax authority.

, Many states have an online tax fraud reporting system. For example, California has a step by step reporting wizard that walks you through the process.Conversely, Kansas has an online form that is very simple, more like an email. In both, you are encouraged to identify yourself, but it is not a required field to submit the online report.To file a written tax fraud allegation, you need to prepare a letter with all of the information you have, including name, address, business identification, and everything you know about the fraud. Use IRS Form 3929-A as a guide in preparing your letter.

, Most counties will not have an online system. You will need to write a letter detailing what you know about the city or county tax fraud. Address it to your county Treasurer, the county commission, or if your county has a specific complaint mailing address. You can send the letter anonymously. The mailing address will be on your property tax documents or in the phone book.


At the county level, the tax fraud will most likely concern property tax or other local assessments such as tobacco or liquor taxes. Be as detailed as possible in your letter identifying the person or business, the type of fraud you suspect, and any details that you have.

, Some state governments and the federal government offer rewards for credible information that leads to a collection of unpaid taxes.If you are reporting federal tax fraud, you will need to contact the IRS' Whistleblower Office.If you are reporting state tax fraud, you will need to contact your state's department of revenue., If you wish to receive a reward for reporting tax fraud, you will need to fill out an Application for Award for Original Information (IRS Form 211).You will need to provide specific and credible information that results in the collection of taxes, penalties, and interest the non-compliant taxpayer.The IRS will keep your identity secret unless you are required to testify in open court about the tax fraud you uncovered.However, you must identify yourself in Form 211 and cannot collect a reward if you anonymously report something to the IRS., Some states also offer rewards for information about tax fraud. For example, in Florida, their Department of Revenue will reward someone who provides information that leads to an investigation that proves a violation and that leads to the collection of all the money owed.To apply for a reward, you will need to contact your state's department of revenue and ask for an award form. In Florida, you can simply go online and download the Application for Compensation for Tax Information (DR-55).The form will ask you to identify yourself and explain the violation you observed.In Florida, while you can report tax fraud anonymously, you will not be allowed to recover an award unless you provide your name."

Disclose any significant changes to your company's finances or operations.",How to Comply With the Sarbanes Oxley Act," SOX requires the boards of publicly traded companies (i.e., those listed on U.S. stock exchanges) to establish an independent committee that will be responsible for overseeing the external auditors tasked with making sure your company's finances are in order.This group of individuals will be in charge of hiring the company’s auditor, establishing the procedures that the auditor will abide by, determining compensation for the auditor, and ensuring that the auditor they hire will perform his or her job effectively.
The audit committee members by law may not have any other relationship with the company and may not receive compensation for any other services performed for the company.
It will be helpful if at least one of these members has experience or education relating to general accounting procedures, financial reporting, and the auditing process as a whole who can serve as a resource to the committee while it carries out its duties. Regardless, you must disclose whether or not your committee includes such an expert.;
, SOX requires that the individuals with the most influence over the auditing process be regularly cycled out for fresh individuals.This reduces the likelihood that any improper relationships develop that would compromise the integrity of the auditing process.

, It is important to have both your company's chief executive officer (""CEO"") and chief financial officer (""CFO"") attest to and sign your company's annual and quarterly financial statements. SOX requires these individuals to be ultimately responsible for these reports, and you must therefore ensure that these individuals are provided with the necessary information regarding your company's financials so that they can fulfill this requirement adequately. They will have to certify that:They have reviewed the financial report.
The information contained therein is accurate and fairly presented.
Such information is free from mistakes, misleading statements, and omissions of relevant facts.

, Your CEO and CFO are responsible for the internal accounting controls. They are required to report any deficiencies in internal accounting controls or any fraud involving the management of the audit committee.


Any material changes to internal accounting controls must be reported by the CEO and CFO.
Of course, this step is vital to running any successful business, but it is even more important when those executives may be personally subject to consequences for failing to understand and sign off on these issues., Employees cannot sell their stock purchased through the company’s 401K program during the blackout period.Such a blackout period usually occurs during administrative changes in the plan and lasts for several business days.

, Any attempt to destroy, alter, omit, or falsify relevant financial information or records that would thwart a federal investigation or other relevant government proceeding is prohibited under SOX.Any new audit information prepared for your company must be kept for at least five years.


You may be imprisoned for up to 20 years and have to pay fines for altering, destroying, concealing or falsifying records or documents with the intent to influence a federal investigation or bankruptcy case.

, These are issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (""PCAOB""). The PCAOB—a private-sector, nonprofit corporation created by SOX to oversee audits of publicly traded companies—sets forth requirements with which companies must comply.This employee should also monitor regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the PCAOB and sometimes promulgates its interpretations of PCAOB rules., In addition to the financial dealings included in your company's balance sheet, any financial information that is off your company's balance sheet that could potentially affect your company's finances must be disclosed under SOX.As one of SOX's primary goals is to increase investor confidence and prevent corporate fraud, any information that affects your company's financial situation in a meaningful way should be disclosed. If you are in doubt, it is always best to disclose so that your compliance with SOX or motives are not called into question.
SOX prohibits a company from providing personal loans to its directors or executive officers.This rule also extends to subsidiary companies.

, While SOX does not explicitly require you to create such standards for your high-level executives, it does require you to disclose whether or not your company has this type of code in place.Having a robust system in place to govern the actions of the senior members of your company is a great way to promote transparency and demonstrate the your company is doing its best to comply with SOX's objectives.


Any changes or waivers of the code must also be disclosed as they arise.

, This should be done by your independent auditing committee to preserve the integrity of this important process, and should be completely confidential. While you obviously will be doing your best to comply with the provisions of SOX, many companies are large in size and scope, and things can happen without management's knowledge. Having such a system in place will help your company remain on the level by allowing a certain degree of self-policing, as employees will feel they can do the right thing anonymously without fear of reprisal.


Make sure this system is truly confidential, as any adverse action taken against an employee for this type of whistleblowing activity, or for aiding in a federal investigation, is strictly prohibited under SOX., Whistleblowers are people who alert the company when there has been a breach of internal policy and/or government regulations. A whistleblower cannot be fired as a result of whistleblowing. Demoting, denying overtime, benefits, or promotion to, disciplining, failing to hire or rehire, intimidating, unfavorably reassigning, or reducing pay or hours for such an employee is also prohibited under SOX.If your employees are assured they do not have to fear reprisal for reporting instances of fraud, they will be more likely to do so. This will help your company deal with problems quickly and privately, preserving your company's reputation and compliance with SOX. Make sure that your company has a reporting and investigation process in place for instances of whistleblowing.

, These changes must be disclosed rapidly after they arise in a manner a layperson could understand.As SOX concerns itself with investor confidence, this helps your investors keep abreast of changes to your company's financial status in more-or-less real time.
Legal insider trading involving the company's directors or officers must be reported within two business days."

In class action lawsuits, the attorney for the plaintiffs are required by federal law to issue a press release with a summary of the allegations. It's likely you'll hear that you're being sued through this press release before you're served with a complaint.Contact your board of directors immediately, so they hear the news about the lawsuit first from you rather than from a press release or financial news item.Keep in mind that you may not be the only person named as a defendant in the lawsuit. As a stock broker, you typically are considered agent of the firm that employs you. This means managers or directors of the company also may be named.;
, Your company may want to hire an experienced litigation attorney to work specifically with the defense.


While your firm probably has attorneys – either on staff or on retainer – you might find greater benefit in using an independent litigation firm, depending on the severity of the allegations and the potential for criminal charges.The prospect of criminal charges also might necessitate hiring a white collar defense attorney. Keep in mind that civil and criminal litigation are two very different processes that require understanding and experience with different laws and regulations., Stock broker fraud typically is covered by the firm's Directors and Officers (D&O) liability insurance.D&O policies typically require prompt notice if a lawsuit is filed against you. Depending on your standing in the company, a director or other manager may be in charge of contacting your company's broker.The broker will need a copy of the complaint so he or she can notify your insurance carrier., Although not legally required, a press release can ensure everyone has the same information about the lawsuit and reduce the number of shareholder inquiries.Whether to issue a press release typically will be at the discretion of your firm's managers or directors.
No public statement should be made without thorough consultation with an attorney. Often these statements can backfire and if the company handles the lawsuit differently than stated in the press release it can negatively impact shareholder confidence.This might happen if, for example, you released a statement denying the allegations and stating you would vigorously defend against them, and then settled with the plaintiff a week later.

, The assistance of the company's independent auditing firm will be necessary to budget for litigation expenses.


If you are a company director or officer, make sure you have meetings with the accountants and auditors on a regular basis to apprise them of the status of the lawsuit.Plans concerning reserves can be made after you have a reasonable estimate from your defense attorney regarding the costs of litigation and the possibilities of settlement., Stock broker fraud lawsuits often go hand-in-hand with investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other federal or state agencies.


Failure to cooperate with a federal investigation may result in you losing your job or your licenses to work as a stock broker.You probably want your attorney to advise you on any statements you make to the SEC or other agencies, since whatever you say in a civil investigation may be used against you in a criminal prosecution., The plaintiff can request any written documents regarding the lawsuit that are prepared by employees of the brokerage firm.


While you may think it would be productive to figure out how the lawsuit came about or what mistakes were made so you can avoid them in the future, this type of document will likely be covered by a request for production during the discovery process, and the information contained within could be used by the plaintiff to prosecute the case.Any analysis regarding the problems that led to the lawsuit should be undertaken by your defense attorney, so any documents produced are protected by attorney-client privilege., The litigation attorney likely will want to interview company directors and employees regarding activity associated with the lawsuit.


Your defense attorney likely will perform an extensive investigation into the plaintiff's allegations and the activity within the firm. Through this investigation, he or she will determine what went wrong as well as the people or policies responsible for that failure., Some allegations or lawsuits may be barred by the agreement the plaintiff signed.


Most clients sign a contract when retaining the services of a stock broker, and this contract typically includes an arbitration clause that requires certain types of disputes to be submitted to arbitration before a lawsuit can be filed., Federal law requires you to keep all documents that are potentially relevant to the lawsuit.Issue a memo immediately to anyone who might have access to relevant documents instructing them that all documents potentially related to the lawsuit must be kept and cannot be deleted or destroyed.Make sure your defense attorney knows which employees are in charge of handling both electronic and paper documents, so he or she can communicate more specific instructions to them regarding how to deal with this material.If your company has a policy of writing over old electronic back-up tapes as new ones are created, this practice should be put on pause until the litigation has concluded., You may be able to gain some perspective from other professionals who have been involved in similar situations.


Stock broker fraud lawsuits are fairly common. You can ask your corporate counsel to connect you with others who've faced similar lawsuits and reach out to them for pointers on how to handle the lawsuit and what to expect.You also can gain an understanding of the pace of litigation and how much of your time will be taken up by dealing with the lawsuit.Keep in mind that particularly if you've been sued in a class action lawsuit, litigation moves very slowly. It could be months or even years before the case makes much progress through the courts., A basic understanding of the regulations that govern stock broker conduct and securities transactions is essential to defending yourself in a stock broker fraud lawsuit.


The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is a nonprofit organization with regulatory authority over stock brokers. The latest rules and regulations are available on the organization's website.Since traditional tort principles also apply to stock broker fraud lawsuits that involve a breach of fiduciary duty, you also should have a basic understanding of the elements of a tort claim: duty, breach, causation, and damages.Essentially, the plaintiff must prove that you had some duty to him or her, you breached that duty, and your breach caused him or her to suffer a monetary loss.In a stock broker fraud case, duty is assumed by the fact that you acted as a stock broker for the plaintiff – so the bulk of the case will focus on whether you breached that duty, and what losses the plaintiff suffered as a result.

, If the plaintiff was provided with a company prospectus or other information related to the transaction or the value of the stock, this can support a defense that the plaintiff understood the risks involved.


When a plaintiff alleges you committed broker fraud, he or she is claiming that you intentionally failed to disclose important information about the investments, or falsified investment reports or statements.All documents or information that was communicated or sent to the plaintiff provides proof that the information was not withheld.
If the correct information was provided to the plaintiff, you can show that he or she failed to evaluate the transaction thoroughly, and that his or her reliance on what the stock broker said wasn't reasonable – even if the stock broker attempted to mislead the plaintiff intentionally., If the plaintiff later approved transactions that were previously unauthorized, you can argue that the plaintiff ratified the transaction.


Essentially, the ratification defense argues that although an action was unauthorized, the plaintiff's actions after the action ratify that action, providing retroactive authority for it.For example, if the plaintiff is suing because of unauthorized transactions, you can defend yourself in that lawsuit by showing that although the plaintiff did not initially authorize the transactions, the plaintiff did not object when he or she received reports of the transactions.Generally, if the plaintiff receives regular account statements and reports, and is in regular contact with you, he or she cannot later dispute transactions by claiming that he or she wasn't aware of them or that they were conducted without authorization."

Stretch and pin the edges of your snowflake to cardboard.After soaking the snowflake, place it on the piece of cardboard and start stretching it out.,
Add glitter for decoration.,
Allow the snowflake time to dry.",How to Crochet a Snowflake," Before you get started, make sure that you have everything you will need to crochet a snowflake. You will need:White or cream colored lightweight yarn.
A size 0 crochet hook.
A darning needle.
Scissors.
Pins.
A piece of cardboard.
A bowl.
Water.
White glue (optional).;
, Slide your crochet hook under the first two loops and use it to pull the third loop under the first two. This will result in your first two loops. You will use that as the foundation to base the rest of your snowflake around.


Make sure that you keep these loops loose. Do not tighten them after you slip them off your finger.

, When you’re done, double crochet through your central loops to attach the end. To do this, insert the crochet hook into the center of the loops and loop the yarn over the crochet hook on the other side. Then, pull the yarn through with the hook to secure it to the central loops.


You should now have a chain loop extending from the loops that you made with your fingers.

, Next, chain two and then double crochet into the central loop again. Continue to follow this pattern of chaining two and double crocheting until you have five chain loops extending from your central loops. Then, finish by chaining two., Once you have five chain loops around your central loops, you will need to tighten the central loops. Doing so will create the center for your snowflake. Gently tug on the yarn, pulling the chain loops closer together. Then, pull on the tail of the yarn to finish tightening the center.

, After you have tightened the center, insert your crochet hook into the top stitch of the chain of five and crochet through it. This is called a slipstitch and it will secure the last two stitches you chained and complete your first round. You should have six spaces in the round you just crocheted. It should look a bit like a pie cut into slices.


Slip stitching is also known as joining in some crochet patterns., Chain three loops and then double crochet through the first chain two space that you made in your first round. Double crochet three stitches into this space. Then repeat this process on the next chain two space, but only chain two stitches and double crochet four stitches into the next chain two space.Continue to chain two and double crochet four times into the chain 2 space until you complete the round.

, After going around the first layer and double crocheting every four loops together, slipstitch into the space in the chain of three you made at the beginning of the round. This will secure your second round., To start adding your snowflake’s edges, you will need to move over to one of the chain two spaces. You can get to one of these spaces, by slip stitching into the outer edges of your snowflake. Insert the needle into each stitch and pull the yarn through until you have reached the chain two space., Then, slipstitch into the chain two space.

,, Next, chain seven stitches and then slipstitch these stitches into the same chain two space as you worked the last stitches into. This will be the central point of this spoke on your snowflake.

, After the chain of seven, you will need to gradually go back down in size. First, chain five and then slipstitch these stitches into the same chain two space as you worked the last ones into., For your last chain in this spoke of your snowflake, chain three and then slipstitch back into the chain two space. This will complete one spoke of your snowflake., You will need to repeat this process over each of the chain two spaces. To get to your next chain two space, slipstitch over to it as you did with the first space. Repeat your steps until you have edges on all sides of your snowflake.Follow the pattern of ch 3, slip, ch 5, slip, ch 7, slip, ch 5, slip, ch 3 slip for each chain two space.

, Take a pair of scissors and cut the yarn off near the point you ended with. Take care not to cut too close however, as you may risk unravelling the final part of the snowflake.

, Next, weave the yarn in with the existing pattern of the snowflake. This will hide any loose ends and prevent the snowflake from unravelling.


To create a loop to hang the ornament from, weave the yarn up through one of the spokes of the snowflake. Do the same with the other end as well and then tie the two pieces into a knot to form a loop.

, If you want your snowflake to hold its form, then you will need to use water or water and glue to get this effect. Start by soaking your snowflake in water or in a 50/50 mixture of white glue and water for an even stiffer snowflake.Allow the snowflake to become fully saturated, then remove it from the water or water/glue solution. Gently squeeze out the excess moisture.


Fabric stiffener (available from crafts stores) is a perfect alternative to water for this purpose., To do this, pull on the outer edges and pin each of the snowflake's outer points to the cardboard.


You will probably need to place the pins at an angle to ensure a tight hold.

, You can add glitter if you want your snowflake to be sparkly, or leave it glitter-free for a more vintage look.If you want to apply glitter, apply it while the snowflake is still wet. You can simply sprinkle some glitter over the top of your snowflake.

, Allow your snowflake to dry overnight, or at least for a couple of hours before you hang it up. Once the snowflake is completely dry, hang it on your tree, on the wall, from the ceiling, or wherever you want to display it.

Appeal, if necessary.",How to Defend Yourself in a Debt Buyer Lawsuit," A debt buyer will start a lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. In this document, the debt buyer explains the factual circumstances of the lawsuit and why the law allows the debt buyer to sue you.The debt buyer will also send you a summons along with the complaint. The summons will tell you the deadline for responding to the lawsuit.;
, To make your strongest defense, you should schedule a consultation with a lawyer. Only an experienced lawyer can help you understand what defenses you have available. To find an attorney, you can contact your state’s bar association, which will run a referral program.


Costs could be a concern. However, you should realize that many states now allow lawyers to offer “unbundled” legal services. Under this arrangement, the lawyer does not take over your entire defense. Instead, he or she will do the tasks you give them. For example, you might need a lawyer solely to draft a court motion. Or you might want a lawyer to offer you advice for trial. When you call to set up a consultation, ask if the lawyer provides “unbundled” legal services.
You can also see if there is a nearby legal aid organization. These organizations provide free assistance to people with low incomes. You should visit the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lsc.gov to check if a legal aid organization is near you.

, The costs of legal assistance may be beyond your budget. However, you should realize that many people are currently representing themselves in creditor lawsuits.Even if you choose to represent yourself, you can still meet with a lawyer, if only for a half-hour consultation. During the consultation, the lawyer can give you good tips about how to defend yourself.

, A copy of the contract between you and the original creditor should be attached to the contract. If none is attached, then the debt buyer might not be able to prove that the underlying contract exists.You can get the lawsuit dismissed if this is the case.


Sometimes debt buyers will attach other documents—like a terms and conditions mailer—and pretend that this is a legal agreement. It is not. You can defend yourself by claiming that the debt buyer has not proved a valid debt.

, You can get the case dismissed if the creditor waited too long to file the lawsuit.Every state has a “statute of limitations” for debt collection lawsuits. This statute sets the maximum amount of time someone has to file a lawsuit against you.


You can find your state’s statute of limitations by searching the Internet for “statute of limitations debt collection” along with your state.
Figuring out the relevant statute of limitations can be complicated. You should check the contract you had with the original creditor. If the debt is credit card debt, then check the cardmember agreement. These document should tell you which state’s law applies.Look for the “choice of law” provision in the contract or cardmember agreement.
If the creditor did take too much time to sue, you can use this as a defense in the answer that you file with the court.

, In some cities and states, the debt buyer must be licensed in order to operate. You should check to see if the debt buyer is licensed. If not, you can raise this as a defense.You can search for “consumer collection license” and your state on the Internet. Often, there is a search engine on your state’s Department of Banking or Department of Financial Regulation.The complaint also should contain a license number. If not, mention that fact in your answer.

, In addition to arguing that the plaintiff waited too long to sue, you can also raise other defenses against a debt buyer who sues you. Some of the more common include:


Argue that the complaint was improperly served. Each state has strict requirements for how you must be served with a complaint. In New York, for example, the debt buyer should try to serve you in person. If not, then he can leave a copy of the complaint with someone who lives in your home so long as he also mails you a second copy. If the debt collector makes service in another way—such as just mailing it to you or leaving it with a neighbor—you can have the case dismissed.Claim that the debt buyer doesn’t actually own the debt. In order to sue you, the debt buyer has to show that the original creditor legally gave it the right to sue you.Typically, debt buyers do not have adequate paperwork to prove this.
Allege that you have paid the debt. The debt buyer might not have gotten a history of payments from the original creditor and therefore is not certain how much you have paid. Again, the debt buyer must prove this in court.
Claim that the debt amount is inaccurate. Similarly, you can claim that you owe less than the debt buyer alleges. The debt buyer has the burden of proving the amount you owe.

, To respond to the lawsuit, you need to file an answer with the court. Your court may have a fill-in-the-blank answer form to use. Ask the court clerk or look on the court’s website. If the court does not have a form, then they may have a sample that you can use as a guide.


In your answer, you respond to each allegation the debt buyer raised in the complaint. Each allegation should be numbered. Take out your copy of the complaint and read each allegation. You can either admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each allegation.#*At this point, you do not need to tip your hand about what facts you will bring up a trial. Ideally, you should avoid arguing your case in the answer.However, you should raise affirmative defenses.For example, you might allege that the original creditor did not properly sell the debt to the debt buyer. Accordingly, you can raise the defense that no contract exists between you and the debt buyer.
It is important that you file an answer by the deadline listed on your summons. If you don’t respond to the lawsuit, then in many states the debt buyer can get a “default judgment” against you.This judgment allows the debt buyer to garnish your wages or put a lien on your property. Accordingly, you want to make sure to file your answer on time.

, In your answer, you can also state any counterclaims that you have against the debt buyer. You should certainly bring counterclaims if the debt buyer has used abusive conduct toward you while trying to collect the debt. Abusive practices can include:threatening to send you to jail
using abusive language
contacting your employer
suing you when the debt buyer knows the statute of limitations has expired

, After you finish drafting the answer, make three or four copies. Take your copies and the original answer to the court clerk. Tell the clerk you want to file. The clerk should stamp all of your copies with the date.


The court might charge a filing fee. This will depend on the court. You can ask the court clerk if there will be a filing fee when you pick up your answer form. If you cannot afford the fee, ask for a fee waiver.

, After you file your answer, you should send a copy of your answer to the debt buyer or its lawyer (if it has one). Ask the court clerk for acceptable methods of service.

, After you serve a copy of the answer on the debt buyer, the lawsuit enters the “discovery” phase. During discovery, you and the debt buyer request relevant documents from each other or ask each other questions. The questions can be submitted in writing (using “Interrogatories”) or orally (in a “deposition”).You should use your document requests to ask the debt buyer to turn over copies of the original contract between you and the original creditor. Also, you should request all documents that show the original creditor gave the debt buyer the right to sue. Often, debt buyers do not have these documents., To successfully negotiate, you need to estimate how much you can reasonably afford to pay on the debt. You don’t want to finish negotiation but still not be able to pay the debt.Take some time to sit down with your bills and figure out how large of a payment you can make.


First, add up all sources of income from jobs, benefits (such as disability or retirement benefits), or child support.
Next, add your monthly expenses. Be sure to include all expenses:

mortgage or rent
heating costs and other utilities
food
healthcare expenses
childcare expenses
transportation costs
other debts



, A typical debt buyer will purchase a large number of debts for pennies on the dollar. If you owe your original creditor (such as a credit card company) $1,000, then the debt buyer might have purchased that debt for $30.


For this reason, the debt buyer might not be motivated to try too hard to collect the debt. Instead, the debt buyer might be willing to settle.
Start with a low initial offer—for example, 5-10% of the face value of the debt. If you have $1,000 in debt, then offer between $50 and $100., Many debt buyers do not want to sue if they know you have a lawyer. Asking an attorney to call the debt buyer to discuss negotiation could lead to the debt buyer dropping the lawsuit.


If you want to negotiate, then avoid negotiating in the hallway outside the courtroom on your trial date. Some debt buyers try to intimidate debtors by approaching them outside the courtroom and offering to cut a deal., The debt buyer might want you to sign a new payment agreement. You should avoid doing this.


Bad debts fall off your credit report after seven years of non-payment. However, if you form a new payment agreement, then this is basically a new debt. Should you miss payments on the new debt, then the debt buyer can report you to the credit bureaus.Your credit can be damaged even more.

, The debt buyer might be willing to settle if you can offer a lump sum payment in cash. A lump sum payment is attractive because the debt buyer can get at least some money immediately without having to go through trial.

, Courtrooms are conservative places, and a judge expects to see you dressed in a conservative manner.


For example, men should plan on wearing suits (if they have one) or dress slacks with a button-up dress shirt and tie.
Women should wear a skirt or pant suit. Otherwise, women can wear slacks with a blouse or nice sweater. Women can also wear a conservative dress.
For more information, see Dress for a Court Hearing.

, You will not have a jury if you are in small claims court. However, you can probably have a jury hear your case if your case is heard in regular civil court.


During jury selection, the judge calls up a panel of prospective jurors and asks them questions. For example, the judge will ask if the jurors know either party and if they can be impartial. If you think a juror is biased, then you can ask the judge to excuse the juror for cause.
The judge will also ask them questions about their jobs and hobbies. Listen closely to this information. If a juror has worked for a bank or a collection agency, then you should think about excusing that juror. Although you can’t excuse them for cause, you can use a “peremptory challenges.”
The judge will probably give you a certain number of peremptory challenges, which you can use to excuse a juror without having to give a reason., The trial starts with the debt buyer’s attorney delivering an opening statement. You will be able to deliver an opening statement second.


If you are in small claims court, then the judge will probably just ask the debt buyer what the case is about. As the party bringing the lawsuit, the debt buyer will go first. You should not interrupt but listen closely to what is said.

, You might have to testify at trial. If you hired a lawyer, then he or she will question you. In small claims court, you will simply tell your side of the story to the judge, who may ask you questions.


If you have to testify, then remember these tips for giving effective testimony:Don’t guess if you don’t know an answer. Instead, tell the lawyer, “I don’t know.”
Speak clearly. You want the jury to be able to hear you. Sit up straight and look the jurors in the eye as you answer.
Don’t volunteer information. Instead, listen to the question and answer as briefly as possible.
Always tell the truth. A skilled lawyer can trip you up in half-truths, so always be upfront and truthful in everything you say.



, After all evidence has been submitted, the debt buyer will give a closing argument. You go second. Your purpose in closing argument is to convince the jury that the debt buyer doesn’t have a valid legal claim and that you do not owe the debt buyer any money.

, When all evidence has been presented, the judge will give the jury instructions. The jury then retires to deliberate. If you are in small claims court, then the judge will rule on the case from the bench.

, You might want to file an appeal if you lose at trial. However, you should talk this over with a lawyer. Appeals can take over a year to complete. In the meantime, you might have to pay the debt buyer the money owed as you wait for the resolution of the appeal.


If you want to appeal, then you should file your Notice of Appeal form quickly. You typically do not have a lot of time. Depending on the state, you might only get 10 days from the entry of the final judgment in order to file for an appeal."

Observe the sky.,
Celebrate the light.,
Honor the sun.,
Make a flower crown.,
Start a garden.,
Visit a local farm.,
Play in the water.",How to Celebrate the Summer Solstice1," From an astronomical point of view, the summer solstice occurs sometime between June 20-21 in the Northern Hemisphere, and December 21-22 in the Southern Hemisphere. Find out exactly when it will take place based on the year and your location, and spend time outdoors to witness the summer solstice.;
, Spend time outdoors in the sun and give thanks for the light that guides our days. Make an altar of light by arranging candles, summer flowers, and tangerines in a beautiful outdoor space. Allow the tangerines to soak up the sun so you can enjoy them later., The summer solstice is a great time to honor the sun. You can make solstice sun tea by adding edible flowers and herbs to a jar filled with water, then leave it out in the sun to steep. You can also make a sun mandala with petals from orange and yellow flowers. Arrange the petals in decorative, circular patterns while maintaining a vision of peace and serenity., Collect flowers from your garden or get some from a garden shop. Choose flowers with thin stems and fragrant blossoms. To make the crown:Take your first flower and gently split the stem in half, about two-thirds of the way up the stem, to create a small hole. The hole should be just large enough to fit a stem through.
Take your second flower and stick the stem through the hole you just made. Then split that stem to create a small hole for the next flower stem to fit into.
Continue to add more flowers in the same fashion. To finish, create a larger hole that will fit a whole flower through and thread your first flower through the last stem. Trim the ends if needed.

, The summer solstice is the perfect time to start a garden. Prepare your soil to receive plants by tilling and mixing in compost or fertilizer. Select plants from your local garden shop, or ask your friends or neighbors for cuttings from their gardens. Then:Dig holes large enough for each plant, and be sure to leave enough space for the plants to grow.
Gently place the plants in the holes and fill in the space with dirt or fertilizer.
Water the newly-planted flowers gently, and enjoy your garden.

, Go to a local farm in order to appreciate how the sun gives life. Pack a picnic and enjoy the sights and smells. Another great activity to do at a farm is to pick sun-ripened berries. You could also volunteer to pull weeds or help the farmers with their chores., Salute the sun while you wade in the water. Visit a local river, lake, waterfall, or even the beach and enjoy the scenery. Float in the water, swim, or simply sit near it and watch for wildlife. Build a sandcastle, make a rock cairn, or gather wildflowers. Use your senses to explore the nature surrounding you, and take note of sights, smells, sounds, tastes, and touches."

Do yoga or meditate.,
Seek fulfillment from your life.,
Start a gratitude journal.,
Learn new ways to heal.,
Focus your energy on positive changes.",How to Celebrate the Summer Solstice2," The summer solstice is a great time to find inner peace and balance. Try the sun salutation and the tree pose or simply sit quietly for a while. Meditation and yoga are intended to exercise both your body and your soul, balancing both in harmony through thought and physical movement. Begin this routine on the morning of the summer solstice and aim to make it a daily habit from this time on.

, The summer solstice heralds the beginning of summer, which also represents the time of fulfillment. This is an excellent time to take stock of your life and assess how your goals are progressing. From earlier New Year's resolutions to the big goals in your life, ask yourself how you're doing in achieving these things for yourself and others you care about.Are you still aligned with your goals or have you strayed from them? Take this opportunity to reinvigorate them and to make any necessary changes to achieve your aims in life.
Be honest with your goal appraisal––set aside those goals that aren't taking you in the direction you want to go now. We all grow and change over time; make sure you're not hanging onto goals that no longer fit the person you have become.

, Keeping a gratitude journal can remind you of all the positive things in your life. Write down things and people you are thankful for, as well as abilities or qualities you possess that you are grateful. Jot down positive experiences you have had as well. Try to recognize all the good and wonderful things in your life, to help you better notice fulfillment when you feel it., The summer solstice is a great day to decide to learn more about a healing technique that has interested you for a while, such as reiki, therapeutic massage, or acupuncture. You could go to a session and try a new healing therapy for something that ails you, be it stress, pain, etc. Alternatively, if you would like become a practitioner in healing arts, look for courses that you can take.

, The stability of summer and the promise of balmy, warmer days ahead is considered to be a time to develop yourself, to set yourself free, and to nurture yourself. Take the easier nature of summer as a reason to make greater efforts to make positive changes.


Refresh your home by creating a new layout. Rearrange furniture or swap out pieces for things you have stored in your attic or basement. Add new accents, like pillows, art, lamps, etc. Get rid of clutter, but keep things that bring you joy.
Readjust your nutrition intake using the fresh fruits and vegetables of summer as your base. Use this opportunity to align your thinking about food to one that involves eating more greens, locally grown foods and organic foods and eating less processed foods.
Find an exercise that you really click. Choose something that you enjoy doing, rather than something you suffer through. Think about meditation, yoga, swimming, running, or riding a bicycle.

Plan to travel.,
Make a solstice feast.,
Throw a party with a bonfire.",How to Celebrate the Summer Solstice3," Consider spending summer solstice away from home, at one of the key destinations where the summer solstice has been celebrated for centuries, or at the site of a solstice festival. Many countries, such as Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, hold summer festivals in which people dance around a midsummer Maypole and decorate their homes with greenery, flowers, and tree branches.Britain's Stonehenge is a must for the avid observer of the summer solstice, and thousands of people celebrate the day as the sun rises. Stonehenge aligns with the sunrise on the solstice, making for spectacular viewing.
An ancient sun temple was discovered in 2006 in Cairo, Egypt. Consider visiting this landmark and participating in local summer solstice activities.Iceland hosts a “secret” three-day music festival on the solstice.In Russia, the solstice is celebrated by a three-month “White Nights” festival in which opera and ballet are performed.In Peru and Ecuador, the Incan Sun Festival takes place over the summer solstice.In the U.S., the Cleveland Museum of Art (in Ohio) has music performances and late-night viewings on the summer solstice, and a Summer Solstice Music Festival is hosted in Santa Barbara, California., Invite your friends and family to come celebrate the solstice with you. Go to local farms or markets and choose the freshest ingredients for your feast. Make dishes using items the color of the sun, like lemons, squash, papayas, corn, oranges, bananas, carrots, peppers, peaches, apricots, cantaloupe, pumpkin, mangoes, grapefruit, and sweet potatoes., A bonfire is part of the tradition of the summer solstice. Fire has always been a source of protection for human beings, scaring off the beings of the night, both real and magical. Nowadays, you can reinvent the bonfire as a great reason to hold a summer solstice party with friends.Just be sure to choose a location where it is both safe and permitted to burn a bonfire––check with the local authority first and be sure there isn’t a fire ban due to the dry conditions.

Consider filing an appeal.",How to Defend Yourself in a Mortgage Loan Fraud Lawsuit," The borrower will start the lawsuit by filing a complaint or petition in court. This document will explain the factual allegations surrounding the lawsuit. The borrower who filed the lawsuit is called the “plaintiff.”


In some situations the United States government will sue as plaintiff.These cases are particularly serious, since the government is usually seeking much more money than a single borrower would.
The plaintiff should send you a copy of the complaint, along with a summons. The summons will tell you how much time you have to respond to the lawsuit.;
, If you don’t meet the deadline for responding to the lawsuit, then the plaintiff could get a default judgment against you. This means that the plaintiff can win the lawsuit without you ever having a chance to come into court and defend yourself.


To protect against a default judgment, start planning your defense immediately and write down the deadline for filing your response.

, Borrowers can sue for a variety of mortgage lending practices that harm them. Go through the complaint and identify which practices the plaintiff alleges you used. Common fraudulent or predatory practices include:Encouraging applicants to lie on their applications, e.g., to lie about their income or expenses.
Convincing borrowers to refinance a loan many times and increasing the payments each time.
Charging fees for nonexistent products or for excessive costs. For example, you include hidden clauses which require the borrower to pay broker fees regardless of whether a mortgage ever closes.
Failing to include Truth in Lending statements, Good Faith Estimates, and a Special Information Booklet.
Pressuring borrowers in an aggressive manner to take out higher-risk loans. These loans can include balloon loans, interest-only payments, and loans with high pre-payment penalties.
Using a false appraisal to sell a property for more than it is worth.
Targeting a borrower knowingly with an offer to refinance their property when you know the borrower needs cash for reasons related to debt, medical issues, or unemployment.

, To build your best defense, you need to review all documents related to the borrower and the mortgage loan. Go through your files and copy all paperwork that relates to the plaintiff. Get the following:the mortgage application
the appraisal on the property
HUD settlement sheets
IRS Form 4506 (which authorizes the release of prior tax returns)
verification of employment paperwork
verification of deposits
a title opinion
mortgage documents and deeds
your notes during any meeting
any communications related to the plaintiff (such as emails to colleagues or letters to the plaintiff)

, You should quickly contact your attorney. If you work for a large bank or mortgage company, then you should have general counsel on staff. Call and schedule an appointment.


Smaller businesses often keep a lawyer “on retainer.” This means that your business pays the lawyer a monthly fee in exchange for the lawyer always being ready to help you.Ask a supervisor if you keep a lawyer on retainer.
If you need to hire a lawyer, then ask other businesses in your industry if they would recommend their attorney.

, You should work closely with your lawyer to come up with your best defenses. In a mortgage loan fraud lawsuit, you have several defenses:


Your best defense is that you did not engage in any fraudulent or predatory practices. For example, if you have been accused of encouraging borrowers to lie about their incomes, then you can defend yourself by showing how you double-checked the borrower’s income and refused to approve applications where the income was inadequate.
You can also argue that although loan documents contain errors, those errors were not significant. The legal term is that they were not “material” to the decision whether to offer a mortgage loan or not.
You can also have a lawsuit dismissed if the plaintiff waited too long to sue. A “statute of limitations” is the amount of time that a plaintiff has to bring a lawsuit. In the context of mortgage loan fraud, there are different statute of limitations depending on what law the plaintiff sues under. For example, some federal laws give the government 10 years to bring a lawsuit., Your lawyer will formally respond to the lawsuit by drafting an answer. In the answer, you go through each allegation in the complaint and either admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each allegation.You can also raise any defense, e.g., the statute of limitations has expired.

, Your lawyer will file the answer in court. The plaintiff must also be sent a copy of your answer., It might be in your best interest to settle the dispute outside of court. For example, if you are being sued for a lot of money, then you run the risk of losing at trial. However, the plaintiff might be willing to settle the dispute for a fraction of what she is seeking in the lawsuit.


During settlement negotiations, you and the plaintiff will meet with your lawyers to see if you can hammer out a deal. Negotiations involve giving up something to get something in return. You are unlikely to leave negotiations without having to pay the plaintiff money.
If it is important for you that a court clear you of any wrongdoing, then you might not want to negotiate. However, be aware that successful negotiations can make the lawsuit go away much faster than a trial.

, Your lawyer should prepare extensively. If you have the money, you might want to hire an attorney who specializes in negotiations to represent you.


Effective negotiations requires that you come up with your “walkaway” number.This is the maximum amount that you would be willing to pay to settle the lawsuit. If the plaintiff cannot meet that number, then you step away from negotiations.
To come up with your walk away number, your lawyer will analyze the strength of your case. If the plaintiff does not have strong evidence of fraud, then you might want to set your walkaway number lower than if the plaintiff has strong evidence.

, You might want to mediate the dispute instead. Mediation is a form of “assisted negotiation.” The mediator is a neutral third party who meets with you and the plaintiff. You explain the dispute and the mediator attempts to guide the parties to a solution they can both accept.


The mediator doesn’t act as a judge. Nor does the mediator have any power to declare one party the winner and force the other to pay money. Mediation is entirely voluntary.Mediation is also confidential. This means that statements made during mediation cannot be used against you later at trial. For this reason, you might want to give mediation a chance.

, If negotiation or mediation is successful, then your lawyers will work on drafting a settlement agreement. This agreement is a contract.Both you and the plaintiff will agree to something. Typically, you will agree to pay the plaintiff some money and the plaintiff will agree to withdraw the lawsuit.


Also make sure that your lawyer includes a release in the settlement agreement. This release is an agreement that the plaintiff will not turn around and file another lawsuit based on the same allegations.

, You might have the option of arbitrating the dispute instead of going through a trial. In arbitration, you and the plaintiff present your case to an arbitrator (or panel of arbitrators). The arbitrator acts like a judge.


Arbitration is most like a trial. The arbitrator’s decision is binding, which means you must abide by it. If you or the plaintiff fail to abide by the arbitrator’s decision, then the other party can sue in court.
Advantages of arbitration include that it is private and that arbitration goes faster than a trial.For example, you can arbitrate a dispute in a year whereas a full trial in court might take 18 months or more.
If you are interested in arbitration, then tell your lawyer. Your lawyer can propose arbitration to the plaintiff.

, If you are sued by the federal government, then you will probably need to hire expert witnesses. It is unlikely that the government will sue you on behalf of one borrower; instead, the government will sue because your practices have affected thousands of borrowers.


Accordingly, you will probably need a forensic accountant or other expert to go through all of the mortgage loans that you have made, possibly over the period of several years.
You might also need a legal expert to testify as to whether you followed federal or state mortgage lending laws. The expert can also offer an opinion on whether your lending practices were up to industry standards.If you need an expert, then your attorney should be familiar with experts who will testify for the defense.

, Your lawyer can file motions before court to limit what the plaintiff can say at trial. For example, your lawyer should make a motion to prevent the plaintiff from using the term “mortgage fraud” at trial.This term is unduly prejudicial. It is also not accurate—there is technically no federal “mortgage fraud” offense.
You can also have other prejudicial terms, such as “fraudulent flipping,” also prohibited.

, The judge will call a panel of prospective jurors to sit in the jury box and then ask them questions. The purpose of the judge’s questions is to feel out whether the juror can be impartial. Accordingly, the judge will ask if the juror knows either party or whether the juror already has any knowledge of the case.If you think a juror cannot be fair, then you can ask the judge to dismiss the juror for cause.
You will also have a limited number of “peremptory challenges” to use. With these challenges, you can excuse a potential juror without having to give the judge a reason.You also might be able to give the judge questions to ask the jurors. Because jury selection is so important, your lawyer will prepare extensively for it. She might even hire a jury selection expert. If your lawyer has questions for the jury, the questions will probably be focused on the juror’s feelings about banks or mortgage companies and whether the juror has had a negative experience with a bank. You can then use a peremptory challenge on those prospective jurors who admit to such negative experiences.

, Both parties make opening statements to the jury. Your lawyer will tell the jury what evidence will be presented and its overall significance to the case.You can expect the opening statement to be fairly brief, unless you are being sued by the government in a case involving complicated facts and a large amount of loans. In that situation, your lawyer will have a lot of information to lay out for the jury.

, The plaintiff presents evidence first, usually in the form of witnesses and documents. After the plaintiff’s lawyer asks the witness questions, your lawyer will be able to cross-examine. The focus on cross-examination will differ depending on the witness.


For example, if the borrower testifies about what you said during a meeting, then your lawyer will try to undermine the witness’s credibility. For example, the witness might claim that you intimidated her into signing a high-interest loan. Your lawyer can undermine the witness’s testimony by pointing to contradictions in the testimony. If the witness waited a week to sign the mortgage, then this evidence shows that she didn’t sign for the loan because of your intimidation a week earlier.
Your lawyer can also cross-examine any expert witnesses. Your lawyer can challenge the witness’s credentials and experience. Also, your lawyer will work closely with your own expert to come up with questions to undermine the testimony of the plaintiff’s expert.

, After the plaintiff finishes presenting his case, the defense can present witnesses. Your defense will probably consist of expert testimony.


You might have to testify, in particular if you were the agent who made the mortgage loan. If you do have to testify, then remember the following tips:Never guess when answering a question. If you don’t know the answer, then say so.
Understand the question before answering. If the question is vague, then ask the lawyer to phrase it differently.
Sit still and speak clearly. You don’t want to do anything distracting in front of the jury.
Stop talking if someone objects. Attorneys might object if a question is out-of-bounds. You should wait for the judge to rule on the objection before answering.



, After all evidence has been submitted, the parties will make closing arguments to the jury. Your lawyer will try to persuade the jury that the evidence commands a result in your favor.

, The judge will read the jury its instructions and then send the jury off to consider the evidence presented. If you are sued in federal court, then the jury’s verdict must be unanimous. Depending on your state, the verdict may not need to be unanimous in state court., If you lose the jury trial, then you might want to bring an appeal. In the appeal, you can tell the appellate court what errors the trial judge made and why these errors warrant a new trial.


Appeals can be quite expensive, so you should discuss the strength of your case with your lawyer.
For example, if the judge made an obvious mistake—admitting evidence which he shouldn’t have—then you might find it worthwhile to bring an appeal. By contrast, if the judge made no significant error, you might want to simply pay the judgment entered against you.

Grow your own potatoes.",How to Celebrate the International Year of the Potato," The potato is being hailed as a very useful food crop that can be easily grown in many parts of the world as a source of nutritious food. The benefits of potatoes include:


They're global favorites: potatoes have been transported all around the world, and can be grown almost everywhere.
Efficient: growing potatoes means being able to produce more nutritious food and in harsher environments than any other major food crop. ""Up to 85 percent of the plant is edible human food, compared to around 50% in cereals"".Nutritious: potatoes are good for you. They are rich in carbohydrates, which provide long-term energy, and they have the highest protein content for the root and tuber family, ""with an amino-acid pattern that is well matched to human requirements"".Increasing future demand: eating potatoes is on the rise around the world, indicating that potatoes will become more and more important as a substantial food crop.;
, The potato has been a firm favorite all over the world for centuries. In the 1800's in Ireland, potatoes were the staple diet. In the summer of 1846, a blight struck the potato crops, leading to the Irish Potato Famine. The fungus which infected the potatoes was so devastating that every potato in Ireland was said to be destroyed.Hundreds starved to death because of the blight, and nearly one million immigrated to America during the famine years Others immigrated to England, Canada and Australia, never to return again. The potato took a starring role in this very significant historical event.

, Did you know the potato's Latin name is ' 'solanum tuberosum' '? How about that it belongs to the ""nightshade"" family of plants, making it a relative of other edible favorites like the tomato and the eggplant? , There are many varieties of potatoes and different potatoes are suitable for different uses. There are potatoes suitable for baking, roasting, boiling, mashing, steaming and frying. Ask at your local potato distributor for information on the best types of potato for your cooking needs.

, Potatoes get an undeserved bad rap, as some say they contain too much fat, and aren't part of a healthy diet. But that's not true. Potatoes are low in fat; it is what you put on a potato that can make it fattening. But potatoes easily satisfy hunger cravings quickly in small portions, making them good for dieters. Potatoes contain many micronutrients, including vitamin C, iron, B1, B3, B6 and minerals such as potassium, phosphorus and magnesium, and contain folate, pantothenic acid and riboflavin. In addition, potatoes contain valuable dietary fiber and antioxidants to help prevent age-related diseases., The method that you use for cooking potatoes impacts on the nutrition level of the potato.


Boiling causes a big loss of vitamin C, especially for peeled potatoes.
Frying potatoes and making French fries/chips reduces the mineral and ascorbic acid content and causes the potato to absorb a lot of fat.
Baking causes a higher loss of vitamin C than boiling, but retains other vitamins and minerals., Get cooking! Almost everyone loves the potato in some form or other, and you can put your culinary skills to use cooking potatoes at home. Look for potato recipes on wikiHow, and share some of your favorite ones with family and friends.

, Potatoes are easy to cultivate, and children can also join in the fun of planting them and watching them grow. For more details on growing potatoes for yourself, see our article Plant Potatoes.

Understand the meanings associated with the autumnal equinox.,
Consider staying up during the night to welcome autumn.,
Build or set up a monument to autumn.,
Be creative.,
Make a list of your inner harvest.,
Express your fall awe.,
Contemplate.,
Seek to improve your health.,
Turn your home into a haven.,
Honor your ancestors.,
Get into your garden.",How to Celebrate the Autumn Equinox," This is the day when both the daytime and nighttime are of the same length, which has been long interpreted to mean that the world is in balance. Once the autumnal equinox passes, the nights begin to get longer and the temperatures will start to fall. Autumn is a time of dual purpose––it is time to gather the main harvests and it is time to determine what is needed for the upcoming winter. This is also about balance and as such, fall is considered the season of balance, a time during which you can restore balance to your own life.;
, Many people like to welcome in fall by remaining awake all night, to honor the equal length of day and night. Perhaps tie this in with a celebration with friends, by holding a small dinner party which features autumn flavors, such as squash, pears and apples. If you're not so keen on an all-night vigil, stay up until midnight instead.

, If you want to share your joy at the arrival of fall, consider building or placing a monument featuring autumnal items like pumpkins and straw in your yard. Ideas for what to do include a scarecrow or an animal you like, a pattern, or even spelling out words such as ""Welcome to fall!"". Your monument could also be an expression of your gratitude for the harvest from the Earth.

, For those who love craft, it's a great time to start some fall-inspired craft. There are all sorts of fall crafts you might like to try. A few ideas include: Carve some shrunken apple heads, make leaf prints, craft a fall wreath, frame fall foliage for decoration and use harvested corn to make corn stalk decorations. For those who love food craft, fall is the ideal time to get into making preserves, pickles, bottles of drink, sauces and frozen goodies.

, An inner harvest refers to all the achievements and experiences that you have had or felt during the past few seasons. This is a way of restoring gratitude into your life, as you realize what you have done and how you have coped with challenges during the past months.


Take this opportunity to consolidate your energy and to fine-tune what you've achieved since spring.
Be grateful for what you have.

, If you're a photographer, artist or writer, try to capture the essence of fall in photo, artwork or word form. Don't just focus on the changing leaves and bountiful harvests; consider the deeper meanings of the season as they resonate with you. Perhaps this is a time of necessary change for you and expressing this through your creativity is a great way to get started.

, This is a season when the buzzing activity of summer dies down and the excitement of life outdoors begins to relax into the more evenly paced, more predictable rhythm of fall. Think about the ways you have neglected your inner growth and how this might be remedied.


Meditate or do tai-chi. Try to find your balance, in the same way that the world finds its balance on the autumnal equinox.

, This is as good a time as any to restore healthful balance to your life. There are delicious foods from harvest to help you cleanse and keep to a healthy diet at this time of year, such as apples, grapes, peaches, plums, pears, watermelon, celery, squash, eggplants, tomatoes, zucchini, bell peppers and more. All of these healthy foods can be incorporated into a healthful lifestyle diet that keeps you fit and energetic. Where you can, support the growers of organic produce, which helps to sustain healthier soils and wildlife as part of the growing balance.


Weigh yourself. On the day of the fall equinox, the sun enters the sign of Libra, the constellation of scales. Are you happy with the weight reflected back at you? If not, what do you wish to do about it?
If you're not already exercising regularly, make today the day you begin exercising again. Start with gentle exercise that allows you to ease into the rhythm, such as stretches, walking yoga or pilates. Take up an exercise that you've long wanted to try, such as cycling, jogging or swimming. Most sports can be continued either outdoors or in indoor arenas during winter, so don't let the colder days ahead put you off sparking this change.
Focus on improving your breathing and posture. Good breathing and posture will help to restore energy to your body and can help you cope better with the respiratory illnesses the colder months bring.

, Fall is the time of the year when people begin to turn from outdoor pursuits and start moving back indoors more often. (Of course, this shouldn't stop you from making the most of the glorious sunny fall days outside!) This is a good time to restore balance in the home, to give it a spruce up before the upcoming fall celebrations such as Halloween and Thanksgiving come and before winter arrives. Add some fall decorations to bring on the festive fall spirit.


Bring more light into your home. As the days will start to shorten from the autumnal equinox, consider how you'll be able to bring more light into your home. Consider making some homemade candles and check out ways to hold back window dressings so that more light can stream inside. Good lighting will keep your spirits buoyed.
Don't neglect the energies in your workplace either. Now is a good time to clear out the clutter on the desk, shift around furniture and even trade places with another person. Remove things that have piled up in corners, replace worn signs and refresh the communal drink and food items.

, In Japan, it is traditional to visit the graves of ancestors around the time of the autumn equinox. This is a thoughtful tradition to build on for your own life, as a way of reconnecting with the past of your family and to remind yourself of your valuable place in the family tree.

, After summer and after the harvests, your garden needs some tender loving care to ready it for winter. The autumnal equinox is a good day to jot down a plan for the following weeks of garden care ahead, to keep you organized and enthused about readying it for the colder months. It's also the ideal time to plant some crops that will produce during fall or even into winter, such as cauliflower, lettuce, red beet, radishes and shallots. Plan for when spring bulbs should be planted too, as many must be dug into the ground during fall.

Compare the demand with your own paperwork, receipts, notes or whatever records you may have., If you know that you owe the debt and if the demand seems accurate, then your choices are limited. If you do not agree that the demand is correct, then you need to try to find out what prompted the demand and resolve the problem before the matter escalates.Pay the debt if it is owed, and if you can. If the demand is accurate, and if you can pay it, then the best course of action is to pay it and put the dispute to rest. If you pay the debt in full, make sure that you get a receipt from the creditor that verifies payment in full. When you send payment, include a letter that says, “I understand that this payment is in full satisfaction of the outstanding debt.”Bargain for a lower payment. You may agree that you owe the debt, but be unable to pay it in full. If you contact the creditor, you may be able to reach an agreement for a lower amount, or some payments over time. Be careful, at this negotiation stage, not to admit anything that the creditor may be able to use against you in court. It is a good idea to get legal help with this step.
Challenge the debt, if it is incorrect. If you do not agree with the demand, you should reply in writing. Be clear about your dispute. If you agree to some lower amount, say so, and the creditor may accept that as a final resolution. If you dispute the debt completely, ask the creditor to clarify the demand with any documents that can prove the issue. Be polite in your response, and be clear about the facts that you dispute.

, Dealing with legal issues like this, it is a good idea to have professional advice and support. If you can afford an attorney, or if you can reach out to a legal aid service, you should do so. It is an unfair fact of life that if an attorney calls a creditor on your behalf, the creditor is more likely to respond favorably and reasonably. If you call on your own, you are more likely to get bullied.

, Depending on who the creditor is and the amount that is in dispute, you may choose to make contact by telephone, or in writing. If you make your initial contact by telephone, you should always confirm whatever was said in writing.For example, if your landlord has sent a demand for one month’s rent, this is a fairly small matter. You may be able to call the landlord on the phone, discuss the issue, and reach an agreement.
If the demand is from a company collecting on a $15,000 past due credit card bill, that is another matter. For that amount, you should put your response in writing. If you are represented by an attorney, the attorney may contact the collection office directly to discuss the debt, but if you call on your own you are not likely to be treated favorably. Keep it in writing.

, If you resolve the demand, whether for full payment, partial payment, or even no payment (if the creditor agrees that you do not owe the money), make sure that you get something in writing. You don’t want this coming back up again in a year and have to deal with it all again., Even while you are attempting to negotiate a resolution to the debt, if the creditor filed a complaint against you for collection, you should begin preparing an answer to the complaint. In most states, you have only 20 or 30 days to file your answer with the court.If you do not file an answer within the time limit, the creditor could get a default judgment against you, and you will lose any further opportunity to challenge the claim.

, The complaint should be written in a format that makes individual legal statements in individually numbered paragraphs. In your answer, you should follow the same numbering system and respond briefly and clearly to each allegation. In some cases, your responses may be as brief as “Admitted” or “Denied.” If you have something to add in response, you may do so., The answer is also your time to raise what are called affirmative defenses. These are your reasons, beyond simply admitting or denying the plaintiff’s allegations, to support your assertion that you do not owe the debt. Some standard affirmative defenses are:


There has been an accord and satisfaction. In other words, this means that you believe the debt has been paid or settled already. Provide the facts that support your defense--when you paid it, how much you paid, and who received the payment.
Failure of consideration. This is a legal phrase in contract law that means the plaintiff did not give what he or she was supposed to give in exchange for your debt.
Statute of limitations. This may be the most commonly used defense. If the debt is very old, the plaintiff may have lost the opportunity to collect in court. The time for a creditor to collect on most credit cards or contracts varies from state to state, but generally ranges from 3 years up to 10 years. If the time has passed since your debt was due, you may be able to raise this defense., Make sure that you deliver a copy of your answer to the plaintiff within the time limit set by your court's rules. The summons that you received with the initial complaint should have the date for your response. Keep a signed copy for your files as well.

, Discovery is a portion of the lawsuit when each side has the opportunity to ask the other for information about the case. Contrary to what happens in the movies and on television, there are not supposed to be any surprises for anyone when a case gets to trial. During the discovery phase, the parties are allowed to ask each other questions, review documents and evidence, and interview witnesses.The citations in this section are generally to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This is the set of rules that directs trial preparation in federal court. Each state has a similar set of Rules of Civil Procedure. You should become familiar with the set of rules that controls the court where your case is filed.

, You have the opportunity to ask your opponent 25 to 30 questions about the case. These should be questions that are designed to learn about the evidence your opponent has, the witnesses he or she intends to call at trial, and anything else that you need to know in order to prepare your defense.Some typical questions to pose as interrogatories may be:


”What contracts do you have that create an obligation by the defendant? Identify each contract by its date, the names of the parties signing it, and a brief description of its purpose.”
”Identify all witnesses you intend to present at trial, giving their name, occupation, relation to the plaintiff, and a brief description of their testimony relative to this case.”

, In most jurisdictions, you are allowed to make an unlimited (within reason) request for the plaintiff to provide you with copies of documents. The plaintiff has 30 days to respond to your request.A sample document request might be, “Provide the original and any copies of all contracts you have that you claim create an obligation by the defendant.” Whether you actually need the original is up to you and your attorney. In some cases, if the veracity of your signature is an issue, for example, you may actually want to examine the original, analyze the ink, etc.

, A deposition is your opportunity to call in a witness or a party to the case and directly ask questions in person. This is useful, if there is someone who is likely to have a great deal of information about the case, beyond what you can ask in 30 interrogatories. A deposition can be expensive, however, because you need to pay for a court stenographer to record a transcript of the deposition, and this can cost several hundred dollars. Before taking this step, have in mind what you expect to get from it, and make sure that it is worth the time and expense., At the same time that you are preparing your case and sending discovery requests (if you choose to do so), your opponent may be sending the same sorts of requests to you. Be sure to reply to them in a timely fashion. If you fail to respond by the deadline, the court may impose sanctions against you. Possible sanctions are monetary fines, an order finding you in contempt of court, or you may lose the opportunity to present certain issues in your defense at trial. Do not treat discovery requests lightly., After your discovery is complete, you will likely get a notice from the court for a pre-trial meeting or pre-trial conference. This is a time for you and the plaintiff to meet with the judge and plan the trial. You will each be prompted to present lists of evidence and witnesses, and to prepare an agreed statement of the legal and factual issues that are to be decided at the trial. This is often a good opportunity for a final settlement to take place.

, At the trial, the plaintiff will present his facts and evidence, and then you will present yours. Depending on the court you are in, there may or may not be a jury and may or may not be opening statements. If it is just a small claims court, then you will each just present your information and whatever evidence you have. But if the amount of the dispute is larger, you could be in a higher level court with more formalities. At the end of the trial, the judge or jury will declare its decision.

, If you won the trial and got the debt erased, congratulations. However, if the decision goes against you, then instead of a “regular” debt, you will have a formal court judgment against you. If you can, you should pay it as soon as you can. Under some circumstances, your debt may begin accruing interest right away.A judgment remains valid for collection for up to 20 years, depending on the state where it issued., Once a judgment has entered against you, your chances of convincing the creditor to accept less than full payment will generally drop. A creditor with a judgment has more power to seize any non-exempt assets you may own, including bank accounts, property, cars or other things. If you can come up with a settlement, you may be able to prevent this. Depending on your financial status, a reasonable creditor may be willing to accept a reasonable settlement. If you have limited assets or limited earnings, the creditor may realize that there are limits to collection. Contact the creditor again and offer to make some payment on the judgment. The creditor may be willing to accept a payment plan over time, if it is reasonable., When you get either a demand or a complaint from a creditor, you need to consider the validity of the demand. If it is a valid claim, then fighting the demand in court may be little more than a waste of time. You might need to file bankruptcy to discharge the debt, along with others that you owe.

, In many cases, a single demand from a single creditor is often just the tip of the iceberg, with additional, similar demands to come soon. You need to take a realistic look at your assets and your debts. Add up everything you own -- house, car, valuable personal property, cash in bank accounts. Then make a list of all your debts -- college loans, other personal loans, car loan, home mortgage, outstanding credit card bills. If the debts outweigh the assets, then it may be a good idea to consider filing bankruptcy., Bankruptcy is a fairly straightforward legal process, but it is always a good idea to enlist the help of a professional. If you have not hired an attorney yet, this may be a good time to do so. If you do not know someone, you may be able to contact the bankruptcy court clerk’s office. They sometimes maintain a list of attorneys who take cases on referral or who provide free or reduced-fee legal services., There is a lengthy packet of papers that you must complete and file to start a bankruptcy case. They consist of a single page called the “bankruptcy petition,” and then several “schedules,” which list your assets, your creditors, your outstanding loans, and other financial information. The forms are all available at http://www.uscourts.gov/forms/bankruptcy-forms.

, The trustee is someone appointed by the court to review your filing, challenge any inaccuracies or misinformation, and determine whether you are entitled to receive your discharge. The discharge is the final order that erases your debts. As long as you are honest and cooperative, you will likely receive your discharge within a few months., The positive outcome of a bankruptcy filing is that your debts, in most cases, will be discharged. You will have what is called a “fresh start” and will no longer owe the debts that you had before. Your credit rating will likely take a negative drop. However, many people see their credit score actually begin to rise again soon after bankruptcy, because, with all your old debts gone, you become a better credit risk again. It is up to you not to repeat what happened before."

Mazao — fruit or crops placed in a bowl, representing the community's productivity.

Kinara — a seven-pronged candle-holder.

Mishumaa Saba — the seven candles which represent the seven core principles of Kwanzaa. Three candles on the left are red, representing struggle; three on the right are green, representing hope; and one in the center is black, signifying the African American people or those who draw their heritage from Africa.

Muhindi — ears of corn. Lay out one ear of corn for each child; if there are no children, place two ears to represent the children of the community.

Zawadi — various gifts for the children.

Kikombe cha Umoja — a cup to represent family and community unity.;
, You can purchase or make these, and it's especially fun to make them with the kids.






See How to make a flag for details on flag making. Click here for detailed instructions on how to color in the Bendera.
If you or your children enjoy making flags, try making African national or tribal flags in addition to the Bendera.

, Starting on December 26, greet everyone by saying ""Habari Gani"" which is a standard Swahili greeting meaning ""what is the news?"" If someone greets you, respond with the principle (Nguzo Saba) for that day:

December 26: ""Umoja"" — Unity
December 27: ""Kujichagulia"" — Self-determination
December 28: ""Ujima"" — Collective work and responsibility
December 29: ""Ujamaa"" — Cooperative economics
December 30: ""Nia"" — Purpose
December 31: ""Kuumba"" — Creativity
January 1: ""Imani"" — Faith.

Non African-Americans are also welcome to participate in greetings. The traditional greeting for them is ""Joyous Kwanzaa.""

, Since each candle represents a specific principle, they are lit one day at a time, in a certain order. The black candle is always lit first. Some people light the remaining candles from left to right (red to green) while other people alternate as follows:

Black candle
Far left red candle
Far right green candle
Second red candle
Second green candle
Last red candle
Last green candle

, Pick and choose some or all of the following activities throughout the seven days of Kwanzaa, saving the feast for the sixth day. Kwanzaa ceremony may include:


Drumming and musical selections.
Readings of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness.
Reflections on the Pan-African colors, discussions of African principles of the day, or recitations of chapters in African history.
The candle-lighting ritual of the Kinara.
Artistic performances.

, The Kwanzaa feast is a very special event that brings everyone closer to their African roots. It is traditionally held on December 31st and is a communal and cooperative effort. Decorate the place where the feast will be held in a red, green, and black scheme. A large Kwanzaa setting should dominate the room where the feast will be held. A large Mkeka should be placed in the center of the floor where the food is placed creatively and made accessible to all to serve themselves. Before and during the feast, an informative and entertaining program should be presented.

Traditionally, the program should involve welcoming, remembering, reassessment, recommitment and rejoicing concluded by a farewell statement and a call for greater unity.
During the feast, drinks are to be shared from a communal cup, the Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all celebrants.

, Kuumba, meaning creativity, is highly encouraged and brings a sense of self-satisfaction. The gifts are usually exchanged between the parents and children and are given out traditionally on January 1st, the last day of Kwanzaa. Since the giving of gifts has very much to do with Kuumba, the gifts should be of an educational or artistic nature."

Have a pi feast.,
Eat pie.,
Choose circular foods.,
Make a pun.",How to Celebrate Pi Day1," Eating pi foods may be the easiest and the most fun way to celebrate pi. If you're in school, everyone can bring in a pi-themed food for a pi-pot luck, and if you're just celebrating with friends, you can all enjoy a pi-themed meal together.;
, While ""pie"" and ""pi"" are spelled differently, they sound the same so eating pie on Pi Day is a popular option. Furthermore, since traditional pies are round, their circular shape acknowledges the mathematical importance of pi.


Eat any type of pie. Try key lime pie, pumpkin pie, pecan pie, or apple pie. You can even make a special Pi Day pie in honor of the day.
For something a little different, consider purchasing and using a pie pan shaped in the mathematical symbol for pi. Such pans can be purchased online.Pi foods don't have to be limited to desserts. Eat shepherd's pie or chicken pot pie.

, Any food that has a circular shape can be fit for your feast due to the mathematical significance of pi. You might try making cookies, cakes, cupcakes, or pancakes.


Consider using icing to put the pi symbol on a variety of cookies, pies, and cupcakes. You can even make the foods in advance and write pi on them in icing in a big group.
Similarly, you can use pi-shaped cookie cutters, pans, and free-form techniques to shape these foods in the symbol for pi.

, Serve foods that start with the letters ""pi."" For instance, you could eat pineapple, pizza, or pine nuts, or drink piña coladas and pineapple juice.


You might even consider combining this idea with some of the others. Write the symbol for pi using pepperoni on your pizza or make a pineapple pie.

Find your participants.,
Schedule the procession.,
Buy or make the dresses for Lucia and the Maidens.,
Buy or make the wreath.,
Find costumes for the boys.,
Buy white candles.,
Print out song lyrics and music.,
Turn off the lights and light the candles.,
Walk in the procession.,
Sing the Lucia song.",How to Celebrate St. Lucia Day1," St. Lucia Day processions are traditionally done by children and teenagers. There isn’t a required number of participants, but you need at least one older girl to portray St. Lucia. Other girls will be her Maidens, and boys participate as Star Boys. Very young children often participate as elves, gingerbread people, or other mythological creatures.

If you don't live in Sweden, contact your local Swedish cultural association to ask for volunteers.
Ask your family and friends!
You can also try posting a request for volunteers on your local neighborhood message boards.;
, The procession should take place on the evening of December 13th, when it's dark enough for the candles to give off lots of light. You can hold the procession indoors or outdoors--some suitable places include parks, churches, Swedish cultural associations, or even your own neighborhood streets., St. Lucia and her Maidens wear long-sleeved white dresses with a red sash and red stockings. You can buy all of these at most big clothing stores, but you can also sew them yourself., St. Lucia also wears an evergreen wreath (often called a crown) with seven candles on her head. Premade St. Lucia wreaths are available, but you can also make one yourself., Star Boys wear white robes with a white cone-shaped hat with stars on it--very similar to a wizard’s hat. You can easily make the hats out of white posterboard and star cutouts., You will need one candle for each participant, as well as seven candles for St. Lucia’s wreath. Electric candles are recommended for safety., Make sure you have printouts of the traditional St. Lucia Day song. This is especially important if you plan to sing it in Swedish but have participants who don’t speak the language., Make sure all the lights in the room or outside are off. Everybody should have their candle on before the procession begins!, In the actual procession, St. Lucia walks ahead, with the Maidens immediately behind her. The Star Boys and other participants walk behind the Maidens. Traditionally, the procession would go along the entire main street of the town, but nowadays it is much shorter. The procession can be as short as a walk up the main aisle of the church., After the walk is completed, St. Lucia stands in the center, with the Maidens in a semicircle behind her and the other participants along the sides and back of the semicircle. St. Lucia leads the whole group in singing the St. Lucia Day song, either in Swedish or in translation. You can listen to the Lucia song in Swedish here."
"
Wear pi-themed clothing.,
Carry pi with you where you go.",How to Celebrate Pi Day2," Math geeks and clothing manufacturers have a better relationship than you might expect. Consider purchasing a t-shirt with the mathematical symbol for pi on the front and wearing it on the special day. You can easily find these shirts online.


If you don't want to buy a shirt, consider decorating a plain t-shirt using fabric paint and a pi-shaped stencil instead.
You can also wear pi accessories. This idea can be taken further to include pi symbol pendants and other jewelry, or you can take a representative approach by wearing something like a necklace with beads representing the numbers in pi,
You could even consider wearing a pi symbol temporary tattoo.

, Shop around online for some fun pi paraphernalia, like pi mugs and pi watches.


Another option would be to put pi symbol stickers on your belongs.
If you want to spread the celebration, try giving away pencils with pi symbols on them.
Make your computer or phone background into something related to pi. The symbol might work, or you can have a background filled with bubbles or other circular shapes.

"
"
Play pi games.,
Use your artistic side to celebrate pi.,
Get physical with pi.",How to Celebrate Pi Day3," Pi games will not only be fun, but they will improve your understanding of pi and will make everyone around you have a deeper appreciation of pi.


There are plenty of traditional games that are appropriate on Pi Day, like a piñata, a pie-eating contest, or a pie-in-the-face fundraiser.
Answer math questions. Come to Pi Day with at least ten math questions you can spring on people. They should be related to geometry, trigonometry, or other fields where pi is particularly useful.
Conduct a Pi Day Scavenger Hunt. Hide pi-themed objects around your classroom, home, or other celebration venue. You can also hide objects representing the digits of pi: three baseballs, one frisbee, four basketballs, etc.
Pi Day also happens to be the birthday of Albert Einstein. Play an Einstein-themed trivia game, or have an Einstein impersonator contest.Have a pi memorization or recitation contest. As soon as someone loses, you can hit him in the face with a pie. If you want to really show your dedication on Pi Day, learn to memorize pi in advance by studying as many of the digits of pi as you can.

, You don't have to be a left-brained thinker to fully celebrate pi. You can use your creative side show how much you love and appreciate pi. And even if you're not the world's most talented poet or writer, you can still have fun while being silly. You don't have to create art to celebrate pi; you can also just appreciate art that already celebrates it. Here are a few ways to celebrate pi artistically:


Write poetry. Write either a pi-ku (haiku) or a regular pi-em (poem) to show how much you love pi.
Write a pi-themed song and sing it, or write a short pi-themed skit and act it out.
Paint a picture of pi.
Watch movies related to pi. Try the film π--it's an interesting and dark movie about a mathematician who goes crazy, but intended for an adult audience only. You could also watch the film Life of Pi.Technically ""Pi"" is only the protagonist's name, but it has gotten people thinking about pi.
Listen to Kate Bush. Progressive rock musician Kate Bush performed a song titled π on her 2005 album Aerial. Bush sings pi to its 137th decimal place, but omits the 79th through 100th decimal places of pi for unknown reasons.

, You can also use your physical prowess, or even your car, to show your love for pi. Here are a few things you can do to celebrate pi:


Do a pi mile run. Run 3.14 miles (5.05 km), which is just a tiny bit longer than a 5K. You can take this a step further by organizing a pi mile run with friends or colleagues.
Lay down in pi formation and take a picture. If you're bold, have two people standing up while holding up a third person who is laying sideways in between them. Make sure the lightest person is on top.
Drive exactly 3.14 miles (5.05 km).
March in a circle to show your love for pi.

"
"
Celebrate at 1:59 PM on Pi Day.,
Convert things into pi.,
Help the tradition continue.",How to Celebrate Pi Day4," This time represents the next three digits of pi: 3.14159. Take a minute to acknowledge pi in whatever way you see fit at that moment During this minute, you can cheer wildly, or even have a countdown leading up to ""pi minute"" the minute before.


For added effect for a countdown, have a ""pi drop"" where you drop a big pie off a balcony or another elevated structure. You can even add a lot of sprinkles to the pie to make it look like a disco ball.
If you've written a pi song or made a pi dance, this would be the perfect minute to share your art.
Note that there is some debate regarding the exact time that Pi Day should be celebrated. Though 1:59PM is probably the most common, some believe that the 24 hour clock should be used instead, which would mean that Pi Day should be celebrated at 1:59AM or 15:09PM.

, This step is absolutely necessary for two reasons: first, to utterly confuse people who have no idea what you're talking about, and secondly, to have fun seeing how many things can be referenced with pi. This will help you reach an even higher appreciation for the amazing number that is pi. Consider two approaches:


Use pi to tell the time. Convert naturally circular things into radians, like the hours on the clock. Instead of it being 3 o'clock, now it's 1/2 pi o'clock. Or, instead of it being 3 o'clock, convert the inclination of the sun into radians and describe that as the time.
Simply use 3.14 as a unit of measure. Instead of being 31 years old, you are 9pi years old. With this same approach, you can find out your next pi birthday -- just don't forget to celebrate it when it comes!

, Don't let this be a one-time thing — you owe it to pi to celebrate again and again. Set the date for next year and consider creating a pi club or website in the process.


Talk about your plans for Pi Day the following year. This will help generate enthusiasm.
Take notes after your Pi Day celebration. What can you do next year to make your celebration even more incredible?
Next year, talk about the day months in advance so your skeptical friends can be convinced to join in. You can even advertise for the event by emailing your closer friends or even setting up a Pi Day Facebook page.

Choose a time and location.,
Invite your guests.,
Decorate for the holiday.,
Serve traditional Swedish foods.,
Arrange traditional entertainment.",How to Celebrate St. Lucia Day2," The best time to throw a St. Lucia Day party is immediately after a procession, but if there is no procession in your area, just schedule it for the evening of December 13th. You can host a party in your home, a restaurant, a church, or your local Swedish cultural association--it’s up to you and your budget!, If you are outside Sweden, it would be appropriate to invite members of the local Swedish community, especially if they are participating in a local procession. Otherwise, you can simply invite your own family and friends. Since St. Lucia Day is so close to Christmas, it would be a good idea to send out invitations several weeks in advance to be sure people can come., St. Lucia’s colors are red and white, but you could also decorate with the Swedish flag. You can use crepe paper, bunting, and tablecloths in red and white. Most Christmas decorations would also be appropriate for St. Lucia Day, especially decorations with evergreens or candles., On St. Lucia Day, it’s traditional to serve a St. Lucia Crown Cake--usually a round coffee cake with seven candles placed in a circle on it. Adults traditionally drink glögg, a type of mulled wine, and you can serve coffee or lingonberry juice for non-drinkers. You can also serve traditional Swedish foods like meatballs, gingerbread cookies, and buns., If there is a St. Lucia procession in your area, it is traditional for participants to sing St. Lucia Day songs at parties afterwards. If not, you can play recordings of St. Lucia Day songs and other traditional Swedish music."
"
Buy the traditional dress or robe.,
Prepare the morning snacks in advance.,
Wake up your family at dawn.,
Watch special holiday programs.",How to Celebrate St. Lucia Day3," It’s traditional in Swedish families for the oldest girl to dress as St. Lucia and wake her family at dawn on St. Lucia Day. She wears the same dress and wreath as the girl playing St. Lucia in the procession.

If you don’t already have the clothes, make sure you get these items ahead of St. Lucia Day--you’ll need them at dawn.
If there are no daughters in your family, there’s no reason why another family member can’t stand in as St. Lucia!, Swedish families traditionally eat lussekatter on the morning of St. Lucia Day. Lussekatter are cat-shaped saffron buns, but any bun or roll is also suitable. They are eaten with glögg or coffee. Make sure you have the food and drink ready to go before you go to bed!, The person playing St. Lucia should wake up the rest of the household at dawn to wish them a happy St. Lucia Day and to serve the traditional morning snack. Dawn represents the arrival of light in the winter darkness, so it’s important to get up early on St. Lucia Day., In Sweden, television stations show big St. Lucia processions and concerts on the morning of St. Lucia Day. If you aren’t in Sweden, you can look up videos online to recreate the experience in your own home."

Educate yourself about Friday the 13th, especially if the day concerns you and fills you with trepidation.,
Take your usual level of care when going about your daily activities.,
Plan a Friday the 13th party.,
Liven up your Friday the 13th party with some excellent games.,
Watch Friday the 13th and other horror films.,
Seek help for a fear of Friday the 13th.",How to Celebrate Friday the 13th," Knowledge is the way to enlightenment and understanding the origins of Friday the 13th can help settle any concerns you might have.


Read about its history. It is important to remember that nobody is really sure as to the origins of the superstition although it does appear to be a combination of two superstitions - a fear of the number 13 and a fear of Fridays. Wikipedia offers a concise write-up that reveals the superstition of Friday the 13th didn't arise until the 19th century.Snopes explains the obscure origins in some detail too.Although Friday the 13th can be scary sometimes, it is equally important to remember is that Friday the 13th is just – a superstition.
Although it is claimed that there are fewer car accidents on Friday the 13th, perhaps on the assumption that some people don't even get out of bed, the proof for reduced accidents is very sketchy.There is also no evidence that one gender has more accidents than another on Friday the 13th.;
, Avoid turning a superstition into a self-fulfilling prophecy by thinking yourself into accidents. Psychologist Richard Wiseman warns against buying into the superstition and ""creating your own bad luck"".It's a day like any other day and it's important to exercise all normal precautions when driving, crossing the road, using sharp objects, etc. And it's also important not to make the day out to be what it isn't.


Avoid linking circumstantial evidence to try to ""prove"" that bad things happen on Friday the 13th (also known as confirmation bias). Making lists of accidents and bad events that happen on Friday the 13th is a skewed way of upholding a preconceived notion of how the superstition should pan out. You'll find what you want to believe (self-validating) but equally, if you sat down and did the same for any day of the year, you'll also find the same level of accidents and bad events!

, This can be a good excuse to throw a fun party and bring out all those superstitions for a fun purpose.



Plan your party.
Draw your inspiration from the eeriness of Halloween for decorative ideas and draw on other superstitious elements. For example, display decorations such as black cats, paper ladders, and the number 13.
Use lanterns or candles to light the party.
Have great nibbles, food, and drinks to keep everyone in the mood for a good party. For great ideas on party snacks, check out wikiHow's Party snacks ideas.
Play spooky music (your Halloween CDs get double use!).
Dress up in costumes. The more mysterious, the better.

,


Play Truth or Dare. This is a party classic that's often worth adding. (See also how to play Extreme Truth or Dare for extra thrills!)
Play ""I would have saved/killed"". It's very simple - every person in the game must choose a character from a horror movie and explain who they would have saved or killed, and why. Award prizes for the best explanations if wished, or just play for the sake of inspiring good stories.
Play Play Stress and Confess.
See wikiHow's Games category for lots more ideas.

, It is inevitable that this film will come up, so make sure you have it available for playing! Not everyone will want to huddle around horror, but for those who get right into the spirit of the occasion, this could be a fun excuse to cuddle up, scream, and share around sugar-laden nibbles. Some ideas to help with the movie-watching include:


Watch a Horror Movie
Appreciate Horror Films
Enjoy a Horror Movie

Get Over a Scary Movie You Saw.

, If you're afraid of Friday the 13th, you've got a condition or phobia known as paraskevidekatriaphobia.It is estimated that 17 to 21 million people in the United States suffer from this phobia.In addition, it is estimated that US$800 to $900 million dollars is lost in the United States on Friday the 13th because a substantial group of people refuse to fly or carry on with business as usual.Henry Ford is one well-known person who refused to do business on Friday the 13th.While this a real phobia, it is likely to have a basis in a ready belief in superstitions associated with bad luck and it is something that you can have treated provided you're willing. And if it is hampering your life and ability to get on with things, it's not a helpful phobia.


See a counselor to work through your phobia. Ask your doctor for a referral if you're not sure whom to contact.
If you are suffering from panic attacks or anxiety, seek professional help immediately.

Make sure that your festivities include a good amount of food – either a large meal or various snack foods.,
Choose a passage or more about hobbits from one of Tolkien's books to read aloud together.,
Play games.,
Have a special cake.,
Give away lovely things to everyone who comes to the party.,
If you do not think your friends would be very interested in a Hobbit Day celebration, celebrate the day in your own way.",How to Celebrate Hobbit Day," This refers to the Chapter One of The Fellowship of the Ring. In the book, this party involves Bilbo Baggins' birthday, his departure and Gandalf farewelling Frodo Baggins. In your case, it is just a great excuse to have a party. Some of the things to set the scene might include:


Decorating with a pile of packages (to represent the wagon that is laden with packages in the story), as well as piles of presents

Fireworks (or at least sparklers) - it's not likely you can recreate one in the image of a dragon but at least consider having a flag or a poster with a dragon on it
Lanterns for lighting would be reminiscent of the book
Have dancing, music, songs and games.;
, If you have a large tree in your backyard or in a nearby park, consider making it the ""party tree"". An outdoor hobbit party is probably more in keeping with the tradition of big hobbit events than trying to cram everyone indoors but obviously this will depend on where you live and the weather. The benefit of being outdoors is the juvenile hobbits can run around without feeling cooped up and all crumbs can be eaten by the creatures of the earth without the need to vacuum up!


If you decide to hold the party in a house, put up pictures or decorations with a hobbit theme. There are plenty of images that you can print out from online images to use in your private home environment and you can embellish these with computer photo programs if needed.

, Hobbits were known for their many well-stocked pantries, as was made known on the first page of The Hobbit. Food that might be perfect for a hobbit celebration includes (unsurprisingly, much of it seems like traditional English fare):



Mushrooms (these are favorite hobbit food and Farmer Maggot used to grow them and Frodo got caught trying to steal some)

Wine (Bilbo and Frodo both inherited vineyards); beer is also popular with hobbits
Hot soup
Cold meats, mince pies, pork pies, rabbit, fish and chips, rashers of bacon


Blackberry tarts and other blackberry foods (including uncooked blackberries)
Freshly baked bread and lots of butter

Pickles are often mentioned
Ripe cheese
Food made from vegetables such as corn, turnips, carrots, potatoes and onions
Food made with apples, such as apple tart (with raspberry jam)
Honey (foods made with honey such as honey cakes would be nice)

Scones (known as ""biscuits"" in North America), fruit pies, and cakes, including seed cakes

Pinwheel sandwiches (just because these are small and cute and the hobbits may have approved provided they weren't too fussy)
Tea and coffee.

Keep seasonings and sauces to a minimum; apparently hobbits didn't bother with them that much.



, This is important for both fans and non-initiates alike. The fans will know the passages and the non-initiate will be introduced to the way of hobbits through listening. Ask someone with an excellent, projecting voice who enjoys reading in public to read out the passages so it's enjoyable for everyone.

, Hobbits loved games, so a party celebrating hobbits needs to have plenty of these going! You could start by putting a hobbit name on each guest's back and making people figure out who they are just by asking questions of other guests (no peeking). Other games to consider include (and each of these can be made suitable for any age with an imagination):



Backyard party games like quoits, horseshoe tossing, beanbag throwing, sack-jumping, egg and spoon race, three-legged race, coconut shy, etc.
Indoor games like musical chairs, pass-the-parcel, the chocolate game, pin-the-tail on the donkey, statues, Chinese whispers, etc.
Play rhyming games and making up haiku, poems, limericks, etc.
Play games that involve riddles, charades, sayings or proverbs.

, As well as all the other scrumptious food,don't forget that Hobbit Day is also a birthday party for Bilbo and Frodo. Make or purchase a special birthday cake with two candles (one for each hobbit). For fun, you might toast the Bagginses and make little speeches in their honor.

, Small but creative gifts (such as toys, jewelry, trinkets, small musical instruments, puzzles, etc.) should be given to the guests. This represents one of the peaceful pursuits of hobbits (gift-giving) and is the spirit of sharing and creating community, both valued by hobbits.


See How to make a birthday goodie bag for adults, How to put together a goodie bag, How to sew a cloth gift bag and How to make gift bags for more ideas.

, Walk around barefoot for the day, eat about six meals (hobbits are always hungry), or make a Hobbit Day t-shirt to spread awareness. Consider making flyers to share with friends and acquaintances to help them understand the importance of this day.

Visit your local fire station or pub that celebrates bonfire night.,
Make your own bonfire party.,
Check the weather forecast for the specific day of the bonfire.,
Gather materials to burn.,
Purchase fireworks and sparklers.,
Get everything ready.,
Light a match or two and place it into the fire lighting fluid.,
Set up a guest area, a safe distance from the bonfire.,
Make an effigy of Guy Fawkes and attach it to a post outdoors.,
Burn the effigy on the bonfire.,
Throw water on the burnt effigy to ensure that there are no embers left to float off and start a spot fire.,
Prepare food if you're holding a bonfire party.,
Provide some non-alcoholic beverages.",How to Celebrate Guy Fawkes Day," This could consist of fireworks, a huge bonfire, and music. If it's a professionally organized event, it's likely that the festivities will be spectacular and you don't personally have to trouble yourself with tending a bonfire.;
, Find a sizable amount of land that is free of trees. Make certain it is not inhabited by people, or has stores or houses close by. You'll also need to check that the local regulations allow the creation of a bonfire in your chosen area.

, Accuweather is a great place to check UK weather so you can be sure the the night will be rain free.

, Twigs and dry leaves will keep a bonfire going for quite a while. Invite friends and relatives and ask them to contribute materials to burn.


Never ever use petrol to start the bonfire, death can, and does occur from this mistake each and every year. Petrol is a highly flammable and extremely dangerous liquid! Instead consider using fire lighting fluid or fire lighting blocks which are made from much safer solidified hexane.
For safety precautions: Have a phone in hand at all times in case the bonfire gets out of hand. In the UK, dial '999' and request help from the local fire station.

Fill two buckets of water and have them in handy. Powerful hosepipes are ideal.



, Use authorized suppliers and only purchase fireworks that are considered to be safe to use by individuals in a domestic context. If the fireworks require professional handlers, leave well alone.

, About one hour before friends and relatives arrive, start the bonfire. Do this by placing the fire lighting fluid in the center of the bonfire. Dried leaves, newspapers and small twigs made ideal kindling if placed loosely around the fluid.

, The hexane will light in a controlled manner and will cause the kindling to light. As the temperature increases the flames will very quickly turn from a small fire into a raging inferno. Make sure than you have enough firewood to maintain your bonfire for the duration of the party. As a rough guide the bonfire will burn a pile of wood equal to the size of the fire every hour.

, When they arrive offer them a a drink and some refreshments. After a brief time of meeting and greeting, start lighting the fireworks. Follow the instructions provided with the fireworks and aim well away from people, animals and buildings; aim into the air.

, As with the bonfire, it needs to be somewhere that is free of vegetation or other flammable objects and should have a good area around it that is clear of any objects.


Make sure that it's legal to burn things in your area. Call your local police station to confirm before the burn.

, You can also sing the popular rhythm Remember Remember the Fifth of November. (The second verse is usually omitted).


Remember, remember, the 5th of November
The Gunpowder Treason and plot;
I know of no reason why Gunpowder Treason
Should ever be forgot.
Guy Fawkes, Guy Fawkes,
'Twas his intent.
To blow up the King and the Parliament.
Three score barrels of powder below.
Poor old England to overthrow.
By God's providence he was caught,
With a dark lantern and burning match
Holloa boys, Holloa boys, let the bells ring
Holloa boys, Holloa boys, God save the King!
Hip hip Hoorah !
Hip hip Hoorah !
A penny loaf to feed ol' Pope,
A farthing cheese to choke him
A pint of beer to rinse it down,
A faggot of sticks to burn him.
Burn him in a tub of tar,'
Burn him like a blazing star.
Burn his body from his head,
Then we'll say ""Ol' Pope is dead.""

, Dispose of the ashes appropriately.

, It's a great way to keep everyone entertained while waiting for the fireworks and makes sitting around the bonfire a bit more enjoyable. Some food suggestions include:


Baked potatoes
Sausage rolls
Hot dogs and burgers
Bangers and mash
Potato wedges with sauces or dips
Bread baked in the bonfire
Any camping food you'd usually shove in the fire (but only in the coals, at the edge!)
Chip butties
Fish and chips
Puddings and sweets of all sorts, from toffee to sticky date pudding (and toffee apples are an easy-to-carry choice for sitting around the bonfire and nibbling)
Hearty soups.

, While no doubt the beer will be flowing, not everyone will want beer all evening. Some hot chocolate, warm fruit drinks and other wintery drinks will be a good choice to keep everyone warm and toasty.

Read up on Groundhog Day history.,
Watch Punxsutawney Phil emerge from his burrow on TV.,
Go on a nature walk.,
Play with shadow puppets.",How to Celebrate Groundhog Day1," Whether you research alone or with friends, learn about the origins of Groundhog Day. In medieval German culture, people believed that hedgehogs could predict winter if it saw its shadow. When some Germans immigrated to Pennsylvania, they brought this tradition with them but switched to groundhogs. The first recognized Groundhog Day celebration was February 2, 1887, when the town of Punxsutawney dubbed their groundhog Phil America's weather-forecasting animal.Groundhog Day history can be intriguing, once you study it. For example: did you know that during the Prohibition, Punxsutawney Phil supposedly threatened to impose 60 weeks of winter if he didn't get a drink?;
, At daybreak in Punxsutawney, reporters gather around the groundhog's den to watch him emerge from his burrow. Get up early in the morning to watch this momentous event on TV. Be prepared for a long winter if he sees his shadow!

Call or email your local station if you're not sure what channel is broadcasting the event.
If you live in the eastern US coast, you can travel to Punxsutawney to watch Phil in-person at his burrow in Gobber's Knob., If groundhogs are native to your environment, go on a hike or trail walk and look for groundhogs (also known as woodchucks).Go with a group and make a game out of who can spot the most groundhogs. If you can't see any, enjoy the fresh air and see if there really will be six more weeks of winter.

Visit your local zoo if groundhogs aren't native to your area. Call ahead to ask if your zoo has a groundhog exhibit.

, To celebrate the importance of Punxsutawney Phil's shadow, make your own shadow puppets out of paper. Outline your shadow puppet on a piece of paper, then cut it out and attach it to a popsicle stick. After you've created your puppets, put on a puppet show.

You could even make a puppet show about the true meaning of Groundhog Day.

Visit Punxsutawney's annual celebration.",How to Celebrate Groundhog Day2," If you're still in secondary school, let your teacher know Groundhog Day is coming a few days in advance. Let them know how much you enjoy Groundhog Day, and ask them if you can learn about Groundhog Day as a class. Your teacher might even plan some fun Groundhog Day festivities, like making Groundhog Day crafts or watching Punxsutawney Phil on TV together.

If you'd like, ask your teacher if you could bring a Groundhog Day-themed treat, like groundhog-shaped cookies or Groundhog Day cupcakes., Some cities in North America have their own Groundhog Day celebrations. Depending on the town, they might have a parade, town festival, or live animal shows celebrating Groundhog Day. Contact your city government to find out about Groundhog Day festivities for times and locations.

All is not lost if your city doesn't celebrate Groundhog Day. Celebrate it with your loved ones or visit a city that has special events.

, Groundhog lodges are clubs in Pennsylvania that preserve German immigrant culture. Dozens of groundhog lodges across the state celebrate Groundhog Day with food, games, speech, and songs. Look for a lodge closest to you, and join in on their celebrations.Because groundhog lodges seek to preserve the dying Pennsylvania German dialect, speeches will often be given in this language., Besides watching Phil leave his burrow, Punxsutawney also hosts an entire weekend of festivities. In the morning, town citizens gather for an annual breakfast. A celebration tent in the center of town hosts fun activities, like a cornhole tournament and top hat decorating contest. Then, in the evening, you can join the Groundhog Ball at the local country club.In the off-season, Punxsutawney also hosts a wine festival where Punxsutawney Phil makes a special appearance."

Watch the 1993 film Groundhog Day.",How to Celebrate Groundhog Day3," To set the mood for your party, make your home look like the Punxsutawney forest. Cut out pine trees from butcher paper and hang them up on the wall. Use flowers or pinecones as a table centerpiece. You could even have your party outdoors to really set the mood.

Alternatively, you could separate a room into winter and spring decorations to represent Punxsutawney Phil's big moment., Your guests don't necessarily have to come dressed up as groundhogs. Instead, ask them to come dressed as their favorite woodland animal. If your guests are not as passionate about groundhogs, they could come as a deer, bear, fox, wolf, or owl., No party is complete without treats. You could make traditional Groundhog Day cookies (popularized on the official Punxsutawney website), or you could make a festive cake.Because groundhogs eat vegetation, you could also leave out a veggie tray or fruit bowl.

To complete the woodland theme, make a trail mix for your guests to enjoy.

, For a fun party craft, make groundhog masks out of cardstock. Draw your outline on the cardstock, then cut it out with a sharp pair of scissors. Color your mask with markers, paints, or crayons, then attach ribbon to the sides. You and your guests can now celebrate Groundhog Day in style.As an alternative, you could make animal masks to complement your guests' costumes.

, Bill Murray's Groundhog Day features a weatherman who must experience the same day over and over until he learns a valuable lesson. Since Groundhog Day thrust the holiday into popular culture, there's no better movie to show at your party. Snuggle up with your friends and a bowl of popcorn, and have a good laugh together.If you do not want to watch Groundhog Day, you could watch a nature documentary on groundhogs instead.

Add the eyes and antenna.,
Draw the claws.,
Draw the legs.,
Finish your crab.",How to Draw a Crab1," Find a comfortable well-lit place to work where all your materials are nearby. For this tutorial, you will need:


Your sketchbook, paper, or card stock.
A pencil
An eraser
Scissors (optional)
Markers, color pencils, or crayons (optional);
, Make sure to give yourself plenty of room on the top, bottom, and sides of your oval. This will be the body of the crab.


You can draw this oval in one continuous stroke or connect two sideways ""C"" shapes to make this shape.

, Crabs have two small eyes with a tiny antenna coming from each one, like eyebrows. You will want to draw these at the top of your oval in the middle.


Find the center of your oval and draw two small circles next to each other on the top line. Make sure to space the circles far enough away that you can clearly see both of them. You may also want to color them in completely with your pencil or a black marker.
Above each circle, add a short line sticking up and out, from the inside of the circle. This means that the two antenna lines should be directly across from each other, with the circle eyes on the outside.

, Drawing the claws of your crab is a three step process. On the top of the oval, toward the edges, add a small oval, tall-ways, to each side. If you have trouble getting these ovals the same size, don't worry, some crabs have one claw that is larger than the other.


On top of each oval, draw a larger oval tilted diagonally inward toward the eyes. Your top ovals should look like they are almost facing each other while reaching upward.
Add the pincers on the top of the larger oval. To draw the pincers, hold your pencil at the top of the oval and draw a short curved line reaching upward. End this line with a pointed tip, and take the line back down to the center of the top of the oval.
From the center of the top of the oval, draw a shorter curved line, curving toward the first (as if to complete a circle), and end that line in a point as well, before taking it back down the the base of the oval.

, Your crab can have three legs on each side, all below the claws. Start the first leg directly below the claw. Draw a crescent shape pointing upward, in line with the direction of the claw. Repeat this on the other side.


Draw another leg directly below the first one. Use a present shape to angle this leg upward as well. Repeat on the other side.
Draw the last leg directly below the second, but this time, angle the present shape downward. Repeat on the other side.

, Depending on what you want to do, there are a few ways you can finish your crab. You may wish to color your crab and then cut it out, using it as a party decoration for an underwater theme. You could also add an underwater scene to your paper, drawing a kelp forest or sea otters around your crab. Have fun!

, A wolf's muzzle is not too long but not too short, having thick black lips, a round, slightly triangle shaped nose with circular nostrils. The snout is blocky.

, The eyes are small and circular. They have a smaller round black pupil in the middle and are surrounded by something black called the wolf's conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is pointed at the end of the eye that leads to the snout but round at the other end of the eye.

, Draw some neck fur that points downwards.

, You should use colored pencil for better results if its hand drawn. The lines of coloring should point the same way the line art does and be thin. For shading, press the pencil down harder. The eyes of a timber wolf are usually bright yellow, but in rare cases they may become green or permanently stay blue.

, This can be whatever you want it to be.

Continue working on improving your drawing skills.",How to Draw a Good Picture," A school pencil will give you a good medium shade line and a medium width of the line. If you want a darker pencil use a B pencil. Most craft and art stores sell drawing pencils. The best drawings use a variety of pencil shades.


The higher the number, the darker you can go. For example, 6B is much darker than 2B.
If you want a really light line use an H pencil. The higher the number the lighter the line. For example, 6H is much lighter than 2H.;
, The sharper the point, the better you can draw. Sharpen it often as you draw.

, Bristol Board is by far the best drawing paper on the planet.The smoother the finish, the more awesome the drawing.

, This prevents smudges and stains. If you get up to grab a snack, wash your hands again before getting back to your drawing.


Never rest any part of your hand on any part of your paper that has pencil on it. In other words never rest your hand on your actual drawing. Try to keep your hand on the blank parts of the paper. This prevents blurring your lines.







, These are special erasers which will erase pencil lines without scratching the paper.

, Before you start, picture the image you want to draw in your head first. Planning ahead allows you to work out what particular techniques will work best with the chosen subject. Some examples of good drawing subjects include people, animals, still life (still objects) and landscapes.


It might help to warm up first. Sketch without judging the outcome, to loosen up before you start on your picture.

, Try to break it down to basic shapes or forms. Use circles, squares, triangles and rectangles to represent the largest parts of the object. Pay special attention to relationships; for example, one object is two and a half times taller than the one beside it and twice as wide. When sketching, use small, fine lines with a pencil to draw quickly and lightly.

, This can be done as often as you like, until you are satisfied that the basic shapes look good.


The more effort you make to draw the forms correctly, the more convincing and impressive your drawing will look. No amount of detail will compensate for unintentional inaccuracies or laziness.







, Add small, wispy lines to increase detail and to show light and shadow.

, Go over the lines with a fine tipped pen or sharp pencil. At this point, you can add details to the darker areas using solid lines.


If you used pen, take an eraser (a rubber eraser is better than the standard pencil eraser) and erase all of the original fine lines you made with the pencil.







, This is optional. If you do color, use the technique of making wispy lines.

, Whether or not the drawing turned out as you wanted it to be, keep learning, keep improving. No artist sits still and thinks they've reached a pinnacle; art is an ongoing journey of improving and changing throughout life.


The best artists are those who try hard, have patience, take their time, and have pride in their own work.

Purchase a colored pencil eraser.,
Test the eraser on a small area.,
Simply use the colored pencil eraser as you would use a standard eraser.",How to Erase Colored Pencil1," A colored pencil eraser can be bought at most stores: dollar stores, an arts and crafts store, etc.


You should not need to pay more than about five dollars for a colored pencil eraser.
A colored pencil eraser should work on all types and brands of colored pencil.;
, It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing can cause streaking. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture.


Rub gently in a small circle to test. If you notice streaking, rub more gently. If you notice streaking, consider trying another method.
Try to choose a peripheral spot to test the eraser. If it does smear or streak, you do not want it to ruin the central part of your image.

, Rub gently; colored-in portions of paper are more fragile than paper you've simply written on.


Be careful, colored pencil erasers are somewhat more firm than normal erasers. They have a rough, coarse feel to them and can tear paper.
Be patient and continue to rub gently, checking your progress every few seconds. It may take some time to fully erase the colored pencil. If you get impatient and try to rub more vigorously to speed up the process, you are likely to rip the paper.

Buy a kneaded eraser.,
Create the shape you need.,
Test the eraser on a small area.,
Rub the eraser on the page to pick up pigment.,
Clean the kneaded eraser.",How to Erase Colored Pencil2," Kneaded erasers are made from a slightly sticky, putty-like substance that makes them very easy to shape and use.


You can find kneaded erasers in most art supply shops.
Kneaded erasers are best for when you need to lighten, rather than fully erase, colored pencil. You can approximate the effect of a kneaded eraser using wall putty, which is a very similar material. , Because kneaded erasers are very malleable, you can and should make the shape that is easiest for you to handle and use.


For large areas, you can flatten and stretch a kneaded eraser out over the area you want to erase.
For small areas, shape the eraser into a pencil-like point.

, It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing can cause streaking. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture.


Rub gently in a small circle to test. If you notice streaking, rub more gently. If you notice streaking, consider trying another method.
Try to choose a peripheral spot to test the eraser. If it does smear or streak, you do not want it to ruin the central part of your image.

, You can rub the page rather hard with a kneaded eraser, because they are soft and unlikely to tear the page.


After your rub some of the pigment off the page, pick up the eraser and fold the eraser over itself. This will help to prevent the pigment from rubbing back off on the page.
You may need to repeat this process several times to remove all or most of the colored pencil. Rub, fold, rub, fold. Continue until you are happy with the results.
Still, be careful. Although you are unlikely to tear the page, you may crease it., Unlike other types of erasers, kneaded erasers need to be cleaned after using them.


To clean the eraser stretch it thin and fold it back over. Repeat several times if necessary. You may need to rub the kneaded eraser on another surface to get pigment out."

Buy a vinyl eraser.,
Buy an “eraser.” Erasers are the type of eraser that comes in pencil form.,
Test the eraser on a small area.,
Erase the colored pencil by rubbing very gently.",How to Erase Colored Pencil3," Unlike kneaded erasers, which you might be able to fashion out of material you have around, you will likely have to buy a vinyl eraser.


You can buy vinyl erasers in many different shapes. Try to find the one that is best for your needs.

,


Erasils can be held and used like a pencil. They are vinyl and should be used carefully, like any vinyl eraser. , It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing can cause streaking. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture.


Rub gently in a small circle to test. If you notice streaking, rub more gently. If you notice streaking, consider trying another method.

, Be very careful. Vinyl erasers are the hardest, stiffest type of eraser. It is very easy to accidentally tear through paper when using them.The edge of a vinyl eraser is the most effective part. Use the edge of the eraser for the best results.
If you need to completely remove all of the colored pencil, erase gently until the colored pencil is totally removed.

Erase the area with normal pencil eraser.,
Cut off a small strip of tape.,
Test the tape on a small area.,
Gently put the strip of tape on the paper, and rub it gently.,
Use a pen to write on the tape over the part you want to erase most thoroughly.,
Peel the tape off the paper.,
Gently erase of the paper again with a regular pencil eraser.",How to Erase Colored Pencil4," Be very gently and do not apply too much pressure. Erase very lightly. The goal here is to just slightly bring up the pigment from the page, in order to help the tape pull it up more easily.


This helps prepare the area for the tape. You do not need to try to fully erase the colored pencil with the normal pencil eraser.

, Even if you need to erase a larger area, you are better off using several small pieces of tape.


You can use masking tape or clear tape.

, It is best to test an erasing method before starting to erase large portions. Erasing with tape can cause damage to the paper. By testing first, you can ensure that you will not ruin your picture.


Try to choose a peripheral spot to test the tape. If it does start to tear the paper, you do not want it to ruin the central part of your image.

, Do not rub too hard, it may damage the paper when you peel it off.

, By using a fine pointed stylus, like a pen, to put pressure on the tape you will encourage the colored pencil to stick to the adhesive.Make sure you do not press too hard and rip through the tape.
This works better with masking tape than with clear tape.

, There should be some of the pigment sticking on the tape. Be careful when peeling the tape back from the paper. This is the step that has the greatest chance of ripping or tearing the paper.


Each time you repeat this step, you increase the chance the paper will tear.

, If there is still pigment left that you want to remove, repeat the entire process.


This can help to erase small, remaining amounts of pigment that are left on the page.

Practice.",How to Continue to Learn Drawing Skills," A sketchpad, all varieties of pencils, rubber, etc.;
, These will help you dramatically and boost your confidence working alongside and around other people at the same level as you. If you do not feel like going to art classes go to your local library or log onto Amazon and get some books that teach you how to draw or how to draw on the right side of your brain. If you’re really willing to invest in yourself do both.

, It could be any household item, e.g. a 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottle. Remember to draw just what you see, not what is in your mind, don’t make things up on paper. Draw the shadings, reflections, curves, etc. Draw it at the best ability you can. The longer you work on it, the better it will be, but don't overdo it. When you first start out, try for 1 to 2 hours. Keep that bottle, keep your drawing and store it in a folder or something. The next day draw that bottle again in exactly the same position and put that drawing with the other one, remembering to put a date on it. Carry on doing this every day for a few months, never miss a day. By the end of those few months you will be almost exactly like a professional at drawing what you drew. Look at your first drawing and last drawing and you will see how good you have become.

, Your brain is clever. People are not born to draw or not draw. Apart from the 1 in a billion prodigy children/people who claimed they have gifts. But no one on this Earth cannot draw. Even people without arms can draw with their feet or mouth. You can draw. You just need to practise and your brain will unfold your miracle talent. Practise drawing everything around you. Do not make things up on paper, draw what you see and everything will come naturally.

, Practice every day. If you really want to draw, try spending 3-4 hours a day drawing. Even if you're rubbish at it, you will get better.

, Make sure they should be slightly off to the sides of it. These rectangles will serve as the ears., Remember, when it comes to drawing chibis you should make sure that the body is about half the size of the head. Chibis are all about being non -proportional., Two should be inside the trapezoid (pointing towards the middle) while the other two should be below pointing to the two bottom corners of the trapezoid., Above it, draw a large circle with a small swirl within it., In the middle of the trapezoid, draw a small, vertical oval.

Admire your work.",How to Draw an Astronaut," Sketch a large circle near the top of your paper. Keep the circle as evenly round as possible.


This first circle will eventually become the outer perimeter of the astronaut's helmet.;
, Draw a rectangle that overlaps the bottom fifth of the circle. The size of the rectangle should be similar to the size of the shape.Also note that the height of the rectangle should be only slightly longer than its width, making it just a little too long to consider it a square.
This portion will eventually become the astronaut's torso.

, Draw one square-like shape coming off from the top right side of the rectangle, then connect a second similar shape to the far side of the first. Repeat on the top left side of the rectangle, as well.


These will become the arms of the astronaut.
The total length of both quadrilaterals in one set should roughly match the height of the original rectangle, and the width of each one should be close to its height.
The exact placement and direction of these quadrilaterals will vary based on personal choice, though.

If you want the arm to be straight, draw the set pointing outward and at a slight downward angle.


If you want the arm to be straight up, draw the set pointing outward and at a slight upward angle.

If you want the arm to curve, draw the first quadrilateral pointing outward, but slant the sides of the second quadrilateral so that bends in the appropriate direction.



, Draw a series of three quadrilaterals beneath the rectangle on the right side. Draw another series of three quadrilaterals on the left side, too.


These will become the legs.
The first quadrilateral should connect to the bottom of the rectangle, and it should also be the largest.
The second in the set should angle slightly inward and be two-thirds the size of the first.
The final in the set should angle slightly outward and match the size of the second. These will become the astronaut's boots.

, Trace over any sharp corners to create a more rounded figure, then erase any pencil lines that do not belong.


Flatten the bottom of your starting circle, giving it rounded corners.
Erase most of the connecting lines between the quadrilaterals in the arms and legs. The only connecting lines you should leave are those between the torso and upper legs, and those between the lower legs and boots; make these connecting lines rounded instead of sharp.

, Draw a horizontal oval in the large beginning circle.


The sides and bottom of this visor oval should be close to the perimeter of the outer helmet, but they shouldn't touch. Furthermore, there should be about twice as much space between the top of the visor and the top of the helmet.

, Draw a large rectangle behind the astronaut. This backpack rectangle should start just beneath the top of the helmet and end slightly above the astronaut's waistline.


Depending on the angle of the astronaut, you may need to add dimension to the backpack by adding sides or a top that point toward an invisible vanishing point.
Note that the lines of the backpack should all remain behind the figure of the astronaut; do not overlap them.

, Draw one hand on the end of each arm. Astronauts wear gloves (not mittens), so you'll need to draw the fingers of each hand, too.


If you're viewing the astronaut from the front and viewing his hands from their sides, however, you can simplify the shape of each hand into an ""L"" shape, with the thumb facing down for each one. This should mimic the side view of the hand well enough.

, Sketch a line beneath each boot. This line should run parallel to the bottom of the boot. It should also connect the inner back corner to the outer from corner.


Essentially, this is the sole of the boot. When viewed from the top, the sole should be a solid shape. If viewed from the bottom, it needs to have parallel rows of ""grip"" lines.

, Draw a parallel line beneath the bottom of the helmet. Connect this line to the bottom of the helmet using two short perpendicular lines, keeping the corners rounded.This portion represents the helmet ring. When locked into place, the astronaut's helmet will stay on. When unlocked, the astronaut can remove his helmet.
You can leave the ring as it is or add another small rectangle in the center of it for further detail.

, Draw a short, curved line poking up from one top corner of the backpack. Add a small circle to the top of this line.


The overall length of the antenna should be no longer than one-third to one-half the height of the backpack itself.

, Create bands around both sleeve cuffs and both shoulders.


To create the cuff bands, simply draw a parallel line to the inside of each sleeve line.
To create a shoulder band, draw two parallel lines that extend from one bottom corner of the helmet down to the armpit of the same side. Repeat on both sides. Note that the shoulder bands are actually the bands of the backpack.

, At minimum, you should draw one panel on the center of the astronaut's torso. You may also draw a second panel on the upper portion of one arm.


The panels do not need to be complex. Simply draw a square or rectangle in the appropriate spot, then accent the rectangle with smaller rectangles or circles to represent buttons.

, Since the sun visor of the helmet is usually difficult to see through, you do not need to add a face. You can still do so if you'd like to, though.


Gauge the size of the visor in comparison to the rest of the body to determine how large the face should be.

If you have a relatively small visor space to work with, simply draw the eyes and nose of the astronaut.If you have a large visor space, define the shape of the head inside the visor and add a full face (eyes, nose, mouth, and ears).



, The sketch itself is done at this point, but you can make it more vibrant by adding color. Use any coloring medium you feel comfortable with.


Have fun with this part of the drawing, but keep in mind a few points:

Most suits are light and plain colored, so opt for a white, light blue, or light gray when coloring the body of the suit.
The visor should be dark. If you did not draw a face, consider using dark blue or black. If you did draw a face, tint the visor glass with a light blue that's slightly darker than the shade of the overall suit.
Most of the equipment will be plain in color, as well (blacks and grays), but you can add a small splash of brighter color to the control panel buttons and sleeve cuffs.



, Assess the drawing and determine if there are any more changes you'd like to make or details you'd like to add. If everything looks the way you'd like it to look, the drawing is now finished.

Use a prompt.,
Work with a favorite category in a new way.,
Set limits or parameters for your drawings.,
Try oblique strategies prompts.",How to Think of What to Draw1," There are a number of websites that have lists of prompts that will give you a task or subject to draw. You can find some of these with a quick internet search. You can also follow prompt feeds on social media, like the Art Assignment Bot (@artassignbot) on Twitter or Drawing-Prompt-s on Tumblr. Typical prompts include things like:“Draw a flock of birds hanging out in a club”
“Draw something that terrifies you, but in a comical way”
“Draw a restaurant you would not eat at”
“Draw a fictional game show host”;
, You might feel in a rut if you draw the same sorts of things over and over again. If you like drawing in a particular category, like nature scenes or fantasy scenes, you can still work with this, just work with it from a new perspective. For instance, if you like doing figure drawing, you might draw someone:You know well in a place you’ve never seen them.
Like you normally would, except make one of their hands be unusually large.
Reimagined as an unlikely superhero.
As you imagine them to look fifty years from now.

, Sometimes, it’s the wide openness of the question “What should I draw?” that makes it so hard. If you force yourself to think “inside the box,” you might actually break through to create something interesting. Give yourself a couple of rules and start drawing according to them.For instance, you might draw the same thing 20 times, making one small change each time.
Likewise, you might tell yourself to draw the first 10 things that start with the letter “M” that pop into your head, no matter what they are.

, Oblique Strategies was originally a deck of cards developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. Each card has a unique direction mean to guide your work through lateral thinking, or approaching a problem from an unusual perspective. There are now virtual versions of these cards freely available online. Choose a card and let it influence your drawing. Typical prompts include things like:”Retrace your steps.”
”Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action. Incorporate.”
”Look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them.”

Understand the fundamentals of art.,
Choose the method that you want to use and/or teach.,
Look at a human, carefully look at the way the lines around their head change and draw around the oval accordingly, don't forget the top of the head this is important.

,
Next make a line of in the center of the head, this will help you with other guidelines and create accurate placing of eyes.

,
Next go halfway down the head vertically, here you have where your eyes should be.

,
Measure down to the bottom of the head from that new line, and divide that number by 2.,
To find where the eyes belong you will measure the head and make 5 even sections.,
Make shaping for the nose.,
Next you have lips.",How to Teach Pencil Drawing," The problem with most people is that when drawing they try very difficultly to draw something all at once. The issue with this though is that your mind takes images it sees and memorizes them into the easiest ways possible. This means that despite the fact that you KNOW what a face looks like, it always turns out as a child's drawing.


To combat this you need to perfect drawing shapes. You must be able to draw any and all shapes, in any way, any place, any thickness. You can change the thickness by one pressing harder with your pencil, or by doing multiple strokes. You can build up lines in at least two ways. One way is having the skill to draw straight lines, which is extremely difficult. Second is to draw multiple curved lines light to build up and even straight line. It may not be as crisp but can be more accurate. Both types of lines have their strengths and weaknesses. Once you have learned these things well you can begin drawing.;
, There are multiple steps to drawing, these include. Guidelines, there are multiples forms of guidelines. Then there is line work, a drawing can end with the line work but doesn't have to, and lastly shading.


Guidelines, as said before have multiple forms one which was briefly mentioned before was shapes. The concept of drawing all and any shapes is used in every aspect in drawing. For example to draw a humans head proportionately you must draw an oval shape.

,,,, This will give you where the nose belongs. Do the same thing again with the line for the nose and you will get the lips.

, an easy way to do this is the diagonal ruler reading method which is most easy when measuring in either pica or agates. Not inches or Metric (which do still work) Measure from one corner of the head to another, anywhere you want, but try to make it a number that is divisible by 5. So for example you are measuring by pica and you have 40 pica (there are 6 pica in an inch) that would mean that you would count by 8s giving you 5 even sections. when you make these sections go back to that horizontal line you made for the eyes and make either ovals or spheres all the way across. This will allow you to make eyes exactly where you need them.

, The nose is quite simple in geometry. Draw two rectangles from the eyes to near the center of the vertical line down the middle of the head, these shapes should be on angle. Basically to simplify, draw angle rectangles that do not touch the original vertical line.Then draw a rectangle that gets larger at the bottom to show that is coming toward the view this is for the nose, From this you should be able to draw a plane on the bottom that is somewhat like a trapezoid. This will probably be the most difficult part.

, Lips are made of 3 parts. The top lip, and two sections of the bottom lip. The top lip comes into an ""M"" at the top and at the bottom had skin that overlaps the bottom lip in the middle but doesn't on the outsides. Then for the bottom lip you just draw two spheres and fill them against the top lip as accurately as you can. Remember to look at your subject. Fill in all the details then the best you can for line work, and you should be good.

Doodle.,
Do quick gesture drawings.,
Draw from photographs.,
Copy the masters.,
Consult a book on drawing.",How to Think of What to Draw2," If you can't think of what to draw, just put pen to paper and make it move. Draw lines, simple shapes, scribbles, cartoon characters, stick people, or anything else that comes out. The physical act of moving your hands to create can reenergize you. Doodling allows you to think and create in a non-judgmental, almost subconscious way., These are the bread and butter of life drawing, but you can use them in other situations as well. Set a timer for one minute and try to draw the entirety of a figure or object. You will have work quickly, forcing you to capture just the essence of your subject. Do several of these drawings in a five or ten minute period.


You can even use online images as subjects for gesture drawings., Photographs can be great as the basis of drawings, especially when you’re out of ideas. If there's nothing around to draw, go looking for photographs that might be interesting or fresh to draw. Tell yourself that you will draw whatever you find on page three of a magazine, for instance, no matter what it is., If you’re stuck and don’t know what to draw, you can always copy what someone else has already done! Trying to recreate the work of a previous artist not only solves the problem of what to draw, it can also be a great opportunity to learn.Consider copying the work of the Old Masters like Raphael or Rembrandt, as well as new ones like Frieda Kahlo or Francis Bacon.
Many museums allow you to sketch on site. Grab your sketchpad and a pencil, and draw a work that inspires you.

, Reading a book about drawing might seem like the path to boredom rather than creativity, but if you’re stuck, one of these can be a lifeline. Even if you’re an experienced artist, looking at the fundamentals and trying basic drawing exercises can be refreshing and lead to great ideas. Some classic books on drawing include:



Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain (Betty Edwards),

Drawing for the Absolute and Utter Beginner (Claire Watson Garcia)

Elements of Drawing (John Ruskin)

The Practice and Science of Drawing (Harold Speed),

Human Anatomy for Artists: The Elements of Form (Eliot Goldfinger)

"
Try another activity before starting to draw.,
Don’t limit yourself to one medium.,
Draw everyday.",How to Think of What to Draw3," Read, listen to music, dance, or do some other creative activity. Take a walk around the block. Clearing your mind can make you feel creatively refreshed. You can also look to these as sources of input to get drawing ideas. For instance:While walking around your neighborhood, look for a seemingly banal object or scene that might make a great subject for a drawing.
Think about what images are suggested by the music you are listening to, and draw them.

, Trying out a new medium can be invigorating if you're stuck and don't know what to draw. Even revisiting familiar subjects can seem newly inspiring in a fresh medium. Try a variety of media, like:


Pencils
Charcoal
Pastels
Pens
Markers
Crayons
Conte crayons

, Push through and draw something, even on the days when you can’t seem to think of a good idea. Even if you don’t feel like what you draw on a given day is any good, don’t give up. By getting in the habit of drawing regularly, you will be more likely to produce good work than if you wait for inspiration to strike."

Draw the lower end.,
Add design to the saree.",How to Draw a Woman in a Saree," To draw the figure on whom the saree will be drawn understand the length and breath of a human body. Depending upon the subject (lady) the object (saree) will be drawn. You may draw three boxes vertically to fit the head, the torso and the legs respectively. You may also make boxes or guiding lines in the shape of a plus '--|--'. These lines help you make a rough image which develops as you continue. These lines are erased as you end the drawing or as you finish each portion.


The top will be the shortest as it will have the head and the neck.
The medium sized center will have the shoulder and the stomach.
The last box will be the longest one to accommodate the legs.;
, Draw the face. The face can be drawn as a simple 'U' or round. You may keep the hair loose or tie it up in a bun. The hair can have a side or a center partition if it is loose. Draw the neck to the face by making two small parallel lines. The neck stars closely below the ears. You may or may not show the ears as it may hie behind the hair. Make shoulders and draw the shoulder of the blouse on one side - the right side, as the saree ends with an extended bit left falling from one shoulder. So the blouse on the left side does not show. The blouse could be shaped as you like. It can have sleeves or be sleeveless. You may also experiment with the neck line by choosing from round neck, rectangular neck, oval neck, boat neck etc.

, Start with the second box to make the stomach. Here, on the right side of the figure, you may show the curve of the stomach. Draw some lines extending from around the waist to the shoulder to show creases and folds of the saree.


You must note that the right side of a saree clad lady shows her silhouette well till the waist.
The left side of the wearer is mostly covered with the last part of the saree which hangs or extends loosely from the shoulders.

, The lower end resembles the look of a long skirt. Draw lines for pleats which are tucked inside. Show the splendid pleats which starts looking narrow at the waist and goes elaborate as it unfolds towards the feet.

, You may make an elaborate saree with intricate design or just a plain one or add borders to the edge. You may then add colors as per your choice and then outline it. The colors could be crayons, pencil colors, water color etc.


Try to start coloring from the top.
Use a blend of two colors for the hair as one shade may make it look like a wig. For that you may fully color it in one color say brown and then color it with red or black or other colors of your choice. The blended effect looks more realistic.
You may use a peach color for the skin. Since the body is not like a log or just linear, you may find it difficult to color it uniformly. To make the coloring presentable, move the color in the direction of the part or object you are coloring. Because the overlapping horizontal and vertical strokes of color may look untidy. Leave the ends or difficult corner for last when you are done with the easy portion. In the end, you may just fill the white or uncolored portion wherever you see it. This keeps the color look neat.
You may outline the drawing either before the coloring or after the coloring. You may outline it after all the coloring if you can't color well within the outline.
The benefit of outlining in the end is you can hide any extra smudged color smartly by covering it with the black outline. But you must be careful because it may be difficult to color over and around the colors with a sketch pen or marker. As markers need a clean page to show. It doesn't show over crayons while water color sticks to the sketch pen. In this case you may use a thin brush to outline your drawing with water color or just outline it before coloring.

Light some candles, put on some music, hide away the clutter, and do whatever you need to do in order to create the best atmosphere for you. Don't forget to set up your writing utensils as well.;
, Breathing exercises are an excellent way to relax the body, open up the mind, and set the tone for a relaxing activity. It will calm your senses and allow you to let the creative juices flow unhindered.

, Is there a particular song that makes you feel like you're on top of the world? Put it on! Is there a picture that makes you want to create things of your own? Look it up!

, The aim isn't to make anything that looks pretty, just get the pen or pencil to the paper and start making lines.


Try closing your eyes and moving your pencil to the beat of the music.
Try putting raw emotions down by moving it in whatever way suits you. Getting your stress out? Hash out some sharp, quick lines. Then try to ease out of it with soft strokes. Let your pencil float and dance around the page in gentle swoops and loop-de-loops.
Anywhere you want to elaborate on your lines, feel free to dive in and get engrossed in a new picture.

, They don't have to be very good. They could be stick figures, even. Think of it as a visual form of venting in your diary: make your problems look positively silly. Get colorful, pull out some Crayolas! Scared someone will find them? Crinkle them up and throw them away! Just like that, problem's gone.

, Close your eyes. If you could be anywhere in the world, where would that be? That's what you're going to put down on paper. Don't be scared to get a little bit silly or fantastical: if you would unwind best next to an owl wearing a top hat, scribble in an owl with a top hat. Make yourself smile!

, You can do this by eye, or you can use the grid method. The most important thing to remember is not to get frustrated if your drawing turns out differently. Give yourself permission to make mistakes, or even give yourself some creative license.

, When you're done, look back over the work you've done. Remember how it made you feel to create it. Remember: even if you feel like it isn't great work, drawing for relaxation is more about the process of creating rather than the end result. Stash your drawings in a ""relaxation folder"", to reminisce on another day.

, Different tools have different feelings. They handle differently and produce different work. What a pencil might do for you one day, charcoal might do for you the next. That is, one day a pencil sketch of the apple on your table might be what relaxes you, whereas a watercolor painting of the sunset might hit the spot another day.

Set a time limit.",How to Practice Gesture Drawing," In every art curricula, gesture drawing is associated with figure drawing, that is drawing the human figure, usually from model's poses. The subject of your gesture drawing, however, can be just about anything, just as long as you have something the essence of which you can try to capture. In the beginning, it's probably a good idea to sketch stationary objects in various angles and learn perspective in order to be able to capture the subject in a more precise way. You can then either go on and practice figure drawing on static images.


Most artists use websites for their static gesture drawings, but you can also find videos on YouTube which will help you get better with decreasing time. Remember that gesture drawing is not drawing the figure in detail, but the gesture, so the motion behind the movement, and the weight associated with the pose.;
, The most important part of gesture drawing isn't precision, but finding the line of action. Through that line of action, you can place the varying features of your drawing such as the ribcage, the hips, and make a coherent gesture throughout., The negative space is the space surrounding your subject. This can be useful to determine the distance from one part of the subject to the next. Usually, the line of action is located where the vertebral column is, but it can go further than that if the subject is having a long, fluid line of action you can see.

, A human body, or anything in nature, is a succession of man-made shapes such as spheres, cylinders, cubes etc. While you have found the line of action, it is useful to then add the ribcage and the arm in simple lines first, then build on those shapes at a later time. After all, you are here to capture the motion, but if your gesture is good, there is nothing that prevents you from going further at your leisure. Remember to always keep it simple, and build on., The reason behind this is that unless both items are in front of you, it is near impossible to draw a first gesture drawing without going back on the paper. This is why, to make it shorter, you glance first, find the line of action, then draw it.,


S and C curves. Living things will, at any given point, have one part or group of parts that are having common curves, which can be easily found throughout the figure. A human body can have S curves and C curves, such as for example the female body, which vertebral column bears a S curve shape, and the buttocks would have a C shape, contour wise. Remember that it is only through daily practice that it will get easier, and by finding those guidelines, you will certainly win time.

, When drawing the human body, contour lines may be drawn to represent the limbs, torso, and even the head. In a way, these are just outlines, but they deter you from learning the real movement itself. A stick figure is a body drawn with very simple lines, and because only single lines are used, it's a two-dimensional representation. Because you are trying to capture the essence of the subject very quickly, you don't have time to draw its individual parts in any real detail. Drawing in shapes, or bits of the entire shape, such as the arc when an arm is folded simply shows that these parts do exist, and the lines give some idea of what those parts are doing.

, The entire time you are drawing a gesture drawing, your hand should be in motion. The idea is that you let the image transfer directly from your eyes to your hand without thinking about it. Stop your hand, and you'll suddenly be separated from the action of drawing. You'll start thinking.


Hold your pencil loosely and keep your motions fluid. Artists sometimes use gesture drawing as a warm-up to other kinds of drawing because it gets the muscles of your arm and hand loosened up. It does this because you try to just let yourself go. Relax and let your hand and arm move freely. You're not trying to color within the lines.






Limit the time you spend on each portion of the drawing. Not only should you not stop drawing, but you should also not keep drawing in any one place for too long. For practice, try to limit yourself to five or six seconds on any one area. Try to capture that part of the subject as well as you can in that time, and then move on. You could jump from working on the foot to working on the hand to drawing the head. Draw wherever your eyes go, and don't worry about trying to use a logical order or making sure that everything's connected perfectly.
Don't erase. It is always a temptation to try to ""fix"" your work or try to think through your next move. Don't give in to this temptation. If you never stop drawing, and if you keep your eyes shifting from your paper to the subject as much as possible, you shouldn't have a problem with this.

, When gesture drawing is taught in classes, a model will usually switch poses every 30 seconds to two minutes. This is good practice to push yourself to draw more quickly and, more importantly, to quickly ascertain the essence of your subject. It also has some practical applications, because if you ever try to draw a butterfly in the real world, you never know just how much time you'll have to do so before it flies away and is lost forever. Think of gesture drawing in this way. You are trying to draw a person or thing and represent its very soul in a fleeting moment. Wait a minute, wait a second, or even blink an eye, and everything may have changed.

Draw the details of the drawing i.e.",How to Draw Basic Human Figures," Draw some vertical and horizontal lines to plan your drawing. Planning is not so important for the proportion of the drawing.

The mouth falls approximately halfway between the bottom of the nose and the bottom of the chin. Draw horizontal lines to act as guides, and we'll go over each facial feature.

, The eyes are usually spaced one eye-length apart. When drawing feminine eyes, remember that femininity is associated with softness and roundness. Large, rounded eyes will have a more feminine look than small, narrow ones. If your 'subject' has visible eyelid creases, articulate them well, and space them far enough from the eye as to be noticeable. Large irises are associated with both femininity and youth. Long, dark, well illustrated eyelashes on both upper and lower lids are possibly considered the most feminine of the eye features. Remember that eyelashes curve outward as well as upward.

, The nose is one of the most difficult features to master, and also the one that can most affect how feminine or masculine your portrait will appear. Again, femininity is associated with softness and roundness--and in this particular case, a smaller size. Larger noses are considered more masculine than smaller one. You may use sharper angles on the tip of the nose if you like, but articulate everything very softly. The fewer lines and the lighter the shading, the better. Illustrate the bridge as little as possible. The alae (the 'wings' protruding from each side of the nose) should be drawn in very lightly, if at all.

, The mouth requires the same treatment as the eyes do. Soft and round, often large but not necessarily so. Lips do not usually seem to divide in the center of the mass. Typically the upper and lower lips will seem asymmetrical, with the lower being thicker, and the upper thinner. Often this is because the 'face' of the upper lip is slanted slightly downward, reducing the view. The mouth is possibly the easiest to 'feminize'. As long as both lips, both upper and lower, are well articulated, you're good to go.

Go over any finishing touches to your satisfaction.",How to Draw Facial Wrinkles," Keep an eye out for the light and dark areas where the natural light hits the face. If there is a shadow on the face, this region will require more shading. The contrast is where the definition of wrinkles lie.
, It is important that you are working on a clean and leveled surface., Keep in mind; faces are always oval in shape.


Note that it is highly recommended that these lines are drawn in lightly


, These lines help to accurately proportion the face.


The vertical line should go straight down the middle, and the horizontal line around half way down.
Note that these lines are not permanent and are only for the purpose to draw in the basic facial features. Erase these lines after.

, Like drawn in the figure, sketch in the eyes, nose, mouth and/or ears as lightly as possible.


The eyes and lips form an almond-like shape as shown.
The nose ends up slightly above the lip.

, Draw in the irises of the eye, eyebrows, and form clearer lines for the lips.

, Wrinkles usually appear around the eyes, forehead, and the mouth. As show in the figure, the lines always go away from the face.























, Additionally, darken any other hair and the irises.


To especially darken the areas, try lightly shading and rubbing with a finger.

, As pictured in the figure, lightly erase above/around the wrinkles, along the nose, and the high points of the cheekbone and forehead.


This contrast of the light and dark should give the portrait the dimension of wrinkles.

, Add or darken wrinkles to create more contrast, or erase more areas. Keep on doing so until you have reached your desired result.

Drawing the neck.,
Work on the shoulders.,
Doing the feminine torso.,
Concentrate on her limbs.",How to Draw Feminine Features2," The female neck is often thinner, though not necessarily longer, than the male neck. While male necks will often begin at the jawline, a female neck should begin notably inside that. Use the outside of your eyes as a guide. The clavicles (the two lovely curved collar bones) are usually more pronounced in females, as are the tendons that run up the neck between the clavicle and the head.

, Female shoulders are generally narrower than male shoulders, and are slanted downward at a steeper angle.

, The breasts are the most obvious addition to feminize the silhouette, but they aren't the most important. Femininity is summed up by the softly curved, rounded hourglass silhouette. The top of the hourglass is not created by the breasts--it is created by the shoulders. The shoulders and hips should be spaced roughly equal, with the torso narrowing significantly in the midsection. The narrowest spot should be just below the ribs, and just above the navel. Creating this silhouette will feminize even the most poorly 'endowed' figures. When articulating the abdomen, many people gravitate to a complete straight, even concave belly. Even when illustrating a very fit woman, the very curve of her frame will create a gentle, round slope beginning at the navel and descending to the groin. The buttocks are similar in that extra roundness in this area will feminize any silhouette (male or female!)

, Female limbs are generally more slender than male limbs, and less muscularly articulated. This is because woman have a greater ratio of body fat to muscle mass than men do. This obscures most of the muscular striations. Because of this, articulate your muscles softly. It is not necessary to make your females flaccid and unfit to feminize them, simply use a gentle hand and avoid hard, sharp lines when illustrating muscles. It is also important to note that women carry more mass (fat and muscle) below the waist than above it, and the legs will often be round and substantial, even with slender arms.


Work hard on the hands. A small palm with slender fingers, tapered at the tips to avoid looking 'stubby'. The wrist bone will also be more pronounced here than on most male figures.
Work equally hard on the feet. As above. Small, slender, with more articulated anklebones.

Make the face.,
Complete the top section.,
Add the arms.,
Draw the lower half.,
Add colors.,
Add the finishing touches.",How to Draw a Roman Princess," Make guidelines to estimate how much space the figure is going to take. To get a rough idea, you may make divisions to fit the top, mid and the lower section.


The top will fit the head, the neck and the shoulder.
The mid section will encompass the waist.
The rest of the body will be drawn in the lower section.;
, The face might be one of the most difficult things to get right. If its a straight face, it may be symmetrical. But when you tilt or bend the face, you will have to adjust the features to match.


First make the face in the shape if a curved 'L'. Leave some space for the forehead and draw curved eyebrows.
Make eyes in the shape of bent '>'. Add eyelids over the pupils and to the lids add light eyelashes.
Make a curved nose. You can opt for a longer nose, if you like.
The lips will be pointed at one end and rounded at another to compliment the tilt of the face.
Make the neck, also slightly curved and then the shoulder.

, Once the intricate detailing of the face is done, draw the hair. The hair could either be straight or wavy and long or short. Here, wavy and short hair is made with the classic wreath head band. Once the hair is made, draw the head band with two parallel lines. Add the leaf like detailing to both the sides of the head band.


This princess is not looking straight so the entire drawing will be asymmetric which means both the sides of the body will look different.
Use the guidelines to keep the left and the right side of the body in proportion by using the center guiding line.

, Start with parallel lines and then work on it until you make it thick at the top and leaner at the wrist.


For measurements you can see how far your fingers extend to your body. This will keep the measurements in check.
Add the waist band with two parallel lines.
To get the fingers right, aim to make it look slender. Make it thicker at the wrist and thinner around the nails. When the fingers are slightly twisted, it makes it appear more graceful and natural.

, The end of the gown could be made simply by continuing from the waist line. Just flair the gown slightly as it goes down.

, Color it to your liking.


Try to blend two colors for the hair by applying them one over the other.
If you smudge colors over the wreath head band, you may still color on top of the smudged color. A little additional color here and there could be covered with other colors and later with outlining.
Color the face and the dress, leaving the waist band for the end.
To keep the color looking neat, keep the coloring strokes either vertical or horizontal. Follow the section your are coloring in mind and it's direction to guide you. Then, in the end, the leftover gaps could be filled with color making it look creative and neat.

, Add the illusion of depth to your drawing with darker colors where there is either a darker area or in folds.


Use two shades of a color to make the color stand out. Just add one color evenly and the other over it.
If you are using water color, blend it with other colors of your choice.
If its pencil color, overlap it one over the other. Same with crayons.

Crayons could also be scrapped with a scale whether its a single layer of a color or more colors.

Use shading to determine the type and shape of your nose.",How to Draw a Nose1," This will be the guide for the rest of your nose, so the size of this will determine the size of your final nose. For now, draw it as big as you feel comfortable -- you can learn to draw new sizes later on.






;
, They should start just inside the edges so that the drawing looks a bit like a upside-down microphone.








, The first line extends from the lower third of the circle, curving downward. This forms the top edge of your nostril. The second line is a curvy L-shape, wrapping slightly around the nostril. This line forms the outside edge of the nostril.









Repeat the drawing on the opposite side.

, Connect the bottom of the nostrils lightly to the bottom tip of the circle. Draw a line through the bottom third of the circle, connecting the two nostrils (you'll be shading this in later).








, Draw two vertical lines from the top of the circle (where it meets the bridge of the nose lines) and connect them to the horizontal line 2/3rds of the way down. When you hit this horizontal line, turn the lines diagonally inward, so that they ""follow"" the curve of the circle back down.









These are only guidelines, so don't worry about shaping the nose perfectly yet. You'll do this through shading.

, The lines you drew are there to provide the blueprint for your shading. Simply start with light shading all along the lines, using thicker shading for bigger noses. Once the light shading is done, use a harder pencil and start shading even darker, sticking closer to your shade lines than before. This is your chance to shape the nose, so break from the guidelines where needed to get the design you want. From here, you can either:









Find and keep filling in the dark spots -- such as inside the nostril.
Add a little white to the highlights, like the tip of the nose or the bridge.
Use a picture to help your shade if you're just starting. That said, your guidelines should give more than enough help.

, Lightly rounded edges and softer shading generally leads to a more feminine nose, where hard edges and sharp lines lend the drawing a more masculine flavor. Keep practicing to learn how to form the noses just how you like.

, The top lids will droop at the edges. Add a little arch for a sad-puppy-dog effect (as shown above). The bottom lids will move upward to show tension.

, Large irises will make a face look especially adorable and huggable. Draw the eyebrows close down to the eyes, with a very subtle u-shaped slant to them. Show crinkles between the two eyebrows if you want.

, Give the eyes a darker color, to contrast more strongly against the tears. Add a large white highlight (oval- or bean-shaped) near the top of the eyes.

, Add a darker color on top, and a lighter color on bottom. Try adding some brighter spots to make the eyes sparkle. This artist included a diagram of how the eyes were shaded, with and without the sparkles.

, First, draw a wavy line across the bottom area of the eyes. This shows tears filling up the eyes. Add curved lines for tears spilling out of the eyes and over the cheeks. The curve should match the curve of the cheek.

, For extra sadness, draw shadows between the bottom of the eyebrows and the top of the eyelids. Add a pinkish tone to the whites of the eyes if you wish to show eyes that are reddened from crying.

Add light shading and highlights to the teeth, lips, and surrounding skin.",How to Draw Teeth," As teeth come in many shapes and sizes, it is important to note that they will all be drawn a little bit differently. However, understanding the general shape of teeth and gums will tremendously help you in drawing realistic teeth. For sake of simplicity, this article will focus on drawing teeth from a face-to-face perspective.


It is important to note that every smile varies in the number of upper and lower teeth that show.
Take note of any abnormalities in the teeth structure, such as missing or crooked teeth.
Although it seems intuitive, it is important to draw what you see, not what you imagine teeth to normally look like.;
,,


Draw another line just below the halfway point of the rectangle. This will serve as the ""tooth line"" later in the drawing.







, Erase the lines you made for the rectangle, as they are no longer needed to proceed. In this step, do not apply too much pressure with the pencil.


Do not erase the midline separating the mouth into two halves. This line will help to align the teeth and gums.

, Always begin with the middle downward triangle, lining it up with the initial midline. Once the middle triangle is placed, add the rest evenly below the upper lip, making sure to lessen the distance between each triangle.


This step is crucial because if all of the triangles are equidistant from one another, the teeth will look flat and unrealistic.

,, At each gum point, draw a very light line that meets the ""tooth line"" you drew earlier. These lines will be erased later, so it is very important to draw them lightly.

, To do this, draw triangles where the downward lines meet the ""tooth line""


In almost every tooth structure, you will find that the third tooth(on both sides) from the center of the midline has a pointier end than the other teeth. Remember, it is little nuances like this that will make your drawing appear more realistic.







, Remember, the bottom teeth are smaller in width than the upper teeth and, therefore, need not match the upper teeth.

,, It is best to slowly develop tones rather than beginning with the darkest tones.


Remember, the cleanest teeth will not appear white on a realistic drawing.

,
Start the shading by using the method of cross hatching.,
Use a blending stump (also known as a Tortillion) or a Q-Tip to smudge the pencil lines.,
The darkest areas will be the area under the pointer finger and the area that is being blended in photo 16.,
To finish, use a 2B and 4B pencil to put in the darkest tones.

",How to Draw a Pointing Hand,";
, Notice the angle, created by the top and bottom lines, slopes towards each other.

, Notice the direction of each of their curves.

, The small banana shape that you see to the left is the fingernail. Do not close the top!

,,, Notice the creases of skin on the foreshortened finger.

,,,, Cross hatching is a series of lines from the pencils tip (watch the video).

, Continue to cross hatch over what you smudge to create strong shadows.

, The creases of the foreshortened area of the pointer finger is also quite dark.

Start with a big circle in the middle of the page.,
Draw two long vertical lines on top of the nose.,
Draw a horizontal line through the bottom 1/3 of your of your circle, slid slightly to the left.,
Draw in a curved, L-shaped nostril on the left side and a smaller one on the right.,
Add a diagonal line where the vertical line meets the horizontal one.,
Start shading along your guidelines.",How to Draw a Nose2," A normal circle is your guide, once again, for forming the nose.









Almost all of the steps are nearly identical to those outlined in ""Front-Facing Nose,"" but they are slid to the left or right to put the nose in profile.

, The first one will be about dead center, the second almost on the far right edge of the circle. Note that, if you want to draw the nose from the other side, you simply flip these lines. Both lines should continue a bit into the circle.








, This line should be the length of your circle, but shifted over so that it doesn't fit. The left side of the line will leave the circle, the right side won't touch the right edge.








, Put your left nostril at the end of your horizontal line, then draw a concave line for the top of the nostril right where your horizontal line ends. When the nose is turned, you barely see the far nostril, so a little backward ""J"" pressed close to the circle should be enough for the right nostril.








, This line will be the underside of your exposed nostril. The line extends diagonally from the horizontal line you drew to the left, towards the bottom of the left nostril. It will create a little triangle on the left side of your circle.








, Again-- anything near the lines is shaded in heavier than anything far away. Start with light, easy shading around the lines, filling in the blocks of shading and the general contours of the nose. Then use a thicker, harder pencil to add in your blacks and darkest patches along your guidelines, paying particular attention to the nostrils and the long vertical lines forming the bridge of the nose.









Keep the space between the two vertical lines and the space above your horizontal guideline mostly white.

"
"
Draw a big circle, then a smaller, overlapping circle to the right of the big one.,
Add a little ""hook"" extending off the smaller circle and into the big one for the nostril.,
Add lines for the bridge of the nose and top of the lips.,
Erase the top half of the guiding circles.,
Use your guidelines to start shading.,
Fill in the highlights with white.",How to Draw a Nose3," The first circle forms the profile of the nose, and the second is the profile of the nostril. You can slide this second circle up and down to change the final shape of your nose easily.








, This little hook should naturally come off the edge of the smaller circle, the curl back on itself inside the larger circle. This is the outline of the nostril opening.








, The first line is a diagonal line coming off the edge of your bigger circle, the second curls slightly off the bottom of the bigger circle. These attach the nose to your face -- look in the mirror if you're unsure what parts these correspond to on a real face.








, Look at a real nose in profile -- the semi-circles of shading around the nostril end when the nostrils start to meet the bridge of your nose. While you'll be shading along the guidelines, like the other tutorials, you don't need all of them.








, Once again, you want to focus on the guidelines to tell you where to shade. Pay particular attention to the outside edges around the nostril, filling it in as dark as you can to get a nice, dramatic shape.








, The three main areas to highlight in a profile nose are the just above the tip (the rounded bulb at the end of your nose), the top of the bridge, and the small circle of light at the center of your nostril (the part of the nostril closest to the ""camera"" in your image)."

Get an ordinary pencil and draw the outline of the eye hole and eyelid.,
Change to a darker sketching pencil.,
Then you shade the edge of the iris really dark and then 1/3 of the way down, blend it slightly so the edge goes a bit lighter.,
Change back to an ordinary pencil if you used a different one and underneath the shaded part under the reflection, do part of the iris.,
Shade around the pupil like you did with the outline of the inner iris in step 2, but with an ordinary pencil.,
At the top, right hand side of the iris you need to shade in darkly with a normal pencil, diagonally, so it looks like the iris is going around and not just colored otherwise it won't look so realistic.,
Add some eyelashes.",How to Draw Realistic Human Eyes," It doesn't have to be too detailed or shaded yet.;
, I used 5B on mine, but you can use any type of pencil. You start of by drawing the out line of the iris - it's not quite a whole circle shape unless your drawing some one with a shocked face. when you're happy with that, make a start of drawing the pupil. Remember the pupil should be close to the centre of the eye, but the iris doesn't have to be at the centre of the eye. You can also draw a reflection of a window or light or something if you want to, but that is optional.

, Then if you've done a reflection, you need to shade darkly around that. Once you've done that, shade the top a bit more lightly and carry on until the corner so it looks a bit like a slanted triangle.

, Don't do it in little section, draw it lightly in quick long strokes and go over them a few times. You may not be able to tell because of the picture quality but next to that you need to draw a smaller part of iris around the inside edge of it, but use the technique of moving the pencil in different directions - don't just shade up and down or side to side, make it look neat, but messy.

, You only need to do it a little bit, quite small. After you've done that, you make the iris look like it's getting darker, by pressing a tiny bit harder and sketching in different directions. You need to make it longer than the bit you just shaded though. The image should be big enough to explain. Once you have done this, you go back to the part of the iris underneath the reflection and add a very small bit of the shading in different directions using a darker pencil.

, Then you need to shade around very lightly around the rest of the iris - shading in straight lines, but going around the pupil.

, Draw really small rounded of lines along the bottom of the eye for the lashes at the bottom and longer lines at the top for the longer eyelashes. They should be the same height at the eyelid, but you can do them longer if you want. For a better look, add light shading to around the eyelid area, simple light sketches from left to right and on the left had corner of the eye.

, Begin by lightly drawing the basic shapes. This will help you with your proportions as you add details. Keep in mind that different hand positions will yield different shapes.

, Round out the fingertips and wrists, making sure not to change the proportions.

, Rather than drawing what you is lit well, look for shadows in the picture, and add them to your sketch, allowing the well-lit parts to appear as the absence of shadow. This will make your drawing look more realistic. Pay special attention to the indents and shading between fingers


Avoid excessive erasing. Draw lightly, and if you decide that you are unhappy with your drawing, simply go over it. Often times the first drawing only needs a bit of touching up.

, Note: the nail is important in recognizing the position of the hand, so do your best to draw it accurately.

, Once you are finished with your drawing, you can erase the excess lines on your page. Just be careful not to erase the lines that you like!

, If you haven't already, shade in the wrinkles and indents on your hand (to ensure a smooth shade, rub the shaded area lightly with your finger to spread the pencil around). Draw any scars or freckles if desired. Add anything else you think is missing.

Add variation.",How to Draw Eyelashes," These instructions assume you're drawing an eye viewed head-on. Outline the eye, then draw a second line just underneath the top edge. This is the thickness of the upper eyelid. The upper eyelashes emerge from the top line.


When viewed head-on, this thickness is barely visible. Keep the two lines close together.;
, Upper eyelashes swoop downward a short distance, then rapidly up and away from the eye. Practice this motion many times on a practice sketch:


Press a hard pencil firmly against the upper edge of the eyelid.
Move downward for an instant, then rapidly ""swoop"" upward. The faster you do this, the more natural the result.Reduce pressure as you move the pencil. The line should be thinner and lighter near the tip of the lash.

, Eyelashes tend to point outward from the curve of the eyelid, as though they were sun rays or wheel spokes. An individual eyelash, however, often overlaps its fellows or points in a slightly uneven direction. Lightly sketch the eyelashes so they fan outward, but have plenty of variation among them. You don't need to commit to the exact shapes, which are described in more detail below. Just focus on positioning for now.


This is a good time to study photographs of eyes, or look in a mirror.
Many eyelashes hook together at the tip. Draw a few pairs of lashes that meet at the same point., Once you've got this motion down, start again with a fresh sketch. First, draw the eyelashes near the outer corner, near the ear. These lashes grow close together.


The eyelashes near the outer corner are the longest. They also curve farther downward and outward than other lashes., Next, draw the eyelashes along the middle ⅓ of the eyelid. These are nearly as long and as numerous as the outer eyelashes.


Rotate the direction of the eyelashes as you move toward the middle. By the time you reach the middle of the eye, the lashes are almost vertical., These are much shorter, and thinly scattered. Avoid even spacing, which looks unnatural.

, Draw over the lashes using a softer pencil, pressing firmly to make them bolder and thicker. Do this for roughly ⅔ of the lashes, to create variation.As before, draw from the base upward. Reduce pressure as you reach the tip, to keep them thin and pointed.

, Eyelids have three dimensions. When viewed head on, the lower eyelid edge is quite visible. Draw a second line alongside the eye's lower outline to show this. Make this edge thicker than the upper eyelid's, assuming the eye is wide open.


You can use white charcoal or chalk to make this edge more obvious., These lashes have a slight curve to them. They grow downward a short distance, then outward. This curve is not as obvious as the upper eyelashes', so be subtle.


These lashes originate from the base of the lower lid. No part of these lashes should cover the white of the eye.

, The lower lashes grow much less densely than the upper ones. Scatter the lashes thinly and unevenly along the lower edge.


Exact eyelash counts vary widely. Typically, the lower lid has about 50% the number of the upper lid.

, As before, the lashes shouldn't be perfectly arrayed in a circle. Add a few eyelashes that merge with a nearby lash at the tip.


If the lashes look too thinly scattered, draw a few shorter lines near the base of the long lashes.

If you want to make your eye look like it has makeup applied, color the top eyelid (eyeshadow effect), and darken the edges just below the eyelashes (eyeliner effect).

",How to Draw a Realistic Female Eye," This is the top edge of the eye.;
, This is the bottom edge and these lines should be connected at one corner. This corner is the outer corner of the eye. These lines at the inner corner must be slightly parted.

,, Mind this detail: the iris isn't completely shown; it is partially covered by the eyelid, this gives the sense of depth.

, Keep in mind, you must draw them on the edges of both eyelids, more on the bottom than on the top. Try to keep the same distance between them and make them approximately under the same angle. Draw the top eyelashes longer than the bottom.

, It should begin a bit before the inner corner and end at the end of the outer corner. Make it as angled as you want. A more distinct angle opens the eye more, but also gives the ""fake cosmetics"" kind of look, so try to achieve a balance (unless you're drawing elves, this is where intense angles are very welcome).

, These can be as near each other or as far apart as you like.

,, It should thin out as you advance toward the outer corner. (This one turned out ugly, though x.x) Color the pupil and the iris, leaving the previously drawn circles white (light reflection). Please notice the color of the iris grows darker while moving upwards; this is because the top eyelid casts a shadow on it.

You can find fantastic books geared specifically toward figure drawing from an anatomical perspective that will give you a better idea of how human beings are put together. The works of Leonardo da Vinci and Henry Gray are wonderful to study because they are both artful and anatomically accurate.;
, Try to really draw what you see, (which is a challenging skill to acquire in and of itself) and not simply copy the movement your hand is used to. If you are simply sketching an image from your head, though, there are still some basics that can help us all create a realistic looking nose. Remember that no two faces are exactly the same, and no face is 100% symmetrical. Human beings are comprised of organic matter, and we are all delightfully imperfect! There are many variations on the human nose, but this guide will give you a basic idea of how to create a ""beginner's nose.""

, Instead of using a No. 2 pencil, you might want to use a 4 or greater to create finer lines.


Draw the basic framework of the head before you draw any facial features. This will allow you to determine how your face will be situated. Will your person be looking up, off in the distance, or directly facing the viewer? There are many variations to consider, and they will all affect proportion and perspective.
It's easiest to draw a profile (a person looking away, so we view the side of the face) or straight on, as if you were having a conversation with your subject. For this guide, we'll assume you're looking straight on. Draw an egg shape, with the widest part of the egg at the top, with the narrowest part on bottom, where the chin will be. Yes, facial shape will vary widely from person to person, but this is just to get an idea for proportion.

,, Generally speaking, the eyes should be along that middle ""equator"" line, and the nose will start just above this line. If you prefer to draw the eyes in first, (which I do,) this can help keep your proportions in check.

, Bring it down into a ""j"" shape, the bottom part of the j being about halfway between the equator and chin.

,,,


This process can be amended and modified according to your own style, but this should give you a basic nose shape without too much strain and effort. Again, it's best to start off with a light touch so you can erase and try again if your proportion looks a bit off.
A different and more realistic technique (that can be slightly more challenging) is to begin drawing one side of the bridge of the nose from above the equator, then stop your line about halfway between the equator and the chin. Do the same on the other side of the bridge of the nose. You should now have two lines on either side of the ""prime meridian"" line on your face.

,,,


This will look more natural once you've mastered it, so as with all artistic endeavors, practice makes perfect!

, There are only three very easy to draw markings on a cartoon ear. At the top, a circular arch. In the middle, a small straight or lowly curved line. At the bottom, an upside down arch that is almost a straight line. Look at the drawing for examples.

, If you want to learn about earrings and more, keep reading! If not, then congratulations!

, In cartoons, most teenage and adult girls have them. Earrings definitely spunk up the look, and is just a small extra detail, but is pleasing to the eye!

It's your decision to make! Picture it in your head exactly to get the best results. Make your earrings match your character's personality helps as well!

, For instance, two triangles and a circle together look great! Then perhaps you could stud square diamonds in it? It's all your decision, so be creative!

",How to Draw an Eye in Colored Pencil," Any brand is ok to use, but using smoother pencils will help with blending. An example of a good brand is Prismacolor Premier, depicted above.;
, It will be much easier to pick out the correct colors if you have a photo to look at, as well as help with the shape and shading.


You can use a picture of your own eye or one from the internet.

, Pay attention to the size of the tear duct and waterline, as this will be important for making it look realistic. Also notice areas where there are glared or reflective spots; you should draw these areas out so you know to avoid coloring inside them. If you plan to go back over light areas afterwards with something such as a white gel pen, only draw out the largest light spots.

,


Do not draw the eyelashes yet, this will be done later.

, Be sure to test them out before using them to make sure they match your reference photo.


Having a white pencil will help you blend over areas if you make a mistake.
Don't sharpen the pencils too much, as the tip is more likely to break if it is at a very sharp point.

, This is so the graphite of the pencil doesn't mix with your colors.

, This should not be the areas you drew out where there was glare on the eye.

, Remember it is much easier to make colors darker than lighter.

,, The top of the iris will likely be one of these spots, as well as some of the details in the iris.

,, Adding more color later is easier than taking it out.

, This will help you reference where the deeper areas of the iris are later.

, This color will be the color that appears most prominently in the iris, such as orange, light brown, or blue. Try to avoid picking a dark color.

, In the case of orange, it could be a brighter orange or even a red if used with caution.

,, This will help it look more 3D.

,,,, It is easiest with a black marker or pen, however you can still use a colored pencil. Make sure they curve and don't go straight up. Look at your reference photo to see how they should curve under the waterline.

,,, In a photo with cooler light, you will use a grey. If the photo has warmer light you will use a more pinkish tone.

,, You can also add in reflections or shadows of the eyelashes.

, Don't make them too visible or it will make the eye less realistic. Pay attention to where they are most visible in your reference photo.

Starting from the left, the eyes we want are the second and fourth. The inner corner of most eyes tilts down; the outer corner can tilt up or down, depending. For our purposes, that outside corner should tilt up a bit, so that the line that describes the bottom lid looks like a very slight ""s"" shape on its side.








, The nose is narrowest between the eyes and widest at the nostrils. Notice how the tip turns under. Everyone's nose is unique, and if you are doing a portrait, capturing someone's nose exactly will give your drawing more authority.








, On either side of this, draw ears. Notice that the ears stick out wider at the top and then come in near the lobes. Some lobes are attached and some are loose. Ears are pretty complicated to draw - keep them simple at first until you get an idea of their construction.








, Make a flat, rounded ""V"" shape that is dips below the lowest line. That will be the bottom of the lower lip. Join that smile line with a wide, soft ""M"" shape—the top of the upper lip. Draw a very soft ""m"" shape between the two, which defines the separation of the lips, and the lip ratio. Moving the mouth up or down, and making the top and bottom lips with different proportions will help vary the look of the face you're drawing.








, Hair is hard to draw, but start off with lines (remember, this is line drawing). Is the hair straight? Parallel lines curving around the head. Is the hair curly? Curved lines. Notice how curly hair breaks into clumps composed of parallel strands.








, The neck is thicker than we like to think. The sides start at the top of the jaw line and go down on a curve.








, You can add a shirt, jacket, turtleneck—even nothing at all. The type of clothing you add will give your drawing some sense of time and place.

, Wide open smiling mouths with just the top row of teeth are the best. You could also make a wavy line to make them look sick. If your character is a bad guy make a mean mouth.

, Your ears should be about twice the size of the eyes. go with just one curved line inside it. Bald is usually my pick for hair but spiked is alright to.

Pick a reference or photograph.,
Create a general outline of the face and head.,
Don't assume anything.,
Begin shadowing.,
Use keen observational skills.,
Be patient and take your time.",How to Draw a Realistic Portrait from a Photograph," Make sure whichever picture(s) you choose, drawing them matches your skill level. If you're just a beginner, you probably shouldn't pick a photo that involves too many weird shadows, is taken from an unusual angle, etc.; keep it simple. If you've had more practice drawing portraits, you can try something more complex to challenge your skills.


Decide if you want the person to be male or female. Male portraits tend to have stronger shadows, which may or may not be easier for you. Female portraits tend to have longer hair, and some people find a lot of hair boring and/or difficult to draw.
Decide if you want the person to be younger or older. Older faces can be more interesting, yet more challenging, because of the extra lines and texture, but they can also convey the most emotion. Very little children are easier to draw, but may be harder if you're used to drawing adults.;
, For this, use a lighter pencil, use a 2H, or if you don't have pencils with a different lead, use a mechanical pencil. These pencils create thinner, lighter lines, which will be easier to erase if you need to change the outline.


Go in further and draw the outlines of the general facial features, such as the eyes, some lines of the nose, inside of the ear, and lips, but don't shadow anything in.

, Only draw what you can see. If there are no bags under the eyes, do not draw them. If you can only see two or three lines around the nose, don't draw more to make it more defined. Making assumptions are risky because those assumptions could be false and mess up the image being conveyed.


You can go back later and add details that can't be seen in your reference photo if you don't want your portrait to be an exact replica.

, This is the most daunting part of drawing a portrait, but it's what makes the subject come to life.


Determine the lightest and darkest parts of the person's face. If you want your portrait to look 3-dimensional and dramatic, make the lightest parts as white as possible (with your hardest/finest pencil) and make the darkest parts and black as possible (with your boldest pencil).

, To make sure the shadows and features look realistic and similar to your reference, consistently look back and compare your drawing to the photo. You don't have to become OCD about this--especially if you're a beginner, your drawing will almost never look like an exact copy of the photo.


Don't forget that part of drawing a good portrait is capturing the uniqueness and expression of your subject. If your subject has a larger-than-average nose, don't try to make it slimmer. Or, if their eyebrows are more wispy, don't try to darken them. A portrait should look like a real person, not an ideal.

, Rushing a portrait will diminish its quality.

Collect a clean sheet of paper and a writing instrument.,
Make sure you have a flat surface to write on.,
Draw the eye.,
Draw the nose.The nose that you draw is crucial to the age and race of the person that you draw.,
The mouth can be very tricky.,
Ears, as you must have heard, where your eyes are, but this is not usually the case.,
The shape of the face depends on you.,
Have fun experimenting with different looks!

",How to Draw Faces With a Pencil," I recommend using a blank sheet of paper, and if this not going to be a masterpiece, then using copy paper is a less expensive alternative. I also recommend using pencil because you are able to erase mistaken marks. Some people like to use erasable pen (yes it does exist), but I wouldn't because sometimes it can leave a slight stain that you cannot remove.;
, Once you improve, you may like to experiment with using a sandpaper-like surface to add definition to your work.

, Draw a shape that looks like an almond. These two eyes have spacing between them that is just as large a one of your eyes. In the inner corner of your eye, soften the tip of your ""almond"" so that it looks curved on the inner corner. The eyelid is about a fourth of a centimeter above your eye. Follow the outline of your eye at this distance to create the eyelid. The iris of the eye is a circle, but when drawing an eye, unless your character is in shock, you will not see the whole circle. The eye can be any color that you prefer. Eyelashes are not to be too long. Try to keep it reasonably short .

, If the nose slants down, the person is older. If the nose is rounded up, it is a younger individual, typically. If the nose if wider, it would most likely be an African American or Native American. If the nose is more narrow, then it is most likely a Caucasian. This does not always apply, though, so check your image or live model for confirmation.

, As you know, or will know now, the mouth has two parts, it is not just one long line. The mouth extends to the center or your pupils on both sides of you face. The upper lip is usually slightly bigger than your lower lip, but this is not always the case, again check your photo or live model for confirmation. For females, the indention of the upper lip us usually more defined that that of a male. Also, the upper lip can cause shadowing onto the lower lip depending on the lighting. This is what gives the look of separation between the lips.

, Your ears start just slightly above your eyes. Something you would not notice if you were not looking for it. They extend to the bottom of your nose. In case your are new to the concept of drawing ears, let me give you a couple tips. If your are drawing a face straight on, remember that your ears lie slanted on your head. They do not stick out like a giraffe's.

, Depending on the size of your person, the size and shape of the head could change. Remember that you have temples, too. Adding this characteristic makes your drawing more detailed and skillful. Also, your neck is as wide as where the outer points of your eyes are.

,
Clean.",How to Draw a Face1," Heads are never circular, they are oval shaped, like an egg. So sketch an oval outline that tapers down at the bottom.;
, The easiest way to start is to use dividing lines to map out the proportions of the face. Firstly, draw a line down the center of the oval. Then cut the oval in half again, this time horizontally.

, Divide the lower half again with another horizontal line. The point at which this crosses the vertical line is where you should begin to draw the base of the nose. Sketch out the base of the nose and a nostril either side.

, Divide the bottom quarter in half again. The bottom of the lips will rest on the dividing line you have just drawn. Draw a line for where the lips meet and then draw the top lip. Now fill in the bottom of the lip.

,

Draw two big circular balls to make out the eyes across the central horizontal line. These will form the eye sockets. The top of this circle is where the eyebrow is and at the bottom is where the cheekbone sits.






Draw the eyebrows along the top.






You then need to work on the shape of the eyes. Eyes are almond shaped, so bear this in mind as you sketch them (eyes come in every size and shape, so feel it out). As a rule of thumb, the distance between the two eyes is the width of another eye.






Inside the iris, the color inside the center of the eye, draw the pupil, which is the darkest bit of the eye. Fill most of it in black and leave a little white. With your pencil flat, use a bit of shading for the base. Shade variant from medium and light in the iris, using tightly spaced short lines from the edge of the pupil to the white of the eye. Draw lighter in some areas to give it a nice effect. Draw eyebrows above. Now rub out the guidelines below the eye.






Next, draw the top of the eyelid over the top of the almond. The base of the eyelid comes down over the top of the iris and covers the top of it slightly.







, Now, add a little shading underneath the eye and where the eye meets the nose to define the socket. For a tired look, add shading and swooped lines at a more acute angle to the bottom eyelid.

, The base of the ear should be drawn in line with the bottom of the nose and the top of the ear in line with the eyebrows. Remember, ears should be flat against the side of the head.

, Make sure that you draw the hair from the parting outwards.

, Necks are thicker than you imagine. Draw two lines coming down from roughly where the bottom horizontal line meets the edges of the face.

, Add a bit of shading under the nose and accentuate the chin. Put expression lines around the mouth, and shading in the corners. Then outline the ridge of the nose. The more prominent you make these features, the ""older"" your face will look.

,, Use an eraser to remove any guidelines.

",How to Draw a Bishounen Face2," Join them by drawing two more lines and connect them with a small chin. Because bishounen tend to have somewhat feminine features, draw the face longer than usual. When drawing the chin, it should be at least somewhat thicker than a girl's chin (which is drawn as a point).

, Use a ruler or any straight edge surface to draw one line in the middle and one across the face. The line across the face will determine the placement for the eyes, while the line in the middle will be used for drawing the nose.

,


For the eyes, draw two parallelograms for the basic shape. This is an easier method because afterwards you just need to round off the edges.
When doing a straight-on face, the nose is drawn as a shadow rather than a line, thus giving it more depth.
Draw a slightly curved line for the mouth, and add a small shadow underneath. Unlike females, bishounens have longer mouths and are more detailed as well.

, Create thicker lines on the eyes and give him some eyelashes. When drawing the eyebrows, start drawing them thickly then slowly thin them at the ends.

Jawlines will also vary, but a girl's jawline is often fairly round., Your girl needs something to wear her clothes on, right? Sketch around the skeleton frame to create the body, and try to make it proportional. Female bodies are generally more curvy and less angular than male bodies, which is a fairly important part of making the body look less masculine. Look up reference photos, if needed.

Don't be afraid to try drawing different body types. Not every girl has a thin, hourglass-shaped body. Your girl doesn't have to be thin and hourglass-shaped to rock that crop top and pair of shorts!

, Again, follow the skeleton frame and try to make it look proportional.

You can try sketching the girl's feet, too, if you want to try drawing her shoes as well. No-heeled or slightly-heeled strappy sandals would look cool with her outfit. Or if she's at the beach, or simply a non-conventional kind of girl, maybe she's barefoot!

, Obviously, you'll need to draw the eyes, nose, and mouth. However, a big thing that people forget are the eyebrows, so be sure not to forget these. Additionally, your girl doesn't have to have a completely spotless face; why not give her some freckles, birthmarks, moles, scars, or even acne? Nobody's face is picture-perfect; in fact, making her face imperfect may make her seem more realistic., Chances are, you don't want your girl to be bald or have a void where her hair should be. Consider drawing different types of realistic hair; curly, wavy, straight, thick, fine, styled, long, short, or more can be used for the appearance of your girl's hair. And who needs to be realistic all of the time? Maybe try anime hair, where it's unusually (or unrealistically) styled, artificially colored, or just plain weird!, For a lot of people, the crop top is what gets them stuck; however, it's fairly simple. All you need to do is draw a shirt. Then, sketch a horizontal line halfway down the shirt. This will be where the shirt is cropped.

Crop tops, like all other shirts, do not form themselves exactly to a person's body. They are not the equivalent of clothing suction cups, and therefore, should not be drawn so that they fit to every curve of the girl's breasts or arms.
Many crop tops have different designs; some are strapless or have spaghetti straps, while others have sleeves that vary in length. The material of the top can vary, and some tops may have additional decorations, such as frills, layers, patterns, or so forth. Don't be afraid to get creative!

, Below the horizontal line you sketched, erase the extra sketch lines. Then, ""round"" the line a bit so that the shirt looks natural, since the ends of shirts don't form into a single solid line., If you don't know how to draw pants, draw rectangles around the legs. Don't worry about how they look; just make sure that they cover her thighs, at the least. Afterwards, on the upper parts of the pants, sketch two horizontal lines on the pants. These will be the shorts., Below the horizontal lines you sketched, erase the extra sketch lines on the pants. Afterwards, ""round"" the lines into curves., If you've chosen to draw shoes on your girl, now's the time to do so. There are many types of shoes you can draw, from flip-flops to heels to sneakers to sandals. Most shoes are somewhat oval-shaped to match the wearer's foot.

Closed-toed, one-piece shoes, such as sneakers, are simpler to draw than open-toed shoes or sandals.

, You can use a pen to darken the lines of the final outcome, if you wish., Use whatever colors you'd like and color in your drawing. Coloring it isn't a necessity, but it's a nice touch!"

, These can be as long/short/straight/wavy you like, but don't put in too many or your skirt will look wrinkled and second-rate.

, Sketch in details/designs that you want--be creative! You don't have to keep it to the simple lace layers seen here, go ahead and put stripes or polka dots or a floral pattern on your skirt. The sky's your only limit!

, Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional. Erase any unnecessary guidelines.

, Use your imagination, with bold streaks and designs of color to make your skirt as memorable as possible. Add in shadow/highlighting and you've created your very skirt drawing!

, Make the ears curve slightly up at the top (which should be level with the bottom of the eyes) and the lobes curve slightly out. The ears should be pretty simple.

People with Down Syndrome tend to be heavyset. Even if this character is a muscular athlete, they will have a very clear softness in their face and body. Make the cheeks full.
Just like people without Down Syndrome, people with Down Syndrome can have a variety of face shapes. Your character's face shape may be round, oval, heart, et cetera.;
, Your character should have a thick, short neck. Make the shoulders proportionate based on your character's age and the style of your art. Use the collarbones to help guide you in the pose.

, The eyes should be widely-spaced, and positioned lower on the face than average (leaving a big forehead). Note the clear almond shape of the eyelids: a bigger swoop on top, and a smaller one on bottom. Both lids should be angled upwards at the outsides.


For extra detail, show a hint of puffiness under the lower lid. This is a common feature of people with Down Syndrome.

, People with Down Syndrome usually have a button nose, wider at the bottom, with a relatively flat nose bridge. Take age into consideration: on a baby or small child, the bridge will be barely visible, while it will be much more defined in adulthood. The girl in the picture is in her mid teens.


The nose bridge extends to the eye socket. Follow this curve to draw the eyebrows. A few people with Down Syndrome have unibrows.

, People with Down Syndrome may not have perfect control over their mouth muscles, so go with a more rounded and relaxed shape. Avoid sharp corners.


Add lips if desired. Make the lips more rounded for a feminine look, and more squarish for a masculine look.

, Most people with Down Syndrome have fine hair that is straight or slightly wavy. Use thin, flowing lines that follow the shape of the hair and the contours of the head.


For bangs, use dense lines, with the most lines at the ends. Give a them a rounded shape.

, Consider glasses, freckles, jewelry, and props. (This girl is wearing headphones.) Refine your sketch.


A good way to check your picture is to view it backwards. Digital artists can flip the sketch in their drawing programs. Traditional artists can hold up their drawing, with the sketch side facing a light or window. They can then see the imaged reversed through the paper.

, Use thicker lines for basic shapes and areas you want to call attention to, and thinner lines for smaller details such as hair, eyebrows, freckles, and glasses.


Keep your lines rounded and organic.
You may line your drawing entirely in black, or use some other colors as well (e.g. brown for the eyebrows).

, This includes general shadows such as the area under the chin, and places of overlap such as the area around the headphone and the hand. Darken lines you want to emphasize, such as the outline of the face and eyes.


Darkening the corners of a smile will make it look more cheerful. However, too much of this may start to make the character look like they might not have Down Syndrome.
Zoom out, or place your picture on the other side of the room, to see how balanced it looks. Refine as desired.

, The nonwhite background color will encourage you to use contrast. Many people with Down Syndrome have a cool complexion, so use cooler and desaturated tones. Take care to keep the cheeks looking full and rounded.


Many white people with Down Syndrome have extremely fair complexions.
Think of the nose as an elongated teardrop. The deepest shadow is usually directly below the nose, with some shading on either side and a lighter part on the middle.

, Fill them both with a medium grey-brown color and work your way up to a near white tone. The deeper tones will suggest shadows cast by the eyelids and the corners of the mouth, and it will look more three-dimensional.


It is normal for work to look creepy at this stage. It will improve once the eyes are finished.

, Start with your darkest color, working up to the lightest one. Many people with Down Syndrome have Brushfield spots—little whitish dots in the iris, close to the pupil.


The top eye on the right shows how the eyes were shaded. The bottom eye shows the same eye with Brushfield spots.

, Flick your brush in the same direction that the hair flows. Apply the darkest color to the edges of the hair, and put layers of lighter colors on top. This artist added the lightest color in a stripe on top.

, If the character is wearing lipstick or lip gloss, add a highlight or two on the lips as shown above. The shirt does not need to be detailed, as the focus is on the face.

, Look over the shading and consider tweaking the colors. This artist added a Gradient Map layer at 15% opacity to enhance the color.


Now is a good time to zoom out or stand back from your artwork again to see how it looks from a distance. You may also notice things needing correction—for example, the mouth was made less pointy.

, The chin would possibly be ""V"" with a square bottom. It could be modified for a full-figured girl.

,,, The top lip should be consistently a little fuller, and the lower lip should be fuller in the center, tapering to the corners. Make a small hole in between her lips as if she was opening her mouth a little bit.

, Try to be as accurate as possible for this as it could define one girl from another.

, Do not make her ears ""stick out"". They should lay alongside her head. Do not make them too small or too big as this may offend her. The hole in her ear should be about the size of half a pea, don't make it too big either.

,, Never put the piercings in first. If she does have any tattoos, make them as best as you can, don't try too hard as she wouldn't be focused on these anyway, you could even leave them out. If she only has studs do small circles, hoops and rings do a kind of ""C"" shape - stretchers just draw a line, thickness depending on how big it is, tunnels just do a kind of ""hole in her ear with a layer outside it.

, You know what women wear for hair styles. Take ideas from real life to fit your model. Don't make it too short or in long heaps. Do a curve at the bottom of her hair and make some feathering. Be careful not to overdraw this. For the strands, if she has multiple hair colours, shade them in, corresponding darkest to lightest. If she has darker hair, like brown or black, and has a blonde highlight in it, shade the darker hair and leave the rest plain, with maybe a bit of shading. Draw faint lines to represent the multiple strands on her head, going down her hair.

, Thick near her nose, thinning outward. Make them smaller than her eyes but not by much, make it nice and neat and not scruffy. The ideal brows start just above the inside of the tear duct, and extend to the outer limit of her eye.

, A freckle or a mole is okay, but they are usually covered by make-up. If you add one, make it very slight.

,, Unless you do this well, you might just be happy with the bust. Don't get into drawing the body unless you have a good eye for this type of drawing. If you do, make the body, go down to about even with her second or third shirt button. The shoulders should be curved, not triangle or square. Make her neck curve down into her body.

, The upper and lower lip, nose, eyes and forehead and opposite side of head and neck are all affected by the light.

, They just take away from the sketch.

Do your research.,

Decide what kind of chin you want to draw.,
Draw the sides of the chin.,
Draw the bottom of the chin.",How to Draw a Chin," Look at every possible resource for chin reference: online images, your reflection, your friends and family, pictures of presidents on coins. After a few months, you'll notice something interesting - all chins are different, and yet, fundamentally the same. Anatomically, the chin is mostly defined by the human mandible. This bone structure is what gives the chin it's sharp, royal angles. It is less hindered by fleshy muscles or soft tissue, unless the recipient is overweight of course.;
, You won't be able to tell if your chin looks right if it's situated on an anatomically incorrect face right? Try taking some online classes or going to live drawing sessions and work on every part of the face other than the chin. Once you can draw soulful eyes, tender lips, and sterling cheekbones you are ready to begin drawing the most powerful feature of the face.

, For instance, feminine chins are generally smaller and sharper whereas masculine chins are larger and more boxy. Making this decision is critical as it will completely determine the personality of your drawing.

, Once you've decided the sort of chin you want to draw, begin drawing the sides of the chin. Keeping in mind that chins are like cornerstones holding together the cheeks of the face, make sure the angle of the sides of the chin match up to sides of the face. This is important or else your chin may look like it belongs elsewhere!

, This is the most difficult part of the entire chin - it may be tempting to connect the sides of the chin with a single horizontal line or to extend the sides down into a point, but these techniques will make your chin look amateur at best. Begin at the left side and slowly descend in the south-east direction as if you are gently caressing the bottom of a magnet. Continue on your path eastwards, leveling out as you reach the meridian of the face, and finally finish with a gentle slope upwards as you reach your destination on the right side of the face. Look back and admire your chin - congratulations! You've drawn a perfect human chin!

Sketch a small online of the top of the dress, extending slightly below the arms. Draw a line halfway down the arms for the bust.

, Draw three lines: one large curved one (A), and two straight ones (B & C). Line A should curve from the start of the feet, and dip down below them. Lines B and C should be straight and reach from where the outline of the dress would be.

Divide the paper into parts to fit the figure, so you don't run out of room and your figure is well-balanced. You can even draw faint lines in pencil to space it out.
Here, the middle line will guide you to balance the left and the right side of the body. The dash above the middle line will serve as the limit for the head of Zeus. The dot made at the far right to Zeus is where the thunderbolt will fit.;
, To get the shapes right, you may have to sketch and re-sketch. For example, if the head is too thin, sketch more lines to make it thicker, until it looks well balanced.


Find the shape of the face first by making a narrow 'U' shape. You can also try drawing a shape similar to a 'V' if you want Zeus to have a sharper jaw. Don't be afraid to create a rough sketch of Zeus's beard and mustache, too!
If you're sketching out the hair, make sure it goes down until the shoulders.

, Make the eyes in the shape of two almonds with the nose centered between them, and make his nose taper off at the end. Don't forget to draw his lips and eyebrows, as well as his facial hair!


Make the irises in the shape of a 'U'. If you draw round irises, it creates an expression of anger or shock.
Sketch over the eyebrows to make them thicker. The eyebrows will be thicker as it begins and thinner at the ends.
The mustache can be drawn with closely drawn lines. It will be thinner around the lips and thicker at the end.

, Draw his right arm lifted up, with his hand forming a fist. Then draw a lightning bolt in his fist.


If you are having trouble drawing the folded fingers or the fist, sketch a rectangle and add the digit '3' two times; then draw the thumb.

, Use pencil before you dive into charcoal. Pencils are easy to erase and won't affect the surface if you erase often.


Try making a rough outline first, and then finalizing it once you're happy with it. Hold off on shading until you're sure it's the right overall shape.
Start with lining the right side of the upper body till the waist. Make the body wider at the top and narrower at the waist. Draw the guidelines for the chest and add some more lines to mark the abs. Then, to the left side of Zeus, draw the outline of the toga starting from the neck and falling until the waist.
Sketch the left arm by making a triangle to imply that the arm is folded on the waist, and then draw the fingers.

, Make a concise shape of the right leg and the folded toga lines to the left.

, Follow how the drapes would fall in real life to get the lines and shading correct. For example, where it is falling low, draw lines that droop; where it is going up, make curved lines going up.


Sketch a rectangle to make the knot.

, The details make all the difference in bringing the expression to life.


For the toga on the right arm, make the lines spaced out at the top and ""bunched"" around the waist.
Concentrate on making the beard and the mustache full, since they're a signature feature of Zeus's.
Cover any flaws at the end with shading.

, Shade the ends and the folds. Shade the darker areas with double the intensity and leave the highlighted areas lighter. You want the folds, backs, and sides to be darker to create depth.


Add thickness to the eyebrows, the sides of the nose, and add definition to the abs with shading.
At the toga knot, follow the fabric lines. Make more lines and shade darker at the waist and around the knot.

Color in your Santa.",How to Draw Santa Claus," Santa is a round and jolly figure, so many of the outlines you will begin with are done by drawing circles and ovals. Draw a circle toward the top of your paper. Create another horizontal oval underneath for the neck and beard.


Draw your oval shape so that it intersects your first circle. The top of the oval should be about halfway up the circle for the head.
Add guidelines for the face. Draw a horizontal line down the center of your circle, and a horizontal line across. The horizontal line should be at the same level as the top of your oval. These lines will help you space out the eyes and form the nose.
Add two more horizontal lines near the bottom of your circle for the mouth.
Use a pencil for the outlines. Draw lightly so you can easily erase any mistakes and the outlines later.;
, The first circle should intersect the bottom oval on Santa’s head. The top of it should be at the same height as your bottom horizontal face line. Your second circle should be bigger than your first one and intersect it. The top of this circle should reach the middle of your first body circle.


The top of your two circles will be Santa’s chest. Keep it round and make it slightly wider than his head.
The bottom of your two circles is Santa’s belly. Make it about one and a half times larger than the circle for the chest.

, To draw Santa’s arms, you want to draw two fat ovals for each arm. The shoulders should start about where the lower oval for Santa's face and his chest meet. His hands are two circles with three fat zig-zags for the fingers, and an upside-down “U” shape for the thumbs.


He should look like a snowman at this point.
It’s ok if the ovals for the arms overlap the circle you drew for the chest. You'll eventually erase your intersecting lines and make Santa look more three-dimensional.

, Drawing Santa’s legs is very similar to drawing his arms. Draw two shorter, fat ovals for each leg extending down from his belly. Then add two ovals for the feet.


Santa is a little top heavy, meaning that his upper body is bigger than his lower body. Try to make sure that your ovals aren’t longer than the rest of his body.
When drawing the legs, start the top ovals, the thighs, at a wider point, closer to the outside of Santa’s belly. Then angle the legs in just a little bit.

, Use the middle horizontal line as a guide point to begin. The bottom of the nose should be at the same level as your middle horizontal line.Draw a round circle-like shape for the nose. You don’t want the circle to connect at the top, so leave it open. Then add the nostrils. On either side of the circular nose, draw a “C” shape. One forward “C” for Santa’s right nostril, and one backwards “C” for his left nostril.

, Draw two “S” shaped lines extending horizontally from the ends of each nostril. Then draw the bottom of the mustache by adding a few zig-zags underneath your “S” shaped curves.


To help you keep the mustache even, place a small dot under the nose in the center. Then when you draw the bottom of mustache, draw your zig-zags so the lines meet at the dot.
Then add two round lines starting at the top of the nose on each side. Bring these lines down to meet near the edge of the mustache. These are Santa’s cheeks.

, Draw two large upside-down “U” shapes on top of the cheeks to form the eyes.


If you’d rather have your Santa look a little less cartoony, you can draw two smaller circles above the cheeks for the eyes. These eyes won’t be connected to Santa’s cheeks and will give him a bit of a more realistic look. Add the pupils to the eyes. Inside the eyes, draw two circles. One larger for the white part of the eye, and one smaller one for the pupils.
If you have room and want to, you can add smaller circles inside the pupils to make Santa’s eyes look shiny. Color in the pupils.

, Draw two “S” shaped lines above the eyes, similar to what you drew for the top of the mustache. Then above your “S” shaped lines, draw two bushy zig-zagging lines for the tops of the eyebrows. Connect these lines to your “S” shaped lines to complete the eyebrows.


If you don't have enough room to make Santa’s eyebrows very bushy, you can draw two rounded rectangle shapes above his eyes.

, Begin by drawing zig-zagged lines on either side of Santa’s head. Start the lines at the same height as the tops of his ears. Follow the outside of the oval shape you drew for Santa’s head. You’ve already drawn the rough outline of Santa’s beard, so now you just need to define it.


The more zig-zagged your lines are the more cartoony the beard the beard will look. If you want the beard to look more realistic, draw softer “S” shaped lines.
Continue down and have the beard lines meet in the middle of Santa’s chest.

, Start drawing Santa’s hat in between his eyebrows. Unlike Santa’s eyebrows and mustache, you want to draw smaller circle-like lines for the fuzzy white part of the hat. Think of it like drawing small clouds. Then follow your original outline for Santa’s head as you draw the top of his hat.


Extend the line you draw for the bottom fuzzy part of the hat outward around the head, and have it meet by his ears.
As you draw a curved line up to form the top of the hat, you can extend the top of the hat above your original outline for Santa’s head to make it look proportional.
On one side of his head, draw a curved line moving inward a bit. And instead of connecting it to the line of the hat from the other side, leave it unconnected.
Then bring the other line over and past the other edge of the hat to add the stocking portion of it. Draw a small, puffy ball at the tip. , Draw two “U” shapes under Santa’s mustache to give Santa a big smile.


Then to make the mouth and beard look more realistic, draw two zig-zagged lines extending from each tip of the mustache. Don’t connect these lines to the outside of Santa’s beard, though. Leave a little space.
Now, draw the sides of Santa’s face. Connect the top part of the beard you just drew, which extended from the mustache, with two wavy vertical lines on each side of Santa’s head. Bring these lines up to meet with the bottom of Santa’s hat.
If done correctly, Santa’s beard will wrap around his face.

, With the face and beard completed, you can now outline Santa’s body, and begin to add more detail.


Draw over the outer edges of your original circles and ovals. You want to fill out Santa’s body now, making him look more three-dimensional.
Only draw the outer edges of your shapes. Erase any intersecting parts to give your drawing weight.
Once completed, you will have a three-dimensional looking Santa that has a hat, but still no clothes.

, Santa wears a waistcoat that extends to knees, a belt, baggy pants, boots, and gloves.


Start with Santa’s waistcoat. Draw the bottoms of the coat by drawing a curved line on the outer side of each of Santa’s legs. The lines should curve away from his legs until each line reaches the knee. Then draw two curved lines back up and connect these lines by the belly button area. The bottoms of the waistcoat get a white fringe similar to his hat.
Add the belt. The belt is a thick rectangle that curves slightly around Santa’s belly. The bottom of the belt is where the two flaps of the waistcoat meet around the belly button. Add a square buckle in the middle and two belt loops, one on either side.
Add a circular button or two in the center of the waistcoat.
Below Santa’s waistcoat are his pants which can be drawn with a few vertical zig-zag lines. He also has big boots which go up to his shins.
Finally, draw two rectangular cuffs on his sleeves where his wrists are and make sure his hands are outlined.

, Add extra details before doing this if you like, such as making his beard longer or his belt buckle more elaborate. Erase any extraneous lines you may see. Then color him in.


Santa’s hat, coat, pants, and boots are all red. His boots are slightly darker than the other red garments.
The fringes on his hat and coat, including his cuffs, are white.
You can make his gloves and belt brown, or even green if you like.

Keep practicing and enjoy drawing as a lifelong passion.",How to Improve Your Drawing Skills," Try drawing the five basic shapes..


The five basic shapes are - Sphere, Pyramid, Rectangle, Cylinder and Cone. All drawings are derived from these five basic shapes
Draw the shapes in different sizes and proportions and angles
Practice shading with the shapes, lighting them from different directions. This trains you for more complex shapes down the track, don't get impatient with it
Use different drawing tools; pencils of varying thicknesses, pens, markers, colored pencils, charcoal, etc. This will help you to get a feel for different mediums.;
, A cylinder with a cone on top of it, or interlocking spheres begin to move you towards very complex drawings in a simple way


Don't press too hard if using pencil; this allows you to erase errors easily as you go. You also typically want to figure out the proportions and the forms in the drawing before you begin darkening in lines.
Again, use different drawing tools, to get a feel for those that work best for you.

, When a form changes, as does the value (how dark or light it is in that location). The way to make something appear truly 3d and give it a lot of weight is to apply values (shading) to it. Start by shading the simple forms and then apply the ideas to more complex combinations.


Shade only in one direction. However, while shading in one direction (as in a straight line) is good for most objects, for things like animals or leaves, shading along with the curves of the object will help it read properly. If you do not shade with the contours of an object you are giving the brain two different ideas of how a given form should read and the result is it will not look right

, Do not think you need to evolve your inner artist on your own. Ask other artists, art teachers, friends and anyone you trust to give advice. Listen to their suggestions to help you improve the areas of your drawing skills that need it, and to learn new ways of doing your art.

, This is the fundamental exercise that will train your observational skills and build your skill immensely


Photographs are not ideal compared to life, a photograph flattens the perspective out, can distort and also takes away the sense of proportion. Seeing a fighter plane in a photo is one thing, seeing how large they are in real life is another

, But do not obsess over them. a good drawing will read early and details only go so far


The best way to make detailed drawings is to start off by breaking it down into simple shapes and lines. make measurements by holding your pencil out and estimating height vs width. Once you have captured the bigger picture go in and refine further, and then focus on the details last. Always capture the bigger picture first and detail uniformly across the image
For animals, add stripes, spots, scales, shine, fur, long coats and background.

, This requires adding in motion-suggestive movements. This will take you quite a while to master, so take it slowly and keep practicing; don't be surprised if your initial attempts look awkward or cartoonish.

, Try a landscape or a street-scape, with all of the activities going on. Do a rough sketch first, to capture everything, then return and infill everything that makes the scene come to life.

, Drawing isn't something you master overnight; moreover, it is something that will continue to evolve all of your life. If you do some research on artists, you'll find that those who kept doing their art throughout many years would often change their styles over decades, reflecting new-found knowledge, new ways of pushing the boundaries and simply seeking to change and improve. In other words, improving your drawing skills, no matter how good you are already, is a work-for-life and is always in progress. At the heart of it is effort and dedication; if you love drawing, both will come easily to you.

Evaluate the image you are recreating.,
Decide on your medium.,
Decide how dense you will make your dots.,
Choose a starting point.,
Begin stippling.,
Add in detail.,
Finish your project.",How to Stipple," Although you can certainly create a stippled drawing from an imagined image, it is much easier to do so with a hard copy to examine as you draw. Outside of determining where figures and objects are in the composition, you’ll need to look for a few other important elements. With your drawing laid out in front of you, look for:


The light source and the direction of the light. The light will determine what areas need more stippling and what areas need less.
The value of the drawing. This is where on the grayscale each of the colors (or shades) lie - how dark or light the colors are. Value is closely related to light.
The shapes in the drawing. You’ll be creating all the figures and objects without using any lines, so pay attention to the shapes that compose the figures, and recreate them with your stippling.;
, Because stippling is just the process of creating hundreds of tiny dots that make up an image, you can use many different media for creating the dots. Higher quality pointillism pieces are done with more dots per square inch, meaning that they were made with a drawing utensil that allowed for very small dots to be made. Keep this in mind, because although you can use about any medium you want to create your image, the smaller the mark that is made, the more realistic your image will look. Possible media for stippling include:


A fine point pen. Most artists who do high-quality stippling use a pen with a .03 or .005 inch (0.0 cm) nib. This allows for tiny dots and plenty of shading.
Pencils - colored or otherwise. Although by using pencil you run the risk of smearing the graphite and blending the color, you can use it to create small dots. Colored pencil is less likely to smear than graphite, and will add a bit more interest (and difficulty) to your image.
Paint. Paint is typically considered the most difficult medium to stipple with, because it is much easier to accidentally create a stroke/line than it is with pen or pencil.

, Before you start making any dots, you need to decide how dense you will draw them. A more detailed image can be made with a higher density of dots. Keep in mind that an image with lots of dark values will need more stippling than an image with plenty of light. Try doing a set of dots on a piece of test paper, creating different shades of gray (or colors, if you’re using colored pencil) by spacing out the dots different amounts. You can then reference this test paper as you create your final project.


The higher the density of dots, the more time it will take to recreate an image.
If you don’t want to put a lot of time into the project but still need dark values, try using a pen with a larger nib (such as .1) or a different medium that creates larger spots., Looking at the original image, decide where you will begin your stippling on your drawing. Typically, it is easiest to choose the darkest point on your drawing. That is because you have more room for mistakes in the dark sections, because you can just add more dots to cover up anything you might do wrong.

, Carefully lift and press your pen (or other utensil) onto your sheet of paper. The closer you place your dots, the darker the area on the paper will appear. Start with the darkest point, and then work around the image, filling in all the dark areas. Eventually, begin adding in the lighter areas by adding dots that are spaced further apart from each other. As you’re stippling, remember to:


Keep all the dots evenly spaced. Although you can put some dots close together and others far apart, the finished work will look more attractive if the dots are evenly spaced.
Avoid making dashes. Nothing will ruin your stippling project faster than adding dashes instead of dots. Be careful to always lift your pen (or other utensil) completely off the paper before setting it back down.
Move slowly. Speed is not your friend when stippling. You’ll be much more likely to create a significant mistake if you’re working quickly, than if you are patient and take your time. Stippling is a very time-intensive practice, so be prepared to put many hours (or weeks!) into a single project., As the major shapes begin to appear, start adding small dots in patterns to form lines and shapes. From far away, these dots will appear to be lines. Close-up though, you’ll see them as they really are. You can also choose to begin stippling your image in a more dramatic pattern. For example, stipple all your dots in rows/columns or diagonal lines. These patterns will only be noticeable close-up and in the light (emptier) spaces.

, Stippling can take a very long time to complete, so don’t rush your work. When, however, you believe you are finished with your work, take a step back and look at it from afar. The true test of pointillism is its ability to create shapes and figures at a distance, not just when you’re standing close. If your stippling is dense, from far away the dots should look like shapes that were drawn, rather than just dots."

Buy a wooden art doll.",How to Get Good at Drawing1," Practice, practice, practice. That’s the mantra of famous artists across the world, and practice is the sure-fire way to improve your drawings. Even spending a few minutes a day on sketch engages your brain with your art and helps you learn new techniques.;
, If you always have a small notebook with you, then you open up the possibility to draw anything – from people on the bus the nature scenes to awe-inspiring city skylines. You need to practice to be a better drawer, so set yourself up to practice anytime.

, Pencils come in a variety of ratings that tell you how hard they are and the thickness of the mark. Pencils labeled “H” get progressively harder, and leave fine, faint lines, while those labeled “B” are good for thick, darker lines.A decent set of starter pencils, available at any art store, might include a 4H, 3H, 2H, H, HB , B, 2B 3B and 4B.Play around with your new pencils to test how each one feels. Note the differences in the lines and try to incorporate different pencils into different drawings.

, Use a couple of pages in your sketchbook to experiment with the way your pencils lay down color, how your fingers or tissues blend colors together and how to shade simple spheres. You need to understand how your materials work to improve your drawings and use the right pencil for the right lines.


Make 3-4 timelines and practice transitions. How can you use each pen to shade the line from completely black to completely white?

, While many young artists feel like they can teach themselves how to draw, there are a variety of techniques that can only be passed on by an experienced teacher. Spend time practicing perspective, proportions, and drawing from live models. The time spent in an art studio with an art teacher can help you find mistakes and fix them far faster than you could on your own.


Check your local art store, parks department, or community college for local drawing classes.

, While you should never trace another artist’s work and claim it as you own, you can learn valuable techniques by copying photos or drawings you admire by hand. Since a picture is already 2-dimensional, you take away the stress of learning perspective and focus solely on the lines and angles.Practice recreating classic drawings to learn from the masters – da Vinci was the king of human anatomy, and his drawings have a lot to teach you.
Never trace – you don’t actually practice drawing, just making lines.

, Drawing upside down forces you to forget about trying to make the drawing look right and instead drawing what you actually see. You can get similar results by drawing through a mirror, or practicing with distorted or Photoshopped images., Drawing accurate contours requires more than simply looking up an image online. The best artists and art teachers pour over books, real-life examples, and studies to understand the lines they are making. While this depends on the type of drawing you are working on. All artists can benefit from time away from the sketchbook every now and then.If you are drawing people, invest in an illustrated book of human anatomy, or sign-up for drawing classes with a live model.
If you are drawing animals, spend a day with your sketchbook at the zoo or purchase an illustrated textbook on animal anatomy.
If you are drawing landscapes or city scenes, you should invest in a book about perspective to help you accurately create depth in your drawings.

, These small, standing puppets have a variety of joints that you can move into place and perfect human proportions. As such, they can be useful when trying to draw complex poses. Simply put the doll into the right position and use it to sketch out your drawing, adding the details of your character later.


If you cannot get a model, use a skeleton from your school’s biology department to learn proportions.
They also make anatomically correct models of hands, heads, and the skeletal system as well, though they are often more expensive.

Know that contour drawing consists only of lines.,
Give yourself guide lines.,
Focus on proportions first.,
Sketch out the basics of each drawing before moving on.,
Slowly add in the details to your contours.,
Draw from the largest object down to the smallest.,
Practice perspective to give scenes realistic depth.",How to Get Good at Drawing2," Contours are the outlines of your drawings. There is not blending or shading yet, just lines. Drawing good contour lines is essential for your final drawing, as this is where you give your drawing its shape and proportions.


In general, contour lines are the first thing you do in a drawing.

, This is often overlooked by beginning artists who dive right into the work, but it is incredibly important to get accurate drawings. For example, if you are drawing a large scene, start with faint lines that break your drawing up into thirds both horizontally and vertically. You should have nine small boxes on your page. These will help you to frame your drawing and put everything where it should be, giving you reference points as you work.

, Proportion is the difference in size between two objects. If you draw your arms and legs out of proportion, for example, your drawing will look crude and lopsided. Close one eye and line your pencil up with the subject. Your arm should be completely extended. Use your pencil as a ruler and mark the length of the object with your thumb. You can then compare this distance with other objects on your page, or even use your pencil to mark out the specific distance on the page for your drawing.You can also use your guidelines to help. What “box” of your guidelines does the subject fit into? Do they take up the whole page, or a third of it?

, There is no worse feeling than getting halfway done with a drawing and realizing that the arm of your character is much too short. Good drawers know how to avoid this by blocking out the drawing beforehand. Use simple shapes to mark the proportions of each object. For example, make an oval for a person’s head, a rounded rectangle for the torso, and longer elbows for each arm and leg. Keep adjusting these blocks until you feel confident in the pose and proportions of each item.Make sure you make these marks lightly, so that you can easily erase them later.
Make a small circle or dot for each joint to help your “move” arms and legs into accurate poses.

, Add a layer of complexity with each draft. First it is guidelines and stick figures. Then you add in basic shapes and poses. Next, add in permanent lines over your outline, connecting the joints, adding facial features, etc. Think about making the final contour of the body by connecting the joints so that you have a recognizable shape.


Once you’re happy with your new lines, erase away your light contour marks from underneath the new drawing.
Work slowly, making each line carefully and erasing when you are unhappy. You need your contour to be accurate in order for the final drawing to improve., Never start a drawing at the details. Once you’ve finished you basic contours, it’s time to move on to the details. This is where most artists get caught up early on, spending all of their time and energy on the small details while neglecting the larger proportions.

, Perspective is why far away objects appear small and nearby ones appear large. To get accurate drawings, you need to have accurate perspective. One way to practice is to use a perspective point. Think of this as the farthest point on the horizon, like the sun right before it sets. Draw straight lines out from this point to match your drawings – anything closer to the dot is farther away, and thus smaller, and anything away from the dot is close to you.


Draw two diagonal lines coming away from the dot. Anything that fits between those two lines is the same size in real life, though perspective makes it appear as if they are different."
"
Know that shading give objects depth.,
Think about the light sources.,
Note the edges of the shadow.,
Map your shading before beginning.,
Focus on gradual transitions.,
Blend your shadows.,
Practice shading simple objects.,
Learn the different types of shading.",How to Get Good at Drawing3," Shading is what makes a drawing pop and prevents it from feeling flat. A big part of the illusion of three-dimensions in good drawings is the shading. But shading is tough to master, especially when you are trying to shade something from your imagination or memory.


Shading can imply lines as well. Think about the two small ridges between your nose and upper lip. While you could draw lines for them, that would make them unrealistically pronounced. Try shading them in instead, darkening the areas around them lightly to make them “appear” in the middle of the dark patches.

, Shadows are created because they are exposed to less light then other parts of the scene. Where the light is coming from, what type of light it is, and even the time of day will all affect your shadows. Shadows are created on opposite sides of the light. For example, if you place a ball down and shine a light on it from the right, the left side of the ball will appear darker. This is where you would shade if you were drawing the ball.

, The edge of the shadow is how quickly it disappears. Think of trying to make a shadow puppet—when your hand is close to the light and the wall, there is a hard edge where your shadow and the light meet; but when your hand is farther away you shadow softly fades into the light. Note however, the all shadows have a slightly soft edge. The difference between shading and contour drawing is the fading at the edges.Direct light, like spotlights and clear, sunny days, creates dramatic shadows with hard edges.
Indirect light, light far away lights, multiple lights, or cloudy days, create softer, muted shadows with faded edges.

, Make soft, gentle lines around the edges of your shadows before starting them so that you know where you are going to.


Map out the highlights: where is the light the strongest? Is there any glare?
Sketch out the shading: where does the shadow on each object start and stop?
Contour any hard shadows. Are there any dark shapes created by the light, like a person’s shadow in the sun?

, Shading is the art of gradually changing the amount of light from one area to the other. Start lightly, shading in the entire object with your lightest pencil strokes. Keep going over the drawing by filling in the darker areas slowly, one shade at a time.

, This is the best way to make realistic, gradual shadows on any drawing. Using a tissue, your finger, or light marks with your pencil, blend the darker areas into the lighter ones by rubbing from dark to light. Most pencils will blend only slightly, while drawing with charcoal allows you to dramatically blend your shadows with your fingers.

, Set up a basic “still life” to practice shading. Simply place several common, easy to draw objects (a ball, small boxes, water bottles, etc.) under a bright light and turn it on. Draw the contours of the objects, then practice shading them in exactly how you see them.


As you get more advanced, add in clear objects, complex shapes, or a second light to practice more difficult shading techniques.
Shade in an old children’s coloring book, which are usually simple contour lines, for advanced practice.

, While the most realistic form of shading is an even, gradual blending (“smooth” shading), there are a variety of shading styles for different artists and styles of work. For example, many cartoons use cross-hatching or dots to indicate shading. The basic principle, however, is the same – more marks equals darker shadows. Test our multiple types of shading to find what works best for you.


Hatching: Single, straight lines create shadows. More lines make darker shadows.
Cross-hatching: Crisscrossing diagonal lines make up your shadows. The farther apart the lines are, the lighter the shadow is. This works well when shading something with lines, like hair or fur.Stippling: A collection of small, black dots make your shadows. Adding dots makes it look darker, to the point where you may not be able to tell that there are dots on the darker edges.
Circular Shading: Making small, overlapping circles around with your pencil, you trace out your shadow. The longer you spend in one area overlapping circles, the darker it will become. This is often the best way to shade with colored pencils."

Sketch trial lines very lightly.,
Study model sheets to see how characters are built.,
Use anatomy books as reference for human and animal subjects.",How to Get Better at Drawing1," Use a light pencil line, and erase the lines when the drawing is done. This way you can sketch in lots of light trial lines until you find the right one without messing up your paper.


Alternatively, use a blue pencil which does not show up on scans and copies.
Many artists use ""col-erase"" blue pencils.;
, A model sheet has numerous sketches of a single animation character in various poses and expressions. It is used to standardize the character's appearance when multiple animators are working on a project. Looking at model sheets can help you understand how every figure has a particular construction set-up that serves as a base.


Many model sheets are available on the Internet.

, Gray's Anatomy, for example, is a classic that can help you learn more about the construction of the human body. You can then apply this knowledge to your drawings of various poses.

Figure out your style.,
Sketch or doodle.,
Daydream.,
Read.,
If you don't have anything yet, try the Internet.,
Remember to be confident when you are drawing.",How to Figure out What You Should Draw," Do you like Picasso? What about exotic art? Maybe you like comfortable fireplace paintings or abstract art. Choose which one you like the most and think you would have fun drawing. Please know that your ""style"" is just something you love to draw, and you do not have to draw it all the time.;
, Fold up a paper and put it in your pocket in case you have any sudden ideas during the day. Trace little pictures or letters. Doodle lightly in a diary or a journal. When you sketch, or doodle, you do not draw anything specific. Just do squiggly lines or shapes or shade in pictures. These drawings are just to draw, not for the picture.

, Daydreaming can help you get ideas. Lots of people do it. Don't think; let your mind wander. Relax. Eventually, some pictures will come to you. Maybe try drawing some of your favorite things. Even if you think you will not draw it very good, be confident and keep trying! Practice makes perfect!

, The best books to read for inspiration are actually ones without pictures, so you can create your own pictures. Picture books are okay, too, but you can get really creative making up your own pictures in your head so you can draw them and share them with people!

, Online at school, home, or the library, or wherever there is a computer, look up some pictures. Don't necessarily copy the pictures, just use them for inspiration. Look up one of your favorite foods or people. Maybe you want to see a picture of the Eiffel Tower. Who knows? You choose.

, Remember, you are your worst critic, so if you don't like it, chances are, everyone else will love it! A picture is worth a thousand words!

Ignore details when you start a sketch.,
Draw upside down.,
Do 30-second sketches.,
Look around and ask, ""How would I draw that?""",How to Get Better at Drawing2," Take a bit of time to analyze things, breaking them down into their basic parts. Learn to see through the clutter, and to reduce and draw the essential. Once you've trained yourself to do this, you will be able to draw anything.

, Drawing upside down helps you unlearn drawing what you think you see. Instead, you draw what you actually see. The easiest way to draw upside down is if you are drawing from a photo: simply invert the photo and go from there.


Alternatively, if you're working from a reference sketch, you can invert the reference sketch., This helps you because it doesn't give you time to bother about detail. Sketch as much as possible.


Practice making quick sketches when you're out and about in the world (at the zoo, on the bus, in the park, etc.). This can help you get at the most basic elements of your object and makes useful reference material that you may develop later., Get into the habit of visually analyzing your surroundings, even when you don't have pencil and paper available. Imagine breaking things down into their most essential shapes. You might end up seeing the world in a whole new way.

Practice drawing shadows and highlights.,
When you do use a line to draw, convey volume by varying line weight.,
Pay attention to the direction of the light source and see how shadows fall.,
Make a mould of your subject.,
Practice drawing negative space.,
Use dramatic lighting.",How to Get Better at Drawing3," Your object has volume and weight, which, when light falls on it, results in shadows and highlights. Instead of drawing the outline of your object, try starting by sketching a well-balanced separation of light and dark areas.


Approach shadows as you would a flat, graphic shapes. Some may be darker than others, but within individual shadows there should be a minimum of contrast and texture. Use the side of your charcoal pencil to create these shadow shapes, rather than scribbling in lines.
Transition from shadows to highlights with halftones. Here, create gradations of contrast with darks from the shadow side and lights from the highlights.
Your highlights may have some texture, depending on the material. There may also be areas without any texture., Hold a charcoal pencil like a brush. Use the length of the charcoal to produce thin lines, and the side for softer, thicker lines. You can also transition the line from thick to thin to produce a taper (great for lines moving between shadows and highlights)., If you are drawing from life, walk around the model or object and observe it from all angles.

, If you're having a hard time conveying light and shade properly, make a basic model of your subject with moulding clay. It needn't be perfect: the point is to help you see how light bounces off the shape, creating highlights and shadows., Negative space is all the space between objects. Looking at negative space can be very helpful in understanding volume, as well as for measuring distances between things.


As an exercise, you can draw negative space only (rather than the object). This is particularly effective when working with a heavier medium like charcoal., This is a trick you can use to make your picture ""pop"": it brings out strong contrast and drop shadows, which often give the illusion of reality.

, Decide how you want to draw your umbrella, which way it will face, how big is it going to be, what will the umbrella's patter be, and what color you are going to make your umbrella. It is not necessary to work out all this detail now, you can decide later while drawing and you can always change your mind, experiment!

, The space between the two is where your umbrella will be, so draw them as far apart as big you want to have your umbrella. You don't have to draw the spike now you can draw it later, it doesn't really matter.

, If your umbrella will be on the ground draw a ground as a guide to where the outline of your umbrella should go up to. When drawing your umbrella's outline, keep it in mind to make it any shape you want, but be sure to draw it lightly. It is up to you to decide what shape your umbrella will be. There are umbrellas that are very big, very small, very flat, and very round, so it depend on you what you want it to be like.

, Umbrellas have metal rods in them which give it it's shape, so mark the place where these rods will go. When drawing the dots make sure to draw the middle ones a bit lower than the ones on the side to later give it that 3D effect.

, Make sure to have these lines the same shape as the outline of your umbrella only being a bit flatter and a bit longer. Notice how the middle line reaches down further than the ones next to it, which reach down further than the lines on the side.

, These lines should not be straight, they should be curved. Draw these lines like you see in the picture: the sides of the lines connecting to the bottom of the lines of the metal rods you drew in the previous step, and the middles bending upwards.

, These parts of your umbrella will be the lightest because here will the light be reflected, so decide where your light is coming from, in my case the left, and draw an arc to that side of the space between the lines. Don't make the arcs too big nor too small.

, Make sure that the bottom middle of your arc is the lightest and the left side is light while the very top of the space is very dark and the right side near the line is darker than the left.

, Don't color in too dark, make sure to leave some of that light green to be seen too.

, This effect will really bring out the other colors, but like with dark green avoid too much of it because too much could and will make your umbrella look worse than before. If you like dark colors like black it is completely OK to put more dark in there, it all depends on you.

, The lines going 'vertically' should be dark while the lines going the other direction should be light. Don't use an eraser here because you will probably end up erasing something you don't want to, just go over the lines with green and keep it in mind that it does not matter if some of the grey is still visible.

, Erase the ground line and now your umbrella is finished, but if you want to add some special effects to it, then just keep reading.
Draw a water puddle right where the umbrella's left side touches the ground. Make it whatever shape and size you want and color in the sides a little bit darker than the middle. You can also make the reflection of the umbrella against the water. For that, just take light or dark green and draw the same thing you see in the picture below.

, Great umbrella! Put it somewhere you can see or stick it in your art book.

Find a willing portrait model.,
Set up your pad somewhere stable, either clip it to a slightly larger drawing board or put it on an easel.,
Turn your pad so it reflects the orientation of the subject.,
Look at your pad of paper for the last time before you start your drawing.,
Decide where you're going to begin your drawing, size up the pose mentally (try to imagine where the edges of the paper would appear around the figure) and put your pen down on your paper in a place where you think corresponds to how you see the figure.,
From that point, begin to trace a contour (line) in a given direction, both with your eye and the pen.,
If you've drawn yourself into a ""corner"" and want to be drawing at another part of the picture, you can risk picking up your pen and guessing where the new contour would start.,
When the time has run out, tell the model to relax and stretch, while you can look at your drawing.",How to Draw a Blind Contour Portrait," Have them strike a pose intended for a set amount of time (5 minutes is an appropriate amount of time for this style), and if they're an adult, disrobe as much as they are comfortable (clothing adds a lot more lines to interrupt the drawing) in a simple setting. If indoors, light the subject so that you can see him or her well, and so that the lighting enhances the form.;
, Set yourself up comfortably at arm's length behind your pad. Ideally, you should have full range of arm motion and be able to see the subject fully without moving. It is not important that you can see your paper, just as long as you can draw comfortably.

, If it's horizontal the pad may need addition support so the binding doesn't break--an additional bulldog clip or rubber band. Individual sheets taped to a drawing board always work.

, Until step 9 you will be ""blind"" to the drawing.

, The head or highest point is usually a good place to start.

, Throughout this drawing you will be striving to follow what lines your eye sees with what your pen draws. Any contour is valid, whether it's an edge of a cast shadow, the edge of the figure, an internal fold of skin, where an area of body hair meets a bare area, or important background elements. Anything your eye takes an interest in is fair game. However, as much as possible you want to describe the figure in as few continuous lines as possible, so it's good to follow large exterior lines, and then if your find yourself in a corner work your way out of it with internal contours.

, The risk with this is that you will be starting a new shape that can be radically out of place. The alternative is to retrace your current line to somewhere closer to where you want to be drawing. Either way can be charming in the end because there's no good way to be exact about this.

, Use this break time to carefully evaluate your drawing, following the contour from the beginning.

Sketch out a circle for your drawing on quality drawing paper.,
Along the horizontal line, draw two circles.,
Now that the basic face is done, add the hair.,
Underneath the head, draw out a trapezoid to form the mid-body section.,
Inside the mid-body section draw a line as shown.,
Draw another trapezoid opposite the previous one.,
Draw two moderate sized circles to be the front ends of the shoes.,
Outline or darken the figure.",How to Draw Albert Einstein," Draw a large circle; this will be Albert's head.


Imagine the circle as a sphere and draw two perpendicular lines wrapping around it. The vertical line determines the center of the face and the direction the head should be facing. Along this line is also where the nose will be located. The horizontal line will determine where the eyes should be placed.;
, Inside both circles draw a large dot to serve as the eyes. Make sure to draw the eyes proportionate to the head. Between the eyes and along the vertical line draw an oval shape with an opening near the top right corner to form the nose. Once again, make sure to keep it in proportion with the head.

, Simply give him two bushy eyebrows that cover about a third of each eye. Make them smooth on the bottom and wavy up on top as shown.


Give him a considerably large mustache right beneath the nose starting at the horizontal line of the initial circle. Draw the mustache smooth at the top and wavy on the bottom.
For the actual hair, draw out a shaggy outline around the upper half of the head and along the sides, bringing it back up on the right side and over and above his eyebrows to form the bangs.

, Then draw two incomplete rectangles with rounded corners to form the arms. Have the right arm facing down, following the form of his body. The one on the left should be facing up and outward at an angle.

, The line should be lined up with the vertical line previously drawn for the head. Alongside this line on the right side draw three small circles to represent the buttons of the coat. For the collar, draw a 'W' shape right beneath the head with the center of the 'W' aligned with the line in the coat. At the end of each arm, simply draw one circle for the hand to the left to represent the palm of that hand. Now, draw the fingers using simple oval shapes.

, Have this one taper downward to form the pants. Draw a line inside slightly to the left and branch out another smaller line from the base of the pants almost up to the coat.

, Have them overlap a bit. At the upper right corner of the right circle, draw yet another circle about half the size of the first two for the back end of the shoe. Draw a line through the bottom half of each circle. This will represent the tread of the shoe.

, Then erase the sketch lines. Add some color to your illustration. Your picture is now complete

Draw some accompanying elements to create an entire pirate theme.",How to Draw a Pirate," These guidelines will enable you to create the pirate as shown in the introduction image. Once you've mastered this pirate, you'll be ready to try many more.


It is recommended that you begin with either the head or the torso first and then add the other elements to the picture so as to keep the proportion right.;
, Basically you're delineating the edge of the face where the beard whiskers commence.

, The nose can be quite striking as this is someone who spends a lot of time in the harsh outdoor elements. For one eye, use a traditional eye-patch in place of the eye.

, In this case, the mouth is open a little more to suggest a menacing appearance. Then complete the beard, as shown by the read lines here.

,, The sleeves are usually rolled up slightly in order to avoid catching on ship's rigging and swords.

, Make the buckle stand out as it's a feature piece.

, In this case they're more like tight culottes but pirates can also wear baggier pants. It's really whatever you'd prefer your pirate to be dressed in.

, Boots were an important part of keeping dry and safe on the ship's rigging, so make it a substantial boot.

, He wouldn't be a good caricature of a pirate without this addition! However, if you'd rather he had both legs and two boots, simply copy the boot from the other foot but have it facing either forward or in the opposite direction of the first boot.

, While drawing the hand, turn it into a scrunched up fist for a more threatening pose, as shown in the red lines here. For the end of the sleeve, draw the ruffle or lace extending from the shirt to reflect the clothing of the olden days.

, Make sure the tip of the blade is pointed. And add the same ruffle detail to the sleeve end as in the previous step.

, To make the pirate come to life, the details are an important aspect of giving him depth. Some of the details include:


The skull and crossbones insignia on the hat.
Clothing lines to help make the clothing seem like it's flowing and therefore realistic.
More whiskers in the beard.
Light reflection lines off the clothing, the leather of the boots, the hat, etc.

, They're quite evident here, and they should be easy to find on your own drawing too.

, Darken areas such as the eye-patch and shade in areas needing shadow gradations. Make any fuzzy details clearer. Once this is done, you're free to color in the pirate with pencils, crayons or paint as wished. The introduction image shows one suggestion for coloring in.

, As well as drawing some more pirates, some other suggestions to turn your pirate drawing into an entire scene include:


Draw a treasure chest and maybe draw a key.






Draw a ship.






Draw an anchor.






Draw ocean waves.






Draw a lighthouse.

, Take a bath, brush your teeth, comb your hair, wash your face, and dress up. If the painter wants you to wear something in specific, be sure to wear that.

, This will increase the chances of the artist liking you and creating a better picture. Don't show up half an hour late, show up on time.

, Don't fidget around, this makes the painter have to start over and take even longer. Use the restroom before you start and rid yourself of any itches.

, If you were doing this for yourself, look at it to see if you like the picture. If it is not yours, it is best not to ask the painter to fix something.

Take care to detail coastal areas.,

Finished.

",How to Draw a Map of an Imaginary Place," Focus on the features that tie up the map together, such as coastlines, mountains or other major features you want your map to focus on.;
, It can be a good idea to begin with coastlines, if your map is to have bodies of water in it. Do not expect your drawing to look like your mental image, even with the simplest idea.

, This will help to make your map more interesting and will help you to balance the image in later phases of drawing.

, If you aren't sure what you want the map to look like, just start drawing lines oriented around shapes and lines.

, Then add the details later as you define the various regions; this includes coloring.

, If you know enough about maps, you will see that that each area has unique features, keep an open mind and don't limit yourself to maps that look the same all over. Things to add include (some of these are elaborated on in the following steps):


Mountains
Canyons
Coastlines
Rivers, lakes
Islands, islets
Forests
Major roads
Cities, towns, villages, outposts, hermit dwellings, farms, etc.
Animal herds, groupings, etc.

, When drawing coastlines try to be especially detailed and varying, make certain areas with many peninsulas and bays, and others that are straighter. Islands and lakes can be anywhere, but try to make a peaceful composition. Make the general shape of your landmass first, then add more eccentric features, you have to pull the coastlines inward and outward, otherwise the map will look unnatural.

, Mountains are normally in small clusters or chains. If you make a large cluster, it should be connected to other areas. Mountains can be absolutely anywhere and should not be limited because they are also a very important part of your composition.

, Rivers can also be anywhere, make sure most of them are wavy, but they don't always have to be. Rivers in mountainous areas are usually straighter than rivers in flat areas. Try to make them originate from lakes (any size) or areas of higher elevation.

, Make archipelagos and clusters, but lone islands may also be used. If coastlines and landmasses still confuse you, try to extend your drawing to include underwater elevations.

, Include hills, vegetation and population. Add in animal herds. Be creative and follow your heart. Add details that make it look more realistic.

Complete the drawing.",How to Draw a Fantasy Alienbot," This will be a guide as well as help you complete your drawing more easily later on. Stoke over the folded paper with your arm to make the fold less visible. Your drawing of an alienbot will be less successful if you don't do this, some think.;
, Start against the line on the left side of the fold. Start drawing in a circle like form and draw your line closer to the middle line as you continue. This will form half of the alien face.

, Start about 2 millimeters away from the bottom of the head and draw your line upwards in parallel with the bottom line of the head. Draw this line about 1cm long and then form a bend to the bottom. Draw a line more or less straight down for about 5cm and then bend the line back to the middle line or fold. This should be like half a shallow bowl.

, In the left side of the head, draw a oval like shape with sharp corners. After doing so, draw another line in the middle of the eye dividing the oval in half.

, For the arms, you can choose any type of arm. For this one, a ""squashed oval"" arm works the best. This arm consists of two half ovals that are stretched. Like with the eyes, draw another oval at the side of the body, but stretch the oval to make it less wide. Separate the two ovals with another line.

, Now you have one half of the alien, the folded paper comes into play. Fold your paper over and use something like an ATM or credit card and rub as hard as you can over the back of the lines of your current drawing. Be careful, rubbing too hard can damage the paper or even tear it, ruining your drawing. Make sure that all your lines traced over onto the other side of the fold. If it didn't, make your left hand side drawing darker and repeat the rubbing process.

, Once all your lines have been rubbed off on the right hand side, use your pencil to complete them. Make them more or less the same shade as the left hand side. This method can be used for any drawing where you need to duplicate something, like wings, eyes, arms, legs, etc.


An example. Here is an example of what your completed alien can look like. Use your imagination and don't bother to make it symmetrical if you don't want to.

Be aware of the possible dangers of artificial food dye.,
Consider using organic food coloring.,
Make your own food coloring.,
Print out a copy of the color wheel.,
Gather together your primary colors.,
Mix your three secondary colors.,
Create your tertiary colors.,
Play around with other hues, tints, tones, and shades.",How to Make Different Colors With Food Coloring," Some medical and scientific sources argue that artificial food dyes can be linked to cancer, brain tumors, hyperactivity, and behavioral issues in children.The FDA has recently required manufacturers to add warning labels to the most commonly used artificial colors, including Yellow #5 & #6, Red #40 & #3, Blue #1 & #2, Green #3, and Orange B. But, these colors can still be added and are still added to processed food and are sold in stores.
While it is up to you whether or not you use artificial dyes in your food, its important to be aware of the possible dangers associated with them and make an informed decision as a consumer.;
, There are several brands that produce organic or natural food coloring made from food and plant extracts available online and in stores.









Keep in mind most of these products advise testing out several different organic colors to see which ones work the best for your project, as some colors may not hold up well under high heat.
These organic dyes can also be expensive, so purchase a small quantity to try out before committing to larger, more expensive quantities.

, Though this may be a more time consuming option upfront, it is cost efficient and you can be assured that the food coloring you’re using came from a natural source. Using the juices from fruits and vegetables like beets, pomegranate, carrot, cabbage and potato, as well as spices like cinnamon, turmeric, and cocoa powder, you can create beautiful, natural colors for your food.However, it’s important to keep in mind the differences between natural dyes and artificial dyes, such as:









Natural dyes often have a more dull or light hue than artificial dyes, as concentrated store bought food coloring requires only a few drops to add color, so it doesn’t change the texture of the food by adding a lot of liquid to it. So, it's a bit more challenging to get a true deep “red” color from beet juice rather than a light pink color as most recipes can’t handle the amount of liquid required to get a true red from beets.
Because natural food coloring contains other foods, strongly colored foods also tend to be strongly flavored foods. So avoid using large quantities of homemade food dyes in your food to ensure it doesn’t overpower the food or render it inedible. For example, a small amount of cinnamon can add a deep brown color, but a large amount will make it difficult to taste anything but cinnamon.
Use powders instead of juices, when possible. For example, using beet powder rather than beet juice will allow you get a nice deep red color, without adding excess liquid to your dish.
If you decide to use this method, you will need to purchase or have access to a juicer., This is the key reference for mixing colors so it may be useful to have a copy in front of you to visualize the colors as you mix them., These are: blue, red, and yellow. You will need to mix these colors together to get secondary colors, and then mix the secondary colors together to get tertiary colors.








Think of the primary colors are the parent colors in the family. When you combine any two primary colors, you get three new hues called secondary colors. So the secondary colors are like the children in the color family.
When you mix a primary color and its nearest secondary color on the color wheel, you create six new hues called tertiary colors. So the tertiary colors are like the grandchildren in the color family.

, Use three clean bowls to mix your colors.Keep in mind if you are using artificial dyes, you will only need a few drops of each color. If you are using natural dyes, you may need to use more of each color.









Take yellow and combine it with red to create orange.
Take red and combine it with blue to make purple.
Take blue and combine it with yellow to make green.

, Now that you’ve made your secondary colors, put out six more clean bowls to mix your tertiary colors.








Take yellow and combine it with orange to make yellow-orange.
Take red and combine it with orange to make red-orange.
Take red and combine it with violet to make red-violet.
Take blue and combine it with violet to make blue-violet.
Take blue and combine it with green to make blue-green.
Take yellow and combine it with green to make yellow-green.

, Now that you have twelve basic colors, you can add more red or orange to make a certain shade of red or add more purple or blue to make a certain tone of blue. The sky’s the limit on the colors you can now create to add something extra to your food.









If you’d like to start with a neutral base for food like icing or cake decorations, begin with pure-white frosting and then add colors to the frosting. Do not add vanilla extract to the frosting as this will alter the color."

Choose the right supplies.,
Create a line drawing of your subject.,
Make your value scale.,
Locate your light source.,
Choose a shading method.,
Create a preliminary shading of your drawing.,
Add more layers of shading.,
Blend shaded areas.",How to Shade Drawings," Although drawing can be done with a regular school pencil and printer paper, for complex shading it is necessary to use specialized artist pencils. You can find inexpensive artist graphite pencils at most craft and art supply stores. If you're able, find sturdy drawing paper with a fine grain to help absorb the shading you will be doing.


Artist pencils come in a range of hardness and softness. This is marked on the pencil by a ""B"" or ""H"". The mark ""B"" refers to soft graphite, and is typically available in 8B, 6B, 4B, and 2B with 8B being the softest. ""H"" refers to a hard pencil, with ""8H"" being the hardest and ""2H"" being the softest.
For the best shading, use the softest pencil you have available. This will allow you to blend the pencil easily, while a hard pencil will be very difficult to shade with.
Typical school pencils are HB, which is a middle ground of hardness/softness. You can use an HB pencil if it is all you have available, but softer pencils will be easier to work with. Also, a good pencil to look out for in school is a 2B pencil, because it can be more versatile in terms of deep shading. Using 2B and HB pencils in conjunction can get you a much greater range and depth of shades than with HB alone.
Paper that is too smooth (printer paper) or too rough (construction paper) will be very difficult to shade. If you can, use a good drawing paper.;
, Use an object in real life or take a photograph of your subject, and print a physical copy of it. Make sure that your subject is still, and that you have plenty of time to get a good outline of it.


Look around your home for ideas. Household objects like flowers, plants, kitchen utensils, or clocks make good subjects. You can also consider items you collect, like figurines or hats.
Refer to the negative space to create a more accurate line drawing. Negative space is the space and forms around your subject. For example, if you are drawing a chair, this is the space between the rungs and chair legs.
If you use a photograph to draw from, consider converting it to gray scale before printing it. This will help you to get more accurate shadings, because your object will already be in black and white.

, Values are the lights and darks of your drawing. A value scale will help you determine the different depths of your shaded drawing. A complete value scale will range from white all the way to black with many shades of gray in between. However, most objects only use 5 adjacent values on the value scale.


To create a value scale, you should start by drawing a long rectangle. You can do this on the corner of your drawing. Or, if you prefer, draw it on a separate piece of paper.
Break the rectangle up into 5 squares, numbering them 1 through 5. You can do more than 5 as you grow in your shading skills, but 5 shades in the scale gives you a place to start.
Intensify the darkness for each number: 1 should be completely white, 2 should be lightly shaded, 3 should represent moderate shading, 4 should be dark, and 5 should be as dark as you can get it.
You should not have both white and black on your shading scale, unless your subject is under a very strong, direct light source. Otherwise you should be working with shades of gray only.

, You will be shading away from your light source; the brightest (lightest) areas will be those closest to the light, and the darkest areas will be the furthest away.


Pay special attention to any glares or reflections, as those tend to be the brightest areas of your subject. Indicate these areas on your drawing.
Your light source will create shadows which you will need to fill in. The shadows are what create a realistic drawing, so don't forget to shade these as well as the bright areas.

, Depending on your subject, your light source, and your desired texture for the drawing, you can choose from several different shading methods. The most common include hatching, cross hatching, and circular shading.


Hatching is the process of drawing many parallel lines that are close together to create a shade. This is best for objects that lack texture or have a natural grain (such as hair).
Cross hatching is a shading method by which you draw crossing lines which form many little 'X' shapes on your drawing. This is a great way to add darkness quickly and easily while simultaneously adding texture.
Circular shading is done by creating small overlapping circles. You can create a lot of texture by spacing the circles far apart and using heavy lines, or create a smooth blend by keeping the circles tight and close together., Because you are still in the ""edit"" mode of your drawing, don't use the full darkness of your pencil so that you can erase or move shadows and light spots. This means press lightly, and only barely fill in areas that need shading.


Leave the very brightest parts of your drawing white. Or, use your eraser to remove the pencil and make a highlight or reflection.
Refer back to your subject frequently to compare it with your drawing. Make sure you get the main shadows and reflections in the right places.

, Darken gradually, each time laying a thin layer of shade. The contrast between light areas and dark areas should become more clear and distinct.


Use your value scale as a guide. This will help you remain consistent throughout your drawing.
Take your time. ""The process is much like a black & white photo slowly developing in the tray in the darkroom. Patience is key at this phase.""
As you deepen your shading, the outline of your drawing should slowly disappear. In real life most things don't have solid outlines - simply a change in value. The same should hold true for your drawing; don't darken the outline, darken the shadows.

, For the smoothest blend, use a blending stump. This smooths out any rough edges and makes the shading more gradual and realistic. Hold the blending stump just like a pencil. Press lightly at first, until you determine how much blending you want to do. You can always go over it again.


You can also use your fingertips or q-tips for blending if you don't have any blending stumps available.
Use an eraser to brighten up spots that might have been accidentally blended. This could be around the outline of shapes or in areas where there is direct light
Just remember that most people, even fine/famous artists, weren't as good as they are now when they were just starting out.

Mix black and white.,

Blend the three primary colors.",How to Make Gray1," Combining black and white will result in a color known as ""neutral gray.""Neutral gray is the purest type of gray you can create because it has no other tint or hue.
Equal parts of black and white should create a mid-tone gray. Vary the shade by adding more of either color. More black creates a darker gray, and more white creates a lighter gray.;
, Mixing two complementary colors will result in a color classified as ""complementary gray.""


The basic color complements are:

Red and green
Yellow and purple
Blue and orange


Combining equal parts of any two complements will result in a flat gray,but you can give the gray a slight tint by adding more of one color than the other. Adding more red, yellow, or orange will result in a ""warm"" gray, but adding more green, purple, or blue should result in a ""cool"" gray.

, When you combine all three primary colors, the resulting color can be called ""primary gray.""


The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.
Mixing equal parts should produce a flat gray, but you can create tints by using more or less of certain colors. Using more blue should result in a cooler tone, but using more red or yellow without additional blue can create warmer tones.

Choose which type of gray to create.,
Combine equal amounts of the appropriate colors.,
Lighten or darken as desired.,
Tint as desired.",How to Make Gray2," Neutral gray, complementary gray, and primary gray are easy to create with paint, but the best option depends on the paint colors you have and the desired application.


Neutral gray can be a great way to tone done other colors without altering the actual hue. Overall, it works best when you know you'll need gray in its purest form.
Complementary gray works best if you want to give cool or warm tints to the hue of the gray.
Primary gray works well when you need to create shadows or pair the gray next to a brighter color. Since primary gray contains all three primary colors, it can make nearby secondary colors look brighter.

, Pour equal amounts of the involved colors into a paint dish or onto a paint palette. Mix thoroughly using a painter's stick until the colors are equally blended.


To review, your color options are:

Black and white
Red and green
Yellow and purple
Blue and orange
Red, yellow, and blue


Blending the colors should result in gray paint. If you used “pure” hues, the resulting gray should be fairly flat in appearance. If the colors used weren't pure hues, however, you may notice a slight tint.

, Examine the shade of the developed gray. If it seems too dark or too light, you can add white or black paint to alter the shade.


Add white to lighten the gray or black to darken it. Work in small amounts of either color, though, to avoid altering the shade more than necessary.
Use white and black to alter the shade regardless of which type of gray (neutral, complementary, primary) you made. Adding any other color will ultimately affect the hue instead of the shade.

, Examine the hue of the developed gray. It it seems too dull for your liking, you can tint the gray by adding more color.


Add small amounts of the color regardless of which one you use. If you don't like the results, it'll be easier to fix them if you've only altered the color in small degrees.
If you made complementary or primary gray, add more of any color used to produce the original gray. In other words, if you made gray with blue and orange paint, you should only add more blue or more orange (not red, yellow, green, or purple).
If you made neutral gray, you can still tint the gray with color. In fact, you can mix nearly any paint color into the gray to create a wider variety of tints.

"
"
Pick the type of gray.,
Drop the involved colors into white icing.,
Add black to darken the gray.,
Tint the gray with color as desired.",How to Make Gray3," Neutral gray is the easiest to create when working with icing, but you can still make complementary and primary grays.


It's best to stick with neutral gray if you want a pure hue, but you can consider the other two types if you'd prefer a tinted gray.
Since readily available packages of liquid food color come with red, yellow, green, and blue, you'll need to create primary (red, yellow, blue) gray or complementary (red and green) gray if you plan to use standard liquid food coloring. If you buy specialty gel or paste food coloring, however, you can create any of the three types since these food colorings have a wider variety of color options.

, Spoon the needed amount of white frosting into a glass bowl. Gradually add the involved colors and mix until fully combined.


As a reminder, the color options are:

Black and white (note: you do not need to add white food coloring since the icing itself is white)Blue and orange
Yellow and purple
Red and green
Red, yellow, and blue


Add liquid food coloring by dropping it in with the bottle's dropper cap. Add paste or gel colors by dipping a toothpick into the color and swirling the same toothpick into the white icing, thereby transferring the color., If you like the tint of the gray but want a darker shade, mix small amounts of black into the frosting until you reach the desired hue.


You can darken the icing with black food coloring regardless of the colors used to produce the gray.
Alternatively, you should be able to create a more vibrant shade by adding more of the original colors to the icing. The higher concentration of color will make the gray brighter. This can be tricky, however, since you'll need to use the exact same amounts of each color to avoid changing the hue.

, If the gray seems a little too flat, try mixing in a small amount of some other color to slightly alter the hue.


For neutral gray, you can tint the hue using nearly any other color.For complementary and primary grays, you should only tint the hue by adding a greater amount of one color already involved. For instance, if you made the gray with red, blue, and yellow food dye, you should only use red, blue, or yellow tints (not green, purple, or orange).

Choose the gray you wish to create.,
Pinch off equal parts of the involved colors.,
Lighten the color, if desired.,
Lighten the shade, if desired.,
Consider tinting the clay.",How to Make Gray4," You can make neutral, complementary, or primary gray using polymer clay. Choose whichever option appeals most to you.


If you want to create a pure gray without any tint, it's best to create a neutral gray.
If you do want to tint the gray, though, primary or complementary grays can simplify the process and reduce your overall number of supplies.

, Grab equal amounts of each involved color. Knead the colors separately, then knead them together.


Your color options are:

Black and white
Blue and orange
Red and green
Yellow and purple
Red, yellow, and green


To knead the colors together, simply stick the separate colors together and roll the mashed ball in between your hands, flattening and re-rolling as needed. Continue until no marbling remains. The colors should be evenly mixed into a solid gray.

, If you want to lighten the color without changing its value, knead a pinch of translucent clay into the ball of gray.Translucent clay has no color, so it won't change the shade or hue of the gray. Instead, it will simply make the gray seem duller and less vibrant.
When choosing how much translucent clay to use, the total amount should not exceed one-third the total amount of your gray clay.

, When you want to lighten the actual shade of the gray, knead a small amount of white into the existing ball.


You can add white regardless of the colors used to create the original gray.
While you could technically darken the color by adding black, it can be difficult to mix black clay into other colors without ruining them. Darkening neutral gray in this manner is much easier, though, since it already contains a black component.

, Once you're satisfied with the saturation of color and shade, determine whether or not you want to add a tint.


Tint the clay by mixing in small amounts of one color.
You should be able to use nearly any color when tinting neutral gray, but you'll need to stick with one of the original colors when tinting complementary or primary grays.

, Experiment with different strokes on a scrap piece of paper first. Hold the pastel at the back end and color with the point or the edge of the tip to make thin, even lines. Press the stick down on the surface lengthwise and move it sideways to create thick, abstract lines. Hold the stick vertically near the tip and you can make thick, rounded markings.Thin lines are useful for linear objects like grass.
Thick abstract lines are good for making a textured background.
Big, round strokes can make cobblestones or bricks.

, Use a brush to move and blend color evenly. Try a tortillon (blending stump) for more linear blending. Try a lint-free rag for large areas. Use a paintbrush and water to blend a watercolor effect.You can also use your fingers, which can push the pastel further into the grip of the paper.

, Brush away excess color with a stiff-bristled brush. Rub a kneaded eraser gently over any mistakes. Try carefully scraping off pigment with a craft knife.You may want to practice this first on a scrap sheet.

, Cut out cardboard shapes. Trace around them with pastels on your drawing surface. Smudge the borders to achieve a “glowing” effect.For example, trace the shapes of Christmas lights or hearts.
This is a great project to do with kids.

, Color a landscape background with your chalk pastels. Dip a finger into tempera paint and rub it over your chalk drawing. Change fingers for different colors.For example, make a sunset or ocean scene with pastels. Then use white paint over it.
This technique is fun for children as well as adults, since it combines finger painting with drawing.

, Make the underpainting of your drawing. Then slowly build up layers and colors to create depth and intensity. Add a background last to make your object really stick out with defined edges.For example, draw a loose sketch of a light-colored piece of fruit. Create shading with colors. Finish up with a dark background.
Another technique is to make the background first using oil pastel in one direction. Then layer more colors on top. Try both techniques and see which one works best for you!, Put your artwork in the refrigerator for twenty minutes. Then warm your pastels in your hands to achieve better coverage.Use this technique if your paper isn’t allowing you to add more layers.

, Draw freehand by sketching with light pressure to the edge of the pastel’s tip. Make choppy, tiny markings to achieve a stippled look.Create “blanket” strokes by making thick, fast squiggles. Use thick, vertical strokes to create hatching.Blanket strokes and hatching work well for backgrounds.
Experiment with different strokes and pressure on a scrap sheet.

, You can blend and mix colors on your paper or on a palette first. Practice using blending to make shadows and reflections. You can make a final blending with baby oil or other liquids.Try the baby oil blending technique on a practice drawing first. Soak a cotton swab in baby oil. Smooth it over your work to blend. Allow it to dry overnight.
Use water for a smooth wash of color. Try turpentine, linseed or other oils for oil pastels that aren’t water soluble."

Use a black pencil to outline your work.,
Layer on the colors.,
Make highlights and deepen shadows.",How to Use Pastels3," Make the contours of the objects you’re drawing. Begin sketching loosely. Add a bit more pressure and shading to the areas that will be shadowed.Try practicing this technique for a still life, such as a few pieces of fruit.

, Color in your main color. For example, if you’re coloring an orange, give the body of the fruit its basic orange hue. Add a layer of darker color. Then apply the main color again.Hold your pencil as you would a regular pencil, or a bit farther away from the tip. See which way is the most comfortable for you.
Add accents after you’ve finished the main colors. For example, shades of brown and green for the blossom end of a fruit.

, Add texture and light or “shiny” areas with a white pencil. Use the white pencil in diagonal strokes to develop the background. Add more shadowing under your objects, if desired, with black and/or light blue.For example, define the pores of a lemon with bits of white.

, Have everyone put in some effort and start allocating roles to everyone (e.g. 2 inkers, 2 drawers, 3 writers etc.), create as many characters, write as much story and draw as much concept art as possible so you can get going with your comic. You might want to do some research in case your comic is set in a certain time period, e.g. if your comic is set during the Golden Age of Piracy, research some pirates, locations and general information about your comic.

, Finish the story for one book/novel by the end of this meeting.

, Plan a script for each panel/page so you know where the comic is going.

, You may want to add gutters or spaces between your panels so it is obvious when one panel ends. Make sure the reader can understand the ordering of the panels.

, Once the drawings are perfect and everyone is happy, ink them with a drawing pen. I recommend using 0.05mm-0.3mm Pilot or Staedtler pens.

, Hopefully you will finish the comic and continue to be a productive team the entire time. But don't get worried if there are small arguments- it is completely natural for this to happen between friends or team-mates, but they don't last long.

, If you are the team leader, hear everyone's ideas out and keep everyone happy. Make sure everyone gets a break or goofing off time- yourself included!

Buy a good set of colored pencils.,
Learn how to hold your pencils properly.,
Practice shading.,
Experiment with textures.,
Plan what you are going to draw before you start a picture.,
Keep your pencil strokes going in the same direction.",How to Draw With Colored Pencils," Most arts and crafts shops will sell these, and they do not have to be expensive. Avoid the ones aimed at children, these often have a slightly waxy texture and don't draw properly, instead pick out some cheap artists' pencils with a large range of colors.;
, Hold the pencil between your thumb, pointing finger and middle finger. Do not put pressure on your pointing finger and don't bend your fingers any more than is necessary to hold the pencil. Holding your pencil properly will give you more control.

, You can get a lot of colors out of one pencil just by changing how heavy the shading is. You can achieve a better color by pressing down lightly and coloring over the same area many times to build up a colour than by pressing down hard.

, You don't have to colour everything in a flat, even color, experiment with different textures to bring your drawings to life. Some examples of common textures you can try are:



Hatching. Drawing parallel lines with white spaces in between. You can control the depth of color by changing how far apart the lines are.







Cross-hatching. Like hatching but using two or more sets of parallel lines, with the lines crossing at an angle.







Directional strokes. These are used for things like hair, fur and grass where the object is made up of tiny strands going in a particular direction. Practice getting all of the lines going in the same direction following a curve while drawing the lines lightly and quickly so that they are smooth.







Circulism. Commonly used for drawing skin textures, this consists of lots of tiny overlapping circles. Press down lightly when using this technique, you can always go back over it if it's not the right shade when you're finished.






Don't be afraid to experiment and find your own textures. Play around and see if you can create any other textures you could use.

, Unlike graphite pencils, colored pencils cannot easily be erased, so it is best to have a good idea of what you are drawing before you start to avoid mistakes.

, Unless you are using a particular texture or following a contour, try to stick to one direction of pencil strokes. If each section of your picture has the lines going in a slightly different direction it can look odd.

A three-dimensional drawing will still look flat or two-dimensional without the aid of shading.,
If we visualize a light source at the upper left of the image, we can simulate an object as 3 dimensional by adding various layers of grey (one darker than the next).,
If the layers of grey are blended together where the each shade meets, It can further simulate the appearance of volume and solidity.

,
This effect can also be done using pen and ink, by drawing intersecting lines drawn on top of one another to simulate the appearance and layers of shading from light to dark.,
Here's an example of shading using various layers of grey.,
Leaving the lightest part of the image as white, the rest of the sketch was shaded with a light shaded coloring tool.

,
Using a slightly darker shade of coloring tool, the next darker areas of the image were shaded.

,
A darker shade of coloring tool was used to shade the darkest areas of the image.

,
By blending the edges of each shade using a blending tool, the final image now has a 3 dimensional appearance like a photograph.

",How to Draw with Realistic Shading,";
, Start by using the lightest gray or white along the area nearest to the light. You can use various shades of pencil or coloring tools to create this effect.

,, This is commonly used in illustrations and comics. In other print media, the printing process uses ""halftone"" printing, which prints small dots of varying sizes to simulate shading.

, The sketch used here was created using an image of the actress Milla Jovovich. I sketched the image using a very dark rough pencil and only drew the darkest parts of the image.

Gather red, blue, and yellow paint.,
Squeeze or dab some of each color onto the palette in a separate spot.,
Mix the paint together.,
Adjust the value and hue of the black.",How to Make Black1," Black is the darkest color, but there are still degrees of blackness you can make with paint. The exact shades of red, blue, and yellow that you use will determine the black. Use your choice of oil, watercolor or acrylic paint.Using Aureolin, Rose Madder Genuine, and Cobalt Blue will yield a soft black while using Winsor Yellow, Permanent Alizarin Crimson, and Winsor Blue will yield a bold black.
If you have a basic paint set, whatever red, blue and yellow you have will work. Magenta and cyan are common red and blue to use.;
, It works best to put the colors on the palette one at a time before you mix them. Put the globs of paint about ½ inch (1.3 cm) apart on the palette. For a basic black, use equal amounts of each color.









Use slightly more of one or two of the colors to give a different look to the black.
If you use a paintbrush to dab paint onto the palette, be sure to use a different brush for each color so that you don’t mix the paints except on the palette.
You will most likely not be able to create the same black from one time to the next, so be sure to make enough to paint what you want to.

, You can use a paintbrush to mix the colors together. Some paint mixes better if you use a palette knife or some type of metal scraping tool. Spend at least 15 seconds moving the paints around to make sure you end up with one full color without any leftover bits of any individual color.









If you use a paintbrush to mix the paint, swirl the brush gently and don’t press down too hard. You can ruin brushes by pushing them too hard against the palette.

, Depending on what you use the black for will affect how you want it to look. You might add a small dab of white paint to lighten the black, or you might add a drop more blue to create a black for a night sky.








If you have time and paint to spare, experiment with the color. Add a little brown or green to the black to paint pine trees at night, or add some yellow for the sun reflecting off of black metal.
Mixing paint by hand usually won’t give you an exact black, but your black will have more character than a pure black.

Purchase your distress markers.,
Secure your paper.,
Color on a nonstick sheet or acrylic plate.,
Pick up the exposed ink with a wet watercolor brush.,
Apply the ink in to your paper.",How to Water Color with Distress Markers1," For this method, you’ll need to purchase a set of distress markers in the colors that you’d like to use. A full set of distress markers can be expensive, so you might want to start with a smaller set of markers in colors that you'll use the most.

The most popular brand of distress markers is Tim Holtz’s line, but you can use any water-based markers, including Zig Art, Graphic Twin, and Tombow ABT makers.;
, When you’re applying marker ink with a watercolor brush, you want to make sure that the paper you’re painting on is secure so that it doesn’t move around once you begin painting. Use painter’s tape around the edges of your paper to keep it in place., Using the brush end (rather than fined-tip) of your distress marker, apply a square of color to an acrylic plate or nonstick sheet to build up color that you can pick up with your brush.Because the markers are water-soluble, applying a wet watercolor brush to the ink will reactivate it and it will become wet again. No need to worry about the ink drying out while you work., Wet the watercolor brush of your choice and use it to pick up the exposed ink by rolling it on your patch of marker ink. The amount of ink you’ll want to pick up will vary according to how saturated you want your colors to be., Now that you have the ink on your watercolor brush, apply it to your paper. At this point, you can paint as you would with a traditional watercolor paint.It's best to start by applying a lighter coat of color and then layer more on the make it darker.

Take a pencil and paper (preferably a grade 2B or 3B pencil, and good cartridge paper - but anything will do for the moment - don’t put it off until you can get to the art shop - start now!,
Hold your pencil as loosely as you can and, starting a little way in - an inch (3cms) or so - from the left-hand edge, make a small patch on the paper, as lightly and softly as possible - just let the pencil use its own weight.,
Next to this patch, make another - but this time use just a little more pressure, to make a very slightly darker patch.

,
Continue making these patches, in a row, each one slightly darker than the last, until you find you can’t make one any darker - you can go back over the patches if necessary.,
Look at what you now have - a row of patches, each one darker than the last.,
Number the patches, making the first, lightest patch No.,
Go back to the beginning of the scale, and draw just a circle, or a square, so you’ve got a patch of pure white paper inside it.,
The row should look something like this:

,
Congratulations!",How to Improve Your Drawings With Tonal Contrast1,");
, The patch can be as big or small as you like, but something about an inch (2 or 3cms) across is ideal.

,, You’ll need to press harder with the pencil, and probably find yourself holding it differently, for each patch - eventually you’ll find you can’t press any harder and you’ll have a patch on the end of the row as dark as it will go. Now stop!

, How many have you got? Probably 8 or 10.

, 2 (yes 2 - you’ll see why in a minute) and the last, darkest patch, whatever number it ends up with - probably 8 or 10 (maybe 9, it doesn’t matter as long as you’ve got a row from lightest to darkest.)

Gather your supplies.,
Draw a straight line.,
Cut your paper.,
Roll your paper.,
Form the pencil shape.,
Secure the tortillon.,
Clean your tortillon.,
Trim the frayed paper.,
Organize tortillons by color.",How to Make a Tortillon," To create the tortillon, you will need a blank piece of copy paper (recommended size A4) a ruler, a pencil and a pair of scissors. You will be able to create two usable tortillons for every one piece of copy paper you prepare.A4 paper is 210mm wide and 297mm long (approximately 8 1/4 x 11 3/4 inches.);
, To do this, measure 1” down the side of your paper and mark it with your pencil. Flip your paper and measure 1” down on the other side. Connect your ruler between the two pencil markings and draw your straight line., Following the straight line you’ve drawn down the center of your paper, cut the paper into two halves. To learn how to cut a straight line on paper using scissors, read this article.

, Grasp the narrowest end of your paper in your hands. Roll the paper evenly and medium tightly towards the other edge of the paper. Be careful not to roll too tightly, as this can result in a more finely tipped tortillon.If you are struggling to roll your tortillon, try positioning it on a flat surface and rolling it using a similar motion to that of a rolling pin. Don’t worry if you struggle for a while; creating a usable tortillon takes time and practice.

, To accomplish this, you will need a thick wire, knitting needle or something similarly sized and shaped. Using your tool, push the center of the tortillon out until it has assumed the shape of a pencil.

, Take a small piece of tape and use it to reinforce the tortillon. Make sure to trim any extra paper or tape from the top, as this will get in the way of blending and could potentially ruin your shading., Tortillons will last for a long time, provided you care for them. To clean your tortillon, rub it against a rough surface until the outer layer is scraped off. Medium sandpaper is a great tool for cleaning your tortillon.When blending lighter areas, use a clean tortillon. When blending darker areas, use a dirty tortillon.

, Using craft scissors, clean off the excess paper from your tortillon. Go slowly, and try to recreate the rounded point you had after initially creating the tortillon., If you continuously clean your tortillons, you will find they have a much shorter shelf life. To avoid this, try organizing your tortillons by the color lead they have on them. If you continue to use the correct shade of tortillon when you are blending, you will not have to clean them as often and the tortillon will last much longer."

Combine red and green paint.,
Blend blue and orange paint.,
Merge yellow and purple paint.",How to Make Black2," Mixing paint colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel essentially cancels out the color properties of each and yields a dark hue. You can choose any red or green depending on how you want the black to look. Phthalo Green and Naphthol Red are great complements to combine for a simple black.







, Place a dab of blue paint, such as Cobalt Blue, and a dab of orange paint, such as Translucent Orange, onto your palette. Gently swirl the colors together until a vibrant black is formed. If equal parts of each doesn’t create a dark enough black, add a bit more blue to the mixture.







, Create a mixture that is around 60% purple and around 40% yellow, and adjust this ratio to get the black that you want. Cadmium Yellow is standard paint that works well and you can mix it with a violet.








"
"
Start with Ultramarine Blue.,
Place a touch of Burnt Umber near the blue.,
Add a dab of Prussian Blue.",How to Make Black3," On your palette or painting surface, place a small dab of Ultramarine blue. Blue should make up roughly half of the total paint, so use as much as you need for what you want to paint., Don’t apply the two colors to the exact same spot. Rather, place them a half inch or one centimeter apart. Then gently swirl the two colors together. Adjust with a little more of either color to make the black you want.








, if you want to deepen and darken the black you’ve mixed, add just a small dab of Prussian Blue. This new mixture works great for a black that shows the darkness of night.

"
Choose the right paper for your project.,
Color directly on your paper.,
Spread the ink with a wet watercolor brush.",How to Water Color with Distress Markers2," Because this technique requires that you apply marker ink directly to the paper and then use water to spread it, you might want to a choose a thicker paper. This prevents bleed-through to the opposite side of your paper and also helps prevent your ink from spreading too far.

Card stock is a good option for this, particularly if you're planning on using a lot of ink/water.
You can also use actual watercolor paper for this method, too.

, Using either the fine or brush tip of your distress marker, color on your paper where you want that particular color to go. You’ll want to color a little more darkly than you normally would since you’ll be diluting the color by adding water to it.Unless you are looking for a very defined border with the color you’re using, you should favor the brush, rather than fine-tip, end of your marker. The fine tip can scratch the paper, which prevents your color from being applied evenly., Dip your watercolor brush into water, and then gently spread the marker ink with light, smooth strokes. The more water you apply to the marker ink, the more diluted and therefore light the color becomes."
"
Spray the ink with water.,
Add salt.,
Use stamps.,
Drop water onto the ink.,
Try different types of paper.",How to Water Color with Distress Markers3," Instead of using water to apply distress marker ink to the paper or painting water on top of the ink, you can try spraying ink with water. Apply the colored ink where you'd like it to go on your chosen paper, and then use a spray bottle to apply water to the page.This technique is particularly good if you're trying to achieve a rainbow look.
Don't spray too close to the paper - if you do, you risk oversaturating the paper with water and causing the structure of the paper to break down.
If your brush the color after you've sprayed it with water, you can achieve an ombre effect.

, Once you've applied the distress marker ink and water to your paper with the technique of your choice, sprinkle some salt on the color. Then use a heat gun to apply heat. This will cause the colors to pool around the salt, making the pigment more intense but still preserving the original color under the salt., Using stamps with distress marker ink and water can help you to create personalized, handmade cards and stationary. You can use stamps as an outline for filling in an image with water color, or you can use distress marker ink directly on the stamp.

If you're using a stamp as an outline, keep in mind that you're not necessarily limited by the lines the stamp makes. You can blend the colors across the lines of your drawing for a more natural look.
If you're applying distress marker ink to the stamp, let the stamp ink dry before you then apply distress marker ink and water. Otherwise, the lines of the stamp will run. You can use a heat gun or hair dryer to speed up the drying process.If you mist the stamp before you apply ink, the lines of your stamped drawing will have a more watercolor look to them.

, Apply distress marker ink to your paper, and then drop water on top of it - a straw is a great tool for this technique. Once you're finished, blot the dropped areas dry. This will create a watermark effect on your paper., There are many types of craft paper available that you can use with distress marker ink. However, the different types of paper will react to the marker ink and the addition of water in different ways. Experimenting with different papers types and water coloring techniques can help you to create specific looks, depending on your project.Watercolor paper will allow you to blend and spread the colors the easiest.
Card stock is best if you're working with a smaller image - the inks will blend but not as far.
Coated paper will give let your watercolors spread the least, which is best if you're looking for very precise lines and colors."

Find some drawings you've done, and compare them to the scale.,
Equally important is Tone Number 1, pure white - this, and the darkest tone, give you the complete tonal range to use in your drawings.

,
Important - You don’t need all these tones - 1 to 10 - in a drawing, but you do need the lightest, No.,
Look at pure white tone No 1 for a minute.,
Beginners often make a superb tonal scale, but somehow are afraid to re-create that darkest tone on their actual drawings.,
Good quality pencils and paper will definitely help - the next article will show you the pencil grades, and how to get the most from them.

,
Happy drawing!

",How to Improve Your Drawings With Tonal Contrast2," Try to see which tones in your drawing match the tones on the scale. Important - use your scale, not the one here! If you think your drawing lacks something, probably the only tones you can match are in the middle range, say 4 to 6. So what does this tell you? To give your drawing dynamism, you must be able to see the dark tones - whether it’s 8, 9 or 10 on your tonal scale, it needs to have, somewhere, the darkest, strongest tone you can make. It often only needs to be a small area that has this darkest tone, but it makes all the difference to the result.

,, 1, the darkest, No 10 (or whatever it is on your scale), and one or two in the middle range - say 4 and 6. Don’t be too worried about the middle ranges, they usually look after themselves -it’s the lightest and darkest which seem to cause problems, and that's the purpose of this exercise - to make you aware of them.

, Although it’s vital, somehow it doesn’t cause a anything like the anxiety to beginners that the dark tones do!

, “I’m scared!” is a common cry…Well, it’s a sheet of paper - you won’t kill anyone or drown or cause an accident - so just do it!

Sketch the base.,
Begin to outline the drawing.,

Add shading where the lines meet.,
Imagine where the light source will be and begin to shade appropriately.,
Smudge or blend the shading.,
Using a kneaded or pointed edge of an eraser, erase the places where the light source will be.

,
Continue to sketch, smudge and erase so you get a gradient of light to dark in the shading.the more you do this, the darker and more in-depth your shading will be.,
Erase around the outlines and darken your final curves and shadows.,
Once you're satisfied, step back and enjoy it.",How to Draw and Shade With Pencil," This does not have to be perfect, so don't make it perfect. Think of it as guidelines, not laws. Sketch it lightly. If you sketch too dark, there will be lines that you do not want in the finished drawing.;
, Remember to make this very light; you'll be darkening it later. 'Flesh out' your character or design by adding the layers like skin, fur, clothing, etc. Add the outlines.

, Making them dark will ensure that they stay in the paper when you erase anything you don't need. But don't make them too dark, yet!

, Right now, you don't need to worry about light source. Adding a small bit of shading on every cross section of the lines gives it depth and weight. This process is often called 'weighting' a picture. It can make the difference between a flat image and an image that pops out at you.


This makes the difference between picture one and picture two at right:

, Do it lightly and in small strokes; the best way to shade is in layers


Some people sketch a small circle or other object to indicate the light source. This can be a good method if you aren't handy at visualizing where the light is coming from.

, Using a tissue or the tip of your finger, press on the shading and smudge is to lay it out evenly. Don't worry about getting it over a larger area than you need or out of the lines; you'll be erasing mistakes later.

,, This process can take a few minutes or days depending on how much you want to do it.

, Add extra highlights for an even shinier look.

, Forget anything? Need more shading in a certain area? Add any finishing details. Done.

, Shapes do not have to look real as long as you can tell what it is because you are making an abstract drawing. Once you find some objects, take a pencil and make them stand out by outlining them so you can see them clearly. Find several shapes to make an image.

, Once you have a good background, color in the shapes. Colors can be realistic, although your image will look a lot more abstract and interesting if you make colors different then they are supposed to be. You are done!

Combine the blocks into figures.,
Make a reference sheet.,
Redraw the subject.,
Research drawing techniques.,
Practice with more equipment.,
Imagine how you’d draw objects.,
Practice.",How to Draw Without Taking Classes," Pick something meaningful to you if possible such as your favorite flower or your dog. It is likely going to be easier for you at first to draw from a reference than from imagination, so drawing something you like will help you focus.


When starting out, you don’t need specialty art supplies. Any pen, pencil, or paper on hand will do.;
, Press your pencil lightly against the paper. Focus in on the line you will draw, forgetting what the subject is. Don’t think about your dog. Instead, start with an outline. The edge of your dog is a line between the dog and the environment. Make your line with short strokes.The shorter you make your line strokes, the steadier your drawing will appear.
Don’t critique your work. Move fast and hone your stroke.

, Once you have a basic outline of your subject, start drawing the interior. Search for landmarks on the subject, distinguishing marks such as a dent in a cup or a tuft of hair on a dog that will give you an idea of where to place nearby lines., Shading is a little more difficult, but it gives your drawings a sense of light and depth. Observe which way the sun shines on your subject. Start with a clean, sharp pencil and make even marks on partially dark areas. As the lead tip wears away, move towards the shadowed areas. Press harder to leave darker marks.This can be practiced by doing a shading bar. Start at one end of the paper. Move your pencil back and forth as you move across the paper. Apply more pressure to transition to darker marks.
Value bars are also good practice. Divide a rectangle into five sections. Leave one end white. Darken the other end as much as you can. Layer your lines in the squares in between to make different shades of gray.

, Copying lines can only get you so far. If you can master shapes, you can begin to draw from imagination and improve the sense of perspective in all your drawings. Start by trying to draw 3D shapes. Adding a rough line across a circle, for example, gives you spheres seen from different perspectives depending on where you place the line., Link up the blocks to form the outlines of objects. At first start with simple or imaginary objects. You might make a table out of a series of rectangles and cylinders or a snake out of a series of circles. Once you can imagine the blocks that make up an object, you will have the creativity to draw them without having a model.


Spend time observing subjects, figuring out how you can fit them into your forms.

, Arrange your forms to make the shape of the subject. As you go, erase and refine the lines so the subject takes shape. After you’re done, try drawing the subject from different angles. For example, a square nose with a circle cheek and triangle ears can form a side view of a horse, but there are many other perspectives.Refer back to these sketches to improve your other drawings.

, During a different session after correcting any mistakes on your reference, redraw your subject. At first, you can use your reference sheet. Use shapes to create a basic outline of the subject, then refine the details and clear up mistakes. With more practice, you’ll be able to draw poses from memory.


Simplifications are okay and can lead to your own style. For example, it would be too time-consuming to memorize every muscle in a body.

, Your local library may have books on different drawing styles from realism to Japanese manga. You can also buy these at retail stores. Search on YouTube or on art websites such as How to Draw It or Drawspace for free ideas and demonstrations.Anatomy books are also an option for learning realistic drawings. Sketch skeletons and muscular diagrams.

, Usually it’s better to stick to one medium, such as pencil on paper, until you get comfortable. Once you start, though, you may find alternatives you like better and lead to your own style, such as colored pencils or charcoal. In addition, pencils come in many varieties that can help you expand your range when shading.For pencils, HB (#2) is standard. Pencils in the H range are harder and make softer lines. Pencils in the B range are softer and make darker lines.
Pencils go from HB-9. In H pencils, 9 is maximum hardness. In B pencils, 9 is maximum softness.
Vinyl and gum erasers are gentler on paper than rubber erasers but they don’t streak color. Kneaded erasers are shapeable for removing individual details.

, When you’re not busy drawing, observe what’s around you. Picture how you’d turn this scene into a pencil drawing. Imagine shading around someone’s eye and sketching in the iris and pupil, for example. This imagination is how you gain insight into how to make your lines and compose your style.The goal is to see the details instead of the labels. Instead of thinking of the eye, think of the lines and colors you’ll fill in to form the eye.

, Drawing is very much a skill like playing an instrument or riding a bike. Whenever you have spare time, sit down and sketch. Practice shading and other techniques. Work on making reference sheets. Space out your time between sessions with subjects so you can learn more without burning yourself out.

, Observe how the switched colors can change the overall impression of the drawing; to get the full effect, you can make two identical images with different colouring choices and display them together.

Get comfortable.,
Use a pencil to draw.,
Don't use an eraser at first.,
Look carefully at the scene or object you want to draw.,
Remember the general rule: objects higher up on the plane (closer to the sky) are generally smaller and farther away than objects lower, which are closer to you.,
You'll notice some artists stick their pencil out in the air between their eye and their subject - this is to measure objects.

,
Hold your arm out straight with pencil in hand.,
Sketch the entire scene lightly, keeping the above rules in mind.,
Don't worry if everything doesn't look right the first time.,
Don't start drawing a tiny portion of your scene and work on that part for a long time.,
Once you are happy with the general scene you sketched even though it is not perfect, fill in slightly darker lines.,
Sketch general shapes; a person's head is an oval, a rock that is resting on the ground should have a flattened bottom, an animal can be drawn with a series of ovals, circles, and hot-dog shapes.,
If you are drawing geometric shapes like buildings or mechanical objects, you will want a ruler and some templates.,
Shade what is not completely drenched in light: use soft line, or crisscrosses, or whatever way you feel comfortable making darker areas.,
Color should be used sparingly with pencil drawings, because the lead is sensitive and will smear easily across the page.",How to Draw What You See," You can't draw well if you are sitting cross-legged on a pile of sharp rocks!;
, Do not use a mechanical pencil. It may seem easier, but it's better if you use a graphite pencil (not only is it easier to control, it also doesn't limit your range of motion,and it doesn't leave dents in the paper).

, You won't need it for the original sketching because it is meant to be quick and very light. The lines you create at first will be barely visible!

, Visually take a picture of it. Try to absorb every detail into your brain. Spend about 3-4 minutes doing this.

, Objects that are far away are less clear and have softer edges as though they are foggy.

,, Move your thumb to take a measurement from the end of the pencil to your thumb. If a person in your scene measures 1/2 the length of your pencil, and the height of a park bench measures 1/4, then make the bench in your drawing half the height of the person.

, Sketch so lightly that you can barely see the pencil marks, and only spend about 5 minutes drawing the entire scene.

, This is why you drew lightly.

, Draw everything at once - otherwise, every part of the drawing will look like it's the wrong size in relation to everything else.

, You can use these lines to be more careful and correct the first lines. If you mess up, erase the first line. Don't get too dark, or you won't be able to completely erase the lines!

, Trees are all different - but careful not to make all the trunks and limbs perfectly straight. Even the limbs of a pine tree swoop down slightly and then curve back out to match the horizon line.

, (See the list below)

, If anything is white or yellow in your scene, don't draw it! Let the paper be the lightest areas.

, Colored pencils or markers will make this worse. Painting, however, is an option - you can completely paint over your drawing and use the drawing as a template. Although it is best to photo-copy it first so you can still see your original drawing.

, Human faces are some of the hardest things to draw. How far apart do you make the eyes? How do you make them look real and not like a cartoon? By studying human faces and using these tricks, you can draw faces that look real.

, Are you going on a trip and you want to draw the beautiful places around you? Maybe you just want to draw the place where you live! Whatever the case, you can draw landscapes with ease by using a few simple tricks.

, Maybe you'd rather draw animals. This can be lots of fun and isn't as hard as it seems! With practice and some helpful hints, you too can draw animals.

, You can also draw cars and other mechanical devices. This is fun and also popular! Give drawing your dream car a try today!

, Shadows and highlights are what give drawings depth and make them look more real. Learn where to put shadows and highlights so that your drawings can look more tangible.

, Perspective, or how the size of something appears to change as it moves away, is another thing that makes drawings look real. This may seem complicated but it is actually very easy. Give it a try!

, The easiest way to begin drawing from life is to use a model. Draw what is directly in front of you. This can be a person, an object, or a landscape. Drawing directly from something you can observe will result in the greatest improvement in your skills.


Try to work as quickly as you can. This will teach your brain to take in the most important information quickly and efficiently. Note basic shapes and proportions before moving on to details. This will be keep you from having to adjust if your model moves.

, If a live model is unavailable, you are worried about the model moving too much, or simply don’t have the time to devote to a live model drawing, you can draw instead from a photograph. This is not as effective a learning tool, but produces similar results in terms of a final drawing.


If you want to draw something photo-realistic but lack proper skills, this will be the easiest method since you will be able to take in minute details at your own pace.

, Though you will not learn as much, you can simply create a realistic image from your imagination. To be truly realistic, you will need to have an excellent understanding of light and shadow, as well as proportion, form, and fold physics.

, Before you begin, create sketches of your intended final image. This will help you create a better final image by allowing you to explore composition and details, as well as acting as a practice run.

, You can start with thumbnail sketches, or small images intended only to convey the basic forms of the drawing. This is a great way to decide a general layout (usually called a composition in fine art).

, Once you have decided on a composition, you can do a more detailed sketch. This will help you get used to creating the form of your subject, acting as a sort of practice run. If you have too much difficulty with the image during this stage, it will be an indication to use a simpler pose or form.

, When creating these sketches, look for the basic shapes which form the object you are drawing. All things which exist are composed of shapes or several shapes. Noses, for example, are complex pyramids, while trees are a series of cones or circles. Find the shapes to help you give dimension to your drawings, as well as helping you draw them correctly.

, Make a copy of the sketch to draw over. It is wise to draw your final image on top of a sketch, either basic or detailed, depending on personal preference. This will let you tweak the forms, as well as give you a guide for creating the final image.

, Get that right and you'll find it much easier to work out what goes where. You will often find it easier to draw the shape of the negative space around an object than the edge of the object itself.

, One of the most important aspects of drawing realistic images is to ensure that you are drawing what you actually see, rather than what you think you see. Our brains tend to generalize images, so paying attention to and recreating what your brain tends to skip over will not only create a more realistic image but teach you a lot.


One trick to prevent drawing your assumptions is to get a picture from a magazine, turn it upside down, and draw it. This technique tricks your brain into thinking it's looking at something new instead of something you think you're familiar with. In this way you can draw what you actually see - unique shapes - instead of drawing what you've always assumed the subject looks like.
Pay particular attention to things like ears, noses, tree leaves and shirt collars. These are things which we tend to generalize in our minds and ignore the details of. If you want to draw something realistically, make sure you are drawing the things which make it unique. Things like ears are vastly different between different people.

, Perspective, or how objects seem different sizes relative to their distance from you, is very important to making objects look realistic. When creating a realistic landscape, for example, you will need to draw the trees that are further away as being smaller and less detailed, even though they may in fact be taller than the trees which are closer to you. This will mimic how your eye perceives objects and make the image more realistic.


Perspective is drawn by first finding the horizon line. When you look at anything in real life, you will see that there is a point at which the physical Earth that you can see meets with the sky. This is the horizon line. You will need to figure out where this should be in your picture and lightly draw it in using a ruler.
Draw in a disappearing point. You can use one, two, or three points. One is the simplest, while two is the most common. Three is hard, so avoid it until you are comfortable. The method for two point perspective is described below.
Draw those one or two points somewhere on the horizon line. This is the direction or directions in which objects disappear. You can have the dots on the paper itself, or they can be far off the page and marked on your drawing surface. With two point perspective, you will need to have one dot on either side of the object you are trying to draw.
Draw the central line of your object and then, from the top and then bottom of the object, use a ruler to draw lines back to your disappearing point.
Figure out how far back the object goes and then draw in some more vertical lines, between the angled disappearing lines, to start creating the box that your object fills.
Close your box by drawing a line from the back line on one side to the perspective point on the opposite side. You can now see what parts of your object should be visible and to what degree.

, Proportions are the sizes of objects relative to each other. Especially when drawing people, paying attention to proportions will be critical in making your image realistic. Most human faces, for example, follow mathematical formulas which lead parts of the face and body to line up in a particular way. Getting proportions wrong will make you drawings look cartoonish or strange.


For example, humans are five to seven heads tall. There is one eye length distance between your eyes. The line of the mouth usually points to the corner of the jaw. There is one foot length between the elbow and the wrist. There are many measurements like this on the human body and it can take time to learn them but it is a rewarding and interesting process.

, Highlights and shadows will do the most to make your drawings look photo-realistic. The more detailed and accurate the highlights and shadows, the more realistic your drawing will appear. However, before you place these highlights and shadows, you will need to decide where the source of the light is in your drawing.


A light source can be something like a lamp or it can be light from a window. If outside, it can be the sun itself. The light will travel in a straight line from this source and hit the facing sides of the object you are drawing.

, The areas which are hidden from or blocked from the line of light will be in shadow. The further from the light, the deeper the shadow. Once you have determined where the light is coming from in your drawing, decide where your darkest shadows will be and begin your shading by making these areas dark. Shadows give drawings depth and form.


Your next step will be to add mid-level shadows. These are areas which are only partially in shadow and are not as dark as the deep shadowed areas. Continue to build in this way until you have three to six blocked levels or areas of shading.
Once you have gotten your shadows generally placed, you may want to blend these together using your fingers or a stump. This will form the smooth gradient of your shadow. Keep hard lines of a shadow if they exist, however, such as shadows from a table or other hard object. If you're newer to drawing, you may want to leave this step out because it can make your drawing look messy.
Hatching and line variation. If you are using ink or do not want to use gradient shadows, you can add depth and form using carefully placed lines and textures. Make outlines thicker in areas where there would be shadows, such as the dip at the top of an apple or the spot at the back of the neck where it meets near the ear. Use lines to follow the form of an object and overlapped lines in differing directions to create the appearance of shadows.
Research hatching or etching to see examples of what this looks like, and master examples of the art. Doing this type of drawing is very challenging to do well and takes a great deal of practice. It is very versatile, however.

, Once you have put in all of your shadows, add highlights at the spots where the light hits the objects directly. You can do this by erasing or using white charcoal or similar substances.


On a face lit from the front, for example, highlights will go above the brow, down the line of the nose, at the crest of the cheek and on the chin, since these are the areas which protrude the most.

, The most common tool for drawing in this style is a pencil. Pencils will allow you to easily lay down shadows and leave blank or erase areas for highlights. Pencils are easy to layer, giving you great control over the image you create. They also blend relatively well.


Pencils come in different hardnesses (created by containing more or less graphite). The harder the pencil, the lighter the mark it will make. Use different pencils depending on how light or dark your lines need to be. Hard pencils will be labeled with an H and soft pencils with a B. The higher the number listed next to the letter, the more hard or soft the pencil is. A standard pencil, for example, is a HB.

, You can also use pens for creating realistic drawings. This will rely on highly accurate lines and proportions, as well as hatching, line variation, and etching style shadows. You can use any pen for this but you will have the best results with a nibbed or brush pen, as this will give you better opportunity to change line widths.

, You can use charcoal to create realistic drawings as well. Charcoal is perhaps the easiest drawing medium with which to create shadows and highlights, a crucial aspect of creating realistic drawings. Charcoal is easily smudged and blended, which can be used to your benefit but can also create difficulties.


Drawing charcoal comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Willow or vine charcoal is a nice middle ground, while charcoal pencils are great for doing details.

, Depending on what media you choose, you will need to be sure to get an appropriate type of paper. Charcoal especially will require paper designed for that medium (a heavily textured paper which gives the charcoal something to latch onto). Pencils will do better with smooth, rag paper since this will help with blending.


Be sure to look for acid-free, archival paper when available. This will keep your drawings from yellowing over time or otherwise aging badly.
In addition to special paper, charcoal will require the use of a spray fixative to keep it from smudging once you are done creating your image.

, A drawing stump is a pencil shaped roll of paper which is sanded to a point. This point is then used to blend charcoal or pencil, forming the soft gradient of shadows in your drawing. It will need to be sanded every time it becomes too covered in charcoal or graphite from your pencils. Stumps can be purchased or made by hand.

, An eraser is invaluable for removing mistakes and creating highlights. You can use a normal vinyl or rubber eraser for pencil or a kneaded eraser for charcoal. You can also use a kneaded eraser for pencils, as it can easily be molded into a sharp point to do detail erasing.

Color.",How to Draw a Tree House," There are many different things to consider when it comes to trees and tree houses. Consider the following to come up with the variables of the drawing:


What kind of tree is it?
What is the appearance of the tree?
What does the tree house look like?
What is the tree house made of?
How do people get to the tree house? Do they use a ladder? Climb the tree?;
, Depending on the tree that you've selected, there will be different ways of drawing the tree.


If the tree is older, it's likely to be taller, have more branches, and have a thicker trunk. Younger trees are notably difficult to climb due to their lack of branches and thin trunks.
Make sure that the tree looks like it could support the tree house! If the tree house is resting on the fork of two thin branches, anyone who climbs into it is going to go crashing to the ground.

, There are many different styles of tree houses and they can be located in different spots. What do you want your tree house to look like?


Make sure that the tree house would be steady in its location. It can't be simply resting on one branch, as walking to the sides of the house would cause it to fall out of the tree. Try resting it across two thick branches or nailing it to the tree.
Tree houses without roofs are commonly seen to be platforms with a fencing around them. However, these don't last very well in rainy environments, as the planks for the floor rot easily when they're wet.
If the tree house has a roof, the most common type of build is simply a box with holes in it for doors and windows. However, there are different builds available. Look online for inspiration

, Does a branch hang into a window of the tree house? Do the owners of the tree house have toys stashed in it? Are there branches leading up to the tree house that permit someone to climb up quickly?

, Color the tree, the leaves, and the tree house. It should stick to a color scheme of being brown and green, although if it's set around the autumn seasons, coloring the leaves with reds, oranges and yellows will work fine.

Finn’s character is essentially made up of an oval shape at the head, and rectangles for the body, legs and arms.;
, To begin, draw an oval shape that’s wider than it is tall.


You want your oval to be a decent size, but not too big as Finn wears a helmet that matches the width of the rest of his body, which you'll draw around this oval.
Your oval doesn't have to be perfect because you'll be drawing over it as you continue. Right now, it just provides an outline.

, Draw a cross in the center of the oval, and add another horizontal line above the one forming the cross. You should have two horizontal lines and one vertical line.These facial lines will help you to place Finn’s eyes and mouth.
If you plan on drawing Finn at an angle, move the vertical line farther to one side in the direction you want Finn’s body to face.
Draw these lines lightly as you will erase them later.

, Start at about the middle of your oval's height for Finn’s head and draw a rectangle that is about twice as long.You don’t need to make the corners of the rectangle perfect right angles. Finn’s body is usually curved slightly to show the character in action.

, Finn’s arms and legs look slightly like noodles. For the right arm, start below the head, just inside of the rectangle. Draw a line slowly curving upward, like an “L”. Then draw another line following the same path to create the arm. Start the left arm at the same height as the right. Draw a “J” shape curving out, away from the body and then back in. Each leg is made up of two lines that start wide at the top and get more narrow toward the feat.


Don’t put the legs too close together. Finn’s legs are as wide as his body.
If you don’t like how your arms or legs look, erase and try again.
The hands are made up of three fingers and a thumb.
The feet look like bloated “L” shapes with donut shaped socks on top.

, Finn’s white helmet/hoodie is as wide as his rectangle body, and goes around the oval shaped head. Start just above the arms and draw upwards along the widest part of the oval. The top has two little bumps like rounded cat ears.


The top of Finn’s helmet should be only slightly higher than the top of the head.

, The first oval you drew is for Finn’s head, this second one makes the opening for Finn’s face.


The oval you draw here should be large enough so you have room to draw Finn’s face.

, Inside of the oval you just drew, you’ll draw the eyes and mouth. Finn’s face is easy to draw because the eyes are just two small black circles and a curved line for the mouth.


Use the facial lines as your guide. draw one eye on each side if the vertical line, and in between the two horizontal lines.
Draw the mouth just below the eyes.

, You should now have the helmet, the face, and the body drawn. Follow your outline and add in Finn’s shorts. The waistline is at an even height with Finn’s left hand. The legs of the shorts go about ⅓ the way down his legs.


Draw the legs of the shorts slightly wider than Finn’s actual legs.
Erase any lines, like the line that you originally drew as the bottom of Finn’s body, to make the shorts look like clothing.

, The top of the backpack should start at the same level as your top facial line. Draw a half circle around Finn’s left arm to form the shape of the bag. Then add two more lines over his shoulder to create the strap.


Add a small curved line about halfway down the backpack.

, Finish adding the shoes, which are made up of two small donut like circles at the ankles, and reversed “L” shaped feet. Make sure that you have Finn’s helmet, shirt, and pants completed. These should be made up of three rectangular sections.


Add sleeve lines for Finn’s shirt about ⅓ the way down his arms.
Erase any of your sketch lines like the facial lines, oval for the head, and any part of the legs that are above the shorts.

, Adventure Time characters don’t need shading and use simple colors. Finn can easily be colored in using greens, blues, and black.


Finn’s helmet and socks are both white and can be left uncolored if you are using white paper.
For the shirt, use a lighter blue, and for the shorts a darker blue.
The top half of Finn’s backpack is light green, while the bottom half is dark green.
Color the shoes in black.

, If you want to place Finn in a scene, you can draw a simple hill of grass and a blue sky, or get more creative with a detailed background of your choosing.

Draw an oblong oval for Jake’s body.,
Draw Jake’s eyes, nose, and ears.,
Add the snout and eyebrows.,
Jake doesn’t always have eyebrows, so you can choose not to draw the eyebrows if you wish.

,
Draw the arms and hands using simple curves.,
Draw the legs and feet.,
Erase any intersecting lines.,
Fill in the eyes.,
Trace with a pen and color.",How to Draw Adventure Time Characters2," You want to make your oval longer than it is wide. Jake is medium in his natural size, so you don’t have to draw a large oval.Jake is roughly ⅓ the size of Finn. If you are drawing the two next to each other, Jake comes up to roughly Finn’s waist.

, Jake’s eyes are two large circles, his nose is an oval, and curves make the ears.


Space the eyes out enough so that you can draw the nose in the space in between. The nose should be at the same height as the bottom of the eyes or just a little below.
The tops of the ears should start where your oval begins to curve down. The ears should extend out from the oval and the back in, curling up.
Nothing should extend past the top ⅓ of your oval.

, Jake’s snout is made up of two parts, the part that goes around the nose, and the small mouth below it. The eyebrows are two squiggly lines, like a tilde.


The snout is drawn a bit like an upside down “U”, and resembles a handlebar mustache. Start with a line going down from the bottom of the nose. Loop your pencil up and around, finishing the line on the other side of the nose. Part of the snout will overlap your eyes.
The mouth is a small half circle under the nose that touches the insides of the snout.

,, For this drawing, Jake will have his arms bent and hands on his hips, The arms are simple zigzags that start roughly at the same height as the bottom of the snout. The hands are simple with three fingers.Think of the arms and the side of Jake’s body as forming an “R” shape. For Jake’s right arm, draw a reversed “R”.

, Jake’s legs are almost as long as his body. The legs are formed by two slightly curved lines that connect to one another by small feet.


Bow the legs out slightly to give Jake more of a springy look.

, Now you want to erase the parts of your oval around the ears, the arms, and legs.


Also make sure to erase the parts of the eyes that intersect with the snout.
When done, Jake’s arms and legs should look like seamless, connected parts of the body.
The ears should also have no lines that separate each ear from the side of the head.

, Jake has two different kinds of eyes. Sometimes he will have watery looking eyes which have two circles, or normal eyes with one circle.If you want to give Jake watery eyes, then draw one bigger circle and one smaller one. Leave the circles white and fill in the rest of the eye.
For Jake’s normal eyes, draw a crescent moon shape on the left side of each eye. Color in the crescent part, and leave the rest white.

, Jake’s color is a golden brown. Color the whole body in and don’t add any shading.

Color BMO in.",How to Draw Adventure Time Characters3," To draw BMO, start with a small, horizontal rectangle to form the video screen and face.Round the corners of your rectangle.

, BMO’s body is made up of a 3D cube. Start by drawing a slightly slanted rectangle around your first one.Then draw two parallel lines going up at a forty-five degree angle from the top two corners of your rectangle.
Draw a third parallel line from the bottom left corner.
Connect the end of these three lines together to form a cube.

, BMO’s arms are made of “J” shapes, with his right arm pointing up, and his left arm rotated forty-five degrees for this drawing. BMO’s right leg is drawn like a backwards “L” shape, or a boomerang. The left leg is straight.


BMO’s hands are made up of three fingers that are connected.
Draw the legs at the bottom of your rectangle. The legs should look like each one is extending from under the 3D body.

, BMO has buttons, some rectangular and circular slots on the front of his body. On the side he has a speaker that resembles one on a telephone. Down the side of BMO’s body is written “BMO” in block letters.


Right below BMO’s face is a slim rectangular slot. To the right is a circular slot. Both of these are filled in.
Below the rectangular slot is a directional pad. To the right of the directional pad, draw a triangle with a somewhat large circle under and a bit to the right. To the right of, and above that circle is a smaller circle. Each button is also drawn in 3D like BMO’s body.
Under the directional pad and to the left of the big circular button are two small rectangular slots which have curved edges. These slots are also filled in.
Draw the speaker on the side of BMO’s body where his arm is. The speaker is toward the top of the body and it has two circles on the top row. Underneath are three more circles. Under those are two more. There are seven total.
Below the speaker write “BMO” in block letters. The “O” goes around BMO’s arm, serving as his shoulder., To draw BMO’s face, draw two curved lines that look like rounded triangles without the base. Then draw a larger, curved line for a smile underneath.


BMO’s eyes and mouth are positioned in the top ⅓ of his face.
Erase any overlapping lines. Make sure you have BMO’s feet drawn as well. You can draw his feet by adding “U” shapes to the bottom of the legs.

, BMO’s body is a sea green, or teal color. The buttons are light blue, green, red, and yellow.


The rectangle that makes up BMO’s face is a lighter teal than the body. The side of the body that has the arm and lettering is a darker teal.
The lettering and slots are the darkest teal color.
The directional pad is yellow. The triangle is light blue. The small circle is green. The big circle is red.

Make sure you will be comfortable and familiar with the program and methods you are using to draw.,
Create an outline of the body of hair, being sure to include a part.,
Begin adding strands of hair throughout using a tool that will create hard lines.,
Start adding more layers of hair, using lighter colors each time you make a new layer.,
Add more pieces of hair that are very light and thin.,
Take a very light color to create a glare.,
Smooth over the hair so the strands don't stand out too much and make the hair look too busy.",How to Draw Hair Digitally," If you have recently downloaded a new program, take some time to find out where all the tools in the program are located and what each one does. Making sure you can easily switch between tools and colors will help you be able to create drawings faster and with less frustration.


Be sure you won't be limited by your mouse. If you are using a laptop with a trackpad you may find it easier to draw with a USB or wireless mouse. You can also buy a drawing pad such as a Wacom tablet.
The program depicted is called Sketch Book Express;
, The part should be made by creating strands of hair, not by drawing a line back from the forehead. Also try not to make a line a the top of the forehead where the hairline starts. This will make the hair look less realistic.


If you are creating a pulled back hairstyle you may not need to create a part, but keep in mind that even up-do's occasionally have a slight part in the hair. Use a color a few shades darker than the color you want the hair to end up being. This will create depth. Try to make your strokes light so it starts to resemble strands of hair.

, Make sure they are the same dark color as the outline, as this is done to create the illusion of layers of hair. Try not to worry about making each strand look perfect. Once you've added more layers it will smooth over.


Once you've added individual strands, go through and color over the remaining white spaces with a slightly lighter and less opaque color than you were using for the outline and strands. This will create a base for the rest of the hair.

, Using an airbrush tool will help to smooth over any harsh lines. Keep doing this until you reach desired hair thickness and color.

, Try to vary them across the hair. You can also create stray pieces if you feel the hair looks too neat.

, Try not to make it completely white unless you're making light blonde hair. You can use an airbrush or hard brush depending on your desired look. Do this on the areas of the hair that would have the most light shining on it. If the hair is straight, it will likely only be at the top of the head. If it's curly, the curls will have more light areas.

, The amount you smooth over is completely based on your preference. You can always go back in to add more strands once you have smoothed things over

Finally, color your tissue box!",How to Draw a Tissue Box," This will be the base of the object. To do this, start with a rectangle. Then, draw diagonal lines from the top and bottom right corners. The lines extending from the corners should be equal lengths. Now, connect the extended lines so that there are no empty spaces.;
, This acts as the opening for the tissues.

, If you want to draw tissues, then this step is vital (you don't want tissues with a line through it).

, Begin with two outer lines stretching outwards. Then, draw a wave connecting these two lines. You must remember that when drawing this wave, it should be imperfect for a natural image.

, This step only applies if you wish to do so.


Draw the flaps most on the side by drawing overlapping trapezoids.
Most modern tissue boxes have an exciting pattern for decoration. Draw your own cool pattern, or use a pattern that's already on a tissue box.
Add ruffles to the tissue. To do this, draw lines that emphasize the waves on the tissue. Also, draw pleats at the bottom of the tissue.
Add shadow effects. Define the source of light with shadows. The shadow of an object should get darker as you get further away from the light source. Also, you can draw a shadow cast from the object to whatever surface it is place on.

, However, many artists don't color when they have used detailed shadowing.

First of all, you will need a piece of paper.,
Draw a circle-like shape similar to the one in the picture.,
Next, draw two little \ and / on each side of the bulb as shown in the image and connect them with a curved line.,
Draw two zigzags coming down from each side of the line vertically.,
Draw curved lines from one of the zigzags to the other.,
Draw a vertical line which goes down right the middle of the bottom part of the light bulb and a horizontal line on it.,
Next draw a line from the end of the zigzag to the place where the two lines meet which you drew in the previous step.,
Erase the guidelines which you drew in step 6 and make the bottom of the light bulb slightly curved, not sharp.








,
If you want your light bulb turned off you can add some lines and shadows for special effects.,
In this step you are going to draw the inside of the light bulb.,
Next draw a wiggly/zigzag line connecting one of the lines you drew in the previous step to the other one.,
If you didn't add shadows to your light bulb you can colour it in.,
Admire the awesome light bulb you drew.,Finished.",How to Draw a Light Bulb," Any size of paper will be fine but it can't be too small. You will need something hard underneath the paper so you can draw easily. You will also need a pencil, maybe a rubber and some colouring pencils if needed.
, It doesn't have to be exact. If you are really having troubles drawing it, you can trace it off your screen.








, Don't make the \ and / too slanted but not too vertical either. After that join the ends of the lines with a curve as shown in the picture. The curved line adds the 3D effect.








, It should look similar to the one in the picture.








, The lines should be parallel to each other and to the line you drew in step 3. Check out the picture below.








, This is to mark the center for the next step. Draw a horizontal line on the vertical one about as far from the lightbulb as is on the picture. This is a marking to help with the next step.








, These lines should not be straight, rather a little bit curved towards the outside.








,, Draw them near the edge of the light bulb. The second line (the inner line) should be shorter than the outer one. You can also add some shadow effects. Shade the inside of the light bulb right next to the edge. The closer it is to to the outside, the darker you should shade it. Only shade a little part though, not the whole light bulb, and only on one side, either left or right.








, You do not need to draw this if you don't want to because the light bulb looks good enough without it. However, if you do want to just follow this step. Draw a line that is relatively straight, but halfway up it bends to the outside. Draw two of these bending in different directions.








, This zigzag should not have very sharp edges. You can also draw little loops instead of the wiggly/zigzag line.








, If you do have shadows you can try this step to see how it looks but it might look very weird. To colour in your light bulb you will need yellow/orange and silver/blue. When colouring in the edge of the bight bulb, press a bit harder so it is a little darker while the very inside of the light bulb should be very lightly coloured. The silver/blue colour is for the bottom part of the light bulb. Don't colour it in too dark so that you can't see the curved lines you drew in step 5.

, Olive trees have long, pointed leaves, so use lots of pointed, angular strokes rather than lines or curves. Draw some groups of little lines within the shape too.

, Because the bark is knobbly, there's no need to be precise – let your lines go wobbly!

, You can also add color if you want to!

Select a healthy-looking plant with several buds yet to open.,
Turn your plant around to determine its best angles.,
Select your drawing materials.,
Choose the size.,
Start with a gesture drawing of the plant.,
Plan the placement of the plant for your painting.,
Prepare your surface for work: stretch an oil or acrylic canvas, choose your paper or board for any other media you prefer.,
Transfer the drawing, once you're completely satisfied with it, onto the intended surface.,
When your outlines are correct, do your painting or drawing of your subject, working from lightest areas to darkest areas, and protecting the paper by putting another large piece of clean tracing paper underneath your hand.,
Work from light to dark, as mentioned before.,
Finally, place the completed work in a mat - usually white or cream - and take another look at it.",How to Draw Orchids," Orchids are often available at florists, over the internet, or even at some grocery or home improvement stores. Do not collect orchid plants from the wild, since they will not survive out of their habitat!;
, Draw it from different angles, and maybe take some photographs for later reference.

, What medium do you mostly use? Pencil, pen and ink, colored pencil, gouache, scratch board, watercolor, pastel, oils? Select that which works best for you.

, What size do you want your completed piece to be? Do some preliminary sketches (artists call these 'thumbnails', drawings about 4"" by 5""), to work out composition of light, medium and dark values, but not any details.


A full-size drawing on tracing paper is ideal. It's much less expensive per piece than the paper the finished piece will be on and it's easy to layer if you decide on completely changing the composition halfway through the initial drawing!

, Delineate the main line of the flowering stem, going down to where it inserts by the leaves (with some species the flowering stems emerge from the middle of the new growth, sometimes from the base of the plant; every species is different). Then very carefully draw the leaves, since they move around the least. Note the midrib, how it inserts further down into the core of the plant, whether the leaves wrap around each other, and any identifying features of the leaves and base of the plant, such as pseudo-bulbs and roots. Carefully draw the buds, noting dimension and being careful about proportions, and, working down the stem, drawing the flowers each in turn. If you feel that the flowers won't last long at this point, take some close-up photos and spend the time drawing and painting the flowers - the leaves will hopefully stay green and fresh for a long time after the flowers have faded!

, Make sure you leave enough paper or canvas around your subject to go under the mat or frame. Look at the positive (image) and negative (empty space) shapes. Are they in balance? Interesting? Consider how the viewer's eye moves around the image!

, Some watercolor papers need to be stretched too.

, Do this by sandwiching a piece of graphite transfer paper (available in art supply stores or you can make your own) between the tracing paper preliminary drawing and the canvas or paper, then carefully tracing over the tracing paper drawing with a fine ball-point pen. (This is a good use for one that is used up, too) The graphite from the transfer paper is transferred by the pressure of the pen onto the paper underneath it. Make sure your tracing paper is taped down securely so the image does not shift. Lift carefully just to check. If the transfer paper lines are a bit too dark, you can lift them a bit by gently pressing a grey kneaded eraser on top of them and lifting until you get the right value of line. If you are working on paper, try not to erase any lines because that will abrade the surface, making your results uneven.

, Cut a window a few inches square in the tracing paper 'shield' so that you can work one area at a time in that square. It works well to tape the tracing paper down near the edges of the good paper so that the papers don't rub together. (If you are right-handed, work from upper left to lower right. A left-handed artist would work from upper right to lower left.) Very carefully lift up and move the tracing paper 'window' from one area to another, trying not to smudge the drawing underneath. When you are painting, you have to be more careful, and often use larger-sized 'windows'. The tracing paper technique doesn't work with oil or any other slow-drying media, since the paper can stick to the wet paint. Only use this for egg tempera, watercolor, pen and ink or gouache and don't move your tracing paper window until the area you completed is fully dry.

, When you feel you're almost finished with the piece, take the tracing paper 'window' off and put the painting or drawing in front of a mirror. The image will be reversed and will often show up any design, value, or color flaws. Go back to the drawing board if need be and make any required changes.

, Sometimes it helps to put it away for a day or so. If you are very pleased with the work, put it in your portfolio or in a frame and submit it to any of several exhibitions. If not, it's back to the drawing board. Do you need a better excuse to go buy a new orchid?

, Do you notice the orange things coming out of the back of the dragon? This is what separates the Chinese dragons from the fairytale dragons. When you draw the neck, make sure it looks elegant yet chunky and ugly. On the front of the neck, make sure you draw a patch of color on it. Remember to add scales in the back.

, Make sure to make the body all tangled together like a spaghetti noodle. Or you can make the body all in a swaying way. Remember to draw the scales and the almost flaming things in the back.
